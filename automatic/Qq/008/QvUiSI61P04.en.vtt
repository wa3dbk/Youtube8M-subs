00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.780
 we are in the international presentation 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.850
 of universities that is parked 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.600
 here behind we are going to tell you which are 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.600
 the most important details 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.850
 the gl adopts the new language of 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.380
 design that is dressing the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.200
 most recent releases of the firm 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.880
 of the star is more spacious more comfortable 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.860
 and light that the model that comes to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.690
 replace the famous heller 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.390
 the straight and angular line of his 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.880
 predecessor give way to attractive 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.550
 rounded shapes that give you a 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.530
 muscular and attractive image 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.079
 thanks to the weight saving and its 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.079
 aerodynamic its revised engines are 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.390
 much more efficient 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.140
 Diesel profiles side improve their levels 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.440
 of consumption and emissions by 19% 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.909
 variants are formed by the 220 gls 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.300
 of 170 horses and the 250 of 204 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:06.390
 horses both with 4matic all-wheel drive 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.510
 meanwhile the cls 250 4 more than 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.520
 gasoline with 211 horses also achieves 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.210
 a saving of 12% and the figures of 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.210
 consumption and emissions 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.220
 we can not ignore the version and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.260
 unit named as gls 350 4matic that 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.930
 combines a gasoline engine and another 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.810
 electric that offers 320 horses and 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.040
 also achieved an average consumption of 2.6 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.040
 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.080
 lgl that is also a sub with a great 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.970
 safety equipment thanks to 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.890
 several radars installed in the vehicle 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.200
 enjoy various systems for 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.180
 avoid collisions increase the pressure of 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.460
 braking if they detect risk of accident 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.729
 it was reach and even start a braking 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.229
 autonomous gets infected collision rich 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.820
 it also has speed control that 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.190
 keeps the distance with the car of 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.540
 pressure and a system that detects 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.540
 typical symptoms of fatigue 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.950
 It has available three lines of 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.020
 different equipment that we can 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.459
 combine with rims of up to 20 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.740
 inches in diameter and numerous 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.740
 customization possibilities 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.330
 the most surprising thing is its habitability 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.470
 which has increased quite a lot as well as the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.470
 space for the legs of 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.590
 rear passengers the trunk homologous 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.570
 180 liters of capacity except 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.380
 the hybrid version that only has 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.380
 350 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.690
 if you want to know more details of 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.470
