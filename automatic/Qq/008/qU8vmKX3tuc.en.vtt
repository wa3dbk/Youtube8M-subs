 she played in favor of promoting peace 8 16v and 1 8 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.659
 if you have seen other videos - talking about lumix cameras with this 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:18.619
 the stage can already imagine my opinion on this camera here 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.560
 the region 8 and 8 megapixel resolution and intilaka with optical zoom 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.349
 five-month equivalent of 32 160 mm with a three-point aperture 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.430
 3 to 5 new point its only defect is the lack of a good trip of squid but in 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.410
 32 mm you can do enough 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.500
 still talking about its lens the activation of the 1 can be done both 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.450
 by the trigger button ring 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.040
 everything by this button here we play one at most almost instantly 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.290
 An interesting point is that if you set the resolution to only 3 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.050
 megapixels the g1 the actor happens to be eight times I would venture to say that with 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.510
 this 3 megapixel lens are enough for moscow 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.710
 one very important thing to be said about this camera is that it already has 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.100
 manual mode as well as priority of opening to interiority 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.420
 or for those who enjoy shooting with a personal touch this loss is very cool 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.320
 if you're like 'I may just want to create the scene and shoot the button 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.440
 region eight times of module ii of intelligent auto air the proposal of this 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.430
 index is to have the camera identify whether the object to be 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.540
 photographed this movement there is only one night exit this is a moment 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.860
 and 70 to lf readjust speed setting until the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.230
 image stabilizer 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.250
 can not say that this is a guarantee of perfect lack but in the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.490
 most of the time worked well another tip is that if you already know by 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.530
 example you will be shooting sports scenes or some other situation already 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.070
 predicted in the scene modes I take this selection finally the chances of 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.410
 a perfect photo 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.810
 the placement of the ademi buttons / if present the singer lily allen closed 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.650
 but it bothers a bit behind the project of shooting the first photo as well as the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.000
 expected delay in normal situations 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.770
 for those who like rechargeable batteries the lumix chose eight works with only 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.180
 two small daughters this is an image of accident cards
