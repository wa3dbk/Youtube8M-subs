00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.820
 good in this video I'll try 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.820
 explain 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:17.129
 Differences over antivirus 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.129
 and about the new intermediate of evo s 7 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.289
 that explanation that I'm going to try to 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.770
 explain a little more information 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.430
 is that you simply ask the 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.320
 customers not that a shark or kilo 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.629
 intermediate I have and instead of account then 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.129
 that many times you do not know what the 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.410
 difference between article and a 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.769
 intermediate to you and why , for example, 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 article can be accompanied by 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:49.600
 other products for a vest 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.410
 the male for example to goals min finder 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.629
 well let's see shark we explain 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.260
 new statistics and more or less than the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.530
 alternative range 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.559
 the auction invoices without that objective for 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.869
 me what can be eight degrees to 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.500
 hold people perfectly 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:15.680
 cyclists who with condemned go ice cream 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 timur in the sleeve 14 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.500
 who more rangers 44 of 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.210
 I would say that this elder is elastic 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.570
 and stuck happened that is stuck 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.690
 that is to say that if we are to ideas and 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.960
 we use a size m 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.760
 / m and l always catch the air because it is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.720
 too close 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.080
 from this model it is in red back 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.790
 is blank is important because the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.470
 photographs we always see them ahead 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.470
 whose elastic 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.390
 preferential adjustable and atomic always 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.050
 with the acronym of iu 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.450
 but if we go in Christian is 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.640
 that everything is Tuesday actor that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.740
 is the string behind that is as if 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.660
 we were on the side as if we were 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.610
 bike we stand seems to 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.670
 is short in front or that we have left 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.740
 wrinkles in the armpits is because it is 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.740
 done as if we were on label 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.860
 Important topics to know about the article 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.860
 Well, I want no windscreen 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.210
 for my experience to the sad fire this 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.860
 greater is for some immigrants 12 degrees 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.650
 10 12 none and it's cold what would happen if 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.030
 we have this greater and we want 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:55.970
 make profitable what we would then take 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:00.900
 and that's when the slogan of a ls comes in 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.590
 and that puddle can put color 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.590
 in blue 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.580
 making this move and if not when 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.580
 ends 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.990
 we get 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.700
 that is a for winds 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.480
 and we get a temperature range 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.280
 much lower 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.360
 that is the air set by layers 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.640
 good we have shark 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.670
 we have your chances of 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.209
 work want 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.480
 suppose we have explained vila in 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.150
 the shark model and people the 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.900
 clients tell me that interactive what 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.600
 we build the felt 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:56.470
 what difference is the network for example 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:02.410
 to an intern of that 7 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:04.440
 you know that formerly the blog is 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.240
 crying 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.810
 now 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.810
 the label 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.709
 that we would highlight the batting entity of the 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.120
 membrane are for winds that are not 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.530
 Energy 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.220
 for the sleeves are delicate payrolls 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.060
 but with the bottom part 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.270
 This type of league is more breathable 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.940
 and hotter between I'm afraid it's for more 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.650
 heat that the shark and although in a 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.320
 beginning the feeling of attributes 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.840
 Severe heat in the section 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.150
 thermal always leave us on label 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.849
 the tribe is always worse what 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.419
 Really 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.419
 this is very important 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.530
 we will ask him what are we going to do is 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.610
 mentally go penalti mules not 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.610
 we are active 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:03.430
 we are pro glasses then pass everything 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.890
 with the vest to have you in hotels 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.040
 12 degrees I would go degrees 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.170
 an internal tv has membrane we have 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.210
 less weight less looms than wearing the 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.780
 intimacy 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.310
 is in red always bend your hand 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.220
 third red 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.840
 whose elastic a lot of panels to 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.840
 make the adjustment perfect 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.990
 and this is the difference between 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.990
 internally I have seven flights 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.660
 if they were in a word then the 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.900
 difference is that for winds and the area 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.900
 intermediate t 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.410
 I hope it's a little bit those little ones 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.400
 doubts and finally tell you that the workshop 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.169
 it is also small 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.439
 more than as a base that you had adjusted 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:01.259
 that you enjoy it and simple to think that 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:04.319
 you're not always when you take a 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.270
 product is thought many times and without 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.940
 be sorry they take it out if it is approved but 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.960
 they do not play it 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.960
 although it is good entry
