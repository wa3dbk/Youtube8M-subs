00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
killer of the meter I think because in

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.060 
killer of the meter I think because in
Japan<00:05:02.170> I<00:05:02.200> know<00:05:02.350> that<00:05:02.560> once<00:05:02.710> behind<00:05:02.950> is<00:05:03.040> a

Japan I know that once behind is a

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.770 
Japan I know that once behind is a
really<00:05:03.370> big<00:05:03.580> time<00:05:03.880> I'm<00:05:04.060> like<00:05:04.240> one<00:05:04.420> of<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.570> big
