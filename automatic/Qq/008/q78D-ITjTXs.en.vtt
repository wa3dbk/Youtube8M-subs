if I hold in here you can also see it's

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
if I hold in here you can also see it's
at<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> same<00:00:47.760> there<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> app

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
at the same there so we do have the app

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.979 
at the same there so we do have the app
ready<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.000> yes<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.510> display<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
ready to go here and yes this display is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.459 
ready to go here and yes this display is
not<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.410> bright<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.969> might<00:01:00.149> think<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:01.350> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
not as bright as you might think if you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.529 
not as bright as you might think if you
look<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> front<00:01:02.250> side<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
look at it from the front side in a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.630 
look at it from the front side in a
camera<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.170> maybe<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:05.100> looks<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.489> little

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
camera like this maybe it looks a little

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.690 
camera like this maybe it looks a little
bit<00:01:06.200> darker<00:01:07.880> but<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.350> into<00:01:10.500> settings<00:01:10.890> here

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
bit darker but we go into settings here

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.149 
bit darker but we go into settings here
this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> try<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.930> server<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.100> we

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
this is try one server here and then we

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.140 
this is try one server here and then we
can<00:01:14.310> try<00:01:14.400> another<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> let's<00:01:17.909> start<00:01:18.060> up

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
can try another one so let's start up

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.039 
can try another one so let's start up
here<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.570> zenfone<00:01:18.840> 2<00:01:20.720> of<00:01:21.720> course

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
here with the zenfone 2 of course

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.660 
here with the zenfone 2 of course
doesn't<00:01:22.259> wanna<00:01:22.500> don't<00:01:23.070> wanna<00:01:23.220> run<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.580> at

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
doesn't wanna don't wanna run them at

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.890 
doesn't wanna don't wanna run them at
the<00:01:23.759> same<00:01:23.939> time<00:01:24.210> here<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.869> I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the same time here so this one can I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.539 
the same time here so this one can I
have<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> 100<00:01:28.799> megabits<00:01:29.130> per<00:01:29.189> second

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
have to get the 100 megabits per second

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.910 
have to get the 100 megabits per second
that's<00:01:29.670> nice<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> mid-range<00:01:30.750> phone<00:01:30.990> in

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that's nice on a mid-range phone in

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
that's nice on a mid-range phone in
terms<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.579> price<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
terms of the price you see here if the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.800 
terms of the price you see here if the
galaxy<00:01:37.380> s6<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.430> match<00:01:38.729> those<00:01:39.030> speeds<00:01:39.450> nine

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
galaxy s6 can match those speeds nine

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:50.010 
galaxy s6 can match those speeds nine
milliseconds<00:01:40.409> pin<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.869> less<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.259> upload

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.470 

yes<00:01:51.020> ooh

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
yes ooh

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.040 

in<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:54.020> sharper<00:01:54.560> yeah<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.970> galaxy<00:01:56.510> Essex<00:01:56.840> is

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
in a sharper yeah the galaxy Essex is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.080 
in a sharper yeah the galaxy Essex is
definitely<00:01:57.710> faster<00:01:58.100> here<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.520> mean<00:01:58.880> that's

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
definitely faster here I mean that's

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.290 
definitely faster here I mean that's
pretty<00:01:59.360> clear<00:01:59.780> both<00:02:00.080> in<00:02:00.320> download<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.950> upload

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
pretty clear both in download and upload

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.070 
pretty clear both in download and upload
almost<00:02:02.300> twice<00:02:02.780> speed<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:03.740> guess<00:02:04.070> at<00:02:04.580> least<00:02:05.080> ping

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
almost twice speed I guess at least ping

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.889 
almost twice speed I guess at least ping
also<00:02:06.530> seems<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.890> be<00:02:06.980> very<00:02:07.220> identical<00:02:07.899> but

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
also seems to be very identical but

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.020 
also seems to be very identical but
let's<00:02:09.080> use<00:02:09.320> them<00:02:09.590> for<00:02:10.160> fun<00:02:10.369> let's<00:02:10.640> just<00:02:10.790> try

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
let's use them for fun let's just try

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.110 
let's use them for fun let's just try
another<00:02:11.090> server<00:02:13.270> let's<00:02:14.270> try<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:15.560> one<00:02:17.110> and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
another server let's try this one and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.400 
another server let's try this one and
see<00:02:20.120> if<00:02:22.360> we're<00:02:23.360> gonna<00:02:23.480> get<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.990> same<00:02:24.170> kind<00:02:24.350> of

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
see if we're gonna get the same kind of

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.570 
see if we're gonna get the same kind of
matching<00:02:25.180> fast<00:02:26.180> speeds<00:02:26.660> here<00:02:26.930> again<00:02:27.580> yeah

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
matching fast speeds here again yeah

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.940 
matching fast speeds here again yeah
again<00:02:28.990> 120<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.230> actually<00:02:30.500> gets<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.709> little<00:02:30.770> bit

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
again 120 it actually gets a little bit

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.460 
again 120 it actually gets a little bit
higher<00:02:31.130> this<00:02:31.310> time<00:02:31.370> around<00:02:31.760> sand<00:02:32.240> foam<00:02:32.470> but

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
higher this time around sand foam but

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.350 
higher this time around sand foam but
then<00:02:33.620> maybe<00:02:33.860> also<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.400> one<00:02:34.610> maybe<00:02:35.000> it

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
then maybe also this one maybe it

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.850 
then maybe also this one maybe it
getting<00:02:35.690> almost<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.140> 200<00:02:36.530> megabits<00:02:36.770> per

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
getting almost like 200 megabits per

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.010 
getting almost like 200 megabits per
second<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.370> upload<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:40.420> 130<00:02:41.420> again<00:02:41.810> maybe

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
second and upload like 130 again maybe

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.479 
second and upload like 130 again maybe
or<00:02:42.380> maybe<00:02:42.650> 140<00:02:44.080> 200<00:02:45.080> 140<00:02:45.560> let's<00:02:45.860> see<00:02:45.980> can<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.280> get

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
or maybe 140 200 140 let's see can I get

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:59.040 
or maybe 140 200 140 let's see can I get
it<00:02:52.930> no<00:02:56.019> it<00:02:57.019> actually<00:02:57.440> got<00:02:57.560> way<00:02:57.769> slower<00:02:58.190> there

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
it no it actually got way slower there

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.130 
it no it actually got way slower there
actually<00:03:00.050> it<00:03:00.320> got<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.269> on<00:03:02.480> upload

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
actually it got not that on upload

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.289 
actually it got not that on upload
actually<00:03:03.590> perform<00:03:04.010> pretty<00:03:04.130> well<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:05.209> just

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
actually perform pretty well it's just

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.699 
actually perform pretty well it's just
for<00:03:06.760> test<00:03:07.760> one<00:03:08.060> more<00:03:08.510> time<00:03:08.780> here<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.350> does

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
for test one more time here and it does

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.490 
for test one more time here and it does
yeah<00:03:10.040> now<00:03:10.370> there<00:03:10.910> we<00:03:11.030> go<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.989> looks<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:12.260> it

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
yeah now there we go so it looks like it

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.750 
yeah now there we go so it looks like it
could<00:03:12.709> have<00:03:12.739> been<00:03:12.860> something<00:03:13.220> wrong<00:03:13.370> there

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
could have been something wrong there

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.910 
could have been something wrong there
but<00:03:14.030> then<00:03:14.660> again<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:15.140> course<00:03:15.290> I'm<00:03:15.650> just<00:03:15.739> gonna

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
but then again of course I'm just gonna

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.180 
but then again of course I'm just gonna
run<00:03:16.130> it<00:03:16.220> again<00:03:16.489> here<00:03:16.700> also<00:03:16.730> on<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:18.040> 115<00:03:19.040> and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
run it again here also on this 115 and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.440 
run it again here also on this 115 and
71<00:03:24.489> yeah<00:03:25.489> this<00:03:25.730> one<00:03:25.880> seems<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.180> be<00:03:26.269> almost

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
71 yeah this one seems to be almost

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.759 
71 yeah this one seems to be almost
capped<00:03:26.870> at<00:03:27.110> 120<00:03:27.709> or<00:03:27.799> something<00:03:29.440> overall<00:03:30.440> it

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
capped at 120 or something overall it

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:31.990 
capped at 120 or something overall it
seems<00:03:30.980> like<00:03:31.160> we're<00:03:31.310> gonna<00:03:31.430> get<00:03:31.640> some<00:03:31.850> more

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
seems like we're gonna get some more

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.199 
seems like we're gonna get some more
juice<00:03:32.060> out<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.070> Galaxy<00:03:34.640> s6

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
juice out of the the Galaxy s6

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.060 
juice out of the the Galaxy s6
especially<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.720> 64<00:03:36.170> gigabyte<00:03:36.530> variant<00:03:36.950> I

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
especially the 64 gigabyte variant I

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.009 
especially the 64 gigabyte variant I
mean<00:03:37.220> it's<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.549> good<00:03:37.730> boy<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.360> guess<00:03:38.750> we<00:03:38.900> can

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
mean it's a good boy so I guess we can

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.800 
mean it's a good boy so I guess we can
call<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.320> tear<00:03:39.590> on<00:03:39.830> twice<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.640> speed<00:03:40.940> in<00:03:41.209> the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
call it tear on twice the speed in the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.350 
call it tear on twice the speed in the
s6<00:03:42.260> Wi-Fi<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:43.220> that's<00:03:43.640> definitely<00:03:43.820> kind<00:03:44.299> of

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
s6 Wi-Fi so that's definitely kind of
