dungeon<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:42.000> way<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> deal<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:42.540> them<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
dungeon one way to deal with them is to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
dungeon one way to deal with them is to
deal<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.770> them<00:00:43.890> silently<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:44.760> they

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
deal with them silently because they

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.910 
deal with them silently because they
won't<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> immediately<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.559> come<00:00:46.800> in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
won't see you immediately as you come in

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.610 
won't see you immediately as you come in
so<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.210> crouch<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.960> backstab<00:00:49.590> them

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so you can just crouch and backstab them

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.470 
so you can just crouch and backstab them
when<00:00:49.980> they're<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.220> looking<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.329> just

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
when they're not looking or you can just

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.569 
when they're not looking or you can just
sneak<00:00:51.690> past<00:00:51.990> them<00:00:52.230> another<00:00:53.070> thing<00:00:53.400> is<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
sneak past them another thing is that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
sneak past them another thing is that
you<00:00:53.940> will<00:00:54.060> find<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.540> broom<00:00:54.780> eventually<00:00:55.410> full<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
you will find a broom eventually full of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.190 
you will find a broom eventually full of
drivers<00:00:56.130> it's<00:00:56.910> easy<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.480> overwhelmed<00:00:57.630> at

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
drivers it's easy to get overwhelmed at

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.990 
drivers it's easy to get overwhelmed at
this<00:00:58.380> part<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.950> recommend<00:00:59.340> using<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.730> master

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
this part so I recommend using a master

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.600 
this part so I recommend using a master
spell<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.989> me<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.380> example<00:01:01.470> I<00:01:01.980> used<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
spell like me for example I used the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.210 
spell like me for example I used the
firestorm<00:01:03.360> master<00:01:03.960> disruption<00:01:04.350> spell<00:01:04.500> which

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
firestorm master disruption spell which

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740 
firestorm master disruption spell which
cleared<00:01:05.610> almost<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.299> whole<00:01:06.509> room

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
cleared almost the whole room

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719 
cleared almost the whole room
immediately<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.399> it's<00:01:08.520> very

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
immediately so as you can see it's very

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.380 
immediately so as you can see it's very
effective

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
effective

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
effective
also<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.710> move<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> dungeon<00:01:11.640> keep

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
also as you move to the dungeon keep

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.569 
also as you move to the dungeon keep
your<00:01:12.060> eyes<00:01:12.270> peeled<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.869> stylin<00:01:13.680> stashes<00:01:14.219> you

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
your eyes peeled for stylin stashes you

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.670 
your eyes peeled for stylin stashes you
will<00:01:14.700> find<00:01:14.969> multiple<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.630> these<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:16.079> you<00:01:16.469> are

waterfall<00:01:34.440> this<00:01:35.310> may<00:01:35.490> look<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.940> any<00:01:36.119> normal

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
waterfall this may look like any normal

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.050 
waterfall this may look like any normal
waterfall<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.560> believe<00:01:37.920> me<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
waterfall but believe me it is not it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
waterfall but believe me it is not it
actually<00:01:39.690> contains<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.320> secret<00:01:40.680> passage

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
