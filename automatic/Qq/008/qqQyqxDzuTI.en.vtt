chroma key settings for the live preview

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.750 
chroma key settings for the live preview
as<00:00:50.579> well<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> actual<00:00:52.110> photo<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
as well as the actual photo and this is

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.330 
as well as the actual photo and this is
nice<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.210> sometimes<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:55.770> lighting<00:00:56.190> is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
nice because sometimes the lighting is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
nice because sometimes the lighting is
different<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> flash<00:00:57.360> goes<00:00:57.660> off<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
different the flash goes off for the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.670 
different the flash goes off for the
photo

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
photo

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
photo
and<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> green-screen<00:00:59.789> settings<00:01:00.510> may

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and so the green-screen settings may

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.720 
and so the green-screen settings may
need<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.260> adjusted<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.520> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
need to be adjusted to get that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.929 
need to be adjusted to get that

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
any adjustments I'm actually going to X

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.940

position myself and I can see myself on

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.920 
position myself and I can see myself on
the<00:03:41.680> screen<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.640> live<00:03:43.180> preview<00:03:43.810> is

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
the screen so that live preview is

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.000 
the screen so that live preview is
really<00:03:44.440> key<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:45.820> getting<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.870> best<00:03:47.170> green

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
really key to getting the the best green

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.770 
really key to getting the the best green
screen<00:03:48.280> photo<00:03:48.670> where<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.060> looks<00:03:49.330> right<00:03:49.630> you're

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
screen photo where it looks right you're

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.300 
screen photo where it looks right you're
the<00:03:49.840> right<00:03:50.140> size<00:03:50.910> you're<00:03:51.910> actually

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
the right size you're actually

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.500 
the right size you're actually
interacting<00:03:54.310> with<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.610> green<00:03:54.910> screen<00:03:55.269> and

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
interacting with that green screen and

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.259 
interacting with that green screen and
so<00:03:56.110> once<00:03:56.739> I<00:03:56.890> do<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.220> we<00:03:57.459> can<00:03:57.640> see<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.910> preview

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
so once I do that we can see a preview
