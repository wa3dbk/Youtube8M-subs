radio<00:01:40.439> waves<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:42.000> newer<00:01:42.150> controllers

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
radio waves like the newer controllers

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.410 
radio waves like the newer controllers
do<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.140> uses<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.979> same<00:01:44.490> technology<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.270> that
