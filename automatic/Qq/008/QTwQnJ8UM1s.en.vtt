00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
taking a closer look here at the head

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.510 
taking a closer look here at the head
sculpt<00:01:56.960> very<00:01:57.960> very<00:01:58.530> nice<00:01:58.770> headsculpt<00:01:59.100> I'm

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
get down to the transformation so the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.840 
get down to the transformation so the
transformation<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.250> first<00:02:50.280> thing<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.700> want
