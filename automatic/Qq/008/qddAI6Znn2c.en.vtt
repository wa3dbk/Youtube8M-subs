00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 new species found in Suriname 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.350
 there is still life to be discovered in this 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.599
 planet scientists of an organization 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.910
 conservationist have discovered 60 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.009
 new species of animals and plants in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.500
 deep in the jungles of Suriname in 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.869
 south america there the white man 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.330
 he has not left his unmistakable mark 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.660
 Suriname is the country in the world with more 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.609
 jungle of the planet 95 percent of its 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650
 territory is covered with forests 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.040
 Amazonian and its barely half a million 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.870
 inhabitants occupies the remaining 5% this 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.360
 makes it one of the least places 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.370
 altered by the action of man and the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.410
 scientists are in a race against 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.239
 the clock before the development the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.340
 extension of agriculture and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.610
 livestock and the arrival of companies 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.320
 mining companies end up with this authentic Eden 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.969
 going up the river to lumen almost a 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 Twenty conservation biologists 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.140
 international if they came from the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.539
 plains to the mountains from which 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.579
 the water is born with the help of 30 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.680
 indigenous peoples of different towns of the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.600
 areas through which the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.210
 researchers were three weeks 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.810
 of 2012 taking samples and cataloging 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.360
 the life that 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.729
 and they find the results 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.570
 they just published their catalog now 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.810
 includes one thousand 378 species of plants 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.500
 amphibian insects fish birds and mammals 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.390
 of them 60 are new to science 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.250
 they found 6 frogs a kind of 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.899
 snake a dozen fish 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.909
 unknown until now and many 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.720
 insects that at least the white man 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.850
 I had never seen before cocoa Frog A 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.920
 of the most fascinating new species 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.380
 found in this expedition is the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.830
 frog they have called cacao ipsi boas esp 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.810
 chicharra among the thousand 378 species 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.060
 cataloged in this jungle of surinam 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.500
 there are also several chicharras like 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.630
 this one with its characteristics 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.880
 extensions used to confuse 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.189
 the liliputian beetle predators 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.929
 this cantini a compare that mini very 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.990
 It could well be the dung beetle 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.539
 smallest in america with just 23 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.729
 millimeters have baptized it as 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.009
 liliputian grasshopper beetle 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.530
 pseudo peeling to the useful and this false 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.750
 grasshopper pseudo peeling of lentini is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.010
 so strange to science that it has not yet 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.379
 they have named 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.209
 could represent not a new species 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.519
 but a new genre within the 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.579
 countertops tree frog snout corners 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.739
 sp this tree frog snout stimac csp 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.299
 is one of the six new species of 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.760
 amphibians that have found in the 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.340
 expedition fish cat this strange fish 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.959
 cat parot oz even sp was found 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.819
 in one of the tributaries of the river to 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.640
 lumen the biggest bat eats 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.920
 fruits artibus planeros trees no doubt 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.349
 this is one of the strangest animals 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.379
 with those who met it is about 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.299
 bat artibus plan and the three 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.060
 quiet just eat fruits today are 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.370
 anomalous dartford gloss usp another of the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.290
 new amphibian species discovered 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.139
 for science is the poisonous anomalous 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.930
 glosas sp3 from its and geographical boas 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.030
 the expedition found about 40 species 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.190
 of frogs six of them unknown 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.950
 until now like this tree frog and 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.079
 geographic boas and shorts and tails nor did I ask 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.599
 a link read the expedition also 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.849
 Its objective was to catalog varieties 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.859
 vegetables like this rare frank orchid 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.680
 I asked for a link law although it only thrives on 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.760
 the beetle mountains player bought 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.470
 for neus sanz and fer 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.750
 although it is not the first time that 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.030
 scientists are with the buy 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.709
 paneus lanci fer have been able to confirm 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.790
 that it is the biggest beetle 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.790
 american player
