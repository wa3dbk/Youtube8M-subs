00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:20.520
 the invitation from iveco aurÃ©lio left there 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 new holy rita and came to seven ponds 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.500
 to get to know the factory and take a test 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 drive on the highway my name is something in 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.560
 walls 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.390
 I'm a fleet supervisor of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.250
 maintenance of the group out there 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.829
 located in new santa rita in rio grande 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 where I was invited by the factory and 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.989
 engineering to be part of the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.920
 truck model adjustments that will 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.200
 be released 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.750
 we're out there wei that 's the way we 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.850
 I tested the week and it was done 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.699
 the settings 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.500
 the group reiterated today has been making a 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:02.579
 partnership with draco in various segments 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:07.280
 of shift trucks on the schedule and no 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.570
 get in touch and now with the trucks 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.299
 small 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.850
 I believe what there is is 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.259
 betting well on the changes that are 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.259
 doing is paying attention to the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.799
 driver for the entrepreneur and the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.049
 care staff in the company car 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.049
 I think it would be better for us to test the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.340
 car walking right we get a sense as 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:36.030
 the car is how it behaves in the hour 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.820
 to piggyback on that cab fully 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.979
 a very big change and there it is 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.000
 who is applying in cars 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.740
 heavy segment and 74 tons tested 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.570
 he is 45 tons 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.329
 I also tested that the car had a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:01.049
 a major evolution in the exchange system 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.950
 of ethylene in the system time 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.929
 driver will win this protest there 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.920
 will be making a great innovation will 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.010
 have less cost with the same operation 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.010
 at 10 o'clock that are worked on in the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.760
 driver's day by day and I can promote 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.830
 a law and it becomes a bit tiresome 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.519
 with the model that before with programming 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.670
 that these paths have been for years 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.590
 today the demand will be with this 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.420
 that the factory has positioned 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.540
 in these trucks will probably be 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.540
 a gain of 10% per day 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.980
 work and consumption of hours more 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.540
 same time as hours a mileage 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:59.980
 of 10% more and with a 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.200
 great reduction of costs because with 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:08.670
 this demand and trucks came to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:14.170
 less consumption and less diesel consumption 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.420
 and today it says it is an element that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.560
 makes transport more expensive 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.959
 likely to have less cost in 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.709
 maintenance part of the consumption of 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.510
 oil and diesel oil and will be less 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.170
 tiring driver arrive at the end of the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.720
 day with a little more spirit to 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.459
 work than he was before 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.269
 as to the car driving the 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.239
 driver today he despite this key the 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.480
 environmental transportation the owner 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.280
 buy 50 100 200 trucks if he does not 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.470
 We have a qualified driver. 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:01.739
 on top of that we see several companies 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:04.450
 hire a course driver does 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.690
 training and that's where this 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.020
 structure to do this 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:14.360
 both we are hitting the 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:17.130
 details for drivers opt live 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.040
 destroy our people show how it is 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.940
 I drove this pump truck with a 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.980
 Proper driving will bring many 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.190
 benefits for both the driver and 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.350
 the company had a major change in 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.000
 a matter of years that is being 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.240
 produced in Brazil today is a very expensive 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.490
 comfortable 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.890
 caron you have a good view 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:46.460
 driving you do not have great options 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:51.210
 How to brake is it late? 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:56.250
 the automated gearbox with torque and torque 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:05:02.280
 that supports and I study iveco is 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:05.700
 what is trying to reduce the consumption of 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.200
 car in question of maintenance then the 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.270
 Good man is a common factor less consumption 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.040
 less maintenance and the client more 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.980
 pleased 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:21.450
 the group, however, also very pleased with the 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.200
 trucks only the trucks that are 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:27.100
 giving a 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.170
 a good concept within the group by 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.290
 treatment that the plant itself is 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:36.760
 giving directly to the group and 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:39.850
 placing the staff now serve in aa 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.360
 ability that the leather needs a certain 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:47.530
 kind of expensive model but I believe 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:52.230
 so iveco started with a project 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:56.410
 very severe in listening to the customer 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:59.020
 mainly on the characteristics that the 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.920
 truck has then each customer has a 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:06.370
 adaptation of the car and that the 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.760
 elekta group trying to hit the car 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:13.810
 for each customer an after-sale that is 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.780
 interested and hit the expensive to put 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.810
 the function that each client needs as 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.280
 happened in our case the cast today 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:26.560
 is being a guy who is being too 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.860
 well accepted by the ring and 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.930
 own driver 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.180
 and this is how iveco consolidates itself as 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.460
 a brand ahead of its time to 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.630
 customer concern is in 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.030
 first place 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.930
 we also want to hear you know 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.930
 our official channels
