00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.750
 so hello again my little ones 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.660
 lovers of wobblers today we continue 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.990
 our series is another series and guests in 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.790
 studios whose name is too wide 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 known to call him as loved 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.289
 to say ostap bender 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.260
 this is zip baits orbit 110 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.800
 I think many people recognized him in the EU by version 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.340
 and 1016 half the game in our open spaces 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.369
 homeland big lure this many love 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.190
 many respect and I can safely say 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.730
 there is what you think they will see in this 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.550
 video for which he loved not one thousand 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.340
 man and around the world probably such 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.350
 there are many thousands but we will not 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.920
 distracted features 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.850
 this wobbler is that he is absolutely 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.070
 quiet for that i call him quiet killer well 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 or less snobbishly just kill this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.680
 wobbler really kill any pike 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.629
 practically it does not pass it a wobbler 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.439
 that everyone should have in the box 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.869
 because it is real 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.200
 magic wand sometimes fishing 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.619
 only he works and nothing else 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.720
 so I think that it must be 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.610
 need to have in the box also the second 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.450
 distinctive feature of it is very 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 wide game 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.119
 this wobbler makes just big tacks 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.909
 I donâ€™t know the meter by the floor 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.970
 even more, in principle, it all depends on 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.439
 How will you tweak him strongly I 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.439
 I'll try it a little later 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.259
 show and in principle now calm 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.509
 I think it will be clearly visible also this 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.549
 wobbler still distinguishes what he catches 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.619
 almost any wiring whether 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.409
 aggressive twitching whether it's just 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.090
 twitching like smooth braces or even 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.090
 simple uniform game 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.000
 he catches and pauses and without pauses 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.280
 to any student and everyone, this wobbler 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.060
 very easy to animate it to master any 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.320
 newbie 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.840
 if you want to start catching a wobbler 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.560
 better than this wobbler not found and 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.050
 believe me I started with him and 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.150
 in fact, this particular wobbler 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.500
 showed me what wobblers are like on them 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.210
 you can catch 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.760
 only on them you can catch and how much 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.030
 It's interesting, so let's try 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.340
 watch his game I think that 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.070
 optimal for him wiring to my 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.960
 the look is jerks of average strength during 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.390
 these jerks lure not only leaves 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.280
 side in 1 and 2 he tries to 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.220
 make a circle around its invisible axis 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.340
 turn around her and that's exactly on 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.950
 this wiring, I think what happens 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.290
 most of all poklevok well naturally this 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.950
 wiring with pauses 2 3 yes. 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.120
 pause 12 fisherwoman pause-pause depends already 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.920
 specifically from the time and place of catching 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.980
 sometimes can reach up to 10 seconds 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.470
 sometimes it works believe it so 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.660
 it is necessary to hurry nowhere what this 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.640
 note we will say goodbye to you I think 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.630
 enough material to show today 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.630
 as far as this air 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.020
 they
