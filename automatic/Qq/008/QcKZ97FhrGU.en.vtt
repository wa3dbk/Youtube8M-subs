00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
longer on that close up I just showed

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.880 
longer on that close up I just showed
you<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.659> where<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.079> VGA<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.680> DVI

you this is where the VGA and DVI

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
you this is where the VGA and DVI
connectors<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.780> side<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.170> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
connectors are and on this side this is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.630 
connectors are and on this side this is
where<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.649> would<00:01:49.710> connect<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.159> power<00:01:50.310> cable

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
where you would connect your power cable

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.749 
where you would connect your power cable
we've<00:01:51.600> also<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:52.079> some<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.500> useful<00:01:52.770> cable

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
we've also got some very useful cable

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
we've also got some very useful cable

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.559 
to keep everything looking nice and tidy
so<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:06.990> I've<00:02:07.140> got<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.759> slideshow<00:02:08.759> running<00:02:09.390> on

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
so now I've got a slideshow running on

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.170 
so now I've got a slideshow running on
the<00:02:09.810> monitor<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.520> wanted<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> show<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the monitor now and I wanted to show you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.370 
the monitor now and I wanted to show you
how<00:02:12.420> effective

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
how effective

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.170 
how effective
250<00:02:14.380> CDM<00:02:14.830> brightnesses<00:02:15.400> it's<00:02:15.610> more<00:02:15.970> than

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
250 CDM brightnesses it's more than

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.840 
250 CDM brightnesses it's more than
adequate<00:02:16.750> for<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.620> office<00:02:18.100> use

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
adequate for in office use

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.300 
adequate for in office use
now<00:02:19.510> I've<00:02:19.810> got<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.080> studio<00:02:20.440> lights<00:02:20.740> on<00:02:21.070> and

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
now I've got the studio lights on and

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.880 
now I've got the studio lights on and
I'm<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.210> rotate<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.870> around<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
I'm going to just rotate this around the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.180 
I'm going to just rotate this around the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
angle a 10 to 1 contrast ratio and I'm

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.390 
angle a 10 to 1 contrast ratio and I'm
round<00:02:30.700> about<00:02:31.320> 160<00:02:32.320> degree<00:02:32.620> mark<00:02:32.920> now<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.310> as

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
round about 160 degree mark now and as

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.250 
round about 160 degree mark now and as
you<00:02:33.520> can<00:02:33.640> see<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:34.030> display<00:02:34.480> starting<00:02:35.140> to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
you can see that display starting to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.740 
you can see that display starting to
disappear<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.580> then<00:02:36.730> bring<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.060> back<00:02:37.180> round

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
disappear and then bring it back round

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.640 
disappear and then bring it back round
to<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:39.070> front<00:02:39.520> view<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.600> then<00:02:41.200> back<00:02:41.380> round

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
to the front view and then back round

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.350 
to the front view and then back round
the<00:02:41.770> other<00:02:41.920> side<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.670> going<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.030> obviously

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
the other side is going to obviously

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.040 
the other side is going to obviously
perform<00:02:44.140> very<00:02:44.380> similar<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.570> we're<00:02:46.570> round<00:02:46.840> to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
perform very similar and we're round to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.220 
perform very similar and we're round to
about<00:02:47.970> 160<00:02:48.970> degree<00:02:49.330> hundred<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:49.870> seventy

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
about 160 degree hundred and seventy

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.430 
about 160 degree hundred and seventy
degree<00:02:50.560> angle<00:02:50.920> now<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.750> performs<00:02:53.080> very

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
degree angle now so it performs very

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.010 
degree angle now so it performs very
well<00:02:53.530> as<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.550> say<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.209> full<00:02:55.510> studio

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
well as I say this is in full studio

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.229 
well as I say this is in full studio
lighting<00:02:56.380> I'm<00:02:57.190> going<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.459> actually<00:02:57.790> switch

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
lighting I'm going to actually switch

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.900 
lighting I'm going to actually switch
the<00:02:58.570> studio<00:02:58.930> lights<00:02:59.230> off<00:02:59.560> for<00:02:59.620> you<00:03:00.370> now<00:03:00.550> so<00:03:00.820> you

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
the studio lights off for you now so you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.760 
the studio lights off for you now so you
can<00:03:01.060> see<00:03:01.330> really<00:03:02.140> how<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:02.680> monitor<00:03:03.190> performs

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
can see really how this monitor performs

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.320 
can see really how this monitor performs
so<00:03:05.770> this<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.100> with<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.340> studio<00:03:06.760> lights<00:03:07.060> off

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
so this is with the studio lights off

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.390 
so this is with the studio lights off
and<00:03:07.600> as<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.230> can<00:03:08.350> see<00:03:08.410> it's<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.680> nice<00:03:08.830> bright

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
and as you can see it's a nice bright

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.630 
and as you can see it's a nice bright
display<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.930> does<00:03:11.260> certainly<00:03:11.680> deliver<00:03:12.370> a

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
display and it does certainly deliver a

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.270 
display and it does certainly deliver a
very<00:03:12.880> clear<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:14.080> very<00:03:14.260> color<00:03:14.620> accurate

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280
