my<00:01:34.680> bench<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.100> getting<00:01:35.400> pretty<00:01:35.640> promising<00:01:36.119> I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
my bench is getting pretty promising I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.240 
my bench is getting pretty promising I
think<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.659> might<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.740> able<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> pull<00:01:38.220> off

think I might just be able to pull off
high<00:01:38.729> 300<00:01:39.450> maybe<00:01:39.630> even<00:01:39.930> 4<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.890> I'm<00:01:41.100> lucky

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
high 300 maybe even 4 if I'm lucky
