well<00:00:21.330> now<00:00:21.480> The<00:00:21.539> Searchers<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:22.320> Japan<00:00:22.740> are

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
well now The Searchers from Japan are

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.849 
well now The Searchers from Japan are
suggesting<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.210> add<00:00:24.480> lithium<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.410> why<00:00:25.800> is

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
suggesting that we add lithium so why is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.310 
suggesting that we add lithium so why is
that<00:00:26.090> well<00:00:27.090> they're<00:00:27.449> actually<00:00:27.869> not

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
that well they're actually not

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.540 
that well they're actually not
suggesting<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.279> they're<00:00:29.400> certainly

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
suggesting it but they're certainly

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.580 
suggesting it but they're certainly
looking<00:00:30.029> into<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.449> lithium<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> medication

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
looking into it lithium is a medication

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.190 
looking into it lithium is a medication
that<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.009> prescription<00:00:32.790> doses<00:00:33.300> treats<00:00:33.960> mood

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that in prescription doses treats mood

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.479 
that in prescription doses treats mood
disorders<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.829> people<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.309> bipolar

disorders in people with bipolar

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760 
disorders in people with bipolar
disorder<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.450> manic-depressive<00:00:37.290> illness<00:00:37.410> and

disorder or manic-depressive illness and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.369 
disorder or manic-depressive illness and
what<00:00:38.309> these<00:00:38.489> researchers<00:00:38.730> found<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.570> Japan<00:00:39.750> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
what these researchers found in Japan is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.610 
what these researchers found in Japan is
that<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.610> lithium<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.629> present<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.200> trace

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
that it's lithium is present in trace

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.619 
that it's lithium is present in trace
amounts<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> normal<00:00:44.789> water<00:00:44.969> supply<00:00:45.090> in

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
amounts in the normal water supply in

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.970 
amounts in the normal water supply in
some<00:00:45.930> communities<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.800> those

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
some communities and in those

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.490 
some communities and in those
communities<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> lower<00:00:48.719> suicide

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
communities they have a lower suicide

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.830 
communities they have a lower suicide
rate<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.520> they're<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:51.030> investigating

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
rate and so they're really investigating

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.810 
rate and so they're really investigating
whether<00:00:51.989> trace<00:00:52.500> amounts<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> lithium<00:00:53.309> can

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
whether trace amounts of lithium can

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.630 
whether trace amounts of lithium can
just<00:00:54.120> change<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> mood<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.160> community

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
just change the mood in a community

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
just change the mood in a community
enough<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.320> positive<00:00:58.739> way

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
enough to really in a positive way

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.170 
enough to really in a positive way
without<00:00:59.039> having<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.550> bad<00:00:59.730> effects<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
without having the bad effects of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.880 
without having the bad effects of
lithium<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.050> really<00:01:01.289> affect<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> mood<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
lithium to really affect the mood and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.170 
lithium to really affect the mood and
decrease<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> suicide<00:01:02.640> rate<00:01:02.789> very

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
decrease the suicide rate very

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
decrease the suicide rate very
interesting<00:01:03.899> concept<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
interesting concept you know it's the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
interesting concept you know it's the
same<00:01:05.220> reason<00:01:05.519> why<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.820> put<00:01:06.090> iodine<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.260> salt

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
same reason why we put iodine in salt

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.219 
same reason why we put iodine in salt

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
fluoride in water there's there's many

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.080 
fluoride in water there's there's many

prominent third hand smoke is the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.270 
prominent third hand smoke is the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
smoke in the air so after you can't see

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.260 
smoke in the air so after you can't see
it<00:01:46.649> anymore<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.189> doesn't<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.640> disappear<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it anymore it doesn't just disappear the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.510 
it anymore it doesn't just disappear the
residue<00:01:48.810> settles<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.860> settles<00:01:50.280> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
residue settles and it settles in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.719 
residue settles and it settles in
carpets<00:01:51.360> furniture<00:01:52.049> car<00:01:52.649> upholstery<00:01:53.460> and

their studies that show that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.170 
their studies that show that

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.810 
particularly in children third hand
smoke<00:01:57.299> residue<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:59.040> dangerous<00:01:59.549> as

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
smoke residue can be as dangerous as

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.690 
smoke residue can be as dangerous as
secondhand<00:02:00.689> smoke<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.920> children's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
secondhand smoke because children's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.780 
secondhand smoke because children's
Airways<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.689> much<00:02:03.930> smaller<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
Airways are so much smaller and the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.210 
Airways are so much smaller and the
residue<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.060> toxic<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:08.009> thing<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
residue can be toxic so one thing that

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.070 
residue can be toxic so one thing that
parents<00:02:08.700> may<00:02:08.910> want<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.750> think<00:02:09.989> about

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
parents may want to really think about

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.240 
parents may want to really think about
is<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.679> allowing<00:02:11.340> others<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:11.970> smoke<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.720> their

or their car even in the absence of
their<00:02:16.010> children<00:02:16.430> because<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.820> residue<00:02:17.300> is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
their children because the residue is

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.910 
their children because the residue is
left<00:02:17.480> over<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.440> could<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:18.650> harmful

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
left over and it could be harmful

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.620 
left over and it could be harmful
particularly<00:02:19.520> as<00:02:19.640> kids<00:02:19.910> are<00:02:20.000> crawling<00:02:20.240> on<00:02:20.540> the

here's<00:02:23.360> another<00:02:23.570> interesting<00:02:24.020> thing<00:02:24.260> British

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
here's another interesting thing British

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.830 
here's another interesting thing British
scientists<00:02:25.310> find<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.790> new<00:02:26.030> way<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.300> treat

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
scientists find a new way to treat

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.900 
scientists find a new way to treat
post-traumatic<00:02:27.590> stress<00:02:28.100> disorder<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.790> this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
post-traumatic stress disorder and this

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.740 
post-traumatic stress disorder and this
is<00:02:29.060> by<00:02:29.180> playing<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.140> video<00:02:30.350> game<00:02:30.680> Tetris<00:02:31.750> so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
is by playing the video game Tetris so

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.830 
is by playing the video game Tetris so
really<00:02:33.650> cool<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.180> one<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.450> those<00:02:35.600> cool

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
really cool this is one of those cool

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.260 
really cool this is one of those cool
things<00:02:36.550> post-traumatic<00:02:37.550> stress<00:02:38.090> disorder

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
things post-traumatic stress disorder

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.120 
things post-traumatic stress disorder
one<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.720> biggest<00:02:39.140> issues<00:02:39.320> with<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:39.950> are

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
one of the biggest issues with it are

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.580 
one of the biggest issues with it are
the<00:02:40.460> visual<00:02:41.030> images<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.960> flashbacks

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
the visual images and the flashbacks

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.010 
the visual images and the flashbacks
that<00:02:42.830> come<00:02:43.010> back<00:02:43.160> after<00:02:43.700> someone<00:02:44.090> experiences

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
that come back after someone experiences

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.740 
that come back after someone experiences
or<00:02:45.230> sees<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> horrific<00:02:46.190> event<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.360> what<00:02:47.600> these

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
or sees a horrific event so what these

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.890 
or sees a horrific event so what these
researchers<00:02:48.340> showed<00:02:49.340> is<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.300> people<00:02:50.510> who

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
researchers showed is that in people who

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.800 
researchers showed is that in people who
are<00:02:51.050> exposed<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:52.100> just<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.730> gruesome<00:02:53.000> event<00:02:53.600> if

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
are exposed to just a gruesome event if

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.310 
are exposed to just a gruesome event if
they<00:02:54.380> play<00:02:54.740> Tetris<00:02:55.459> afterwards<00:02:56.270> they<00:02:57.050> have

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
they play Tetris afterwards they have

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.800 
they play Tetris afterwards they have
fewer<00:02:57.830> flashbacks<00:02:58.640> than<00:02:59.120> individuals<00:02:59.690> who

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
fewer flashbacks than individuals who

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.870 
fewer flashbacks than individuals who
are<00:02:59.900> exposed<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.560> same<00:03:00.800> event<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.340> don't

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
are exposed to the same event and don't

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.990 
are exposed to the same event and don't
play<00:03:02.060> Tetris<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.630> here's<00:03:02.990> why<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:04.580> there's<00:03:04.940> a

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
play Tetris and here's why the there's a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.540 
play Tetris and here's why the there's a
part<00:03:05.300> of<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.450> brain<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:06.080> embeds<00:03:06.830> visual

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
part of the brain that embeds visual

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.250 
part of the brain that embeds visual
images<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.330> so<00:03:08.450> when<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.750> see<00:03:08.990> something

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
images and so when you see something

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.030 
images and so when you see something
terrible

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
terrible

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.340 
terrible
it<00:03:10.220> gets<00:03:10.459> embedded<00:03:10.760> in<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:10.970> brain<00:03:11.240> Tetris<00:03:12.170> and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
it gets embedded in the brain Tetris and

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.980 
it gets embedded in the brain Tetris and
those<00:03:12.500> falling<00:03:13.010> bricks<00:03:13.690> preoccupies<00:03:14.690> the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
those falling bricks preoccupies the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.590 
those falling bricks preoccupies the
brain<00:03:15.260> so<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:16.220> horrific<00:03:16.610> visual<00:03:17.300> image

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
brain so that the horrific visual image

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.990 
brain so that the horrific visual image
doesn't<00:03:17.989> get<00:03:18.380> embedded<00:03:18.769> in<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.130> brain<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.580> so

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
doesn't get embedded in the brain and so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.220 
doesn't get embedded in the brain and so
they<00:03:20.180> even<00:03:20.600> when<00:03:20.959> they<00:03:21.110> did<00:03:21.500> recall<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
they even when they did recall of the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.990 
they even when they did recall of the
bad<00:03:24.230> event<00:03:24.650> afterwards<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.430> people<00:03:25.670> who<00:03:25.790> paid

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
bad event afterwards in people who paid

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.420 
bad event afterwards in people who paid
played<00:03:26.660> Tetris<00:03:26.930> they<00:03:27.530> didn't<00:03:27.830> remember<00:03:28.130> as

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
played Tetris they didn't remember as

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.160 
played Tetris they didn't remember as
much<00:03:28.640> they<00:03:28.850> weren't<00:03:29.060> having<00:03:29.180> flashbacks<00:03:29.540> but

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
much they weren't having flashbacks but

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.020 
much they weren't having flashbacks but
even<00:03:30.500> when<00:03:30.620> they<00:03:30.739> kept<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.130> journal<00:03:31.430> for<00:03:31.670> about

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
even when they kept a journal for about

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.140 
even when they kept a journal for about
a<00:03:32.060> week<00:03:32.300> later<00:03:32.600> they<00:03:33.170> had<00:03:33.410> 43<00:03:34.190> percent<00:03:34.730> fewer

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
a week later they had 43 percent fewer

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.640 
a week later they had 43 percent fewer
flashbacks<00:03:35.750> than<00:03:35.959> people<00:03:36.230> who<00:03:36.320> didn't<00:03:36.560> play

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
flashbacks than people who didn't play

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.259 
flashbacks than people who didn't play
so<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.730> keeps<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.239> brain<00:03:38.480> from<00:03:38.750> encoding

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
so it just keeps the brain from encoding

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.009 
so it just keeps the brain from encoding
something<00:03:41.269> that<00:03:41.390> wasn't<00:03:41.690> very<00:03:41.720> pleasant

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
something that wasn't very pleasant
