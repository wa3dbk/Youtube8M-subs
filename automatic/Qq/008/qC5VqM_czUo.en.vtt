00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:34.880
 however we say that we are at copacabana b 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.199
 the youngest beach 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.480
 we have drawn here left and at 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.480
 shoulders of which we have the beach of via 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.399
 poma that was both of the same styles and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.619
 so there is an area right where the are 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.890
 waves arrive in the best way 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.289
 so I really do n't know about twenty 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.580
 of surfers in the water looking for wait 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.580
 that I show you from 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 ok after this 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.700
 read small pause 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.750
 and if you are looking for surfers go 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.610
 this beach starts while mine is here 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.790
 right you see the whole beach of 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.620
 hypanema that the youngest beach where 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.150
 kids go this is a bit 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.910
 quiet let's say you try group 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.650
 of areas where there are few people 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.800
 quiet you have all the space there 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.330
 can instead want to do with roots and the 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.520
 contrary a bit of people go i 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.680
 enemies a little more moving we are 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.410
 was in between the correct 9 the turret 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.190
 10 in this case that from a little bit 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.140
 I say to myself but they are just girls 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.050
 boys and girls all young people no 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.159
 children nothing then play this 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.700
 that never everyone waits for the ball 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:15.200
 the girls no because the area 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.720
 let's find out soon and do 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.260
 something carlo during the summer 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.790
 Brazilian 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.340
 rbc which is located near paris when 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.099
 see our pictures of sugar loaf 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.500
 our videos you will see this specialty 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.450
 very closed vineyard as if it were one 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.069
 cart 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.980
 where usually always the hand also 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.180
 families with children because there 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.640
 are the waves a little more enslaved 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.280
 we say that the beaches are very beautiful 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.230
 they are very large 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.859
 are fifteen real for what we 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.459
 we spent just for breno nor and 3 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:01.989
 A total of 5 euro is thought of 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.989
 what you spend in Italy 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.950
 state surveys spend the cost 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.490
 generate for which with 516 very comfortable in 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.630
 beach the sea among other things went there 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.010
 also very well because actually 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.770
 it was not so cold Rio's winter 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.340
 however we say nothing in the sense that the 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.220
 temperatures range from 20 to 30 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.500
 degrees is very good and the water is warm 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.030
 compared to summer so there it is 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.360
 we can also very much inter while 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.310
 state temperatures reach 40 42 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.260
 43 degrees so it offers a little bit is 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.890
 practically winter and summer in 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:49.200
 Italian are absolutely reversed 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.200
 today there is a parade street of panic 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.590
 and a kiss we go to get a 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.590
 little bit of sun
