joking I'm joking of course we all know
the<00:00:27.810> plastic<00:00:28.170> bricks<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.680> know<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.039> love

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the plastic bricks we know and we love

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
the plastic bricks we know and we love
them<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.449> played<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.410> any<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
them I have not played with any of the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.860 
them I have not played with any of the
computerized<00:00:32.430> stuff<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.969> Mindstorm<00:00:33.570> stuff

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
computerized stuff the Mindstorm stuff

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.810 
computerized stuff the Mindstorm stuff
since<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> very<00:00:34.739> first<00:00:34.880> product<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:38.520> big

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
since the very first product so the big

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.799 
since the very first product so the big
yellow<00:00:39.090> brick<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.570> could<00:00:39.690> like

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
yellow brick that you could like

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.650 
yellow brick that you could like
drag-and-drop<00:00:40.320> different<00:00:40.920> pieces<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.250> code<00:00:41.660> I

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
drag-and-drop different pieces of code I

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.630 
drag-and-drop different pieces of code I
guess<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.770> oh<00:00:43.920> three<00:00:44.280> or<00:00:44.430> something

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
guess it was like oh three or something

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
guess it was like oh three or something
but<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.539> has<00:00:45.629> changed<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> last<00:00:46.469> 10

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
but what has changed in the last 10

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.200 
but what has changed in the last 10
years<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.160> mindstorm<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> lot<00:00:48.000> has<00:00:48.180> changed

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
years with mindstorm a lot has changed

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.970 
years with mindstorm a lot has changed
actually<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:48.899> our<00:00:48.989> third<00:00:49.260> generation<00:00:49.440> we're

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
actually it's our third generation we're

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.279 
actually it's our third generation we're
in<00:00:50.039> our<00:00:50.100> 15th<00:00:50.610> years<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.329> what<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> had<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
in our 15th years so what you had the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.410 
in our 15th years so what you had the
RCX<00:00:52.770> platform<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> still<00:00:53.640> an<00:00:53.879> autonomous

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
RCX platform is still an autonomous

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
RCX platform is still an autonomous
robotics<00:00:54.930> platform<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.500> kids<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> now<00:00:56.010> we're

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
robotics platform for kids and now we're

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.560 
robotics platform for kids and now we're
on<00:00:56.280> our<00:00:56.309> third<00:00:56.430> generation<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.360> what's

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
on our third generation so what's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.619 
on our third generation so what's
changed<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.730> lots<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.879> things<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.539> can

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
changed is lots of things as you can

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.080 
changed is lots of things as you can
imagine<00:01:01.230> lots<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:01.890> sensors<00:01:02.460> more<00:01:02.730> inputs

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
imagine lots more sensors more inputs

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.170 
imagine lots more sensors more inputs
more<00:01:03.300> outputs<00:01:03.780> more<00:01:04.290> memory<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> brick<00:01:05.460> we

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
more outputs more memory in the brick we

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
more outputs more memory in the brick we
have<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> toy<00:01:06.780> version<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.560> use<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.010> home<00:01:08.159> we

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
have a toy version for use at home we

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.830 
have a toy version for use at home we
have<00:01:08.520> an<00:01:08.640> educational<00:01:09.119> version<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.570> use<00:01:09.689> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
have an educational version for use of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.480 
have an educational version for use of
kids<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.710> said<00:01:10.890> schools<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> teach

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
kids for you said schools to teach

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.270 
kids for you said schools to teach
science<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> technology<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.159> what<00:01:14.159> is

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
science and technology and so what is

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.010 
science and technology and so what is
the<00:01:14.430> process<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.420> somebody<00:01:15.659> that's

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the process like for somebody that's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.670 
the process like for somebody that's
completely<00:01:16.740> new<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.110> started

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
completely new to this to get started

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.289 
completely new to this to get started
with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> platform<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:21.090> Oh

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
with the platform it is like Oh

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.600 
with the platform it is like Oh
programming<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:22.860> stuffing<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
programming that you know I'm stuffing I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370 
programming that you know I'm stuffing I
just<00:01:24.119> want<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> play<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.570> Lego<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.110> really

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
just want to play with Lego but I really

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.899 
just want to play with Lego but I really
like<00:01:25.619> technics<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.400> I've<00:01:26.549> already<00:01:26.670> figured

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
like technics and I've already figured

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700 
like technics and I've already figured
out<00:01:27.090> gears<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> want<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> take<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
out gears so now I want to take it to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.020 
out gears so now I want to take it to
the<00:01:28.799> next<00:01:29.070> step

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the next step

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.780 
the next step
what's<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> barrier<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.350> entry<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:32.520> barrier

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
what's the barrier to entry the barrier

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.490 
what's the barrier to entry the barrier
to<00:01:32.909> entry<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.390> obviously<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.079> kit<00:01:34.290> which

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
to entry is obviously the kit which

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.050 
to entry is obviously the kit which
comes<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> software<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.880> need<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
comes with the software but you need a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.390 
comes with the software but you need a
computer<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> program<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.979> also<00:01:38.100> do

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
computer to program on you can also do

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.069 
computer to program on you can also do
some<00:01:38.640> basic<00:01:38.880> programming<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> brick<00:01:39.930> up

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
some basic programming on the brick up

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.889 
some basic programming on the brick up
to<00:01:40.229> 12<00:01:40.500> steps<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.670> programming<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.270> really

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
to 12 steps the programming is really

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.350 
to 12 steps the programming is really
really<00:01:43.079> easy<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.649> all<00:01:43.890> drag-and-drop<00:01:44.549> icons

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
really easy it's all drag-and-drop icons

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.780 
really easy it's all drag-and-drop icons
into<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.079> line<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.799> super<00:01:47.220> simple<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.640> use

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
into a line so it's super simple to use

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.010 
into a line so it's super simple to use
very<00:01:47.939> similar<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.659> described

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
very similar to what you described

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.929 
very similar to what you described
before<00:01:49.170> only<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:49.890> much<00:01:50.070> more<00:01:50.250> intuitive<00:01:50.790> now

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
before only it's much more intuitive now

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.850 
before only it's much more intuitive now
so<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> idea<00:01:51.899> being<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.500> want<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.770> do

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so the idea being like if I want to do

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
so the idea being like if I want to do
an<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.100> statement<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.670> grab<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.540> green<00:01:54.750> if

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
an if statement I grab a little green if

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.389 
an if statement I grab a little green if
and<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.320> drag<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:56.280> like

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and I drag it in there and then I'm like

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.950 
and I drag it in there and then I'm like
oh<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.790> what<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> then<00:01:57.299> grab<00:01:57.479> something<00:01:57.869> else

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
oh if what and then grab something else

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
oh if what and then grab something else
and<00:01:58.229> say<00:01:58.350> well<00:01:58.829> lift<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> sensor<00:01:59.579> sees<00:02:00.149> this

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and say well lift the sensor sees this

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.450 
and say well lift the sensor sees this
so<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.049> grab<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.920> things

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
so and then I grab a then and things

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.670 
so and then I grab a then and things
like<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.880> yes<00:02:03.299> okay<00:02:04.079> well<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.469> I'm<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
like that yes okay well what if I'm a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
like that yes okay well what if I'm a
programmer<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.000> what<00:02:06.180> I'm<00:02:06.270> doing

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
programmer and I know what I'm doing

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.839 
programmer and I know what I'm doing
with<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.750> C++<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.829> Java<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.369> things<00:02:08.729> like

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
with like C++ and Java and things like

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.460 
with like C++ and Java and things like
that<00:02:09.090> what<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
that what do you have for like the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.690 
that what do you have for like the
hardcore<00:02:10.920> enthusiasts<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
hardcore enthusiasts so the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.520 
hardcore enthusiasts so the
brick<00:02:12.849> is<00:02:13.060> now<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.300> operating<00:02:14.170> system<00:02:14.440> is

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
brick is now the operating system is

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.860 
brick is now the operating system is
Linux<00:02:14.890> now<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.550> you're<00:02:15.910> kidding<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.270> real<00:02:16.390> no

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
Linux now so you're kidding for real no

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.330 
Linux now so you're kidding for real no
way<00:02:17.019> when<00:02:17.230> did<00:02:17.379> that<00:02:17.440> happen<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:17.920> with<00:02:18.190> this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
way when did that happen just with this

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.089 
way when did that happen just with this
generation<00:02:18.849> it<00:02:19.120> happened<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.510> morning<00:02:20.099> it

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
generation it happened this morning it

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.550 
generation it happened this morning it
just<00:02:21.180> happened

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
just happened

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.680 
just happened
what<00:02:23.560> was<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:25.000> thought<00:02:25.180> process<00:02:25.540> behind

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
what was the the thought process behind

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.020 
what was the the thought process behind
bringing<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.680> from<00:02:27.040> like<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> little<00:02:27.849> tiny

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
bringing it from like a little tiny

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.150 
bringing it from like a little tiny
microcontroller<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.080> was<00:02:29.200> before<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
microcontroller that it was before to a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.520 
microcontroller that it was before to a
complete<00:02:30.459> Linux<00:02:30.790> platform<00:02:31.150> we<00:02:32.050> just<00:02:32.230> wanted

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
complete Linux platform we just wanted

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.750 
complete Linux platform we just wanted
to<00:02:32.650> make<00:02:32.800> sure<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.220> appealed<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.550> all

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
to make sure that it appealed to all

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.430 
to make sure that it appealed to all
kinds<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.390> people<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:34.660> had<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.019> be<00:02:35.080> super<00:02:35.410> easy

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
kinds of people so had to be super easy

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.320 
kinds of people so had to be super easy
to<00:02:35.800> use<00:02:35.830> for<00:02:36.220> kids<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.819> also<00:02:36.940> needed<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.269> be

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
to use for kids but it also needed to be

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.030 
to use for kids but it also needed to be
really<00:02:37.630> expandable<00:02:38.200> for<00:02:38.349> adults<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.799> fans

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
really expandable for adults and fans

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.000 
really expandable for adults and fans
like<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.660> sounds<00:02:40.660> super<00:02:41.080> hackable<00:02:41.560> what<00:02:41.920> is

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
like you sounds super hackable what is

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.650 
like you sounds super hackable what is
the<00:02:42.190> device<00:02:42.430> itself<00:02:42.760> how<00:02:42.910> many<00:02:43.090> inputs<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
the device itself how many inputs and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.229 
the device itself how many inputs and
outputs<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.170> what<00:02:44.349> are<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.560> kind<00:02:44.739> of<00:02:45.239> outputs

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
outputs and what are the kind of outputs

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.640 
outputs and what are the kind of outputs
it<00:02:46.540> has<00:02:46.780> an<00:02:46.989> ARM<00:02:47.170> processor<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:49.750> 64

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
it has an ARM processor and a 64

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.890 
it has an ARM processor and a 64
megabytes<00:02:51.280> ram<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:51.849> it<00:02:51.970> also<00:02:52.120> has<00:02:52.360> expandable

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
megabytes ram but it also has expandable

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
memory with USB and SD what about

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.089 
memory with USB and SD what about
connectivity<00:02:56.680> Bluetooth<00:02:57.160> Wi-Fi<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.010> know

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
connectivity Bluetooth Wi-Fi do you know

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.650 
connectivity Bluetooth Wi-Fi do you know
anything<00:03:00.280> about<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.640> chipsets<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.360> Wi-Fi

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
anything about the chipsets of the Wi-Fi

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.470 
anything about the chipsets of the Wi-Fi
or<00:03:01.810> Bluetooth<00:03:03.989> probably<00:03:04.989> not<00:03:05.110> for<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:06.450> okay

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
or Bluetooth probably not for you okay

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.330 
or Bluetooth probably not for you okay
well<00:03:08.049> I<00:03:08.079> guess<00:03:08.410> that's<00:03:08.590> just<00:03:08.650> for<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.069> hackers

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
well I guess that's just for the hackers

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.850 
well I guess that's just for the hackers
to<00:03:09.519> open<00:03:10.329> it<00:03:10.420> up<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.690> check<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.200> out<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.470> in

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
to open it up and check it out so in

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.860 
to open it up and check it out so in
addition<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.459> launching<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.239> hardware<00:03:16.599> today

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
addition to launching the hardware today

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.870 
addition to launching the hardware today
do<00:03:17.049> have<00:03:17.260> kind<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.680> any<00:03:18.130> other<00:03:18.340> things<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:18.730> kind

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
do have kind of any other things to kind

you will for those that are new coming
into<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.350> sure<00:03:23.829> so<00:03:24.220> for<00:03:24.459> schools<00:03:24.790> we<00:03:25.120> have<00:03:25.299> a

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
into that sure so for schools we have a

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.050 
into that sure so for schools we have a
30-hour<00:03:26.290> stem<00:03:26.980> curriculum<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:27.730> teachers<00:03:28.030> can

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
30-hour stem curriculum so teachers can

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.520 
30-hour stem curriculum so teachers can
take<00:03:28.359> this<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.660> implement<00:03:29.049> science<00:03:29.440> and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
take this and implement science and

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.599 
take this and implement science and
technology<00:03:29.980> engineering<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.400> math

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
technology engineering and math

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.670 
technology engineering and math
curriculum<00:03:31.120> in<00:03:31.269> their<00:03:31.420> school<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.019> we<00:03:32.530> also

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
curriculum in their school and we also

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.590 
curriculum in their school and we also
have<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> software<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:34.030> science<00:03:34.510> teachers

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
have a software that science teachers

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.050
