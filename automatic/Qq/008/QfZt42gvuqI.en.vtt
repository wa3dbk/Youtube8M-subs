 I have always learned in Basque; but when I got home, we always talked in Spanish; since my parents did not know Basque. 

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:37.234
 And always, for the tasks, we asked them about mathematics, geography ... And when they began to study Basque, they changed everything: they arrived and they asked this how it is said, this is how it is done, is this ok? , and that? ... Change everything. 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.556
 It was very gratifying to get home and be able to speak in Basque. For me it was very important, I gave much more importance to Basque. 

00:00:50.556 --> 00:01:08.556
 After all, I learned in Basque, but they did not know, then, it did not give much importance, but when the two began, in their free time, working, with two children, there is not much free time, 

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:16.682
 I gave him a lot of importance and I'm very proud 

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:27.989
 My parents did not know Basque, but they went to euskaltegi and did the effort to learn Basque 

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:35.067
 and now we live in Basque at home, and my parents in everyday life use Basque as normal. 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.230
 My mother, in addition, being a teacher, where she works, teaches in Basque. 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 I am very proud that my parents are Basque speakers and that I have been transmitted to Basque. 

00:01:54.952 --> 00:02:02.950
 Aita goes to Euskaltegi, with the notebook. 

00:02:05.483 --> 00:02:13.480
 With the play ... we do the homework. 

00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:23.300
 After the father, he also loves euskaltegi and is studying Basque. 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.810
 I want to thank my father for the effort to have learned Basque 

00:02:28.894 --> 00:02:36.890
 since with 40 years Basque, or any language. To learn it, I think it has a lot of merit. 

00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:48.370
 Also, working at the factory, in turns, with two small daughters, I find it very complicated. 

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:54.950
 I had an occasion since childhood, I am also grateful for that and ... 

00:02:56.056 --> 00:03:03.060
 I remember the image of my father, learning with the headphones, repeating things ... 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.520
 We often made funky at home; Of course, without him knowing, je je 

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:15.730
 He decided to join the euskaltegi and I am very proud. 

00:03:16.342 --> 00:03:19.340
 Distinguish the appropriate step, love. 

00:03:19.987 --> 00:03:23.476
 I know that you make a great effort to go to Euskaltegi every day. 

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:27.480
 But that gives me a lot of joy. 

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:39.090
 I am very proud to see how you have overcome that embarrassment that you have and with your grandson BeÃ±at speak in Basque, I am very proud. 

00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:52.540
 When my little girl was little she studied in Castilian and I did not know Basque. 

00:03:54.017 --> 00:04:00.020
 With 20 years he decided to go to Euskaltegi to learn Basque. 

00:04:00.872 --> 00:04:10.870
 Since then, he has taught us Basque, and speaks to us. 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:29.330
 Thanks to that, it can help me in the tasks of the school, and play games in Basque, go to Basque theaters ... 

00:04:32.757 --> 00:04:44.760
 Amazing ... when I saw how my mum was going every afternoon to euskaltegi, at what times, it was difficult to fix ... because I was working, seeing what schedules I had classes 

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:55.830
 At that moment you do not realize, you value it over time. And I have them a lot to thank. The father also saw the necessary Basque, he always uses it to interact. 

00:04:56.388 --> 00:05:00.390
 Me, and I think that my brother too, is something that I appreciate very much. 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.230
 That has meant that we are fully Basque-speaking, and, in the same way, I have been able to raise my children in Basque 

00:05:07.893 --> 00:05:11.890
 As a mother, as a daughter, for me it is very important. And now more children and daughters have aitiko and euskaldun amatxi. 

00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:17.300
 My children do not have Basque parents berris, but they will be an old Basque. It is splendid as in three generations we have taken that step. 

00:05:17.995 --> 00:05:26.500
 As a mother, as a daughter, for me it is very important. And now more children and daughters have aitiko and euskaldun amatxi. 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.100
 It's not silly, it's a matter of being very proud 

00:05:33.743 --> 00:05:51.740
 Thank you very much, dad, love, all my heart
