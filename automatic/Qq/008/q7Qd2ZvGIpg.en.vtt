out<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> way<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> animation<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.559> go

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
out of the way but the animation will go

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.680 
out of the way but the animation will go
faster<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.610> new<00:00:35.820> tablet<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> draw

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
faster with my new tablet to draw

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.170

instead<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> mouse<00:00:37.340> but<00:00:38.340> there's<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:39.120> thing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
instead of a mouse but there's one thing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.240 
instead of a mouse but there's one thing
that<00:00:39.719> would<00:00:39.840> take<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> long<00:00:40.440> time<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:40.829> me

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
that would take a long time for me

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.540

of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> scenery<00:01:07.049> from<00:01:07.290> multiple<00:01:07.740> angles

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
of the scenery from multiple angles

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.090 
of the scenery from multiple angles
within<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.700> area<00:01:09.080> some<00:01:10.080> images<00:01:10.619> will<00:01:10.799> need<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
within the area some images will need to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.350

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
be longer than the viewer screen

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.750 
be longer than the viewer screen
shape-wise<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> background<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.610> move

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
shape-wise so the background can move

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.600 
shape-wise so the background can move
while<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> anime<00:01:15.479> characters<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.020> top<00:01:16.610> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
while I anime characters on top this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.850 
while I anime characters on top this
goes<00:01:17.880> from<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.270> entire<00:01:18.600> cast<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.470> wish<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
goes from my entire cast if you wish to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
goes from my entire cast if you wish to
assist<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.280> speeding<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.909> pace<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
assist in speeding up the pace of the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.719 
assist in speeding up the pace of the
production<00:01:22.080> though<00:01:22.320> not<00:01:22.740> rushing<00:01:23.250> too<00:01:23.430> fast

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
production though not rushing too fast

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.910 
production though not rushing too fast
so<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> series<00:01:24.330> won't<00:01:24.540> go<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> trash<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.320> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so the series won't go to trash if you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.679 
so the series won't go to trash if you
cannot<00:01:26.189> draw<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:26.850> maybe<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.420> others

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
cannot draw then maybe there are others

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.950 
cannot draw then maybe there are others
you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:28.200> confined<00:01:28.710> who<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.250> draw<00:01:29.960> also

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you know or confined who can draw also

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.710

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
as most animations are done by crews you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.510 
as most animations are done by crews you

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
can have one person specialize in one

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.340 
can have one person specialize in one
step<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:35.970> process<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.540> someone<00:01:37.049> else<00:01:37.200> in

basic layout of the areas which are then

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.899 
basic layout of the areas which are then
sent<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.630> other<00:01:42.840> artists<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:44.310> others<00:01:44.670> can

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
sent to other artists then others can
