00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
about the blue I love it not only

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.440

because of Lavinia I want to catch up to
that<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:26.690> wasn't<00:01:26.960> really<00:01:27.259> familiar<00:01:28.250> with

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
that I wasn't really familiar with

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.609

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
either cooking it or even eating it I

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.289 
either cooking it or even eating it I
figured<00:01:30.860> it'd<00:01:31.039> be<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.130> really<00:01:31.369> fun<00:01:31.700> challenge

for myself as an amateur cook to get the
blue<00:01:35.000> fish<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.450> see<00:01:35.600> what<00:01:35.690> I<00:01:35.750> could<00:01:35.810> do<00:01:36.020> with

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
blue fish and see what I could do with

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.570
