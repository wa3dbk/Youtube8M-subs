00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.380 
a rule but I'm asking like me what was
the<00:01:49.260> mindset<00:01:49.470> behind<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.340> rule<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.000> reason

the mindset behind the rule the reason

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.360 
the mindset behind the rule the reason
is<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.900> a<00:01:52.080> family<00:01:52.620> server<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
is that it's a family server it's a

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.700 
is that it's a family server it's a
g-rated<00:01:53.760> server<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.870> with<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.260> Keith<00:01:55.440> why<00:01:55.650> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
g-rated server so with it Keith why is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.420 
g-rated server so with it Keith why is
killing<00:01:56.460> allowed<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.540> killing<00:01:58.170> g-rated<00:02:01.430> yeah

killing allowed is killing g-rated yeah
but<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.300> doesn't<00:02:03.570> make<00:02:03.660> any<00:02:03.840> sense<00:02:04.140> like

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
but that doesn't make any sense like

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.810 
but that doesn't make any sense like
you're<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:07.040> you're<00:02:08.040> just<00:02:08.429> saying<00:02:08.670> like
