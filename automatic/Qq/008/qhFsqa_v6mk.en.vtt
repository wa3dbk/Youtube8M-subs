today<00:00:03.600> we<00:00:04.200> have<00:00:04.319> an<00:00:04.440> unboxing<00:00:04.589> from<00:00:05.220> Shapeways

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
today we have an unboxing from Shapeways

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.890 
today we have an unboxing from Shapeways
comm<00:00:07.220> so<00:00:08.220> here's<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.730> box<00:00:08.970> my<00:00:09.240> camera<00:00:09.599> angle

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
comm so here's the box my camera angle

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.209 
comm so here's the box my camera angle
makes<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.230> look<00:00:10.349> very<00:00:10.380> large<00:00:10.860> but<00:00:11.099> it's

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
makes it look very large but it's

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.100 
makes it look very large but it's
actually<00:00:11.460> not<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.639> big<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.630> if<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.960> don't

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
actually not that big and if you don't

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.020 
actually not that big and if you don't
know<00:00:13.259> what<00:00:13.440> Shapeways<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.160> Shapeways<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
know what Shapeways is Shapeways is a

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.519 
know what Shapeways is Shapeways is a
place<00:00:15.299> where<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:16.039> upload<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.220> design<00:00:18.180> and

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
place where you can upload a design and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.550 
place where you can upload a design and
a<00:00:19.529> CAD<00:00:19.920> file<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.490> then<00:00:20.850> get<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.119> 3d<00:00:21.539> printed<00:00:21.960> so

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
a CAD file and then get it 3d printed so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.859 
a CAD file and then get it 3d printed so
this<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.189> actually<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.760> elemental<00:00:24.660> cube

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
this one is actually the elemental cube

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.230 
this one is actually the elemental cube
by<00:00:25.230> Evan<00:00:25.619> E<00:00:25.710> gear<00:00:26.010> grib<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.880> really

by Evan E gear grib and I'm really

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.370 
by Evan E gear grib and I'm really
excited<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.080> it

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
excited to get it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.259 
excited to get it
the<00:00:28.619> only<00:00:28.769> thing<00:00:28.980> else<00:00:29.220> I've<00:00:29.550> ever<00:00:29.699> ordered

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the only thing else I've ever ordered

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.920 
the only thing else I've ever ordered
from<00:00:30.420> shapeways<00:00:30.869> was<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:32.480> 2x3<00:00:33.480> cuboid

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
from shapeways was the one by 2x3 cuboid

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.150 
from shapeways was the one by 2x3 cuboid
and<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.340> by<00:00:35.760> Tom<00:00:36.120> Z<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and this one was by Tom Z so this is the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.060 
and this one was by Tom Z so this is the
1<00:00:38.309> by<00:00:38.460> 2<00:00:38.489> by<00:00:38.760> 3<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.559> elemental

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
1 by 2 by 3 and this is the elemental

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.139 
1 by 2 by 3 and this is the elemental
cube<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.579> let's<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> box<00:00:44.940> is

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
cube so let's get in it so the box is

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.290 
cube so let's get in it so the box is
super<00:00:45.539> light<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.879> there's<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> reason<00:00:48.270> for

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
super light and there's a reason for

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.229 
super light and there's a reason for
that<00:00:49.100> it's<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.309> box<00:00:50.550> empty<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.030> did

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
that it's my box empty and this one did

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.810 
that it's my box empty and this one did
take<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> while<00:00:54.739> but<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
take a while but I think it was two and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
take a while but I think it was two and
a<00:00:56.879> half<00:00:56.969> weeks<00:00:57.239> ok<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.859> where<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.730> our<00:01:00.690> product

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a half weeks ok so where is our product

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.750 
a half weeks ok so where is our product
this<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.770> bubbles<00:01:03.890> okay<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.100> else<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.549> have

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
this is bubbles okay what else we have

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.660 
this is bubbles okay what else we have
to<00:01:05.990> know<00:01:06.990> there's<00:01:07.260> other<00:01:07.470> bubbles<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.159> an

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to know there's other bubbles and an

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
to know there's other bubbles and an
empty<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> think<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> flew<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.200> this

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
empty but I think it flew out what this

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.210 
empty but I think it flew out what this
is<00:01:10.850> what<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:13.729> let's<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.939> closer

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
is what is that let's get closer

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.270 
is what is that let's get closer
so<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.820> tiny<00:01:18.409> super<00:01:19.409> tiny<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
so if that is tiny super tiny if you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
so if that is tiny super tiny if you
haven't<00:01:20.520> already<00:01:20.610> figured<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:21.330> maybe<00:01:21.630> by<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
haven't already figured out maybe by the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.830 
haven't already figured out maybe by the
title<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.560> thumbnail<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
title or the thumbnail this is the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.010 
title or the thumbnail this is the
world's<00:01:25.409> smallest<00:01:25.850> rubik's<00:01:26.850> cube<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.750> 8

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
world's smallest rubik's cube it's 8

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.190 
world's smallest rubik's cube it's 8
millimeters<00:01:28.710> across<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
millimeters across and this is what it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.719 
millimeters across and this is what it
looks<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> can't<00:01:32.340> wait<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> put<00:01:32.610> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
looks like so I can't wait to put it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.480 
looks like so I can't wait to put it
together

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.649 

so<00:01:40.120> that<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.540> course<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.200> corner<00:01:41.740> piece<00:01:42.659> here

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
so that of course is a corner piece here

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.930 
so that of course is a corner piece here
we<00:01:43.900> have<00:01:44.110> edge<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.970> are<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.420> center<00:01:46.780> pieces

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.880 

and<00:01:52.940> here<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.930> centerpiece

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.000 

so<00:01:58.820> what<00:01:59.030> happened<00:01:59.390> next<00:01:59.570> was<00:01:59.930> I<00:02:00.260> spent<00:02:00.830> an

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
so what happened next was I spent an

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.000 
so what happened next was I spent an
hour<00:02:01.280> trying<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.540> assemble<00:02:02.870> the<00:02:03.440> elemental

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
hour trying to assemble the elemental

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.940 
hour trying to assemble the elemental
cube<00:02:04.250> I<00:02:04.780> struggled<00:02:05.780> with<00:02:05.960> putting<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.620> center

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
cube I struggled with putting the center

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.620 
cube I struggled with putting the center
pieces<00:02:07.160> into<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.060> core

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
pieces into the core

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.600 
pieces into the core
now<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.170> openings<00:02:09.770> in<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.039> core<00:02:10.310> are<00:02:10.580> a

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
now the openings in the core are a

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.730 
now the openings in the core are a
little<00:02:10.940> too<00:02:11.120> small<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.020> had<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.470> enlarge

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
little too small so I had to enlarge

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.720 
little too small so I had to enlarge
them<00:02:13.160> with<00:02:13.760> my<00:02:14.120> exacto<00:02:14.690> knife<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.730> actually

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
them with my exacto knife I actually

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.240 
them with my exacto knife I actually
broke<00:02:17.270> four<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.320> center<00:02:18.590> pieces<00:02:18.770> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
broke four of the center pieces and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.060 
broke four of the center pieces and
luckily<00:02:20.120> there<00:02:20.690> were<00:02:20.840> four<00:02:21.110> extra<00:02:21.710> Center

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
luckily there were four extra Center

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.150 
luckily there were four extra Center
pieces<00:02:22.490> I<00:02:22.730> cut<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.390> really<00:02:23.420> close<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.560> also

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
pieces I cut it really close I also

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.910 
pieces I cut it really close I also

broke a couple corner pieces and I lost
an<00:02:28.220> edge<00:02:28.400> piece<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.300> this<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.630> something<00:02:29.959> you

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
an edge piece so this is something you

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.320 
an edge piece so this is something you
have<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.290> be<00:02:30.380> very<00:02:30.860> careful<00:02:31.310> with<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.730> like<00:02:32.180> I

have to be very careful with and like I
said<00:02:32.570> it<00:02:32.750> took<00:02:33.050> an<00:02:33.230> hour<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.920> assemble<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.760> oh

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.880 

my<00:02:38.300> goodness<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:38.750> went<00:02:38.900> right<00:02:39.110> in<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.530> can't

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
my goodness that went right in I can't

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.630 
my goodness that went right in I can't
believe<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.489> did<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:42.070> cut<00:02:43.070> that<00:02:43.250> way<00:02:43.580> to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
believe it I did it I cut that way to

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.479 
believe it I did it I cut that way to
coast<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.720> small<00:02:45.160> all<00:02:46.160> right<00:02:46.340> let<00:02:46.459> me

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
coast that is so small all right let me

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.270 
coast that is so small all right let me
get<00:02:46.700> back<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.880> my<00:02:47.030> normal<00:02:47.150> camera<00:02:47.570> angle<00:02:47.959> so

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
get back to my normal camera angle so

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.380 
get back to my normal camera angle so
this<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.880> eight<00:02:50.230> millimeter<00:02:52.390> elemental

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
this is the eight millimeter elemental

I'm<00:03:04.850> gonna<00:03:05.030> see<00:03:05.209> what<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.420> looks<00:03:05.540> like<00:03:05.660> with

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
I'm gonna see what it looks like with

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.979 
I'm gonna see what it looks like with
stickers<00:03:06.290> on<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.950> will<00:03:07.220> do<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.489> later

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
stickers on it and I will do that later

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.330 
stickers on it and I will do that later
right<00:03:08.989> now<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:09.380> late<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.860> I'm<00:03:09.950> gonna<00:03:10.130> go<00:03:10.280> to

right now it's late and I'm gonna go to
bed<00:03:13.030> stickering<00:03:14.030> was<00:03:14.330> no<00:03:14.690> easy<00:03:15.049> task

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
bed stickering was no easy task

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.789 
bed stickering was no easy task
I<00:03:16.010> used<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.790> very<00:03:17.030> sharp<00:03:17.750> exacto<00:03:18.410> knife<00:03:18.590> I

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
I used a very sharp exacto knife I

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.940 
I used a very sharp exacto knife I
change<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.340> blade<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:20.570> then<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:21.080> used<00:03:21.530> this

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
change the blade and then I used this

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.759 
change the blade and then I used this
straight<00:03:22.370> edge<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.610> cut<00:03:23.299> very<00:03:23.900> nice<00:03:24.260> straight

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
straight edge to cut very nice straight

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.630 
straight edge to cut very nice straight
lines<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.140> very<00:03:27.380> difficult<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:28.489> here

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
lines and this is very difficult so here

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.120 
lines and this is very difficult so here
you<00:03:28.700> can<00:03:28.790> see<00:03:28.970> me<00:03:29.120> cutting<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.690> then<00:03:30.620> after

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
you can see me cutting and then after

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.220 
you can see me cutting and then after
they<00:03:31.280> were<00:03:31.340> cut<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:31.880> put<00:03:32.090> each<00:03:32.299> sticker<00:03:33.019> on

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
they were cut I put each sticker on

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.660 
they were cut I put each sticker on
individually<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:36.200> assembling<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:37.370> it

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
individually and like assembling it it

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.430 
individually and like assembling it it
took<00:03:38.420> forever

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.440 

so<00:03:44.440> here's<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:45.070> fully<00:03:45.280> stickered<00:03:45.820> elemental

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
so here's the fully stickered elemental

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.260 
so here's the fully stickered elemental
cube<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.930> as<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.770> can<00:03:47.920> see<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.910> stickers

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
cube and as you can see the stickers

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.510 
cube and as you can see the stickers
aren't<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.660> great<00:03:49.930> but<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:50.830> know<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.250> took

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
aren't that great but you know it took

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.550 
aren't that great but you know it took
me<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:52.000> long<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.660> was<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:52.780> difficult<00:03:53.200> to

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
me so long and it was so difficult to

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.350 
me so long and it was so difficult to
sticker<00:03:53.890> I'm<00:03:54.160> not<00:03:54.400> going<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.670> redo<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:54.970> so<00:03:55.120> I'm

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
sticker I'm not going to redo it so I'm

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.910 
sticker I'm not going to redo it so I'm
going<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.570> just<00:03:55.690> leave<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.440> now<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.680> guess

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
going to just leave it so now I guess

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.400 
going to just leave it so now I guess
I'll<00:03:57.130> I'll<00:03:57.730> solve<00:03:58.240> this<00:03:58.410> checkerboard

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
I'll I'll solve this checkerboard

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.320 
I'll I'll solve this checkerboard
pattern<00:03:59.620> and<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:00.340> can<00:04:00.490> see<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.790> actually<00:04:00.910> it

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
pattern and you can see it actually it

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.100 
pattern and you can see it actually it
does<00:04:01.630> move<00:04:01.990> like<00:04:02.470> a<00:04:02.680> Rubik's<00:04:03.040> Cube<00:04:03.780> although<00:04:04.780> a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
does move like a Rubik's Cube although a

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.390 
does move like a Rubik's Cube although a
little<00:04:05.260> fragile<00:04:06.870> now<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.110> is<00:04:08.290> not<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.860> puzzle

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
little fragile now this is not a puzzle

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.640 
little fragile now this is not a puzzle
I<00:04:09.730> will<00:04:09.940> keep<00:04:10.090> out<00:04:10.300> for<00:04:10.630> just<00:04:10.870> anyone<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.470> play

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
I will keep out for just anyone to play

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.460 
I will keep out for just anyone to play
with<00:04:11.820> because<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:13.300> do<00:04:13.570> not<00:04:13.870> want<00:04:14.140> anyone

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
with because I do not want anyone

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.750 
with because I do not want anyone
breaking<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:16.120> did<00:04:16.510> break<00:04:17.130> many<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.430> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
breaking it and I did break many of the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.520 
breaking it and I did break many of the
little<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.060> pieces<00:04:19.570> as<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:19.989> was<00:04:20.110> putting<00:04:20.320> it

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
little the pieces as I was putting it

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.630 
little the pieces as I was putting it
together<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.549> this<00:04:21.820> is<00:04:22.000> not<00:04:22.180> one<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.840> want<00:04:23.620> out

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.940 

you<00:04:27.640> can<00:04:27.760> see<00:04:28.000> as<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.150> struggle<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:29.740> got<00:04:29.860> to

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
you can see as I struggle you got to

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:40.130 
you can see as I struggle you got to
make<00:04:30.100> sure<00:04:30.220> it's<00:04:30.370> all<00:04:30.520> lined<00:04:30.790> up<00:04:30.970> properly

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.810 

so<00:04:41.140> there<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:41.590> can<00:04:41.650> see<00:04:41.980> it's<00:04:42.310> back<00:04:42.610> together

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
so there you can see it's back together

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.850 
so there you can see it's back together
again<00:04:43.470> not<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.680> easiest<00:04:44.980> thing<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.340> solve

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
again not the easiest thing to solve

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.350 
again not the easiest thing to solve
can't<00:04:47.860> believe<00:04:48.100> I<00:04:48.250> almost<00:04:48.280> forgot<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.210> do<00:04:49.330> a

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
can't believe I almost forgot to do a

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.960 
can't believe I almost forgot to do a
size<00:04:49.750> comparison<00:04:49.980> so<00:04:50.980> here<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.370> can<00:04:51.490> see<00:04:51.730> the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
size comparison so here you can see the

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.510 
size comparison so here you can see the
eight<00:04:52.210> millimeter<00:04:52.770> elemental<00:04:53.770> cube<00:04:53.950> on<00:04:54.250> top

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
eight millimeter elemental cube on top

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.150 
eight millimeter elemental cube on top
of<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.940> 57-millimeter<00:04:55.920> standard<00:04:56.920> sized

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
of a 57-millimeter standard sized

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.800 
of a 57-millimeter standard sized
rubik's<00:04:57.580> cube<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:57.940> this<00:04:58.090> is<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.300> dying<00:04:58.570> goo

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
rubik's cube and this is a dying goo

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.650 
rubik's cube and this is a dying goo
hyung<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.340> you<00:05:00.340> can<00:05:00.550> see<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:01.030> sure<00:05:01.390> enough

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
hyung and you can see that sure enough

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.140 
hyung and you can see that sure enough
this<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.320> eight<00:05:03.070> millimeters<00:05:03.640> let's<00:05:03.940> measure

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
this is eight millimeters let's measure

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.460 
this is eight millimeters let's measure
it<00:05:07.290> let's<00:05:08.290> see<00:05:08.770> five<00:05:09.340> six<00:05:09.850> seven<00:05:10.360> eight<00:05:10.630> eight

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
it let's see five six seven eight eight

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.980 
it let's see five six seven eight eight
millimeters<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.640> might<00:05:12.790> be<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:13.000> hair<00:05:13.630> more

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
millimeters and it might be a hair more

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.160 
millimeters and it might be a hair more
than<00:05:14.050> eight<00:05:14.560> maybe<00:05:15.460> eight<00:05:15.790> point<00:05:16.330> one<00:05:16.630> eight

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
than eight maybe eight point one eight

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.400 
than eight maybe eight point one eight
point<00:05:17.920> two<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:19.300> reason<00:05:19.690> why<00:05:19.840> it's<00:05:20.260> a

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
point two and the reason why it's a

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.230 
point two and the reason why it's a
little<00:05:20.530> more<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:21.010> because<00:05:21.370> that<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.880> stickers

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
little more is because that the stickers

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.110 
little more is because that the stickers
are<00:05:22.390> there<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.680> adds<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:24.160> tiny<00:05:24.610> bit<00:05:24.970> of

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
are there so that adds a tiny bit of

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.970 
are there so that adds a tiny bit of
thickness<00:05:25.360> but<00:05:26.140> yeah<00:05:26.350> so<00:05:26.620> there<00:05:26.770> you<00:05:26.860> go

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
thickness but yeah so there you go

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.820 
thickness but yeah so there you go
that's<00:05:27.130> eight<00:05:27.400> millimeters<00:05:28.470> versus<00:05:29.470> the

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
that's eight millimeters versus the

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.490 
that's eight millimeters versus the
fifty<00:05:30.250> seven<00:05:30.550> of<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:32.140> normal<00:05:32.560> rubik's<00:05:33.310> cube

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
fifty seven of a normal rubik's cube

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.450 
fifty seven of a normal rubik's cube
here's<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.590> fun<00:05:35.890> fact

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
here's a fun fact

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.580 
here's a fun fact
you<00:05:37.030> could<00:05:37.210> fit<00:05:38.400> 343<00:05:39.400> Elemental<00:05:40.330> cubes<00:05:40.690> inside

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
you could fit 343 Elemental cubes inside

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.970 
you could fit 343 Elemental cubes inside
the<00:05:41.919> volume<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.550> a<00:05:43.000> standard<00:05:43.480> Rubik's<00:05:43.900> Cube<00:05:44.169> so

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
the volume of a standard Rubik's Cube so

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.250 
the volume of a standard Rubik's Cube so
here<00:05:45.250> is<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.730> elemental<00:05:46.240> cube<00:05:46.540> and<00:05:46.750> I'm

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
here is the elemental cube and I'm

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.830 
here is the elemental cube and I'm
pretty<00:05:47.470> happy<00:05:47.710> with<00:05:47.950> it<00:05:48.010> this<00:05:48.850> is<00:05:49.120> not<00:05:49.419> for<00:05:49.750> the

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
pretty happy with it this is not for the

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.570 
pretty happy with it this is not for the
faint<00:05:50.050> of<00:05:50.169> heart<00:05:50.230> you<00:05:50.440> could<00:05:50.650> see<00:05:50.919> how<00:05:51.160> much<00:05:51.370> I

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
faint of heart you could see how much I

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.909 
faint of heart you could see how much I
struggled<00:05:52.000> putting<00:05:52.270> it<00:05:52.390> together<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:52.990> giving

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
struggled putting it together and giving

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.850 
struggled putting it together and giving
stickers<00:05:54.310> on<00:05:54.460> it<00:05:54.490> but<00:05:55.240> it<00:05:55.540> is<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.530> smallest

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
stickers on it but it is the smallest

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.210 
stickers on it but it is the smallest
Rubik's<00:05:57.520> Cube<00:05:57.940> in<00:05:58.090> the<00:05:58.510> world<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.990> like<00:05:59.950> all

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
Rubik's Cube in the world and like all

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.370 
Rubik's Cube in the world and like all
rubik's<00:06:01.000> cube<00:06:01.270> world<00:06:01.450> records<00:06:01.840> that<00:06:02.050> one<00:06:02.229> will

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
rubik's cube world records that one will

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.370 
rubik's cube world records that one will
probably<00:06:02.950> break<00:06:03.190> because<00:06:03.700> as<00:06:04.120> 3d<00:06:04.870> printing

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
probably break because as 3d printing

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.680 
probably break because as 3d printing
technology<00:06:05.979> gets<00:06:06.250> better<00:06:06.340> and<00:06:06.700> better<00:06:06.880> they

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
technology gets better and better they

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.590 
technology gets better and better they
can<00:06:07.750> print<00:06:08.229> with<00:06:08.500> higher<00:06:08.860> resolution<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:09.790> so

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
can print with higher resolution and so

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.180 
can print with higher resolution and so
they<00:06:10.750> can<00:06:10.900> make<00:06:11.050> smaller<00:06:11.410> and<00:06:11.620> smaller<00:06:11.919> pieces

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
they can make smaller and smaller pieces

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.300 
they can make smaller and smaller pieces
with<00:06:13.000> greater<00:06:13.300> detail<00:06:13.780> so<00:06:14.380> my<00:06:14.620> final<00:06:14.950> verdict

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
with greater detail so my final verdict

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.210 
with greater detail so my final verdict
for<00:06:15.370> this<00:06:15.729> puzzle<00:06:16.120> is<00:06:16.390> this<00:06:17.229> is<00:06:17.410> probably<00:06:17.890> not

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
for this puzzle is this is probably not

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.670 
for this puzzle is this is probably not
one<00:06:18.580> for<00:06:18.880> everybody<00:06:19.450> this<00:06:20.020> is<00:06:20.260> definitely

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
one for everybody this is definitely

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.150 
one for everybody this is definitely
very<00:06:20.830> difficult<00:06:21.729> to<00:06:21.940> put<00:06:22.180> together<00:06:22.300> and<00:06:23.160> also

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
very difficult to put together and also

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.210 
very difficult to put together and also
to<00:06:24.479> play<00:06:25.479> with<00:06:25.780> so<00:06:26.320> as<00:06:26.680> you<00:06:26.890> can<00:06:27.010> see<00:06:27.190> I

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
to play with so as you can see I

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.670 
to play with so as you can see I
struggled<00:06:27.850> trying<00:06:28.510> to<00:06:28.630> get<00:06:28.780> it<00:06:28.930> from<00:06:29.290> the

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
struggled trying to get it from the

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.969 
struggled trying to get it from the
checkerboard<00:06:30.430> back<00:06:30.940> to<00:06:31.300> salt<00:06:31.660> now<00:06:32.380> why<00:06:32.770> do<00:06:32.830> I

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
checkerboard back to salt now why do I

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.790 
checkerboard back to salt now why do I
have<00:06:33.310> it<00:06:33.490> well<00:06:33.669> I<00:06:33.880> have<00:06:34.360> a<00:06:34.810> project<00:06:35.620> in<00:06:35.740> mind

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
have it well I have a project in mind

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.790 
have it well I have a project in mind
for<00:06:36.760> the<00:06:36.880> future<00:06:37.030> that<00:06:37.479> I<00:06:37.510> wanted<00:06:38.080> this<00:06:38.290> puzzle

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
for the future that I wanted this puzzle

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.490 
for the future that I wanted this puzzle
so<00:06:39.190> I<00:06:39.220> went<00:06:39.490> ahead<00:06:39.580> and<00:06:39.700> bought<00:06:39.970> it<00:06:40.180> and

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
so I went ahead and bought it and

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.230 
so I went ahead and bought it and
Shapeways<00:06:41.530> I<00:06:41.800> wanted<00:06:42.340> to<00:06:42.430> get<00:06:42.580> something<00:06:42.910> from

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
Shapeways I wanted to get something from

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.210 
Shapeways I wanted to get something from
shapeways<00:06:43.750> and<00:06:44.020> this<00:06:44.200> is<00:06:44.410> pretty<00:06:44.770> much<00:06:44.950> the

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
shapeways and this is pretty much the

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.969 
shapeways and this is pretty much the
cheapest<00:06:45.610> thing<00:06:45.820> you<00:06:46.180> can<00:06:46.479> get<00:06:46.750> from

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
cheapest thing you can get from

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.650 
cheapest thing you can get from
shapeways<00:06:47.979> anyway<00:06:48.849> that's<00:06:49.030> the<00:06:49.180> elemental

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
shapeways anyway that's the elemental

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.480 
shapeways anyway that's the elemental
cube<00:06:49.840> I<00:06:50.110> hope<00:06:50.560> you<00:06:50.770> enjoyed<00:06:51.130> this<00:06:51.310> video
