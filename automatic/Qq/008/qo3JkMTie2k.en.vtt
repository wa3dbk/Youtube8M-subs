00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
where I was a sniper but I was even

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.110 
where I was a sniper but I was even
worse<00:00:46.600> than<00:00:46.870> I<00:00:46.899> am<00:00:46.929> today<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.879> was

worse than I am today and that was

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.149 
worse than I am today and that was
really<00:00:49.359> bad<00:00:49.629> I<00:00:49.690> couldn't<00:00:50.050> land<00:00:50.350> anything<00:00:50.829> I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
really bad I couldn't land anything I

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.220 
really bad I couldn't land anything I
was<00:00:51.309> constantly<00:00:51.969> getting<00:00:52.390> shot<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.929> pieces

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
was constantly getting shot to pieces

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.399 
was constantly getting shot to pieces
and<00:00:53.710> it<00:00:54.159> was<00:00:54.370> just<00:00:54.699> all<00:00:54.850> in<00:00:55.149> one<00:00:55.179> not<00:00:56.019> a<00:00:56.050> very

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
and it was just all in one not a very

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.700 
and it was just all in one not a very
pleasant<00:00:56.920> experience<00:00:57.929> nonetheless<00:00:58.929> here<00:00:59.589> we

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
pleasant experience nonetheless here we

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.130 
pleasant experience nonetheless here we
are<00:00:59.739> on<00:01:00.159> a<00:01:00.519> sniper<00:01:01.149> only<00:01:01.569> map<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.839> as<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:02.019> can

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
are on a sniper only map and as you can

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.290 
are on a sniper only map and as you can
see<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:03.219> are<00:01:03.249> constantly<00:01:03.850> fighting<00:01:04.210> each

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
see we are constantly fighting each

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.570 
see we are constantly fighting each
other<00:01:04.420> with<00:01:04.659> blows<00:01:05.170> sniper<00:01:05.740> rivals<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.430> we

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
other with blows sniper rivals and we

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.730 
other with blows sniper rivals and we
can<00:01:06.850> pull<00:01:07.060> out<00:01:07.180> different<00:01:07.420> weapons<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.530> this

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
can pull out different weapons so this

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.399 
can pull out different weapons so this
map<00:01:09.010> is<00:01:09.220> not<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.580> perfect<00:01:10.210> example<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:11.380> I

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
map is not a perfect example but I

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.380 
map is not a perfect example but I
reasonable<00:01:12.159> to<00:01:12.399> begin<00:01:12.759> with<00:01:12.969> like<00:01:13.119> there's<00:01:13.299> a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
reasonable to begin with like there's a

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.600 
reasonable to begin with like there's a
lot<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.659> sniper<00:01:13.960> maps<00:01:14.320> where<00:01:15.040> you<00:01:15.070> can<00:01:15.460> only

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
lot of sniper maps where you can only

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.789 
lot of sniper maps where you can only
kill<00:01:15.939> other<00:01:16.210> people<00:01:16.600> with<00:01:16.780> headshots<00:01:17.049> only

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
kill other people with headshots only

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.469 
kill other people with headshots only
but<00:01:18.280> fortunately<00:01:18.759> there's<00:01:19.030> always<00:01:19.180> going<00:01:19.450> to

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
but fortunately there's always going to

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.539 
but fortunately there's always going to
be<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.869> group<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.439> people<00:01:20.710> that's<00:01:20.950> going<00:01:21.189> to<00:01:21.369> do

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
be a group of people that's going to do

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.819 
be a group of people that's going to do
that<00:01:21.729> or<00:01:22.299> at<00:01:22.390> least<00:01:22.420> wear<00:01:22.750> that<00:01:22.869> anti<00:01:23.229> headshot

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
that or at least wear that anti headshot

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.670 
that or at least wear that anti headshot
gear<00:01:24.250> which<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:24.880> just<00:01:25.180> really<00:01:25.600> in<00:01:25.869> bad<00:01:26.350> taste

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
gear which is just really in bad taste

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.440 
gear which is just really in bad taste
but<00:01:26.890> that's<00:01:27.189> what<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.460> usually<00:01:27.579> also<00:01:27.969> gets<00:01:28.210> bad

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
but that's what it usually also gets bad

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.399 
but that's what it usually also gets bad
so<00:01:28.689> that's<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:29.020> given

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
so that's a given

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.789 
so that's a given
nonetheless<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:31.450> sniper<00:01:32.049> only<00:01:32.289> maps<00:01:32.619> are

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
nonetheless these sniper only maps are

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.100 
nonetheless these sniper only maps are
the<00:01:32.890> reason<00:01:33.280> why<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:33.700> am<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.299> decent<00:01:34.570> sniper

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
the reason why I am a decent sniper

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.289 
the reason why I am a decent sniper
because<00:01:35.799> you<00:01:36.070> will<00:01:36.219> learn<00:01:36.369> two<00:01:36.789> very

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
because you will learn two very

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.359 
because you will learn two very
important<00:01:37.899> things<00:01:37.960> well<00:01:38.950> first<00:01:39.189> of<00:01:39.310> all

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
important things well first of all

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.010 
important things well first of all
you'll<00:01:39.520> learn<00:01:39.640> how<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.909> quickscope<00:01:40.359> because

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
you'll learn how to quickscope because

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.719 
you'll learn how to quickscope because
if<00:01:41.140> you're<00:01:41.259> not<00:01:41.409> quick<00:01:41.649> enough<00:01:41.680> you're<00:01:42.430> dead

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
if you're not quick enough you're dead

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.450 
if you're not quick enough you're dead
and<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.630> want<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.899> kill<00:01:44.170> them<00:01:44.680> faster<00:01:45.430> than

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
and you want to kill them faster than

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.550 
and you want to kill them faster than
they<00:01:45.700> kill<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.539> I<00:01:46.750> suppose<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.140> makes<00:01:47.259> sense

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
they kill you I suppose that makes sense

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.060 
they kill you I suppose that makes sense

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
to learn how to counter snort but I

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.339 
to learn how to counter snort but I
should<00:02:15.280> say<00:02:15.520> with<00:02:16.390> little<00:02:16.750> tricks<00:02:16.930> like<00:02:17.170> for

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
should say with little tricks like for

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.990 
should say with little tricks like for
example<00:02:17.409> I've<00:02:17.709> stated<00:02:17.950> before<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.849> video

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
example I've stated before in a video

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.100 
example I've stated before in a video
where<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.480> say<00:02:19.780> wait<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.349> them<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.530> shoot

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
where I say wait for them to shoot

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.890 
where I say wait for them to shoot
first<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:21.470> little<00:02:21.740> tricks<00:02:21.950> like<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.220> and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
first like little tricks like that and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.720 
first like little tricks like that and
the<00:02:23.900> reason<00:02:24.200> why<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.440> got<00:02:24.770> into<00:02:25.130> these<00:02:25.310> matches

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
the reason why I got into these matches

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.250 
the reason why I got into these matches
because<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:26.000> friend<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.420> mine<00:02:26.600> which<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:26.900> believe

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
because a friend of mine which I believe

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.980 
because a friend of mine which I believe
is<00:02:27.530> actually<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.970> server<00:02:29.240> as<00:02:29.450> well<00:02:29.720> I

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
is actually in the server as well I

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.660 
is actually in the server as well I
believe<00:02:30.140> he's<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> very<00:02:30.620> good<00:02:30.830> sniper<00:02:31.010> he's<00:02:31.340> way

that's a very good way to start off as

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.870 
that's a very good way to start off as
well<00:03:07.850> but<00:03:08.810> he<00:03:08.959> also<00:03:09.680> frequently<00:03:10.280> attends

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
well but he also frequently attends

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.150 
well but he also frequently attends
servers<00:03:11.540> like<00:03:11.690> these<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.230> that's<00:03:12.800> how<00:03:13.100> we

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
servers like these and that's how we

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.920 
servers like these and that's how we
really<00:03:13.280> specifically<00:03:14.090> got<00:03:14.330> better<00:03:14.570> against

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
really specifically got better against

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
of an annoyance you are for the enemy

of an annoyance you are for the enemy
team<00:03:24.320> they<00:03:25.010> can't<00:03:25.280> really<00:03:25.610> pinpoint<00:03:25.850> you

team they can't really pinpoint you

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.490 
team they can't really pinpoint you
because<00:03:26.510> one<00:03:26.750> you're<00:03:26.930> always<00:03:27.080> on<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.320> move

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
because one you're always on the move

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.680 
because one you're always on the move
but<00:03:27.680> every<00:03:27.920> time<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.640> they<00:03:28.790> see<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:29.239> they

take<00:03:29.900> 150<00:03:30.620> damage<00:03:31.070> we<00:03:31.190> didn't<00:03:31.430> means<00:03:31.549> they<00:03:31.700> are

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
take 150 damage we didn't means they are

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.930 
take 150 damage we didn't means they are
about<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.299> die<00:03:32.480> or<00:03:32.750> they're<00:03:33.230> dead<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.940> both

about to die or they're dead and both
scenarios<00:03:35.299> are<00:03:35.750> very<00:03:36.019> inconvenient<00:03:36.470> for<00:03:37.070> the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
scenarios are very inconvenient for the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.940 
scenarios are very inconvenient for the
enemy<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.540> playing<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.170> lot<00:03:39.320> on<00:03:39.410> these<00:03:39.560> maps<00:03:39.799> is

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
enemy so playing a lot on these maps is

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.520 
enemy so playing a lot on these maps is
like<00:03:40.070> it's<00:03:40.250> not<00:03:40.370> like<00:03:40.580> after<00:03:41.420> an<00:03:41.630> hour<00:03:42.230> you're

if you can do that then you can

like a lot of people they just jump in

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.420 
like a lot of people they just jump in

normal games I suppose I should say and

already weaker as you and most likely

already weaker as you and most likely
don't<00:04:24.080> even<00:04:24.200> know<00:04:24.260> what<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.470> hell<00:04:24.590> they're

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
don't even know what the hell they're

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.530 
don't even know what the hell they're
doing<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:25.430> can't<00:04:25.700> become<00:04:25.970> better<00:04:26.210> in<00:04:26.390> that

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
doing you can't become better in that

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.120 
doing you can't become better in that
there<00:04:27.260> are<00:04:27.350> certain<00:04:27.620> things<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.830> can<00:04:27.890> improve

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
there are certain things you can improve

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.710 
there are certain things you can improve
with<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.760> but<00:04:29.090> in<00:04:29.360> general<00:04:29.419> your

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
with that but in general your

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.170 
with that but in general your
even<00:04:31.020> worse<00:04:31.320> layer<00:04:31.920> because<00:04:32.760> you're<00:04:32.910> going<00:04:33.060> to

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
even worse layer because you're going to

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.210 
even worse layer because you're going to
anticipate<00:04:33.420> a<00:04:33.780> certain<00:04:34.590> amount<00:04:34.770> of<00:04:34.920> skill

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
anticipate a certain amount of skill

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.220 
anticipate a certain amount of skill
level<00:04:35.610> which<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.150> way<00:04:36.330> below<00:04:36.540> average<00:04:36.690> as

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
level which is way below average as

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.660 
level which is way below average as
opposed<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.710> on<00:04:37.920> your<00:04:38.040> own<00:04:38.100> skill<00:04:38.400> level

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
opposed to that on your own skill level

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.760 
opposed to that on your own skill level
so<00:04:38.910> if<00:04:39.390> you're<00:04:39.510> going<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.690> fight<00:04:39.930> against<00:04:40.590> good

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
so if you're going to fight against good

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.460 
so if you're going to fight against good
people<00:04:40.980> constantly<00:04:41.670> you'll<00:04:42.540> become<00:04:42.870> forced

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
people constantly you'll become forced

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.050 
people constantly you'll become forced
to<00:04:43.740> become<00:04:44.040> better<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:44.640> can<00:04:44.670> keep<00:04:44.880> up<00:04:45.030> with

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
to become better so you can keep up with

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.910 
to become better so you can keep up with
them<00:04:45.420> which<00:04:46.050> is<00:04:46.140> one<00:04:46.260> of<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.440> reasons<00:04:46.740> why<00:04:46.890> I

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
them which is one of the reasons why I

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.410 
them which is one of the reasons why I
wanted<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.250> become<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.550> good<00:04:47.790> sniper<00:04:47.970> as<00:04:48.240> well

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
wanted to become a good sniper as well

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.490 
wanted to become a good sniper as well
because<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.720> was<00:04:48.900> constantly<00:04:49.350> getting

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
because I was constantly getting

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.410 
because I was constantly getting

if<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:54.000> isn't<00:04:54.210> like<00:04:54.330> damn<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.930> dude<00:04:55.080> I'm<00:04:55.260> trying

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
if it isn't like damn it dude I'm trying

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.800 
if it isn't like damn it dude I'm trying
to<00:04:55.890> record<00:04:56.010> here<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.270> kind<00:04:57.510> of<00:04:57.570> figured

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
to record here and so I kind of figured

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.090 
to record here and so I kind of figured
well<00:04:57.960> if<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.170> can't<00:04:58.350> beat<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:58.830> just<00:04:58.890> have<00:04:59.040> to

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
well if I can't beat it I just have to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.700 
well if I can't beat it I just have to
become<00:04:59.370> better<00:04:59.610> so<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.210> can<00:05:00.270> beat<00:05:00.600> him<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.260> then

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
become better so I can beat him and then

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.010 
become better so I can beat him and then
record<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.550> then<00:05:02.670> laughs<00:05:02.910> I<00:05:03.180> suppose<00:05:03.390> at

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
record that and then laughs I suppose at

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.680 
record that and then laughs I suppose at
my<00:05:04.230> own<00:05:04.350> personal<00:05:04.620> victory<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.330> think<00:05:06.570> that

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
my own personal victory and I think that

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.360 
my own personal victory and I think that
I'm<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.810> reasonable<00:05:07.050> sniper<00:05:07.650> considering

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
I'm a reasonable sniper considering

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.700 
I'm a reasonable sniper considering
after<00:05:09.180> all<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.750> things<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.140> did<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.590> achieve

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
after all the things I did to achieve

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.220 
after all the things I did to achieve
that<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.370> it<00:05:11.850> is<00:05:12.240> always<00:05:12.420> a<00:05:12.510> weird<00:05:12.810> thing<00:05:13.020> to

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
that and it is always a weird thing to

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.620 
that and it is always a weird thing to
do<00:05:13.350> that<00:05:13.530> like<00:05:13.710> trying<00:05:14.640> to<00:05:14.730> be<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.120> good<00:05:15.420> sniper

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
do that like trying to be a good sniper

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.760 
do that like trying to be a good sniper
while<00:05:15.960> still<00:05:16.170> playing<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.500> little<00:05:16.680> other

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
while still playing a little other

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.500 
while still playing a little other
classes<00:05:17.220> as<00:05:17.310> well<00:05:17.490> because<00:05:17.790> there's<00:05:17.970> a<00:05:18.030> clear

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
classes as well because there's a clear

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.930 
classes as well because there's a clear
difference<00:05:18.840> between<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.560> sniper<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.580> of

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
difference between a sniper and of

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.120 
difference between a sniper and of
course<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:21.210> soldier<00:05:21.690> for<00:05:21.870> example<00:05:22.500> which<00:05:22.890> also

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
course a soldier for example which also

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.740 
course a soldier for example which also
doesn't<00:05:23.370> really<00:05:23.430> help<00:05:23.669> your<00:05:24.030> skill<00:05:24.720> level

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
doesn't really help your skill level

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.659 
doesn't really help your skill level
when<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.140> Spurs<00:05:25.380> in<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.830> specific<00:05:26.070> class<00:05:26.520> if

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
when the Spurs in a specific class if

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:27.890 
when the Spurs in a specific class if
you're<00:05:26.760> going<00:05:26.910> to<00:05:27.000> play<00:05:27.510> a<00:05:27.540> lot<00:05:27.780> of<00:05:27.810> different

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
you're going to play a lot of different

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.620 
you're going to play a lot of different
classes<00:05:28.350> if<00:05:29.160> I<00:05:29.370> were<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:29.640> only<00:05:29.790> play<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.150> sniper

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
classes if I were to only play a sniper

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.150 
classes if I were to only play a sniper
and<00:05:30.840> only<00:05:31.080> have<00:05:31.200> plates<00:05:31.590> type<00:05:31.830> from<00:05:32.070> the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
and only have plates type from the

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.590 
and only have plates type from the
moment<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.520> started<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:32.820> train<00:05:33.150> my<00:05:33.330> sniper

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
moment I started to train my sniper

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.200 
moment I started to train my sniper
ability<00:05:34.140> I<00:05:34.320> would<00:05:34.740> probably<00:05:35.280> be<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.580> lot<00:05:35.970> better

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
ability I would probably be a lot better

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.510 
ability I would probably be a lot better
right<00:05:36.480> now<00:05:36.540> but<00:05:37.020> at<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.530> same<00:05:37.680> time<00:05:37.950> I<00:05:38.130> really

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
right now but at the same time I really

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.890 
right now but at the same time I really
enjoy<00:05:38.700> playing<00:05:38.880> other<00:05:39.120> classes<00:05:39.570> so<00:05:39.600> that's<00:05:39.840> a

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
enjoy playing other classes so that's a

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.380 
enjoy playing other classes so that's a
sacrifice<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.530> am<00:05:40.560> willing<00:05:40.650> to<00:05:41.190> make<00:05:41.340> for<00:05:41.880> the

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
sacrifice I am willing to make for the

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.020 
sacrifice I am willing to make for the
greater<00:05:42.419> good<00:05:42.930> hits<00:05:43.140> it's<00:05:43.500> a<00:05:43.620> lesser<00:05:44.490> evil<00:05:44.669> I

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
greater good hits it's a lesser evil I

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.590 
greater good hits it's a lesser evil I
suppose<00:05:45.360> in<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:45.540> end<00:05:45.710> but<00:05:46.710> unless<00:05:46.979> I<00:05:47.310> do<00:05:48.180> enjoy

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
suppose in the end but unless I do enjoy

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.780 
suppose in the end but unless I do enjoy
getting<00:05:48.960> Hensel<00:05:49.410> is<00:05:49.440> it's<00:05:50.220> a<00:05:50.310> very<00:05:50.520> satisfying

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
getting Hensel is it's a very satisfying

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.880 
getting Hensel is it's a very satisfying
thing<00:05:51.419> to<00:05:51.450> get<00:05:51.810> heads<00:05:52.080> against<00:05:52.530> people<00:05:52.770> that

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
thing to get heads against people that

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.500 
thing to get heads against people that
are<00:05:52.979> better<00:05:53.160> than<00:05:53.250> you<00:05:53.550> even<00:05:54.030> if<00:05:54.300> they<00:05:54.419> are

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
are better than you even if they are

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.940 
are better than you even if they are
lucky<00:05:54.870> but<00:05:54.960> that's<00:05:55.110> that's<00:05:55.320> how<00:05:55.500> it<00:05:55.680> start

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
lucky but that's that's how it start

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.350 
lucky but that's that's how it start
doesn't<00:05:56.220> it<00:05:56.310> like<00:05:56.640> getting<00:05:56.970> that<00:05:57.090> headshot

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
doesn't it like getting that headshot

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.000 
doesn't it like getting that headshot
getting<00:05:57.780> that<00:05:57.930> kill<00:05:58.169> before<00:05:58.530> he<00:05:58.650> kills<00:05:58.919> you

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
getting that kill before he kills you

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.590 
getting that kill before he kills you
because<00:05:59.130> he<00:05:59.370> or<00:05:59.490> she<00:05:59.550> messes<00:06:00.030> up<00:06:00.120> and<00:06:00.300> then<00:06:00.419> you

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
because he or she messes up and then you

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.930 
because he or she messes up and then you
get<00:06:01.229> that<00:06:01.410> if<00:06:02.130> you're<00:06:02.310> that<00:06:02.430> feeling<00:06:02.850> of

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
get that if you're that feeling of

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.430 
get that if you're that feeling of
satisfaction<00:06:03.090> even<00:06:03.630> if<00:06:03.900> they<00:06:04.020> killed<00:06:04.290> you<00:06:04.410> a

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
satisfaction even if they killed you a

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.260 
satisfaction even if they killed you a
hundred<00:06:04.740> times<00:06:05.070> before<00:06:05.280> you<00:06:05.700> still<00:06:06.030> feel

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
hundred times before you still feel

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.670 
hundred times before you still feel
satisfied<00:06:06.780> after<00:06:07.110> getting<00:06:07.350> that<00:06:07.440> one

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
satisfied after getting that one

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.490 
satisfied after getting that one
headshot<00:06:08.250> if<00:06:08.550> they<00:06:08.729> just<00:06:08.910> mess<00:06:09.120> up<00:06:09.320> and<00:06:10.320> that's

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
headshot if they just mess up and that's

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.550 
headshot if they just mess up and that's
very<00:06:11.370> good<00:06:11.640> for<00:06:11.910> your<00:06:12.000> motivation<00:06:12.900> to<00:06:13.020> keep<00:06:13.380> on
