00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 personal hello all right today I will tell you 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.779
 for you a step by step how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.529
 to draw the model of the blouse and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.300
 bell 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.380
 so for this we will need the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.630
 Our long template is I'll leave the link 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.900
 down here I've already taught you how to draw the mold 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.660
 the base of the sleeve and this 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.519
 blouse with the bell mouth and sleeve 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.680
 The bell mouth I'll think you'll 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.390
 do a little dress and I'll leave soon 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.160
 all specified when making a 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.380
 I messed up all the modeling I 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.440
 I worked for not being produce invested 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.050
 in boxing information not even if in the next 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 tutorial how to do okay then I 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.920
 accompanying that soon will be a dress 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.750
 super cool, cute for you could 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.750
 be producing at home let's go there 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.579
 The first step I'm going to take, I'll get it. 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.489
 the fulfillment already a little bigger than 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.860
 my sleeve and we will retrace 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.840
 you already have the base of your long sleeve 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.399
 better even for you to work alone 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.469
 pictures her in another role for us 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.500
 do the interpretation but if you have 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.990
 only with your short line even the people 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.920
 will be retracing her to do 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.920
 interpretation as well 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.400
 Well, I've already portrayed the manga and the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.190
 prolong it is to prolong the line that 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.110
 mark the middle of my band is because 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.690
 it will serve as the basis for finding now 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.659
 my fist and make a long run in 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.880
 That's the one I was thinking. 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.649
 finding the length I want 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:47.640
 For me Amanda I already told me I'm going 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:51.440
 want 50 and leaving 52 centimeters 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.440
 I was injured by my mother. 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.170
 now I'm taking the circumference of 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.659
 my fist 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.659
 I left it for mine 20 centimeters 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.670
 Keep calm and stay until wide and then 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.090
 back to play ten centimeters from 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:14.250
 from straight line 10 to here and 10 to there 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.120
 to give the full circumference of the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.620
 group 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.739
 This is because I'm working with the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.480
 line already open such as 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.329
 had worked with half of the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.100
 would be half the circumference 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:36.120
 of the fist I would play 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:39.450
 Okay, now I'm going to frame a line. 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.840
 I had and I'll call from here 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.410
 to the point that I close my 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.410
 long sleeve 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.190
 My long one stays like this, now I'm going 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.170
 Mark 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.170
 It's from where I want my 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.250
 mother she begins to open okay to make 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.590
 bell mouth 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.440
 so I already told myself on my arm not 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:29.640
 40 cm want is there and here in 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.709
 my fist I measure the circumference and 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.340
 when I want you to want that mouth too 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.950
 Yeah, I left 40cm eyes 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.769
 It was pretty lame so here I am already 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.690
 I have 28 10 for each side so have to 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.640
 have from that outside line more 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.640
 Ten to here and ten more to here. 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.239
 I'm going to make another square here. 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.819
 quad pulled to the point 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.910
 here in the 40 centimeter mark that the 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.150
 son also voted squad one line 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.150
 straight 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.949
 and now I'll connect the points from here I'll go 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.970
 call here and from here to here with a 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:46.210
 gentle curve, so he will not be straight 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:51.930
 here that part was making a neighbor 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:57.070
 I'll see very carefully to pull mec 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.600
 rounded up is doing there 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.550
 first you want to do some 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.550
 correction already easy before 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.490
 now I'll move the pen 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.590
 I lend my long back pain back 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:31.729
 now it folds the middle and this side 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.310
 here the body with it folded and then I 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.169
 open to cut on top because the part of the 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.099
 front and menorca to the top 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.099
 my back so I'll cut right there 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.099
 separated 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:06:03.430
 the ox to not get that much score 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:06.810
 Straight I'll stop here, okay? 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.810
 do not get too weird 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:17.310
 and to give a better trim this sleeve 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:17.310
 I did it, I doubled it. 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:26.080
 I cut it here, you can cut more 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:32.430
 next line and I opened it too 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.430
 This is the layout of the sock so far. 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.370
 you can come only determined 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.259
 point does not necessarily need and until 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.759
 It's up there because I want tomorrow with 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.400
 increased growth 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:47.410
 and then I'm going to take off my tissue so much 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.330
 I want to open here O 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.580
 It gets bigger and bigger than we 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.099
 you can not change the size of our cava 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.599
 It's our boss's up here because 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.389
 it will fit the lacalle 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:00.310
 but the rest he works on 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.690
 he gets softer 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.310
