constantly have the same amount of heat

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.560 
constantly have the same amount of heat
temperature-wise

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
temperature-wise

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.020

can just start from the hair shaft for a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.899 
can just start from the hair shaft for a
scalp<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.680> slowly<00:01:10.250> glide<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.400> over<00:01:11.760> your

and if you notice it just makes my hair
so<00:01:25.659> silky<00:01:26.590> smooth<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.280> shiny<00:01:28.020> doesn't<00:01:29.020> give

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
so silky smooth and shiny doesn't give

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.670 
so silky smooth and shiny doesn't give
that<00:01:29.290> drying<00:01:29.830> feeling<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:31.780> all<00:01:31.930> like<00:01:32.380> it's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
that drying feeling at all like it's

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.240 
that drying feeling at all like it's
literally<00:01:34.830> still<00:01:35.830> soft<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:39.009> it<00:01:39.100> basically

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
literally still soft so it basically

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.820 
literally still soft so it basically
keeps<00:01:40.149> all<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.479> moisture<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.080> your<00:01:41.380> hair

without<00:01:42.240> damaging<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.740> that's<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:45.070> plus

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.730 

and<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.539> repels<00:01:50.100> humidity<00:01:51.100> like<00:01:52.560> no<00:01:53.560> matter

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
and that repels humidity like no matter

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.669 
and that repels humidity like no matter
how<00:01:54.009> hot<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.520> if<00:01:55.060> it's<00:01:55.210> raining<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:56.140> mean<00:01:56.560> my

doing it quick

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.660 
doing it quick
for<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.009> video<00:02:03.130> but<00:02:03.550> you<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.979> kind<00:02:06.190> of<00:02:06.250> get<00:02:06.490> an

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
for the video but you can kind of get an

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.250 
for the video but you can kind of get an
idea<00:02:06.759> how<00:02:07.360> fast<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:08.019> works<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:09.959> know<00:02:10.959> my<00:02:11.080> hair

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
idea how fast it works I know my hair

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.199 
idea how fast it works I know my hair
may<00:02:11.500> look<00:02:11.769> pretty<00:02:11.920> straight<00:02:12.310> as<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.730> before

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
may look pretty straight as it is before

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.630 
may look pretty straight as it is before
I<00:02:13.269> did<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.569> but<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:13.959> really<00:02:14.470> wavy<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.190> mean<00:02:15.580> I

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
I did it but it's really wavy I mean I

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.430 
I did it but it's really wavy I mean I
just<00:02:15.670> kind<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.090> combed<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.510> out<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.350> looks

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
just kind of combed it out so it looks

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.370 
just kind of combed it out so it looks
straight<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.340> mean<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.450> can<00:02:19.630> really<00:02:20.170> tell

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
straight but I mean you can really tell

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.140 
straight but I mean you can really tell
the<00:02:20.470> difference<00:02:21.000> be<00:02:22.000> using<00:02:22.269> this<00:02:22.390> iron<00:02:22.660> I

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
the difference be using this iron I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.970 
the difference be using this iron I
suppose<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.420> opposed<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.930> not<00:02:26.079> using<00:02:26.410> anything

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
suppose as opposed to not using anything

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.259 
suppose as opposed to not using anything
at<00:02:27.100> all<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:29.230> blow<00:02:30.220> drying<00:02:30.579> your<00:02:31.060> hair

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
at all and just blow drying your hair

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:41.370 
at all and just blow drying your hair
out<00:02:36.239> look<00:02:37.239> it's<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:37.630> still<00:02:38.410> shiny<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:40.380> looks

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
out look it's like still shiny and looks

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:50.970 
out look it's like still shiny and looks
healthy<00:02:43.530> it's<00:02:44.530> not<00:02:44.680> damaging<00:02:45.310> at<00:02:45.430> all

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.069 

it<00:02:51.980> basically<00:02:52.280> penetrates<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.510> hair<00:02:53.540> shaft

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
it basically penetrates the hair shaft

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.149 
it basically penetrates the hair shaft
from<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.439> inside<00:02:54.950> out

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
from the inside out

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.630 
from the inside out
so<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.730> constantly<00:02:56.269> get<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.719> same<00:02:56.959> results

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
so you constantly get the same results

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.199 
so you constantly get the same results
and<00:02:58.640> if<00:02:59.329> you<00:02:59.420> look<00:02:59.599> at<00:02:59.840> this<00:03:00.109> side<00:03:01.209> straighten

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
and if you look at this side straighten

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.849 
and if you look at this side straighten

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
kind of wavy a little bit if you can see

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.020 
kind of wavy a little bit if you can see
right<00:03:14.299> here<00:03:14.750> has<00:03:15.230> little<00:03:15.560> few<00:03:16.250> kinks<00:03:16.549> here<00:03:16.849> and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
right here has little few kinks here and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.869 
right here has little few kinks here and
there<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.950> could<00:03:19.129> strain<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.760> in<00:03:19.849> no<00:03:20.030> time<00:03:20.200> I

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
there you could strain it in no time I

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.729 
there you could strain it in no time I
haven't<00:03:22.879> tried<00:03:23.030> curling<00:03:23.629> my<00:03:23.989> hair<00:03:24.019> using<00:03:24.439> this

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
haven't tried curling my hair using this

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.140 
haven't tried curling my hair using this
so<00:03:25.430> I'm<00:03:25.879> not<00:03:26.030> sure<00:03:26.269> right<00:03:26.510> now<00:03:27.849> may<00:03:28.849> not<00:03:28.879> be

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
so I'm not sure right now may not be

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.659 
so I'm not sure right now may not be
successful<00:03:29.359> like<00:03:30.019> how<00:03:30.799> other<00:03:31.069> people<00:03:31.430> do<00:03:31.639> it

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
successful like how other people do it

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:37.479 
successful like how other people do it
