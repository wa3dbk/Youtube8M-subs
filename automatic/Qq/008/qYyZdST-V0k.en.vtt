00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.440 
absolutely yeah of course you know I
wouldn't<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.670> signed<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.210> didn't

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
wouldn't have signed here if I didn't

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.050 
wouldn't have signed here if I didn't
think<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.630> I'm<00:01:40.460> like<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> think

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
think that I'm like you know I think

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.340 
think that I'm like you know I think
it'll<00:01:42.240> stand<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> next<00:01:42.990> year<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> guess

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
it'll stand to the next year I guess

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.870 
it'll stand to the next year I guess
it's<00:01:43.530> hard<00:01:43.649> near<00:01:43.950> when<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.250> lose<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> final

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
it's hard near when you lose the final

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.550 
it's hard near when you lose the final
but<00:01:45.030> look<00:01:45.659> they've<00:01:45.840> been<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.439> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
but look they've been there then all it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
but look they've been there then all it
takes<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.340> no<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.640> needs<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> do<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
takes and then it no one needs to do to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.940 
takes and then it no one needs to do to
get<00:01:48.329> over<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.540> line<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.799> must

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
get over the line you know and you must

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.050 
get over the line you know and you must
be<00:01:50.040> impressed<00:01:50.189> with<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> strength<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.880> depth

of<00:03:20.980> course<00:03:21.220> yeah<00:03:21.430> sure<00:03:21.730> best<00:03:22.269> team<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.480> Europe

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
of course yeah sure best team in Europe

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.960 
of course yeah sure best team in Europe
at<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.959> moment<00:03:23.319> so<00:03:23.470> hope<00:03:24.430> they're<00:03:24.609> too<00:03:24.790> long

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
at the moment so hope they're too long

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.780 
at the moment so hope they're too long
and<00:03:25.440> look<00:03:26.440> they<00:03:26.920> set<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.250> bar<00:03:27.430> for<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.670> last

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
and look they set the bar for the last

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.190 
and look they set the bar for the last
couple<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:28.060> years<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.540> suppose<00:03:28.750> allowed<00:03:29.049> to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
couple of years and suppose allowed to

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.440 
couple of years and suppose allowed to
be<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.980> bit<00:03:30.430> annoyed<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.819> happen<00:03:31.120> last<00:03:31.269> year

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
be a bit annoyed to happen last year

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.120 
be a bit annoyed to happen last year
they<00:03:31.660> lost<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.959> finals<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:32.560> it's<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.040> good

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
they lost the finals so it's a good

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.500 
they lost the finals so it's a good
chance<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.549> play<00:03:33.700> them<00:03:33.850> again<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.120> know<00:03:34.329> and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
chance to play them again you know and

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.650
