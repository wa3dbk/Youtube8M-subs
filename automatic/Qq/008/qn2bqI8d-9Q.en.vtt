but has a lot of influences and it's
it's<00:06:19.789> a<00:06:19.879> good<00:06:20.120> game<00:06:20.270> it's<00:06:20.479> very<00:06:20.810> underrated<00:06:21.710> I

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
it's a good game it's very underrated I

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.200 
it's a good game it's very underrated I
believe<00:06:22.490> that<00:06:22.520> this<00:06:23.419> game<00:06:24.189> actually<00:06:25.189> has<00:06:26.029> a

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
believe that this game actually has a

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.809 
believe that this game actually has a
lot<00:06:26.509> of<00:06:26.539> potential<00:06:26.960> just<00:06:27.529> no<00:06:28.069> one<00:06:28.219> is<00:06:28.430> online<00:06:28.610> I

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
lot of potential just no one is online I

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:29.980 
lot of potential just no one is online I
think<00:06:28.909> there's<00:06:29.180> like<00:06:29.240> a<00:06:29.330> thousand<00:06:29.840> people

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
think there's like a thousand people

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.200 
think there's like a thousand people
online<00:06:30.319> and<00:06:30.620> when<00:06:30.740> i<00:06:30.770> was<00:06:30.949> playing<00:06:31.210> which

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
online and when i was playing which

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.550 
online and when i was playing which
isn't<00:06:32.960> actually<00:06:33.259> that<00:06:33.469> much<00:06:33.770> but<00:06:34.669> for<00:06:34.909> a<00:06:35.150> game

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
isn't actually that much but for a game

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.890 
isn't actually that much but for a game
that's<00:06:36.560> as<00:06:36.919> polished<00:06:37.430> as<00:06:37.430> this<00:06:38.060> game<00:06:38.300> is<00:06:38.360> i

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
that's as polished as this game is i

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.830 
that's as polished as this game is i
think<00:06:38.930> it<00:06:39.169> got<00:06:39.610> reviews<00:06:40.610> around<00:06:40.969> the<00:06:41.150> 9<00:06:41.419> mark

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840
