00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and I was really hoping that would be

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.609 
and I was really hoping that would be
explosive<00:00:30.330> rounds<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.779> Mustang<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.289> sally's

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

straight up it's sucks that was
obviously<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> other<00:00:38.520> option<00:00:38.940> either<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
obviously the other option either that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.360 
obviously the other option either that
would<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.170> really<00:00:40.379> cool<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.800> explosives

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
time I was on solo just getting as many

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.310 
time I was on solo just getting as many
points<00:01:14.880> as<00:01:15.090> possible<00:01:15.150> upgrading<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.020> weapon

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
lot it's so much damage that it does the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.880 
lot it's so much damage that it does the
LMGs<00:01:30.659> don't<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.409> nearly<00:01:31.740> enough

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
LMGs don't really do like nearly enough

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.160 
LMGs don't really do like nearly enough
damage<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> IMR<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.659> print<00:01:33.990> its<00:01:34.110> own

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
damage but the IMR can print its own

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.480 
damage but the IMR can print its own

again<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> wasn't<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.450> low<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
again I wasn't so low on this one so the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.080 
again I wasn't so low on this one so the
connection<00:02:04.649> was<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> bit<00:02:05.009> better<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.939> might

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
connection was a bit better and it might

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.370 
connection was a bit better and it might
be<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> little<00:02:06.420> bit<00:02:06.570> biased<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.020> sense<00:02:07.229> but

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
be a little bit biased in that sense but

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.900 
be a little bit biased in that sense but
