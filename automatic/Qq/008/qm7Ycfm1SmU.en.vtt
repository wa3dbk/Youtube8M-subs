the<00:00:11.160> skid<00:00:11.519> recovery<00:00:11.969> for<00:00:12.179> us<00:00:12.300> which<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.750> can

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
the skid recovery for us which you can

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.010 
the skid recovery for us which you can
turn<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.980> ABS<00:00:14.910> that's<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.420> as<00:00:15.570> well<00:00:15.750> on

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
turn on and the ABS that's on as well on

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.680 
turn on and the ABS that's on as well on
number<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.740> both<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.820> those<00:00:17.910> help<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.449> quite

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
number one both of those help you quite

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.470 
number one both of those help you quite
a<00:00:18.720> bit<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.920> suggest<00:00:20.340> turning<00:00:20.880> both<00:00:21.240> those

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
a bit so I suggest turning both those

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.170 
a bit so I suggest turning both those
things<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:22.460> unless<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.670> want<00:00:23.850> over<00:00:24.060> your

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
things on unless you want over your

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.880 
things on unless you want over your
challenge<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:25.500> need<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.430> 204<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:28.019> get<00:00:28.170> gold<00:00:28.820> and

challenge you need a 204 to get gold and
to<00:00:31.890> pass<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> test<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.669> need<00:00:32.820> about<00:00:32.940> 210<00:00:33.600> I've

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
to pass the test you need about 210 I've

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.889 
to pass the test you need about 210 I've
got<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.079> 59<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> run<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> I'm<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.780> going

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
got one 59 on this run so I'm just going

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.900 
got one 59 on this run so I'm just going
to<00:00:36.960> run<00:00:37.170> through<00:00:37.200> how<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> did<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.890> still<00:00:38.760> not

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
to run through how I did that still not

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180 
to run through how I did that still not
getting<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.120> most<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.540> car<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:41.040> the

getting the most out the car but on the
pit<00:00:41.370> lane<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:42.210> sure<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.390> turn<00:00:42.629> left<00:00:42.840> or

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
pit lane just be sure to turn left or

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.299 
pit lane just be sure to turn left or
they'll<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.290> otherwise<00:00:43.530> you'll<00:00:43.770> hit<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
they'll be otherwise you'll hit the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.060 
they'll be otherwise you'll hit the
right<00:00:44.460> hand<00:00:44.700> side<00:00:44.989> already<00:00:45.989> searched<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
right hand side already searched for the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.330 
right hand side already searched for the
braking<00:00:47.430> spot<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> hundred<00:00:48.570> meter<00:00:48.600> mark

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
braking spot it's the hundred meter mark

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.619 
braking spot it's the hundred meter mark
cut<00:00:50.340> across<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> chicane<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.270> much<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
cut across the chicane as much as you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
cut across the chicane as much as you
can<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.110> attract<00:00:53.039> tends<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.520> sort<00:00:53.699> of

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
can and attract tends to be sort of

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.389 
can and attract tends to be sort of
where<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> walls<00:00:54.180> are<00:00:54.680> just<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.219> comes

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
where the walls are just when it comes

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.880 
where the walls are just when it comes
to<00:00:56.550> chicanes<00:00:57.079> it's<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.320> quite<00:00:58.469> forgiving

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
to chicanes it's really quite forgiving

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.950 
to chicanes it's really quite forgiving
you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.340> cut<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.820> completely<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you can just cut it completely and you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590 
you can just cut it completely and you
can<00:01:01.109> maintain<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.770> much<00:01:01.949> speed<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
can maintain so much speed so with that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.539 
can maintain so much speed so with that
one<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.140> go<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:04.769> 200<00:01:05.159> miles<00:01:05.309> an<00:01:05.430> hour

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
one you can go up at 200 miles an hour

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.300 
one you can go up at 200 miles an hour
through<00:01:05.760> there<00:01:06.049> this<00:01:07.049> corner<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.530> well<00:01:07.740> nearly

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
through there this corner as well nearly

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.870 
through there this corner as well nearly
200<00:01:08.549> miles<00:01:08.970> an<00:01:09.119> hour<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.840> again<00:01:10.430> about<00:01:11.430> 200

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
200 miles an hour and again about 200

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.450 
200 miles an hour and again about 200
miles<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.240> every<00:01:12.540> year<00:01:12.979> it's<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.159> got<00:01:14.280> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
miles now every year it's just got so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.010 
miles now every year it's just got so
much<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:14.939> us<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> struggle<00:01:15.900> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
much down for us that the struggle of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
much down for us that the struggle of
this<00:01:16.170> car<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.470> actually<00:01:16.619> turning<00:01:17.240> fast<00:01:18.240> enough

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this car is actually turning fast enough

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.640 
this car is actually turning fast enough
particularly<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.590> you're<00:01:19.680> using<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.009> wheel<00:01:20.390> and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
particularly if you're using a wheel and

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.630 
particularly if you're using a wheel and
control<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> users<00:01:23.040> don't<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
control the users don't have that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.200 
control the users don't have that
problem<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.180> badly<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.750> turn<00:01:25.640> it's<00:01:26.640> turning

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
problem so badly but turn it's turning

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.020 
problem so badly but turn it's turning
at<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:27.540> point<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.170> well<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.369> very

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
at the right point as well it's a very

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.120 
at the right point as well it's a very
very<00:01:30.390> tricky<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.049> turn<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.439> exactly<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> right

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
very tricky to turn it exactly the right

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
very tricky to turn it exactly the right
point<00:01:32.400> I'm<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.030> being<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.810> accurate

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
point I'm not really being as accurate

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.130 
point I'm not really being as accurate
as<00:01:34.380> I'd<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.479> it's<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> speed

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
as I'd like here but it's just the speed

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.929 
as I'd like here but it's just the speed
everything<00:01:37.890> happens<00:01:38.250> you'll<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.549> get<00:01:38.670> blown

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
everything happens you'll just get blown

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
everything happens you'll just get blown
away<00:01:39.119> completely<00:01:39.509> by<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> speed<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
away completely by the speed so the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.730 
away completely by the speed so the
first<00:01:41.040> lap<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> high<00:01:42.509> 101<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.470> think

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
first lap was a high 101 there I think

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.270 
first lap was a high 101 there I think
it<00:01:43.829> was<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.869> break<00:01:46.229> at<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> 150<00:01:47.340> meter<00:01:47.520> marker

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
it was so break at the 150 meter marker

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.460 
it was so break at the 150 meter marker
without<00:01:50.280> turning<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.700> little<00:01:50.790> bit<00:01:51.000> too<00:01:51.149> much

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
without turning a little bit too much

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.380 
without turning a little bit too much
here<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> slight<00:01:53.520> mistake<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
here so I slight mistake there on the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
here so I slight mistake there on the
left-hand<00:01:54.659> side<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.259> then<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.790> just

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
left-hand side but then it's it's just

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.249 
left-hand side but then it's it's just
the<00:01:57.060> sheer<00:01:57.240> speed<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.750> everything<00:01:58.110> that's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the sheer speed that everything that's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:58.820 
the sheer speed that everything that's
happening

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
happening

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.900 
happening
this<00:01:58.950> car<00:01:59.220> really<00:01:59.840> doesn't<00:02:00.840> let<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.700> make<00:02:02.700> any

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
this car really doesn't let you make any

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.530 
this car really doesn't let you make any
mistakes<00:02:03.390> tool<00:02:04.550> it's<00:02:05.550> very<00:02:06.060> very<00:02:06.480> difficult

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
mistakes tool it's very very difficult

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.770 
mistakes tool it's very very difficult
to<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.230> just<00:02:07.710> pinpoint<00:02:07.980> accurate<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:09.570> a<00:02:09.600> little

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
to be just pinpoint accurate go a little

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.960 
to be just pinpoint accurate go a little
bit<00:02:09.960> wide<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:11.660> but<00:02:12.860> breaking<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.790> get

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
bit wide there but breaking you can get

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.580 
bit wide there but breaking you can get
away<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.270> breaking<00:02:15.480> really<00:02:16.230> really<00:02:16.410> late

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
away with breaking really really late

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.430 
away with breaking really really late
with<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:16.980> car<00:02:18.020> particularly<00:02:19.020> for<00:02:19.200> these

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
with this car particularly for these

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.680 
with this car particularly for these
fast<00:02:20.100> turns<00:02:20.460> through<00:02:20.850> here<00:02:21.090> because<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.480> can

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
fast turns through here because you can

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.440 
fast turns through here because you can
then<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:23.520> can<00:02:23.640> take<00:02:23.790> them<00:02:23.910> at<00:02:24.060> such<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> high

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
then you can take them at such a high

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.300 
then you can take them at such a high
speed<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.440> you're<00:02:25.560> breaking<00:02:25.920> from<00:02:26.070> maybe

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
speed so you're breaking from maybe

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.210 
speed so you're breaking from maybe
about<00:02:26.750> 260<00:02:27.750> down<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.110> how<00:02:28.170> about<00:02:28.350> 200<00:02:28.860> s<00:02:28.980> your

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
about 260 down to how about 200 s your

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.330 
about 260 down to how about 200 s your
little<00:02:30.000> bits<00:02:30.150> there<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:32.190> trying

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
little bits there and then just trying

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.760 
little bits there and then just trying
to<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.520> neat<00:02:32.700> on<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.480> exit<00:02:33.960> via<00:02:34.380> or<00:02:34.590> not

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
to be neat on the on the exit via or not

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.320 
to be neat on the on the exit via or not
you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.130> maintain<00:02:35.340> quite<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> lot<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.090> speed

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
you can maintain quite a lot of speed

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.130 
you can maintain quite a lot of speed
just<00:02:36.780> by<00:02:36.990> being<00:02:37.230> neat<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:38.700> lap<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:40.310> 57

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
just by being neat so that lap is a 57

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.270 
just by being neat so that lap is a 57
so<00:02:43.140> I'm<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.440> going<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> show<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:43.980> from<00:02:44.160> a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
so I'm just going to show it now from a

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.980 
so I'm just going to show it now from a
different<00:02:44.670> angle<00:02:44.820> just<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.570> people<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.959> see

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
different angle just so people can see

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.650 
different angle just so people can see
two<00:02:46.350> over<00:02:46.650> whereabouts<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.180> track<00:02:48.450> at

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
two over whereabouts and the track at

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.590 
two over whereabouts and the track at
different<00:02:48.959> times<00:02:49.820> so<00:02:50.820> just<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.090> clarify<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.510> few

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
different times so just to clarify a few

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.810 
different times so just to clarify a few
things<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.650> breaking<00:02:53.190> because<00:02:53.670> you

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
things that the breaking because you

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.730 
things that the breaking because you
traveling<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.390> fast<00:02:54.720> instead<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.290> writing<00:02:55.470> so

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
traveling so fast instead of writing so

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.760 
traveling so fast instead of writing so
tense<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.510> get<00:02:57.660> your<00:02:57.840> breaking<00:02:58.290> right

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
tense to to get your breaking right

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.070 
tense to to get your breaking right
you've<00:02:59.040> got<00:02:59.070> set<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.550> milliseconds<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.600> you

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
you've got set of milliseconds and you

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.740 
you've got set of milliseconds and you
gotta<00:03:01.320> get<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:02.610> exactly<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.330> right<00:03:03.510> min<00:03:03.720> a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
gotta get just exactly the right min a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.720 
gotta get just exactly the right min a
second<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.440> be<00:03:04.920> very<00:03:05.040> careful<00:03:05.340> with<00:03:05.580> your

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
second so be very careful with your

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.390 
second so be very careful with your
breaking<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.660> turn<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.680> even<00:03:07.920> worse<00:03:08.100> I

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
breaking but the turn in is even worse I

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.270 
breaking but the turn in is even worse I
mean<00:03:08.900> I've<00:03:09.900> turned<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.650> little<00:03:11.040> bit<00:03:11.160> too

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
mean I've turned in a little bit too

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.100 
mean I've turned in a little bit too
early<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.670> few<00:03:11.910> times<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.480> just<00:03:12.810> hit<00:03:12.989> you

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
early a few times and just hit you

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.350 
early a few times and just hit you
inside<00:03:13.410> look<00:03:13.650> particularly<00:03:14.130> here<00:03:14.550> very<00:03:15.180> easy

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
inside look particularly here very easy

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.990 
inside look particularly here very easy
today<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.709> if<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.860> happens<00:03:17.280> then<00:03:17.550> you'll

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
today so if that happens then you'll

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.690 
today so if that happens then you'll
just<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.420> restart<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:20.040> very<00:03:20.580> very

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
just have to restart it so very very

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.870 
just have to restart it so very very
difficult<00:03:21.450> just<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.760> really<00:03:23.760> really

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
difficult just to be really really

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.790 
difficult just to be really really
accurate<00:03:24.390> but<00:03:24.570> that's<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.019> square<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.530> car

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
accurate but that's the square this car

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.449 
accurate but that's the square this car
room<00:03:26.130> gives<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.269> lot<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.600> speed<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.110> mean

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
room gives you a lot of the speed I mean

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.070 
room gives you a lot of the speed I mean
it<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:29.730> does<00:03:30.000> reward<00:03:30.450> brave<00:03:30.930> driving<00:03:31.739> so

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
it really does reward brave driving so

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.710 
it really does reward brave driving so
you'd<00:03:34.080> be<00:03:34.230> surprised<00:03:34.530> how<00:03:34.560> much<00:03:35.450> time<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.690> can

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
you'd be surprised how much time you can

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.990 
you'd be surprised how much time you can
get<00:03:37.019> at<00:03:37.140> this<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.590> love<00:03:37.830> even<00:03:38.070> what<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.280> think

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
get at this I love even what I think

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.900 
get at this I love even what I think
what<00:03:39.360> i<00:03:39.390> could<00:03:39.510> do<00:03:40.320> around<00:03:40.500> here<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.130> manage

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
what i could do around here if I manage

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.040 
what i could do around here if I manage
to<00:03:42.000> get<00:03:42.300> everything<00:03:42.570> just<00:03:42.870> right<00:03:44.870> but<00:03:45.870> there's

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
to get everything just right but there's

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.770 
to get everything just right but there's
definitely<00:03:46.200> more<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:48.390> isn't<00:03:48.570> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
definitely more in this this isn't the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.420 
definitely more in this this isn't the
fastest<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.410> can<00:03:49.530> be<00:03:49.620> done<00:03:49.769> by<00:03:50.010> any<00:03:50.160> means

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
fastest that can be done by any means

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.910 
fastest that can be done by any means
I'll<00:03:50.640> just

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
I'll just
