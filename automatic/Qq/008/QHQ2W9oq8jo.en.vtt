 comments here down like videos 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.730
 they want you to do but comment fast 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:49.079
 before the happy good day is over 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.520
 christmas although yes merry christmas a little 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.570
 late and good was the prosperous new year 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:02.810
 well let's continue today I could 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:07.580
 make another day equally 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.460
 how to make a phone again but 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.619
 This will be different 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.619
 sorry for the chain you are placing 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.729
 if it's going to be different in fact these 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.730
 you can find them in your 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.980
 home 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.100
 good are three materials apart 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:37.170
 use nothing else and well then let's start 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.920
 The first thing you will need is what 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.920
 is 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.229
 levels 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.509
 Carlton left me with the cardboard of the video 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.530
 what did I do yesterday how to make phones 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:58.360
 here abajito I leave the link 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.270
 and well they will also use again 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.420
 resist 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.939
 Y 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.250
 because this activity is super easy to 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.289
 do it since then some things 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.500
 can find when they go to 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.010
 Telcel turn off your phone or several other 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.880
 things 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.780
 I went yesterday to cover him by a telephone 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:28.040
 my mom who was new and they gave me 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.040
 a brochure with several phones then 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.580
 and this one does not compare it so much then 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.040
 leave me in the short I'll tell you 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.020
 why I'm not going to occupy it because it's 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.080
 on the side and will always be on the side 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.570
 well I do it like this even though the iphone is not 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.970
 you will notice here nothing nothing nothing the 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.160
 circulito and I can not even see 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.250
 then this one I would say is not a 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.610
 good alcohol then I tell them they're going to 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.870
 occupy telefonito chiquitos these the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.660
 you can find in any 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.600
 site where they provide 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.330
 where 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.900
 buy phones come and put them as 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.050
 in telcel 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.150
 unefon 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.910
 and well, other several brands of 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.150
 phones 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.390
 I went to Telcel and they gave me this 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.490
 it was a soft one throwing you big a 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:30.470
 large brochure so then if the 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:33.440
 cuts all already good the first step 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.230
 would you choose your phone in this 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.420
 case I'm going to choose this 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.050
 and then they're going to cut it out wright 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.390
 they are not going to cut very very very very well and 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.750
 they are going to be careful before cutting it 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.920
 because it is so if they cut it badly or not 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.920
 you do something 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.030
 in this case you need patience and if 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.840
 they are angry better not do it and 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.310
 keep it because if you are not going to cut it 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.310
 with the scissors the purpose 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.780
 they are going to break it 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:31.750
 and I want to send a greeting to the 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.750
 Polynesians 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.980
 to reason to fall in English reads because I am 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.910
 your biggest fan if you follow me down here 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:48.249
 comment the masters I love them very much 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:51.359
 three do not stop making videos because they are 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.359
 the most 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.220
 I am 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.710
 you already because the phone came out more or 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.460
 less like that but I did not like this 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.460
 shore then 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.340
 when they hear to cut the little things 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.340
 little 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.070
 be very careful 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:25.010
 well the next step is that they are going to 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.289
 cut a piece of cardboard the size 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.860
 of the telephone 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.129
 here I already have a good one like my cardboard 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.689
 It is very hard, I put the cardboard 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.689
 glue to stick the phone 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.400
 when it's dry, trim it 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.740
 just like that 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.770
 and well after sticking it 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.740
 we finish with this simple activity 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.320
 who already saw that yourselves that 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.530
 they are very simple to make 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.180
 and it takes little time and well, that's how it is 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.180
 how it is on the phone 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.380
 and then later if I'm going to cover anything 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.570
 more than like right now I do not have plastic 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.460
 the stationery is in the corner but 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.460
 where I karl then I will go to another 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:24.249
 we can cover it when it finishes 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:27.029
 they have in their house 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:27.029
 well 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.259
 I dont know 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.900
 yes in his plastic house that 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:37.380
 leave lining up so that when you 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:40.410
 stick in the lp that does not take off 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.960
 and well, after you can 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.699
 make decorations or whatever I do in 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.160
 this case I liked how it looked like this 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.560
 then so as not to ruin it 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.249
 and well with this with this 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.959
 finished 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:55.449
