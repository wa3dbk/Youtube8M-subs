probably talk about that later on it's
just<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.450> lot<00:04:19.600> of<00:04:19.660> ideas<00:04:19.840> are<00:04:20.170> running<00:04:20.590> in<00:04:20.709> my

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
just a lot of ideas are running in my

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:21.990 
just a lot of ideas are running in my
head<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.190> hopefully<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.489> don't<00:04:21.579> forget<00:04:21.880> about

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
head and hopefully I don't forget about

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.310 
head and hopefully I don't forget about
them<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.540> this<00:04:22.690> is<00:04:22.810> why<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.960> need<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.170> write

them<00:04:23.470> down<00:04:23.500> because<00:04:23.800> if<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.070> don't<00:04:24.130> write<00:04:24.460> them

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
them down because if I don't write them

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.160 
them down because if I don't write them
down<00:04:24.640> that's<00:04:25.240> when<00:04:25.390> I<00:04:25.540> forget<00:04:25.840> about<00:04:25.960> these

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170
