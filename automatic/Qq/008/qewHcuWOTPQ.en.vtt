00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 what happens families or unfair in 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.710
 Welcome back to my channel and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.560
 Welcome back to Friday with 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.389
 see good to Saturday with worse 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.010
 for those who do not know it good yesterday I 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.480
 you were wondering why not 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 you go up Friday to see what happens 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.580
 Yes, yesterday was very bad indeed 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.650
 Today I'm still bad but well I'm already a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.230
 little better this morning so I was 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.400
 pretty pretty bad but 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.410
 good throughout the day I'm gone 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.029
 recovering and good yesterday I made the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.260
 direct from 'dragon ball' but see if not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.260
 you have seen it, you can see it 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.800
 and well, basically, I did not go up on Friday 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.900
 with duty that's why he was bad like that 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.490
 Good thing I upload today there were also 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.210
 a little bit late so forgive me for 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.879
 that and good 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.800
 this week they have brought us as you will be 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.690
 seeing in the video title the system 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.260
 of 'night and day' well this is a theme 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 in which the duty team said that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.210
 I went to work once I was studying 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.980
 the game officially released I am is 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.930
 the server running is worth it because this 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.839
 it is one of the new things that he wants 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.129
 implement the team to see what good 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.290
 because in the original 'must' it is not 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.880
 implemented so good they 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.680
 they want to release and well they are 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.200
 Working on it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.630
 and well, basically, they have left us 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.860
 a video is very short 20 seconds 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 showing us how it is done by day and 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.290
 night basically not more is not 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.090
 what the good video is like 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.760
 you already know me I do not like 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.740
 put the video here on my channel because 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.680
 well I prefer not to do it simply 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.780
 I take it sometimes as I have done 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.440
 rooster has left me 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.810
 I take pictures then screenshots of what is 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.910
 the video and imported them into my video voucher 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.740
 so then in this video you go to 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.080
 have a couple of images is worth the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.850
 video but as always I tell you I leave you 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.040
 in the description of this video worth 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.590
 you have the link of the original video of the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.149
 team duty this link 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.740
 video although the verona team has 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.890
 put this video in hidden do not tell me 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.810
 because the page is now seen there 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.910
 put or publicly so I think 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.550
 that there will not be any kind of problem like that 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.459
 what good said what told you said you know 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.410
 I leave the link of the video in the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.450
 description you already know that you can always 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.000
 register on the worst page 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.920
 to know all the news before and 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.430
 well let's start with this Friday 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.040
 with worst 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.689
 and says well this week we've been 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.879
 trying a bit the day system and 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.219
 night though we said no today 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.170
 let's focus on new things in 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:35.319
 new things forgive me until the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.629
 server was launched worth up 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.159
 that the game good until it was 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.530
 officially released is worth studying 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.319
 the game in official operation and 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.689
 well they say that apart this week they have 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.030
 been working on the infrastructure 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.549
 of the server since a bad server 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.900
 it would not be a fun server then 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.359
 when we say that what they tell us in 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.709
 this message is how good is it 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.239
 trying a little bit of the day system and 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.010
 night and they have also been 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.540
 working on the infrastructure of 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.129
 server I imagine good because they are left 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.829
 now they have been and setting things up 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.870
 of the server to optimize it and go 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.750
 well obviously they have to do it is 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.879
 obvious so well let's see the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.159
 first pictures is good as you are 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.959
 seeing the first picture on the screen 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.790
 two first photos that you are going to see are 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.219
 screenshots I've made of the video 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.769
 so it's good, well, basically 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:26.079
 you are seeing how he has a 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.579
 machine book and good good ma jin wook 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.060
 what do I say is a good rabbit is a 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.800
 corner 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.730
 you already know what is rabbits 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.440
 never better said and well it is there 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.810
 I do not know exactly where you were 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.520
 that you already know that you know a thousand 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.160
 times more than I on the 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.630
 tebeo locations so good 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.519
 putting in the comments where you think 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.610
 what is and well then as we see is 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.700
 being made of day basically and good not 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.410
 doing it is not day or evening 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.510
 and in the next photo, we see how 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.120
 it gets completely dark and it becomes 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.440
 night the truth that this gives quite 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.060
 naturalness so to speak to the game well 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.650
 that will be interesting the truth 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.470
 imagine that we are there I know 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.150
 fighting a duel and suddenly it's done 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.500
 at night and only the rain would be 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.209
 that it was a good epic duel both 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.479
 following photos are those that have 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.630
 posted the duty team is worth it 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.240
 let's go to them to see the 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.900
 next picture good, it's still here 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.729
 the head with the good rabbit friend is a 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.280
 ma jin for what I see but has as 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.569
 putting on a rabbit skin or a 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.750
 Those shit I do not remember how it gets 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.880
 call good yet you know your is what 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.039
 that I've said before and well it 's 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.009
 in the watchtower is here with our 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.330
 friend of the kitten there with that cane that 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.870
 besides that cane I already have it in the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.000
 Chinese bears so good not much more 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.069
 to clarify in this good picture we see that 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.440
 it is obviously day and in the next 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.479
 picture, so they put a picture that we already 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.520
 they put I want to remember that this photo 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.949
 they already put it in a previous one 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.780
 Friday to see how good it looks 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.440

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.639
 paints well and well there the moon in the background 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.979
 at night the truth that looks very nice 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.139
 I already said it on your day when I saw this picture 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.680
 and it is very beautiful or really is 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.710
 aesthetically it is very cool but good 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.750
 well, now 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.010
 I'm going to tell you good after 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.840

 happy to hear you 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.310
 opinions as I said earlier 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.890
 You can go to the forum to comment on what has 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.900
 similar to giving your opinions to 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.250
 tell them what you want them to upload etc. 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.990
 I always tell you to register on the web 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.910
 for more information and good more 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.289
 interaction with what the team would be 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.149
 of duty 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.789
 well now I will say my opinion 

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:42.050
 it's basically good yes this time I do not know 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.490
 have shown a video worth in this 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.229
 Friday with the door as it has been a 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.939
 video a 20-second video that does not 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.800
 it's bad, it's a video at least 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:50.300
 it's nothing but good I'm still waiting 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.610
 Boys 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.740
 to see if they show us I would like the 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.050
 true that they did it to you maybe it sounds 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.699
 for me or for me it seems like a thing 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.469
 important the best for us is a 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.259
 foolishness but I would like a 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.729
 day duty equipment will say good 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.399
 to catch and I'll do a live come 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.349
 a live on youtube of doing things 

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:11.240
 in the game so we can see how it goes 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:14.300
 is the game is worth so that we see power 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.069
 Well, how is the issue going? 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.689
 the server is still not good and that's why 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.899
 they take things from us because it's that you're 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:22.789
 things that is really I say to you not 

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:25.420
 it does nothing to me so I hope 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:28.480
 really deeply 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.670
 and that they get, I do not know if something happens that 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.850
 fix soon 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.440
 or that if they are not yet so advanced that 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.760
 they can move forward as soon as possible, I know 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.460
 that we can not throw anything on him 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.350
 I always tell you not, but fuck, I do not know 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.200
 me this falls short of me 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:47.710
 truth and I want some mambo 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.750
 I want I want salt or things 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.880
 show me that the game is advanced 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:57.070
 and something else I do not want anything else I'm going to 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.220
 Sincerely, I'm not worth it, do not tell me 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.660
 enough good this is my opinion as 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.430
 I always tell you, no, we can not be in 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.070
 nothing on the face, just good, I think 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.810
 this and obviously I'm not going to throw 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.120
 face because there's no need to do it or 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.640
 I have motives in fact so good and 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.200
 As I always tell you, I 'm actually 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.240
 very grateful to the bert team for 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.030
 be working again in this game 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.110
 fuck that is is wonderful fucking well 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:24.000
 what good as I always tell you - it's nothing 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.920
 we know that someone is working to 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.850
 bring the game back and it's the 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.360
 hope that we have 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.370
 - It would be that we did not know anything that
