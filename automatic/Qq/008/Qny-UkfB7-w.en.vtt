00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.730 
and I'll let you guys look at it for so
it<00:01:48.240> basically<00:01:48.390> allows<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> jump<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it basically allows me to jump up to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
it basically allows me to jump up to
four<00:01:49.950> times<00:01:50.159> being<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.390> my<00:01:51.689> first<00:01:51.899> jump<00:01:52.200> is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
four times being that my first jump is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.850 
four times being that my first jump is
my<00:01:52.530> normal<00:01:52.590> everyday<00:01:52.979> jump

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
my normal everyday jump

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.740 
my normal everyday jump
that<00:01:54.130> every<00:01:54.460> class<00:01:54.670> has<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.270> then<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.720> other

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
that every class has and then the other

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.650 
that every class has and then the other
three<00:01:56.200> come<00:01:56.410> from<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.950> delivery<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:58.000> little

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
three come from the delivery a little

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.720 
three come from the delivery a little
quick<00:01:58.840> tip<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.230> it<00:01:59.680> jumps<00:02:00.070> about<00:02:00.190> twice<00:02:00.490> as

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
quick tip is it jumps about twice as

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.410 
quick tip is it jumps about twice as
high<00:02:00.970> as<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.950> Enderdragon<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.730> the<00:02:03.970> which<00:02:04.150> class

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
high as a Enderdragon so the which class

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.190 
high as a Enderdragon so the which class
on<00:02:04.630> anything<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:07.150> also<00:02:07.330> gets<00:02:07.570> sure<00:02:07.750> missed<00:02:07.990> one

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
on anything it also gets sure missed one

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.600 
on anything it also gets sure missed one
on<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.440> week<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:08.830> it's<00:02:08.979> like<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.490> like

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
on the week so it's like this is like

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.600 
on the week so it's like this is like
the<00:02:09.729> weakest<00:02:10.060> melee<00:02:10.600> ever<00:02:10.770> uh-huh<00:02:11.770> I<00:02:12.070> have

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
the weakest melee ever uh-huh I have

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.790 
the weakest melee ever uh-huh I have
think<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:13.090> only<00:02:13.300> 12<00:02:13.540> times<00:02:13.780> with<00:02:14.620> them

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
think it's only 12 times with them

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.860 
think it's only 12 times with them
regenerating<00:02:15.460> house<00:02:15.640> until<00:02:15.970> them<00:02:18.690> he<00:02:19.690> said

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
that's just as bad ah see okay let's see

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.760 
that's just as bad ah see okay let's see
what<00:02:24.880> else<00:02:25.000> do<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.240> have<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.570> have<00:02:25.720> ten<00:02:26.050> harming

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
what else do I have I have ten harming

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.910 
what else do I have I have ten harming
potions<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.690> harming<00:02:28.690> potions<00:02:29.020> their<00:02:29.650> level

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
potions of harming potions their level

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.590 
potions of harming potions their level
two<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:30.370> they<00:02:30.580> do<00:02:30.640> quite<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> bit<00:02:31.090> damaged<00:02:31.480> you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
two so they do quite a bit damaged you

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.630 
two so they do quite a bit damaged you
keep<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.080> hits<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.650> ductile<00:02:32.950> I'd<00:02:33.370> say<00:02:33.550> it

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
keep and hits on the ductile I'd say it

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.860 
keep and hits on the ductile I'd say it
probably<00:02:33.880> takes<00:02:33.970> about<00:02:34.060> three<00:02:34.600> or<00:02:34.630> four

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
probably takes about three or four

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.530 
probably takes about three or four
ghosting<00:02:35.380> skills<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:35.709> them<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.880> got<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> splash

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
ghosting skills on them you got a splash

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.670 
ghosting skills on them you got a splash
of<00:02:37.690> poison<00:02:39.390> these<00:02:40.390> are<00:02:40.540> 33<00:02:40.959> seconds<00:02:41.260> long<00:02:41.440> so

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
of poison these are 33 seconds long so

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.770 
of poison these are 33 seconds long so
they<00:02:42.040> can<00:02:42.190> do<00:02:42.370> some<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.790> does<00:02:43.270> if<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.600> hit

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
they can do some it does if you hit

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.699 
they can do some it does if you hit
someone<00:02:43.959> directly<00:02:44.350> on<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:45.030> potion

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
someone directly on with the potion

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.870 
someone directly on with the potion
would<00:02:47.709> see<00:02:47.890> we<00:02:48.010> also<00:02:48.130> got<00:02:48.340> potion<00:02:48.760> weakness<00:02:49.239> ah

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
would see we also got potion weakness ah

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.790 
would see we also got potion weakness ah
that<00:02:51.880> reduces<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.840> li<00:02:52.989> damage<00:02:53.140> for<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.530> minute

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
that reduces in a li damage for a minute

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.370 
that reduces in a li damage for a minute
and<00:02:53.920> seven<00:02:54.310> seconds<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.780> timing<00:02:56.110> on<00:02:56.320> that

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
and seven seconds so the timing on that

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.510 
and seven seconds so the timing on that
one<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.739> pretty<00:02:56.860> good<00:02:57.070> see<00:02:57.280> how<00:02:57.370> he's<00:02:57.489> doing
