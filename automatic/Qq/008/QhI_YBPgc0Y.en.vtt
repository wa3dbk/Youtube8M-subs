00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
never thought about doing it but

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.749 
never thought about doing it but
normally<00:01:37.530> when<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.710> light<00:01:38.009> my<00:01:38.040> candles<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
normally when I light my candles I

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.270 
normally when I light my candles I
always<00:01:39.090> use<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.659> long<00:01:40.280> lighter

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
always use like that long lighter

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310
