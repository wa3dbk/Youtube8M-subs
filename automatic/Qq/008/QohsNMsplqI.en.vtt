of solid maple wood in the insides are

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.709 
of solid maple wood in the insides are
metal<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> plastic<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.660> you

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
metal they are not the plastic that you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
metal they are not the plastic that you
see<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:39.989> other<00:00:40.079> stretchers<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.980> makes<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.280> big

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
see in other stretchers that makes a big

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.130 
see in other stretchers that makes a big
difference<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> metal<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.899> last

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
difference because the metal will last

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
difference because the metal will last
for<00:00:43.410> years<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.710> years<00:00:43.980> whereas<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> plastic

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
for years and years whereas the plastic

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
for years and years whereas the plastic
ones<00:00:45.090> will<00:00:45.239> strip<00:00:45.539> out<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.930> no<00:00:46.050> time<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.590> so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
ones will strip out in no time at all so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.580 
ones will strip out in no time at all so
these<00:00:47.190> are<00:00:47.430> quality<00:00:48.000> shoe<00:00:48.420> stretchers<00:00:48.840> all

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
these are quality shoe stretchers all

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.970 
these are quality shoe stretchers all
you<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.260> shoe<00:00:52.260> spray

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you have to do is take your shoe spray

you have to do is take your shoe spray
it<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.190> either<00:00:53.370> shoe<00:00:53.789> stretch<00:00:54.120> aerosol<00:00:54.840> and

it with either shoe stretch aerosol and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.110 
it with either shoe stretch aerosol and
let<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> soak<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.219> minute<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:56.670> two<00:00:56.730> or

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
let it soak in for a minute or two or

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.869 
let it soak in for a minute or two or
squirt<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> with<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> shoe<00:00:58.559> stretch<00:00:58.920> liquid

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
squirt it with the shoe stretch liquid

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
squirt it with the shoe stretch liquid
and<00:01:00.090> squirt<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> outside<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.230> you'll<00:01:01.440> let

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and squirt the outside that you'll let

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.979 
and squirt the outside that you'll let
that<00:01:01.739> set<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> while<00:01:02.460> also<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.629> reason

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that set in for a while also the reason

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.929 
that set in for a while also the reason
for<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> aerosol<00:01:04.680> shoes<00:01:04.920> stretch<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.489> liquid

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
for the aerosol shoes stretch and liquid

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.219 
for the aerosol shoes stretch and liquid
shoe<00:01:06.119> stretches<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.689> loosens<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
shoe stretches that loosens up the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
shoe stretches that loosens up the
fibers<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> makes<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.340> stretching<00:01:08.760> process

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
fibers so it makes a stretching process

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.660 
fibers so it makes a stretching process
even<00:01:09.600> easier<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.890> point<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.310> take<00:01:11.490> your

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
even easier at that point you take your

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.219 
even easier at that point you take your
shoe<00:01:11.880> stretcher<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.720> inside<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
shoe stretcher you put it inside the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.010 
shoe stretcher you put it inside the
shoe<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:14.070> give<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:14.520> five<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.600> six<00:01:15.720> turns

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
shoe you give it about five or six turns

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
shoe you give it about five or six turns
until<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.439> gets<00:01:16.590> snug<00:01:16.860> at<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.580> point<00:01:17.850> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
until it gets snug at that point you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
until it gets snug at that point you
have<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> three<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:18.689> maybe<00:01:19.140> four<00:01:19.290> more<00:01:19.770> turns

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
have a three or maybe four more turns

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.550 
have a three or maybe four more turns
and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.180> let<00:01:21.390> sit<00:01:21.869> overnight<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and then you let sit overnight and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560 
and then you let sit overnight and
that's<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.090> by<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that's all it really is to it and by the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.140 
that's all it really is to it and by the
next<00:01:24.780> morning<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.380> should<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.710> fine<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.520> for

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the shoe push up as far as possible you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
the shoe push up as far as possible you
give<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> turn<00:01:40.530> until<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.189> gets<00:01:41.400> snug<00:01:41.700> once

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
give it a turn until it gets snug once

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.480 
give it a turn until it gets snug once
it<00:01:42.390> gets<00:01:42.509> snug<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.110> give<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.350> four<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.860> turns

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it gets snug you give it four more turns

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.340 
it gets snug you give it four more turns
at<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.939> point<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> sit<00:01:45.630> down<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.320> are

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
at that point you sit down and you are

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.710 
at that point you sit down and you are
done<00:01:46.439> your<00:01:47.250> high-heeled<00:01:47.729> stretcher<00:01:48.180> there's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
done your high-heeled stretcher there's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.600 
done your high-heeled stretcher there's
some<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> other<00:01:49.259> ones<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.220> contour

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
some of the other ones it just contour

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.859 
some of the other ones it just contour
it<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> little<00:01:50.909> bit<00:01:51.000> differently<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it a little bit differently so you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.510 
it a little bit differently so you
actually<00:01:52.079> put<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> inside<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> shoe<00:01:53.189> like

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
actually put it inside the shoe like

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
actually put it inside the shoe like

that there again you would use the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
that there again you would use the
aerosol<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.250> spray<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.329> liquid
