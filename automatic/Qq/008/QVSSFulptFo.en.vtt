to<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:39.480> inside<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.710> bit<00:01:40.800> of<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
to the inside and a little bit of a

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.960 
to the inside and a little bit of a
front<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.300> can<00:01:42.480> see

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
realized that its timing going to be

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.420 
realized that its timing going to be
seen<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.110> I'm<00:01:50.200> not<00:01:50.260> being<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.650> prime<00:01:50.920> it's<00:01:51.280> just

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
seen so I'm not being a prime it's just

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.710

it'll look good oh yeah this is like my

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.260 
it'll look good oh yeah this is like my
favorite<00:04:33.220> part<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.610> speaker's<00:04:33.970> we<00:04:34.150> got

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
favorite part of the speaker's we got

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.360 
favorite part of the speaker's we got
these<00:04:34.389> sick-ass<00:04:35.350> solderless<00:04:35.889> connectors

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
these sick-ass solderless connectors

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.930 
these sick-ass solderless connectors
pretty<00:04:37.060> much<00:04:37.210> all<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.419> do<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:41.700> fuck<00:04:42.700> when<00:04:42.880> you

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
pretty much all you do is fuck when you

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.969 
pretty much all you do is fuck when you
use<00:04:43.060> these<00:04:43.210> longer<00:04:43.630> ones<00:04:45.210> used<00:04:46.210> take<00:04:46.570> them<00:04:46.750> and

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
use these longer ones used take them and

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.940 
use these longer ones used take them and
slide<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.160> positive<00:04:48.639> on<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.440> like<00:04:50.440> one<00:04:50.919> of

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
slide the positive on to the like one of

00:04:50.950 --> 00:05:00.540 
slide the positive on to the like one of
these<00:04:54.540> other<00:04:55.540> positive<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:57.550> then<00:04:59.370> it's<00:05:00.370> not

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
these other positive and then it's not

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.480 
these other positive and then it's not
that<00:05:00.729> easy<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:01.000> get<00:05:01.240> on<00:05:01.270> but<00:05:01.660> they<00:05:02.280> just<00:05:03.280> sit

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
that easy to get on but they just sit

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.250 
that easy to get on but they just sit
like<00:05:03.639> that<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.930> yeah<00:05:06.600> so<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.900> could<00:05:08.370> hot<00:05:09.370> swap

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
like that and yeah so I could hot swap

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.400 
like that and yeah so I could hot swap
the<00:05:11.260> PCB<00:05:11.740> if<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:12.100> want<00:05:12.310> to<00:05:12.370> get<00:05:12.880> a<00:05:13.120> better<00:05:13.840> preamp

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
the PCB if I want to get a better preamp

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.320 
the PCB if I want to get a better preamp
and<00:05:14.530> throwing<00:05:15.130> a<00:05:15.190> sub<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.669> whatnot<00:05:16.090> later

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
and throwing a sub and whatnot later

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.480 
and throwing a sub and whatnot later
these<00:05:17.080> will<00:05:17.200> be<00:05:17.320> playing<00:05:17.560> loud<00:05:17.800> for<00:05:18.010> what<00:05:18.400> I'm

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
these will be playing loud for what I'm
