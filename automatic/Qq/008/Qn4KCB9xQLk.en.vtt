00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
every card in the game it really is so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.840

much<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.340> guys<00:00:47.520> take<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
much you can do and if you guys take a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.639 
much you can do and if you guys take a
look<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> lot<00:00:48.930> more<00:00:48.989> cars<00:00:49.440> they

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
look there is a lot more cars they

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
look there is a lot more cars they
probably<00:00:49.860> think<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> jerseys

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
probably think I know one of the jerseys

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.720 
probably think I know one of the jerseys
is<00:00:51.960> glitched<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.280> can't<00:00:53.579> get

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is glitched right now so you can't get

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
is glitched right now so you can't get
Diamond<00:00:54.210> Derrick<00:00:54.480> Rose<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.500> still<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.039> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
Diamond Derrick Rose but still this is a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.450 
Diamond Derrick Rose but still this is a
heck<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.789> collection<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.660> mean<00:00:58.350> all<00:00:58.649> historic

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
heck of a collection I mean all historic

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.369 
heck of a collection I mean all historic
teams<00:00:59.730> my<00:01:00.270> collection<00:01:00.809> looks<00:01:00.960> nothing<00:01:01.170> like

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
teams my collection looks nothing like

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.900 
teams my collection looks nothing like
this<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:01.890> I'm<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.730> those<00:01:02.820> people

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
this because I'm one of those people

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
this because I'm one of those people
once<00:01:03.449> i<00:01:03.570> get<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.750> reward<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.470> go<00:01:04.860> ahead<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.129> sell

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
once i get to reward I go ahead and sell

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
once i get to reward I go ahead and sell
everyone<00:01:05.580> else<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> pack<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.140> we're

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
everyone else in the pack so now we're

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.630 
everyone else in the pack so now we're
going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.439> through<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.070> compare<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
going to go through we will compare the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640 
going to go through we will compare the
diamond<00:01:09.000> cards<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.420> regular<00:01:09.750> version<00:01:09.960> you

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
diamond cards as a regular version you

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.410 
diamond cards as a regular version you
see<00:01:10.830> diamond<00:01:11.189> Carmelo<00:01:11.490> Anthony<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> biggest

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
see diamond Carmelo Anthony the biggest

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
see diamond Carmelo Anthony the biggest
difference<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.930> probably<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.350> plus<00:01:13.619> six<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
difference is probably that plus six to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.070 
difference is probably that plus six to
his<00:01:14.700> mid-range<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.479> you're<00:01:15.570> gonna<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.900> that

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
his mid-range and you're gonna see that

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080 
his mid-range and you're gonna see that
for<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.530> diamond<00:01:17.040> cards<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
for all the diamond cards that the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.450 
for all the diamond cards that the
mid-range<00:01:18.509> definitely<00:01:19.140> gets<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.560> huge<00:01:20.070> boost

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
mid-range definitely gets a huge boost

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.520 
mid-range definitely gets a huge boost
he's<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.689> better<00:01:21.840> defense<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
he's a little bit better defense a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.630 
he's a little bit better defense a
little<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.770> better<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.130> finishing<00:01:23.310> around

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
little bit better at finishing around

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.670 
little bit better at finishing around
the<00:01:23.880> rim<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.900> mean<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.290> too<00:01:25.500> much<00:01:25.619> of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the rim but I mean it's not too much of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.410 
the rim but I mean it's not too much of
a<00:01:25.830> huge<00:01:26.159> difference<00:01:26.490> where<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.909> seems<00:01:27.180> almost

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
a huge difference where it seems almost

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.660 
a huge difference where it seems almost
unfair<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.560> these<00:01:28.710> players<00:01:28.950> they're

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
unfair to have these players they're

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.980 
unfair to have these players they're
gonna<00:01:29.790> take<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.030> look<00:01:30.180> at<00:01:30.270> Michael<00:01:30.540> Jordan<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
gonna take a look at Michael Jordan and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.649 
gonna take a look at Michael Jordan and
his<00:01:31.049> mid<00:01:31.290> range<00:01:31.320> goes<00:01:31.799> from<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.040> 91<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> 99<00:01:33.450> on

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
his mid range goes from a 91 to a 99 on
