00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.059
 good friends of youtube in 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.189
 this video tutorial teach towards 

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:08.389
 Our paper box is an easy box 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.009
 to do and that we can serve as 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.660
 to save our figures or what 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.800
 be I for example I'm saving 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.380
 inside the paper stars 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.480
 and I do not know is a pretty cool box alone 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.530
 and nothing to do it we will need 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.080
 two identical square sheets of paper 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.940
 and we will do the following we will make a sheet 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.230
 of paper and we will double it going from 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.850
 this tip is like this 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.989
 trying to make it as accurate 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.989
 possible and we will open now we will go from 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.370
 this tip is even bending over here 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.370
 thus 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.730
 we would give 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.730
 we will turn the paper 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.780
 and we will go from this side to this one 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.409
 up here folding in half 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.409
 A) Yes 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.750
 and we will reopen 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.290
 and now we will go from this side to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.290
 is folding around in this way 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.310
 and we will reopen 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.939
 once we reach this point we will give 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.939
 the return to paper 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:57.220
 and we will go from this point to the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.190
 center making these sides 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.240
 match these 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.240
 thus 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.590
 we will repeat it with the three sides 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.590
 remaining 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.360
 if we will have something like this 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.970
 and we will go from this side 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.280
 until the middle part marked by 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.330
 these two lines 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.330
 thus 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.940
 and on this side 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.940
 we will do the same 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.130
 we will open 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.680
 and we will do the same with these 2 with these 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.670
 two sides or with this side and with this 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.670
 thus 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.150
 and we will open 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.150
 we will have stayed like this 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.140
 well then we will open for example this 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.550
 tip 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.220
 and this point 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.830
 and we will do the following 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.520
 this side and this side we will rise 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.520
 A) Yes 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.480
 to make it be the walls 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.400
 from the box 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.400
 and for this by this line here 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.670
 we will raise this up 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.000
 well and these two we will throw you towards 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.000
 inside 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.480
 that is, we raise this on this side 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.340
 from here that's why we raise and this 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.190
 we throw in 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.310
 this would have to match like this from this 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.900
 shape 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.190
 and this equal 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.720
 and now this part of here is part of 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.720
 we throw into the box 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.390
 and we would have a side and now with this 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.210
 side 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.750
 we do the same thing we're going to do this 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.969
 we will look inward like this and this 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.379
 we raise 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.379
 and we lower them in work 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.730
 we speak everything well and we have to 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.730
 get corrector fits well 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.720
 without glue and without anything we have 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.190
 so pretty pretty cool 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.720
 and now with another sheet we would have to 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.180
 do the same I have the folds 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.910
 done because it saved me time 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.470
 video we go but the steps themselves 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.650
 and what we would do would be what 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:28.410
 next the same we raised this and 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.410
 we threw it in again 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.379
 we will have the two topics 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.629
 nothing we put one inside another by 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.629
 example the green inside the blue 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.330
 and we would have the box 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.070
 As you can see, it's pretty cool 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.990
 will expose the little flower is the link for 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.730
 here I suppose is to do it if you want and 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.060
 nothing also I will put the link of the 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.060
 little stars 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.320
 in case you feel like doing it 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.570
 and that has been all dad liza liked 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.490
