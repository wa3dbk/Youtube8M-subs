00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to car reverse because when you start

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.939 
to car reverse because when you start
adding<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.730> let's<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:27.990> Co<00:00:28.260> T's<00:00:28.529> here

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
adding in let's see we have Co T's here

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.860 
adding in let's see we have Co T's here
and<00:00:31.279> say<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.880> will<00:00:33.090> add<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:34.079> random

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
and say we just will add this random

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
car per race like I just mentioned with

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.990 
car per race like I just mentioned with
the<00:00:51.300> 1990<00:00:52.289> car<00:00:52.559> there's<00:00:53.010> already<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.250> 24<00:00:53.699> car<00:00:53.910> in

this race so why would you want to have
another<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.149> would<00:00:58.140> make<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.440> confusing

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
another thing is don't guess how far to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.520 
another thing is don't guess how far to
move<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.580> cars<00:01:05.820> use<00:01:06.689> something<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
move the cars use something like a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.679 
move the cars use something like a
pencil<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.970> my<00:01:09.150> case<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.750> use<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.350> stylus<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
pencil or in my case I use a stylus and

set it right in front of the bumper of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.550 
set it right in front of the bumper of
the<00:01:13.950> car<00:01:14.540> move<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.869> much<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.350> every

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the car move it that much for every

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
the car move it that much for every
single<00:01:16.770> car<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.909> help<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.330> out

single car that's going to help you out
a<00:01:18.509> bunch<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.250> you're<00:01:20.430> moving<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> like

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
a bunch because if you're moving it like

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.020 
a bunch because if you're moving it like
that<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.790> one

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that and this one like that and this one

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
that and this one like that and this one
in<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.020> don't<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> was

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
in that one I don't know that I was

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.969 
in that one I don't know that I was
exaggeration<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> 55<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.350> that's

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
exaggeration with a 55 there but that's

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.770 
exaggeration with a 55 there but that's
that's<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:29.820> something<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.450> look<00:01:30.540> after

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that's that's something to look after

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.510 
that's that's something to look after
because<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:31.890> style<00:01:32.130> motion<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.460> going

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
because then your style motion is going

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.590 
because then your style motion is going
to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:32.850> over<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> place

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to be all over the place

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.219 
to be all over the place
use<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> clean<00:01:35.100> simple<00:01:35.549> track<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.420> know<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
use a clean simple track you know like I

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.890 
use a clean simple track you know like I
have<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.640> isn't<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.090> good<00:01:39.240> track<00:01:39.600> at<00:01:39.780> all

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
have here this isn't a good track at all

five<00:03:56.819> pictures<00:03:57.030> exactly<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.680> that's<00:03:59.370> another

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
five pictures exactly so that's another

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.780 
five pictures exactly so that's another
thing<00:03:59.819> also<00:04:00.480> less<00:04:01.440> cautions<00:04:02.130> makes<00:04:02.459> for<00:04:02.760> a

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
thing also less cautions makes for a

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.080 
thing also less cautions makes for a
better<00:04:03.030> race<00:04:03.530> just<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.769> NASCAR<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.790> don't

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
better race just like a NASCAR you don't

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.970 
better race just like a NASCAR you don't
want<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.299> see<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.450> caution<00:04:06.780> every<00:04:07.350> single<00:04:07.739> lap

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
want to see a caution every single lap

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.450 
want to see a caution every single lap
unless<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.700> want<00:04:08.880> your<00:04:09.000> job

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
unless you want your job

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.570 
unless you want your job
of<00:04:09.700> course<00:04:09.970> but<00:04:10.900> yeah<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:13.380> usually<00:04:14.550> try<00:04:15.550> to

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
of course but yeah so I usually try to

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.040 
of course but yeah so I usually try to
avoid<00:04:15.700> that<00:04:16.630> because<00:04:17.700> it's<00:04:18.700> just<00:04:19.000> it's<00:04:19.840> gonna

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.050 
avoid that because it's just it's gonna

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.380 
avoid that because it's just it's gonna
take<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.440> less<00:04:20.740> time<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:21.850> finish<00:04:22.120> the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
take you less time to finish the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.480 
take you less time to finish the
stop-motion<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:23.170> I<00:04:23.260> know<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.830> for<00:04:24.460> sure

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
stop-motion and I know that for sure

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.940 
stop-motion and I know that for sure
because<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:25.450> am<00:04:25.750> making<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.140> race<00:04:26.320> right<00:04:26.560> now<00:04:26.590> and

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
because I am making a race right now and

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.100 
because I am making a race right now and
I<00:04:27.490> had<00:04:27.670> one<00:04:27.880> caution<00:04:28.420> that<00:04:28.450> took<00:04:28.750> up<00:04:28.870> three

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
I had one caution that took up three

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.140 
I had one caution that took up three
laps<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.680> 10-lap<00:04:30.040> race<00:04:30.190> so<00:04:30.730> this<00:04:30.940> is<00:04:31.060> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
laps of a 10-lap race so this is the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.060 
laps of a 10-lap race so this is the
only<00:04:31.330> caution<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:32.110> told<00:04:32.290> myself<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.770> was<00:04:32.920> going

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070

to have and that was actually an
accident<00:04:35.470> caution<00:04:36.190> it<00:04:36.340> was<00:04:36.430> supposed<00:04:36.670> to<00:04:36.790> all
