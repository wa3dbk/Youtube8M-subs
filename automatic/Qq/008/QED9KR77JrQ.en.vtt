curious as to you know how you came to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.369 
curious as to you know how you came to
write<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.759> book<00:00:14.820> i<00:00:15.330> was<00:00:15.690> actually<00:00:15.809> inspired

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
write this book i was actually inspired

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.650 
write this book i was actually inspired
mostly<00:00:17.070> by<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> classes<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.119> teach<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
mostly by the classes that I teach and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.150 
mostly by the classes that I teach and
the<00:00:18.900> questions<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.470> my<00:00:19.680> students<00:00:20.100> have

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the questions that my students have

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.439 
the questions that my students have
throughout<00:00:20.730> class<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> bunch<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
throughout class and all the bunch of

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.820 
throughout class and all the bunch of
silhouettes<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.720> styles<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.350> they<00:00:25.529> wanted

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
silhouettes and styles that they wanted

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.710 
silhouettes and styles that they wanted
to<00:00:25.890> learn<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.519> then<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.910> kind<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.240> discovered

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
to learn and then I kind of discovered

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.490 
to learn and then I kind of discovered
that<00:00:28.519> if<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.910> broke<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.390> down<00:00:30.510> by<00:00:30.900> silhouette

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that if I broke it down by silhouette

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.440 
that if I broke it down by silhouette
and<00:00:31.740> then<00:00:31.949> style<00:00:32.309> changes<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.149> ended<00:00:33.390> up

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and then style changes that it ended up

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
and then style changes that it ended up
being<00:00:33.690> literally<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.320> style<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.070> almost<00:00:35.340> every

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
being literally a style for almost every

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.040 
being literally a style for almost every
single<00:00:35.910> day<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> month<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.020> just

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
single day of the month and so we just

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.799 
single day of the month and so we just
kind<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.350> expanded<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.600> really<00:00:39.600> love

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
kind of expanded on that I really love

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.450 
kind of expanded on that I really love
to<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.649> know<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.040> manual<00:00:41.340> for

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
to that it's you know it's a manual for

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.319 
to that it's you know it's a manual for
basic<00:00:42.030> pattern<00:00:42.450> drafting<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.850> mm-hmm<00:00:44.850> why<00:00:45.270> do

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
basic pattern drafting and mm-hmm why do

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.970 
basic pattern drafting and mm-hmm why do
you<00:00:45.480> think<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.780> skirts<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.410> such<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> good

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
you think that skirts are such a good

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520 
you think that skirts are such a good
garment<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.610> learn<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.120> skill<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.840> well<00:00:49.379> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
garment to learn the skill on well it's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
garment to learn the skill on well it's
the<00:00:49.710> first<00:00:49.980> thing<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.520> learned<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the first thing that I learned when I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.080 
the first thing that I learned when I
was<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.629> design<00:00:52.050> school<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.910> think<00:00:53.910> it's

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
was in design school and I think it's

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.459 
was in design school and I think it's
mainly<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.230> only<00:00:55.410> need

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
mainly because like you really only need

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.990 
mainly because like you really only need
to<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> couple<00:00:55.890> measurements<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
to just a couple measurements the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.880 
to just a couple measurements the
fitting<00:00:57.270> process<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.170> easier<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
fitting process is a lot easier and a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.459 
fitting process is a lot easier and a
lot<00:00:59.010> more<00:00:59.070> forgiving<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
lot more forgiving and so you kind of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
lot more forgiving and so you kind of
can<00:01:01.739> learn<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> ropes<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.550> fitting<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
can learn the ropes of fitting and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
can learn the ropes of fitting and
drafting<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.309> have

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
drafting and and then not have to have

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.420 
drafting and and then not have to have
the<00:01:05.580> headache<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.320> all<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.560> trial<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.220> error

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the headache of all this trial and error

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.340 
the headache of all this trial and error
that<00:01:08.760> comes<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.630> other<00:01:09.930> kinds<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that comes with like other kinds of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.830 
that comes with like other kinds of
garments<00:01:10.850> why<00:01:11.850> don't<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.150> walk<00:01:12.360> us<00:01:12.390> through

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
garments why don't you walk us through

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
garments why don't you walk us through
kind<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.619> learning<00:01:13.950> journey<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
kind of the learning journey that you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.550 
kind of the learning journey that you
take<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> reader<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.450> through<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> chapters<00:01:16.530> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
take a reader on through the chapters of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.249 
take a reader on through the chapters of
the<00:01:16.770> book<00:01:16.890> okay<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:18.299> start<00:01:18.630> very<00:01:19.020> very

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the book okay so we start very very

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
the book okay so we start very very
beginning<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:20.310> how<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.549> take<00:01:21.090> measurements

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
beginning with how to take measurements

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.810 
beginning with how to take measurements
we<00:01:22.110> take<00:01:22.320> those<00:01:22.560> measurements<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.460> then

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
we take those measurements and then

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.960 
we take those measurements and then
draft<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.600> into<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:26.009> called<00:01:26.250> sloper<00:01:26.759> or

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
draft them into a was called sloper or

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
draft them into a was called sloper or
block<00:01:27.869> pattern<00:01:28.140> which<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.890> basis<00:01:29.369> for

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
block pattern which is the basis for

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.569 
block pattern which is the basis for
every<00:01:29.880> single<00:01:30.119> pattern<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.200> book<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.310> it's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
every single pattern in the book so it's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.760 
every single pattern in the book so it's
not<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.900> pattern<00:01:34.320> drafting<00:01:34.470> it's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
not not just pattern drafting it's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.609 
not not just pattern drafting it's
included<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.340> also<00:01:35.490> include<00:01:36.030> lots<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.619> sewing

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
included I also include lots of sewing

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.560 
included I also include lots of sewing
information<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.520> once<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> pattern

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
information so once you get the pattern

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
information so once you get the pattern
drafted<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.590> teach<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.920> how<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> put

drafted and I teach you how to put

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.310 
drafted and I teach you how to put
together<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:42.840> wanted<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
know why don't you give us a concept of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.880 
know why don't you give us a concept of
you<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:49.049> different<00:01:49.350> styles<00:01:49.710> you've

can<00:02:41.310> grow<00:02:41.550> with<00:02:41.760> over<00:02:42.240> time<00:02:42.450> yeah<00:02:42.900> there's

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
can grow with over time yeah there's

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.340 
can grow with over time yeah there's
definitely<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.680> really<00:02:44.250> large<00:02:44.640> range<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.840> skill

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
definitely a really large range of skill

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.630 
definitely a really large range of skill
sets<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.610> guess<00:02:48.450> entry<00:02:49.440> points<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:50.010> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
sets and I guess entry points in the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.940 
sets and I guess entry points in the
book<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.720> if<00:02:51.900> you've<00:02:52.140> never<00:02:52.440> seen<00:02:52.590> a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
book so like if you've never seen a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.910

pattern<00:02:53.850> before<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.870> still<00:02:55.290> be<00:02:55.560> able<00:02:55.680> to

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
pattern before you can still be able to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.220 
pattern before you can still be able to
use<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.850> are<00:02:57.180> used<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.750> using<00:02:57.960> like

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
use it and if you are used to using like

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.050 
use it and if you are used to using like
simplicity<00:02:58.410> or<00:02:58.770> recalls<00:02:59.130> patterns<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.850> put

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060
