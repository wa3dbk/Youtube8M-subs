a classic we'll be using it for that
much<00:00:22.769> longer<00:00:22.830> though<00:00:23.279> once<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.699> upgrade<00:00:24.660> to

Gore margalla it'll probably be nearly
an<00:00:29.460> exclusive<00:00:30.119> weapon<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.720> point<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
an exclusive weapon at that point and it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.770 
an exclusive weapon at that point and it
will<00:00:32.430> slowly<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.969> sick<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:35.600> not<00:00:36.600> too

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
will slowly get sick of that one not too

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.110

have<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> wake<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> ultimate<00:00:43.710> version<00:00:43.890> for

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
have to wake the ultimate version for

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.709 
have to wake the ultimate version for
those<00:00:47.180> which<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.329> would<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> good

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
those which this would be a good

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.799 
those which this would be a good
precursor<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.649> I'm<00:00:49.770> sure<00:00:50.780> outside<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
precursor to because I'm sure outside of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.420 
precursor to because I'm sure outside of
a<00:00:51.930> little<00:00:52.140> bit<00:00:52.230> more<00:00:52.350> weapon<00:00:52.680> diversity<00:00:53.280> be

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
a little bit more weapon diversity be

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.299 
a little bit more weapon diversity be
the<00:00:53.850> low<00:00:54.030> rank<00:00:54.300> will<00:00:54.449> probably<00:00:54.750> stay<00:00:55.309> very

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the low rank will probably stay very

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.740 
the low rank will probably stay very
nearly<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> same

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:19.210 

maybe<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.840> new<00:01:03.020> monster<00:01:03.260> or<00:01:03.680> two

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:31.899 

she<00:01:20.220> had<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> decency<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.909> carry<00:01:21.180> me<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.600> her

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:02:02.230 

no<00:01:32.479> someone<00:01:32.840> got<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:32.960> write<00:01:33.109> off<00:01:33.140> all<00:01:33.499> right

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:13.350

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.660 

just<00:02:14.360> do<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.510> again

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:30.840 

and<00:02:20.209> I'm<00:02:20.360> sure<00:02:20.540> she's<00:02:20.840> very<00:02:21.140> upset

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:46.620 

be<00:02:31.600> careful<00:02:31.960> she<00:02:32.590> might<00:02:32.620> do<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:32.950> again

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.230

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
it up looks like that tail cut isn't

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.210 
it up looks like that tail cut isn't
going<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.610> happen<00:04:58.440> all<00:04:59.440> right<00:04:59.560> nobody<00:04:59.919> cares

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220

going to happen all right nobody cares
about<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.490> tail<00:05:00.639> cut

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:18.790 

ok<00:05:09.580> hate<00:05:10.090> for<00:05:10.300> fire<00:05:10.450> resistance<00:05:11.550> do<00:05:12.550> care

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:29.120 

yes<00:05:22.580> perfect<00:05:24.199> nah<00:05:25.199> let<00:05:25.880> that<00:05:26.880> fight<00:05:28.010> it<00:05:29.010> could

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
yes perfect nah let that fight it could

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.240 
yes perfect nah let that fight it could
have<00:05:29.220> been<00:05:29.280> worse<00:05:30.530> we'll<00:05:31.530> see<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:31.800> time<00:05:32.040> and

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
have been worse we'll see the time and

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:43.890 
have been worse we'll see the time and
they<00:05:32.310> reward<00:05:33.240> screen

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.070 

oh<00:05:43.990> right<00:05:44.710> yeah<00:05:44.889> so<00:05:45.270> he<00:05:46.270> had<00:05:46.389> noticed<00:05:46.570> the<00:05:46.840> for

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
oh right yeah so he had noticed the for

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.689 
oh right yeah so he had noticed the for
every<00:05:47.410> time<00:05:47.590> you<00:05:47.680> capture<00:05:48.160> it<00:05:48.190> automatically

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
every time you capture it automatically

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.590 
every time you capture it automatically
becomes<00:05:48.910> a<00:05:49.680> capture<00:05:50.680> timer<00:05:51.270> so<00:05:52.270> if<00:05:52.389> you<00:05:52.509> have

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
becomes a capture timer so if you have

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.879 
becomes a capture timer so if you have
things<00:05:52.780> to<00:05:52.960> car<00:05:53.139> if<00:05:53.259> you<00:05:53.320> probably<00:05:53.590> want<00:05:53.800> them

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
things to car if you probably want them

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.860 
things to car if you probably want them
to<00:05:53.949> be<00:05:54.009> able<00:05:54.070> to<00:05:54.190> carve<00:05:54.430> them<00:05:54.630> unless<00:05:55.630> you<00:05:55.780> were

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
to be able to carve them unless you were

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:05.700 
to be able to carve them unless you were
right<00:05:56.020> next<00:05:56.169> to<00:05:56.350> them<00:06:04.289> well<00:06:05.289> looks<00:06:05.470> like<00:06:05.530> I<00:06:05.680> got

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
right next to them well looks like I got
