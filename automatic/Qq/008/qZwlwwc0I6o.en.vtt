00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.170 
have which is called ambient I haven't
yet<00:02:54.320> used<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:54.829> but<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.310> will<00:02:55.609> try<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:55.910> out<00:02:56.090> with

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
yet used this but I will try it out with

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.360 
yet used this but I will try it out with
the<00:02:56.299> rabbits<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.750> see<00:02:57.200> what<00:02:57.799> they<00:02:57.980> think<00:02:58.040> of

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
the rabbits and see what they think of

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.949 
the rabbits and see what they think of
it<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.640> hopefully<00:02:58.820> Jack<00:02:59.209> won't<00:02:59.420> be<00:02:59.510> too<00:02:59.660> fussy

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
it and hopefully Jack won't be too fussy

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.199 
it and hopefully Jack won't be too fussy
but<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:00.950> one<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.459> very<00:03:01.760> similar-looking

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
but this one is very similar-looking

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.240 
but this one is very similar-looking
Tofino<00:03:02.900> hay<00:03:03.109> as<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.709> can<00:03:03.829> see<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.070> quite

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
Tofino hay as you can see it's quite

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.819 
Tofino hay as you can see it's quite
green<00:03:04.609> the<00:03:04.970> strands<00:03:05.390> also<00:03:05.750> look<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.170> fairly

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
green the strands also look a fairly

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:07.930 
green the strands also look a fairly
decent<00:03:07.010> length<00:03:07.310> they<00:03:07.519> don't<00:03:07.730> look<00:03:07.880> too

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
decent length they don't look too

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.720 
decent length they don't look too
chopped<00:03:08.510> up<00:03:08.720> or<00:03:08.900> too<00:03:09.140> bitty<00:03:09.410> but<00:03:10.100> this<00:03:10.310> is<00:03:10.549> the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
chopped up or too bitty but this is the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.789 
chopped up or too bitty but this is the
sort<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.209> size<00:03:11.450> Bale<00:03:11.810> we<00:03:11.959> would<00:03:12.109> get<00:03:12.319> so<00:03:12.769> I

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
sort of size Bale we would get so I

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.620 
sort of size Bale we would get so I
expect<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.489> will<00:03:13.670> probably<00:03:14.180> last<00:03:14.390> us

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
expect that this will probably last us

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.110 
expect that this will probably last us
