the<00:00:51.480> texture<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.110> more<00:00:52.289> interesting<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the texture the more interesting it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.950 
the texture the more interesting it
becomes<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.219> knee<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.329> notice<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.780> not

tip of Gov the area covered the idea is
to<00:01:10.320> hide<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.560> method<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.130> application<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
to hide the method of application you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.280 
to hide the method of application you
can't<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.270> how<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> did<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.110> just

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
can't see how I did this this is just

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
can't see how I did this this is just
part<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.100> okay<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> leave<00:01:14.820> these

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
part one but it's okay to leave these

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.050 
part one but it's okay to leave these
voids<00:01:16.470> that's<00:01:17.070> why<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> usually<00:01:17.430> use<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> darker

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
voids that's why I usually use a darker

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
voids that's why I usually use a darker
base<00:01:18.210> color<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.619> doing

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
base color so I can see what I'm doing

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.990 
base color so I can see what I'm doing
if<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.189> white<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.490> white<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> little

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
if it was white on white it's a little

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
if it was white on white it's a little
bit<00:01:21.090> harder<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.259> finish<00:01:22.920> with

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
bit harder to see all right finish with

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.590 
bit harder to see all right finish with
that<00:01:23.450> I'm<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> take<00:01:24.720> my<00:01:24.869> trowel

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.789 

just<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.659> regular<00:01:28.960> little<00:01:29.020> drywall<00:01:29.500> trial

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
just a regular little drywall trial

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.889 
just a regular little drywall trial
using<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.430> light<00:01:30.610> pressure<00:01:30.789> I'm<00:01:31.509> going<00:01:31.689> to<00:01:31.750> come

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
using a light pressure I'm going to come

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.039 
using a light pressure I'm going to come
down<00:01:32.110> in<00:01:32.380> various<00:01:33.159> areas<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:34.180> just<00:01:34.869> knock

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
down in various areas and just knock

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.960 
down in various areas and just knock
down<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.380> high<00:01:35.500> spots<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.130> again<00:01:36.579> various

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
down the high spots and again various

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.649 
down the high spots and again various
directions<00:01:38.880> okay<00:01:39.880> we<00:01:40.149> finished<00:01:40.479> with<00:01:40.570> the

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
directions okay we finished with the

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.139 
directions okay we finished with the
trial<00:01:40.929> next<00:01:41.530> step<00:01:41.829> we<00:01:42.280> have<00:01:42.429> to<00:01:42.549> let<00:01:42.729> this<00:01:42.909> dry

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
trial next step we have to let this dry

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.669 
trial next step we have to let this dry
overnight<00:01:43.179> if<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.929> don't<00:01:44.140> let<00:01:44.289> it<00:01:44.320> dry<00:01:44.619> and

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
overnight if you don't let it dry and

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.679 
overnight if you don't let it dry and
you<00:01:44.890> do<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.159> next<00:01:45.310> step<00:01:45.610> prematurely<00:01:46.179> it's

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
you do the next step prematurely it's

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.660 
you do the next step prematurely it's
going<00:01:46.869> to<00:01:46.929> be<00:01:47.079> a<00:01:47.110> big<00:01:47.439> mess<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.039> we<00:01:48.159> can't<00:01:48.429> fix

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
going to be a big mess and we can't fix

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.819 
going to be a big mess and we can't fix
it<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.240> nice<00:01:49.450> thing<00:01:49.689> is<00:01:49.720> this<00:01:50.110> plaster<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.710> on

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
it the nice thing is this plaster is on

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.710 
it the nice thing is this plaster is on
so<00:01:51.100> thick<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:51.700> going<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:51.939> crack<00:01:52.240> those

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
so thick it's going to crack those

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.940 
so thick it's going to crack those
cracks<00:01:53.110> are<00:01:53.229> going<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.409> make<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.649> final

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
cracks are going to make the final

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.249 
cracks are going to make the final
finish<00:01:54.220> more<00:01:54.520> interesting<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.569> let<00:01:55.929> it<00:01:56.049> dry

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
finish more interesting so let it dry

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.270 
finish more interesting so let it dry
we're<00:01:56.470> going<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.649> come<00:01:56.740> back<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.130> next

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
we're going to come back to the next

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.669 
we're going to come back to the next
step<00:01:57.549> all<00:01:58.210> right<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.780> it's<00:01:59.170> dried<00:01:59.439> overnight

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
step all right so it's dried overnight

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.559 
step all right so it's dried overnight

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
gold paint dried the next step is going

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.940 
gold paint dried the next step is going
to<00:02:43.359> add<00:02:43.480> some<00:02:43.750> highlights<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> texture

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
to add some highlights to the texture

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.259

if<00:05:40.170> you<00:05:40.260> use<00:05:40.440> too<00:05:40.680> much<00:05:40.710> you're<00:05:41.610> going<00:05:41.760> to<00:05:41.820> see

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
if you use too much you're going to see

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.550 
if you use too much you're going to see
we're<00:05:42.240> just<00:05:42.270> wasting<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:42.930> so<00:05:43.260> I'm<00:05:43.350> just<00:05:43.440> going

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
we're just wasting it so I'm just going

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.320 
we're just wasting it so I'm just going
to<00:05:43.620> keep<00:05:43.800> working<00:05:44.220> it<00:05:44.310> in<00:05:44.430> here's<00:05:45.090> one<00:05:45.240> of

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
to keep working it in here's one of

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.030 
to keep working it in here's one of
these<00:05:45.390> cracks<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:46.260> biggest<00:05:46.560> thing<00:05:46.710> is<00:05:46.830> when

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
these cracks the biggest thing is when

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.100 
these cracks the biggest thing is when
you're<00:05:47.160> doing<00:05:47.220> this<00:05:47.610> part<00:05:47.910> of<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.210> working

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
you're doing this part of it working

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.630 
you're doing this part of it working
about<00:05:49.350> a<00:05:49.410> four<00:05:49.680> foot<00:05:49.860> by<00:05:49.980> four<00:05:50.250> foot<00:05:50.280> area

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
about a four foot by four foot area

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.180 
about a four foot by four foot area
something's<00:05:50.940> manageable<00:05:51.890> you<00:05:52.890> want<00:05:53.070> to<00:05:53.130> go

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
something's manageable you want to go

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.590 
something's manageable you want to go
too<00:05:53.250> big<00:05:53.580> because<00:05:53.820> if<00:05:53.880> it<00:05:53.970> starts<00:05:54.150> to<00:05:54.270> dry<00:05:54.450> it's

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
too big because if it starts to dry it's

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.120 
too big because if it starts to dry it's
going<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:54.780> make<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:54.990> a<00:05:55.020> lot<00:05:55.170> harder<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:55.590> come

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
going to make it a lot harder to come

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.320 
going to make it a lot harder to come
back<00:05:56.310> now<00:05:56.490> we're<00:05:56.580> gonna<00:05:56.700> take<00:05:56.820> the<00:05:56.940> rag<00:05:57.090> we're

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
back now we're gonna take the rag we're

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.050 
back now we're gonna take the rag we're
going<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:57.510> fold<00:05:57.690> it<00:05:57.870> for<00:05:58.020> a<00:05:58.050> flat<00:05:58.320> surface<00:05:59.060> then

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
going to fold it for a flat surface then

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.390 
going to fold it for a flat surface then
we're<00:06:00.180> going<00:06:00.300> to<00:06:00.330> come<00:06:00.480> in<00:06:00.600> here<00:06:01.070> with<00:06:02.070> a<00:06:02.100> light

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
we're going to come in here with a light

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.260 
we're going to come in here with a light
pressure<00:06:02.670> and<00:06:04.490> just<00:06:05.490> start<00:06:05.700> getting<00:06:05.820> off<00:06:06.030> any

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
pressure and just start getting off any

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.660 
pressure and just start getting off any
excess<00:06:06.720> glaze<00:06:07.050> so<00:06:07.950> you<00:06:08.040> can<00:06:08.160> see<00:06:08.310> I'm<00:06:08.400> letting

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
excess glaze so you can see I'm letting

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.340 
excess glaze so you can see I'm letting
it<00:06:08.700> the<00:06:09.060> dark<00:06:09.300> colors<00:06:09.600> I'm<00:06:09.750> leaving<00:06:10.080> them<00:06:10.170> down

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
it the dark colors I'm leaving them down

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.140 
it the dark colors I'm leaving them down
into<00:06:10.650> those<00:06:10.890> crevices<00:06:11.130> I'm<00:06:11.610> not<00:06:11.790> trying<00:06:12.060> to

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
into those crevices I'm not trying to

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.790 
into those crevices I'm not trying to
pull<00:06:12.330> it<00:06:12.480> out<00:06:12.570> that's<00:06:12.780> going<00:06:12.900> to<00:06:12.990> make<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:13.230> more

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
pull it out that's going to make it more

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.960 
pull it out that's going to make it more
dimensional<00:06:14.400> that's<00:06:14.580> why<00:06:14.700> I<00:06:14.730> said<00:06:14.940> don't

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
dimensional that's why I said don't

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.670 
dimensional that's why I said don't
worry<00:06:15.240> about<00:06:15.330> it<00:06:15.510> the<00:06:15.630> cracks<00:06:15.930> it<00:06:16.140> adds<00:06:16.260> to<00:06:16.530> it

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
worry about it the cracks it adds to it

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.530 
worry about it the cracks it adds to it
just<00:06:17.280> makes<00:06:17.490> a<00:06:17.580> little<00:06:17.700> bit<00:06:17.790> more<00:06:17.880> interesting

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
just makes a little bit more interesting

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.660 
just makes a little bit more interesting
so<00:06:19.530> we're<00:06:19.680> going<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.830> finish<00:06:20.010> it<00:06:20.130> off<00:06:20.370> real

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
so we're going to finish it off real

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.820 
so we're going to finish it off real
quick<00:06:20.940> you<00:06:21.810> can<00:06:21.930> see<00:06:22.080> this<00:06:22.200> part<00:06:22.440> goes<00:06:22.620> really

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
quick you can see this part goes really

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.190 
quick you can see this part goes really
fast<00:06:23.270> you're<00:06:24.270> not<00:06:24.420> using<00:06:24.600> a<00:06:24.750> lot<00:06:24.870> of<00:06:24.930> pressure

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
fast you're not using a lot of pressure

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.450 
fast you're not using a lot of pressure
you're<00:06:25.470> not<00:06:25.560> trying<00:06:25.770> to<00:06:25.830> leave<00:06:25.950> any<00:06:26.070> scratch

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
you're not trying to leave any scratch

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.850 
you're not trying to leave any scratch
marks<00:06:26.850> or<00:06:27.000> rag<00:06:27.150> marks<00:06:27.480> on<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:27.720> surface<00:06:27.870> this

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
marks or rag marks on the surface this

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.290 
marks or rag marks on the surface this
is<00:06:28.920> why<00:06:29.130> I<00:06:29.160> said<00:06:29.280> don't<00:06:29.640> use<00:06:29.760> a<00:06:29.790> lot<00:06:29.880> of<00:06:30.030> glaze

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
is why I said don't use a lot of glaze

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.240 
is why I said don't use a lot of glaze
because<00:06:30.570> it's<00:06:30.690> going<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:30.840> be<00:06:30.990> here<00:06:31.440> if<00:06:31.980> you<00:06:32.070> use

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
because it's going to be here if you use

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.590 
because it's going to be here if you use
too<00:06:32.400> much<00:06:32.430> glaze<00:06:32.760> going<00:06:33.000> to<00:06:33.060> be<00:06:33.120> working<00:06:33.300> twice

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
too much glaze going to be working twice

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.980 
too much glaze going to be working twice
as<00:06:33.660> hard<00:06:33.840> to<00:06:34.110> get<00:06:34.290> it<00:06:34.410> off<00:06:34.530> of<00:06:34.710> the<00:06:34.800> surface<00:06:35.990> and

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
as hard to get it off of the surface and

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.510 
as hard to get it off of the surface and
you<00:06:37.050> can<00:06:37.560> start<00:06:37.860> to<00:06:37.980> see<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.310> cranberry

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
you can start to see the cranberry

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.400 
you can start to see the cranberry
poking<00:06:39.180> through<00:06:39.390> and<00:06:39.630> the<00:06:39.690> bronze<00:06:39.960> coming

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
poking through and the bronze coming

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.250 
poking through and the bronze coming
through<00:06:40.680> and<00:06:41.130> just<00:06:41.490> adding<00:06:41.820> to<00:06:42.000> it

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
through and just adding to it
