 a person more than known by many 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.990
 of our elements is a person who 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.660
 is part of the history of mackerel 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.750
 here in Antioquia I do not know if that man 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.910
 He knows many people more than anything because of his 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.550
 horses although he has never never 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.850
 I really liked to take to the track or anything but 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.090
 yes he has had very good horses and 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.210
 they know him by his word 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.609
 well let's start then now yes 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.469
 talk about beetles remember to try 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:35.049
 a little bit of genetics has this 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:39.009
 beetle horse the cheeky dad is 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:42.069
 helmsman and the mother of the coxswain 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.729
 as everyone knows is the best the best 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:49.600
 grandfather is very very important is a 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:53.380
 grandfather and the gala outside of equal contest 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.409
 that helmsman very good good mom too 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.599
 she is excellent grandmother and has a race and 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.679
 very good children have their 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:05.469
 offspring and the horse has weighed very 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:09.759
 well said the helmsman out of competition 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.929
 the gala out of competition and he did not 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.569
 reached to finish his career 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.730
 competitive to be crowned for the contest 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.620
 but he did some very competitive 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.049
 good and if he managed to make his career 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.170
 on track itself the horse has eight 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:26.600
 championships between them record and serious 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.330
 important the championships very very very 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.040
 in the umpteenth there is a very well moved 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.709
 the horse ends up like the chicken see in 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.810
 the videos does not show very well because 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.240
 a long time ago the horse does not ride 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.270
 the horse sure an accident but 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.540
 here the horse does not ride so much 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.630
 it is already said to see it to the reproduction and 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.780
 has achieved very good results 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.090
 good being a copy that what I eat 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.500
 we mention of your genetic non-genetic 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.920
 very important very beautiful and very 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.030
 representative in the diagonal walks 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.160
 the as a player has been highlighted 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.569
 because without being a callus they have the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.450
 number of children who have many 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.950
 other reproducers if the children that 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.599
 you have are very important not 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.069
 let's mention some of the more children 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.880
 important that there has been at 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.250
 national 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.100
 nationally the favorite of the 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.750
 bonanza the real pampered are the 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.210
 two daughters more representatives of this 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.230
 horse approximately how many children 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.900
 has beetle approximately has 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.799
 Over there 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.620
 sales 100 goes from 90 120 liters is 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.019
 the horse I have always said that the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.890
 product is not the one that has is not the one that 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.420
 my children have my children and another is 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.620
 good to me it seems to me that player is 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:55.180
 a horse that has 30 42 but between 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.640
 those 30 42 have 23 good or 4 me 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.379
 it seems that it is a player in favor of 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.560
 encouragement here we do not want to put the 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.319
 beetle service 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.840
 in a 50 percent promotion in the 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.840
 rest of those two means well let's 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.810
 look at some children who have here in the 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.030
