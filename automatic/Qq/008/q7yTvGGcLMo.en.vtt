00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.130
 raised 4 cm and embellished with 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.539
 details that emphasize the 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.060
 off road character 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.710
 the volvo v40 becomes cross country e 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.050
 showcases all the cards for 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.839
 win over those customers looking for 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.730
 a compact average different from the usual 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.830
 wilder and fancier comes with 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.290
 renewed front daytime running lights 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.230
 vertical alloy wheels up to 19 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.400
 inch side protection plates e 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.989
 roof bars 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.610
 taking up that range of 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.850
 sedan engines from which 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.910
 born or from the thrifty unit of 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.399
 two 115 hp turbodiesels up to 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.149
 powerful d5 petrol engine than horse 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.820
 at 254 we have chosen the variant 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.890
 of three 150-liter turbodiesels 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.410
 horses which is a great compromise between 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.619
 low consumption, performance and pleasure 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.990
 driving dynamism and sportiness therefore 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.210
 without giving up the usual elegance 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.610
 on board we find a passenger compartment 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.560
 attention to detail even if the weapons 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.750
 cross country are others 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.240
 steering wheel position also raised 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.009
 of 4 cm the correct ergonomics of the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.090
 controls and once placed the foot 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.190
 accelerator 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.039
 smooth driving and driving 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.319
 rather accurate and fast without counting 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.910
 then the effective soundproofing is 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.910
 fundamental for those who choose it 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.450
 with that something extra in the look and a 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.970
 luggage compartment up to 1,032 liters 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.800
 inevitably becomes the limit of 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.510
 A ready car is also possible 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.510
 to everyday adventure
