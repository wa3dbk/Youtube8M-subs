into this game just a tad bit late well

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.089 
into this game just a tad bit late well
actually<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.900> game<00:00:13.049> was<00:00:13.200> about<00:00:13.349> halfway<00:00:13.710> over

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099

when<00:00:14.460> i<00:00:14.490> did<00:00:15.470> so<00:00:16.550> but<00:00:17.550> i<00:00:17.609> noticed<00:00:17.970> our<00:00:18.119> team<00:00:18.359> was

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
when i did so but i noticed our team was

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.660 
when i did so but i noticed our team was
winning<00:00:18.779> anyway<00:00:19.320> by<00:00:19.830> quite<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.279> substantial

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
winning anyway by quite a substantial

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.840 
winning anyway by quite a substantial
margin<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.960> i<00:00:22.199> decided<00:00:22.830> i<00:00:23.039> would<00:00:23.100> spawn<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.699> any

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
margin so i decided i would spawn in any

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.790 
margin so i decided i would spawn in any
way<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.590> just<00:00:25.590> see<00:00:25.980> how<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.250> goes<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.000> i<00:00:27.800> just

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
way and just see how it goes and i just

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.370 
way and just see how it goes and i just
i<00:00:28.980> go<00:00:29.130> 19<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.939> oh<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.570> quick<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:31.050> three

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
i go 19 and oh it's a quick like three

minutes<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:31.859> something<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.520> i<00:00:32.809> thought<00:00:33.809> i'd

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.360 
winds up to a close I bet I guess it's
kind<00:02:01.870> of<00:02:01.930> winding<00:02:02.170> up<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.560> close<00:02:02.980> as<00:02:03.220> it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
kind of winding up to a close as it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.510 
kind of winding up to a close as it
starts<00:02:03.990> pretty<00:02:04.990> much<00:02:05.260> is<00:02:05.530> because<00:02:06.040> I<00:02:06.220> joined

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
starts pretty much is because I joined

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.900 
starts pretty much is because I joined
in<00:02:06.790> they<00:02:07.270> had<00:02:07.480> like<00:02:07.750> three<00:02:08.500> we<00:02:09.250> had<00:02:09.399> like<00:02:09.610> three

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
in they had like three we had like three

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.580 
in they had like three we had like three
thousand<00:02:10.479> other<00:02:11.460> 7500<00:02:12.460> points<00:02:12.880> already<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:14.350> um

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
thousand other 7500 points already so um

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.050 
thousand other 7500 points already so um
I<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.720> didn't<00:02:17.260> think<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.950> was<00:02:18.250> going<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.550> do

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I just I didn't think I was going to do

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.800 
I just I didn't think I was going to do
anything<00:02:19.690> too<00:02:19.960> spectacular<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:21.130> um<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.810> mean

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
anything too spectacular but um I mean

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.540 
anything too spectacular but um I mean
you<00:02:23.140> can't<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.560> too<00:02:23.740> much<00:02:23.770> in<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.310> team

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
you can't do too much in a team

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.370 
you can't do too much in a team
deathmatch<00:02:25.000> with<00:02:25.330> half<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.840> score<00:02:26.080> left

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
deathmatch with half the score left

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.010 
deathmatch with half the score left
because<00:02:26.830> uh<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.370> mean<00:02:28.180> team<00:02:28.420> deathmatch<00:02:28.810> is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
because uh I mean team deathmatch is

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.950 
because uh I mean team deathmatch is
probably<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.860> hardest<00:02:29.890> game<00:02:30.700> mode<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.330> get<00:02:31.750> a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
probably the hardest game mode to get a

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.280 
probably the hardest game mode to get a
ton<00:02:32.710> of<00:02:32.740> kills<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.520> unless<00:02:34.060> unless<00:02:34.750> everyone

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
ton of kills in unless unless everyone

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.860 
ton of kills in unless unless everyone
on<00:02:35.410> your<00:02:35.530> team<00:02:35.590> sucks<00:02:36.280> um<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.240> think<00:02:37.540> it's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
on your team sucks um I think it's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.320 
on your team sucks um I think it's
easier<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.530> get<00:02:38.650> kills<00:02:39.100> if<00:02:39.430> your<00:02:39.700> team<00:02:39.970> sucks

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
easier to get kills if your team sucks

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.750 
easier to get kills if your team sucks
then<00:02:40.780> if<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.050> enemy<00:02:41.410> team<00:02:41.440> sucks<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.520> team

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
then if the enemy team sucks in a team

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.780 
then if the enemy team sucks in a team
deathmatch<00:02:43.270> that's<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.959> way<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.140> look<00:02:44.530> at<00:02:44.740> it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
deathmatch that's the way I look at it

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.330 
deathmatch that's the way I look at it
um<00:02:45.790> but<00:02:46.090> anyway<00:02:46.810> while<00:02:47.440> game<00:02:47.770> is<00:02:47.920> already<00:02:48.070> over

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
um but anyway while game is already over

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.120
