slots<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.010> thing<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.670> didn't<00:00:24.150> really

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
slots on this thing it didn't really

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.400 
slots on this thing it didn't really
scroll<00:00:24.869> too<00:00:25.260> well<00:00:25.529> only<00:00:26.369> +<00:00:26.580> 8<00:00:26.789> attack<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.599> it's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
scroll too well only + 8 attack but it's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.380 
scroll too well only + 8 attack but it's
better<00:00:28.590> than<00:00:28.710> nothing<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.609> gotta<00:00:29.789> redo<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
better than nothing and I gotta redo the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.910 
better than nothing and I gotta redo the
potential<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.650> something

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
potential but this is just something

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000 
potential but this is just something
that's<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> when<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.230> you

I'm<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.299> enhance<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.020> thing<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I'm going to just enhance this thing and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
I'm going to just enhance this thing and
I'm<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:25.799> too<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.150> don't<00:01:27.270> we

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
I'm not really too you know I don't we

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
I'm not really too you know I don't we
care<00:01:27.780> about<00:01:27.900> these<00:01:28.080> enhancements<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.340> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
care about these enhancements so if I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.859 
care about these enhancements so if I
start<00:01:29.460> failing<00:01:29.820> everything<00:01:30.240> which<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.630> might

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
start failing everything which I might

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
start failing everything which I might
actually<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.470> very<00:01:31.650> possible<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
actually it's very possible you know and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.719 
actually it's very possible you know and
how<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> went<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.140> by<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:35.220> couple<00:01:35.640> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
how you see it went up by a couple of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.580 
how you see it went up by a couple of
the<00:01:35.790> defense<00:01:36.119> actually<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.229> did<00:01:37.380> increase

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the defense actually but it did increase

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.010 
the defense actually but it did increase
my<00:01:37.740> range<00:01:37.979> by<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> 200<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.630> slowly

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
my range by a 200 so that that's slowly

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.850 
my range by a 200 so that that's slowly
adding<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.000> we're<00:01:42.180> gonna<00:01:42.270> gain

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
adding on to it so now we're gonna gain

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.530 
adding on to it so now we're gonna gain
accuracy<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:43.950> avoid<00:01:44.159> ability<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:45.390> gonna

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
accuracy and avoid ability it's gonna

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
accuracy and avoid ability it's gonna
cost<00:01:45.810> double<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> message<00:01:46.500> though<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.890> that's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
cost double the message though so that's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.340 
cost double the message though so that's
something<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.630> into<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.960> zone

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
something when you get it into that zone

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.980 
something when you get it into that zone
it<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:50.340> gives<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> bonus<00:01:51.420> potential

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
it like gives you a bonus potential

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.499 
it like gives you a bonus potential
almost<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.369> our<00:01:53.399> range<00:01:54.210> went<00:01:54.420> up

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
almost as you can see our range went up

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.080 
almost as you can see our range went up
by<00:01:54.659> 100<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:56.070> will<00:01:56.280> slowly<00:01:56.520> add<00:01:56.759> up<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
by 100 so it will slowly add up the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.910 
by 100 so it will slowly add up the
range<00:01:57.270> keep<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.409> mind<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.649> actually

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
range keep that in mind it's actually

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
range keep that in mind it's actually
really<00:01:59.009> cool<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.810> says

really cool and you know when it says

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.780 
really cool and you know when it says
failure<00:02:01.380> keep<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.100> means<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.369> when<00:02:02.579> if

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
think that once it gets to six then it

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.790 
think that once it gets to six then it
starts<00:02:57.450> dropping<00:02:57.630> down<00:02:57.870> we'll<00:02:58.110> find<00:02:58.290> out<00:02:58.440> the

yeah<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.430> does<00:03:23.610> waste<00:03:23.850> your<00:03:24.030> mesos<00:03:24.390> but<00:03:24.750> I

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
yeah it does waste your mesos but I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.140 
yeah it does waste your mesos but I
think<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.350> far<00:03:25.530> better<00:03:25.710> than<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.580> high

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
think this is far better than the high

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.390 
think this is far better than the high
risk<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.900> equipment<00:03:28.800> has<00:03:28.920> been<00:03:28.980> scribbles

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
risk of equipment has been scribbles

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.640 
risk of equipment has been scribbles
because<00:03:30.300> yes<00:03:30.480> I'm<00:03:30.660> losing<00:03:31.020> messes<00:03:31.320> pretty

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
because yes I'm losing messes pretty

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.380 
because yes I'm losing messes pretty
badly<00:03:31.920> right<00:03:32.190> now<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.370> think<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.670> wasted<00:03:32.820> like<00:03:33.060> 30

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
badly right now I think I wasted like 30

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.790 
badly right now I think I wasted like 30
mil<00:03:33.720> on<00:03:33.990> my<00:03:34.560> cane<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.190> now<00:03:35.610> this<00:03:35.970> solely<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.650> it

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
mil on my cane and now this solely so it

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.490 
mil on my cane and now this solely so it
does<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.040> up<00:03:38.190> into<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.790> lot<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.350> you're

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
does that up into a lot so if you're

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.520 
does that up into a lot so if you're
very<00:03:40.740> poor<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:42.060> will<00:03:42.450> add<00:03:42.780> up<00:03:42.930> really<00:03:43.260> fast

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
very poor it will add up really fast

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.340 
very poor it will add up really fast
especially<00:03:43.980> if<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.280> have<00:03:44.310> bad<00:03:44.550> luck<00:03:45.140> my<00:03:46.140> luck

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
especially if you have bad luck my luck

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.280 
especially if you have bad luck my luck
is<00:03:46.470> normally<00:03:46.770> terrible<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:48.150> expect<00:03:48.780> many

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
is normally terrible so I expect many

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.830 
is normally terrible so I expect many
more<00:03:49.350> failures<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.130> be<00:03:50.190> honest<00:03:50.490> lets<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.810> know

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
more failures to be honest lets you know

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.080 
more failures to be honest lets you know
it's<00:03:52.080> going<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.890> far<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.190> good<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:53.970> just

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
it's going so far so good and you just

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.490 
it's going so far so good and you just
you<00:03:54.240> continuously<00:03:54.900> see<00:03:55.080> that<00:03:55.230> my<00:03:55.320> range

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
you continuously see that my range

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.470 
you continuously see that my range
increases<00:03:55.950> obviously<00:03:56.820> because<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.060> gets<00:03:57.270> more

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
increases obviously because it gets more

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
increases obviously because it gets more
bonuses<00:03:57.990> it's<00:03:58.560> getting<00:03:58.830> more<00:03:58.980> stats<00:03:59.480> that's

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
bonuses it's getting more stats that's

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.680 
bonuses it's getting more stats that's
continually<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.620> want<00:04:01.770> to<00:04:01.830> get<00:04:01.920> 2<00:04:02.010> 12<00:04:02.310> 10<00:04:03.030> at

it's not bad but I do feel like it's a
little<00:07:31.870> bit<00:07:31.960> broken<00:07:32.200> for<00:07:32.860> the<00:07:33.010> very<00:07:33.190> very

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:33.430
