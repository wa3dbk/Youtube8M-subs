00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.330
 This is something I wanted to say to you. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.250
 you who though 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.740
 people for this crazy thing to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.889
 see damn 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.769
 our attitude turns on our rebelliousness 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.560
 what we believe that the fact 80 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.000
 acting on me in my marginal arm does not 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.490
 It means that I'm marginal does 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.770
 several other action tapes do not want 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.529
 say that it acts under much of what 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.230
 I think the hypocrite is a liar. 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.260
 I'm on, I'm under the church. 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.500
 came back more 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.270
 the bad revolt goes away because I did 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.690
 in my life a working life of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.610
 battle and from there fought my dream and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 made and if futile 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.559
 Thanks to you, but we've struggled. 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.600
 So much to get where we are alone. 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.309
 that all this we've been working on 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.030
 without a conscience that we acquired 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.949
 today it's nothing because I saw one today 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.129
 thing that you may not have that is 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.290
 a successful band is a crazy life of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.870
 every day in place of appearing in 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 television on the radio only very 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.729
 You have one thing I do not have 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.330
 What is your father y'know 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.510
 My father left two years ago and until today. 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.030
 I can not understand why 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.159
 Do you have father if you have an ox? 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.600
 if you have a home if you have a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.150
 food on the table 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 if you have a clean bed that you had 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.370
 if you are healthy if you see 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.700
 you listen 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.690
 you overcome if you are and learn from 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.540
 your self 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.140
 then you happy then you come 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.630
 what money and success do not buy 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.500
 additional money purchase 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.649
 people but do not buy everything is not connected 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.110
 so I want you to live the best 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.549
 that we can have in life are the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.479
 basic things 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.770
 our family health a friend is a 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.619
 place to live 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.160
 Thank you, I have to believe, to live. 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:12.649
 in function of a dream 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.649
 I have a soul that is made of dreams.
