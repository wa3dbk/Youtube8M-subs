going to go into the ribcage we're going
to<00:01:55.430> isolate<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.060> ribcage<00:01:56.390> by<00:01:56.750> having<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.320> seat

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
to isolate the ribcage by having a seat

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.280 
to isolate the ribcage by having a seat
in<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.890> chair<00:01:58.270> because<00:01:59.270> once<00:01:59.810> you're<00:01:59.990> seated

in a chair because once you're seated
you<00:02:01.250> have<00:02:01.369> no<00:02:01.579> choice<00:02:01.880> but<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.270> keep<00:02:02.420> this

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
you have no choice but to keep this

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.030 
you have no choice but to keep this
still<00:02:02.930> otherwise<00:02:03.350> you'll<00:02:03.590> fall<00:02:03.619> right<00:02:03.860> off

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
still otherwise you'll fall right off

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.969 
still otherwise you'll fall right off
the<00:02:04.280> chair<00:02:04.840> now<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:05.900> can<00:02:06.110> lift<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.650> place<00:02:06.740> it

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
the chair now we can lift and place it

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.230 
the chair now we can lift and place it
behind<00:02:07.100> her<00:02:07.460> head

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
behind her head

behind her head
and<00:02:08.480> keeping<00:02:09.410> up<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.460> string<00:02:10.790> taut<00:02:11.060> you're

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
and keeping up the string taut you're

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.190 
and keeping up the string taut you're
going<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.050> go<00:02:12.170> left<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.450> right<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.080> you're

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
going to go left and right so you're

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.920 
going to go left and right so you're
holding<00:02:15.590> tight<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.490> we<00:02:16.610> have<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> leveler<00:02:17.330> now

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
holding tight so we have a leveler now

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.780 
holding tight so we have a leveler now
i'm<00:02:18.020> going<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.200> use<00:02:18.380> this<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.830> teach<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.760> a

i'm going to use this to teach you a
little<00:02:19.970> bit<00:02:20.150> about<00:02:20.300> body<00:02:20.810> movement<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.440> how

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
little bit about body movement and how

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.730 
little bit about body movement and how
to<00:02:21.770> use<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.250> i<00:02:22.670> really<00:02:23.510> believe<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.930> energy<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
to use it i really believe in energy the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.200 
to use it i really believe in energy the
more<00:02:24.920> energy<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.310> have<00:02:25.490> in<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:25.940> more<00:02:26.090> you

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
more energy you have in the more you

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.330 
more energy you have in the more you
give<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.780> your<00:02:26.870> partner<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.950> more<00:02:28.100> she

give to your partner and the more she
licks<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:28.820> receives<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.110> know<00:02:30.260> i<00:02:30.500> can

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
licks and receives it you know i can

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.560 
licks and receives it you know i can
give<00:02:30.950> her<00:02:30.980> all<00:02:31.160> my<00:02:31.190> energy<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:31.880> transfer

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
give her all my energy and transfer

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.470 
give her all my energy and transfer
energy<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.990> her<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.880> if<00:02:34.880> she<00:02:35.000> doesn't<00:02:35.210> want<00:02:35.360> to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
energy to her and if she doesn't want to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.940 
energy to her and if she doesn't want to
receive<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.020> can<00:02:36.140> totally<00:02:36.320> blocked<00:02:36.740> it

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
receive it you can totally blocked it

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.890 
receive it you can totally blocked it
but<00:02:37.760> first<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.090> all<00:02:38.120> i<00:02:38.330> need<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.600> learn<00:02:38.690> how<00:02:38.780> to

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
but first of all i need to learn how to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.500 
but first of all i need to learn how to
transfer<00:02:39.380> my<00:02:39.530> energy<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.010> how<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.190> use<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.910> so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
transfer my energy and how to use it so

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.510 
transfer my energy and how to use it so
i'm<00:02:41.600> going<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.780> use<00:02:41.960> this<00:02:42.140> i'm<00:02:43.070> going<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.340> start

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
i'm going to use this i'm going to start

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.760 
i'm going to use this i'm going to start
off<00:02:43.930> first<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.110> all<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.320> first<00:02:45.500> thing<00:02:45.620> i<00:02:45.680> want

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
to do is show you that if i'm holdin I'm

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.200 
to do is show you that if i'm holdin I'm
holdin<00:02:48.740> this<00:02:48.860> stick<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:49.820> I'm<00:02:49.910> going<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.090> go

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
holdin this stick so I'm going to go

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.570 
holdin this stick so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.390> hold<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.750> from<00:02:50.900> here<00:02:51.580> really

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
ahead and hold it from here really

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.000 
ahead and hold it from here really
simple<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.870> is<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.050> solid<00:02:54.470> mass<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.920> has

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
simple this is a solid mass it has

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.040 
simple this is a solid mass it has
energy<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.730> its<00:02:55.850> bouncing<00:02:56.270> energy<00:02:56.660> off<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:56.810> me

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
energy and its bouncing energy off of me

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.770 
energy and its bouncing energy off of me
it's<00:02:57.950> not<00:02:58.160> going<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.400> move<00:02:58.520> so<00:02:59.090> i<00:02:59.120> need<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.570> give

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
it's not going to move so i need to give

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.230 
it's not going to move so i need to give
energy<00:02:59.930> inwards<00:03:00.650> inwards<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.430> hold<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
energy inwards inwards to hold it the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.240 
energy inwards inwards to hold it the
