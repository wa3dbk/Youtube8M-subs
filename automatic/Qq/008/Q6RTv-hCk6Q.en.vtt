life at this point they're just kind of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
life at this point they're just kind of
throwing<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.350> us<00:01:19.530> which<00:01:19.710> gives<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> bad

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
throwing them at us which gives me a bad

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.390 
throwing them at us which gives me a bad
feeling<00:01:20.820> about<00:01:20.880> later<00:01:21.240> levels<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.170> know

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
feeling about later levels I don't know

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
feeling about later levels I don't know
probably<00:01:23.400> good<00:01:24.000> feeling<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> bad

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
probably good feeling that I have a bad

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.080 
probably good feeling that I have a bad
feeling<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.979> later<00:01:26.159> levels<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.700> don't

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
feeling about the later levels I don't

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.539 
feeling about the later levels I don't
know<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> put<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.600> any<00:01:27.810> other<00:01:27.930> way<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
know how to put it any other way so I

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.730 
know how to put it any other way so I
guess<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.479> means<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.290> some<00:01:31.500> tree

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
guess that means we have to do some tree

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.160 
guess that means we have to do some tree
