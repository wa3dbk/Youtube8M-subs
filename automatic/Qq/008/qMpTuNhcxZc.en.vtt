00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
tension very often but I went from a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.090 
tension very often but I went from a
metal<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> plastic<00:02:39.640> bomb<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.240> I<00:02:40.270> did<00:02:41.100> so

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
metal to a plastic bomb and so I did so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.620 
metal to a plastic bomb and so I did so
I'm<00:02:42.160> going<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.490> tighten<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:42.880> back<00:02:43.030> down<00:02:45.630> that

way

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.840 

makes<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.650> big<00:02:55.800> difference<00:02:56.220> if<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.490> go<00:02:56.640> from

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
makes a big difference if you go from

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.200 
makes a big difference if you go from
metal<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.330> plastic<00:02:58.580> it's<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.730> little<00:02:59.940> better<00:03:00.090> I

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
metal to plastic it's a little better I

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.620 
metal to plastic it's a little better I
tighten<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.690> up<00:03:00.810> too<00:03:01.020> much<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.410> looks<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:02.630> we

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
tighten it up too much it looks like we

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:14.890 
tighten it up too much it looks like we
just<00:03:03.660> have<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.050> tweak<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:06.500> submit<00:03:07.500> again
