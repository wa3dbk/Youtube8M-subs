00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
same in FIFA 11 to be fair that's a

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.370 
same in FIFA 11 to be fair that's a
pretty<00:01:39.090> decent<00:01:39.450> card<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.720> wouldn't<00:01:40.079> mind<00:01:40.229> using

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
pretty decent card I wouldn't mind using

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.060 
pretty decent card I wouldn't mind using
it<00:01:40.590> myself

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
it myself

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
it myself
especially<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> FIFA<00:01:42.240> 10<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:42.570> 191<00:01:43.140> heading<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
especially the FIFA 10 or 191 heading I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.289 
especially the FIFA 10 or 191 heading I
bet<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.100> could<00:01:44.280> score<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.640> lot<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.909> headers

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
bet you could score a lot of headers

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.539 
bet you could score a lot of headers
with<00:01:45.479> him<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> FIFA<00:01:46.619> 12<00:01:46.829> taking<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.220> big

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
with him but then a FIFA 12 taking a big

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.289 
with him but then a FIFA 12 taking a big
big<00:01:47.790> drop

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
big drop

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.649 
big drop

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
odd I did play him as a CDM in FIFA 12

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.380 
odd I did play him as a CDM in FIFA 12
as<00:01:55.920> did<00:01:56.460> most<00:01:56.670> people<00:01:56.729> because<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.270> was<00:01:57.360> a

as did most people because it was a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.179

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
90 pace that is unbelievable what an

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.750

improvement<00:02:14.480> he<00:02:14.840> has<00:02:14.930> had<00:02:15.110> over<00:02:15.860> two<00:02:16.099> years

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
improvement he has had over two years

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.809 
improvement he has had over two years
indeed<00:02:17.450> go<00:02:17.989> into<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.319> 75<00:02:18.860> in<00:02:19.069> FIFA<00:02:19.340> 12<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:19.730> was

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
indeed go into a 75 in FIFA 12 that was

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.640 
indeed go into a 75 in FIFA 12 that was
a<00:02:19.849> pretty<00:02:20.060> decent<00:02:20.180> non<00:02:20.510> rad<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.260> believe<00:02:21.530> he

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
a pretty decent non rad but I believe he

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.070 
a pretty decent non rad but I believe he
did<00:02:21.920> get<00:02:22.129> an<00:02:22.250> upgrade<00:02:22.549> to<00:02:22.760> 79<00:02:23.390> ordering<00:02:23.930> fee

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
did get an upgrade to 79 ordering fee

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.410 
did get an upgrade to 79 ordering fee
for<00:02:24.260> 12<00:02:24.500> -<00:02:24.680> he<00:02:25.069> did<00:02:25.190> get<00:02:25.310> an<00:02:25.400> inform<00:02:25.760> or<00:02:25.970> two<00:02:26.269> as

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
for 12 - he did get an inform or two as

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.759 
for 12 - he did get an inform or two as
while<00:02:26.659> I'm<00:02:26.810> pretty<00:02:27.019> sure<00:02:27.200> he<00:02:27.319> did<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.500> can't

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
while I'm pretty sure he did I can't

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.800 
while I'm pretty sure he did I can't
remember<00:02:27.950> too<00:02:28.250> much<00:02:28.819> but<00:02:29.120> I'm<00:02:29.239> sure<00:02:29.569> someone

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
remember too much but I'm sure someone

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.360 
remember too much but I'm sure someone
in<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.019> comment<00:02:30.319> section<00:02:30.620> will<00:02:30.769> let<00:02:30.950> me<00:02:31.099> know

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
in the comment section will let me know

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.819 
in the comment section will let me know
but<00:02:31.640> Emenike<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.269> is<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> huge<00:02:32.840> huge<00:02:33.530> upgrade

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
but Emenike that is a huge huge upgrade

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.490 
but Emenike that is a huge huge upgrade
63<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:35.030> 81<00:02:35.690> he'll<00:02:35.870> probably<00:02:35.989> get<00:02:36.170> downgraded

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
63 to 81 he'll probably get downgraded

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.440 
63 to 81 he'll probably get downgraded
next<00:02:37.340> year<00:02:37.549> I<00:02:37.700> don't<00:02:38.030> think<00:02:38.180> he'll<00:02:38.299> be<00:02:38.420> a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
next year I don't think he'll be a

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.729 
next year I don't think he'll be a
normal<00:02:38.750> team<00:02:38.900> actually<00:02:39.200> he's<00:02:39.290> moved<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.590> fill

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
normal team actually he's moved to fill

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.229 
normal team actually he's moved to fill
a<00:02:39.769> batch<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.159> I'm<00:02:40.250> not<00:02:40.310> sure<00:02:40.459> if<00:02:40.760> they'll<00:02:40.940> be<00:02:41.120> in

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
a batch in I'm not sure if they'll be in

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.809 
a batch in I'm not sure if they'll be in
3<00:02:41.750> for<00:02:41.959> 14<00:02:42.170> but<00:02:42.560> his<00:02:42.680> pace<00:02:42.920> did<00:02:43.129> take<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> big<00:02:43.610> hit

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
3 for 14 but his pace did take a big hit

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.500 
3 for 14 but his pace did take a big hit
in<00:02:43.940> head-to-head

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
in head-to-head

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.420 
in head-to-head
I<00:02:44.540> think<00:02:44.989> he's<00:02:45.079> got<00:02:45.230> 83<00:02:45.650> pace<00:02:45.950> now<00:02:46.160> back<00:02:46.400> to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
I think he's got 83 pace now back to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.119 
I think he's got 83 pace now back to
what<00:02:46.790> he<00:02:46.910> had<00:02:47.030> in<00:02:47.180> FIFA<00:02:47.780> 12<00:02:48.109> which<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.620> great

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
what he had in FIFA 12 which is great

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.500 
what he had in FIFA 12 which is great
and<00:02:49.280> he<00:02:49.370> won't<00:02:49.519> be<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:49.760> automating<00:02:50.209> actually

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
and he won't be in automating actually

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.180 
and he won't be in automating actually
hopefully<00:02:50.930> good<00:02:51.200> riddance<00:02:51.739> but<00:02:51.980> another

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
hopefully good riddance but another

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.339 
hopefully good riddance but another
