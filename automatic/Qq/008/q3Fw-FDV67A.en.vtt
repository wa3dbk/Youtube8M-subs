00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.700 
little bit more to be able to access
different<00:01:57.329> things<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.469> there

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
different things like you can see there

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.760 
different things like you can see there
I<00:01:58.740> am<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.399> struggling<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
I am kind of struggling to get the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.650 
I am kind of struggling to get the
camera<00:02:02.250> out

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.210 

and<00:02:08.660> it's<00:02:09.050> actually<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.440> little<00:02:09.619> bit<00:02:09.860> easier

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
and it's actually a little bit easier

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.680 
and it's actually a little bit easier
with<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.550> phone<00:02:10.759> being<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.360> there's<00:02:11.540> not

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
with the phone being that there's not

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.870 
with the phone being that there's not
pressure<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.380> push<00:02:12.590> against<00:02:12.890> but<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:13.730> like

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
pressure to push against but so like

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.520 
pressure to push against but so like
little<00:02:14.210> tabs<00:02:14.450> like<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.900> are<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.170> little<00:02:15.350> more

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
little tabs like that are a little more

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.680 
little tabs like that are a little more
difficult<00:02:16.070> like<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.400> can<00:02:16.580> see<00:02:16.790> whereas<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
difficult like you can see whereas the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.420 
difficult like you can see whereas the
otterbox<00:02:18.080> defender<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.740> don't<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.250> do

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
otterbox defender you don't have to do

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.100 
otterbox defender you don't have to do
that<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.210> it's<00:02:20.360> really<00:02:20.420> just<00:02:20.630> kind<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.020> a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
that so it's really just kind of a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.810 
that so it's really just kind of a
balance<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.620> what<00:02:21.830> you're<00:02:22.010> looking<00:02:22.340> for<00:02:22.550> if

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
balance of what you're looking for if

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.940 
balance of what you're looking for if
you<00:02:22.970> want<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.330> full<00:02:23.570> protection<00:02:23.840> then<00:02:24.770> we

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
you want the full protection then we

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.160 
you want the full protection then we
recommend<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.580> griffin<00:02:25.910> survivor<00:02:25.940> if<00:02:26.930> you

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
recommend the griffin survivor if you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.930 
recommend the griffin survivor if you
want<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.440> little<00:02:27.590> bit<00:02:27.680> less<00:02:27.980> than<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.370> otterbox

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
want a little bit less than the otterbox

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.910 
want a little bit less than the otterbox
defender<00:02:29.240> is<00:02:29.900> probably<00:02:30.350> your<00:02:30.530> way<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.740> go

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
defender is probably your way to go

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.040 
defender is probably your way to go
hoping<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.520> is<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.640> little<00:02:31.880> slimmer<00:02:32.300> also

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
hoping that it is a little slimmer also

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.140 
hoping that it is a little slimmer also
give<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.380> plenty<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.770> drop<00:02:34.400> protection<00:02:34.970> so

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
give it plenty of drop protection so

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.710 
give it plenty of drop protection so
that's<00:02:35.330> not<00:02:35.540> something<00:02:35.960> to<00:02:35.990> worry<00:02:36.080> about<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
that's not something to worry about the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.570 
that's not something to worry about the
otterbox<00:02:39.290> defender<00:02:39.410> comes<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.220> some<00:02:40.430> more

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
otterbox defender comes in some more

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.970 
otterbox defender comes in some more
colors<00:02:40.970> which<00:02:41.270> could<00:02:41.810> be<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.990> reason<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.709> buy

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
colors which could be a reason to buy
