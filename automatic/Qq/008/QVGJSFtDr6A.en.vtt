00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
out of fabric one thing that a lot of

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.230 
out of fabric one thing that a lot of
people<00:00:07.170> use<00:00:07.379> are<00:00:07.649> these<00:00:08.130> yo-yo<00:00:08.639> makers<00:00:09.030> by

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
people use are these yo-yo makers by

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.660 
people use are these yo-yo makers by
clover<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.590> can<00:00:10.769> get<00:00:10.889> them<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.309> all

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
clover and you can get them in all

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.850 
clover and you can get them in all
different<00:00:11.849> sizes<00:00:12.150> mine<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> 16<00:00:13.710> millimeter

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
different sizes mine is a 16 millimeter

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.730 
different sizes mine is a 16 millimeter
disc<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.420> problem<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.020> these<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.529> that

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
disc and the problem with these is that

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.490 
disc and the problem with these is that
when<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.490> make<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.910> fabric<00:00:18.300> yo-yo<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.109> doesn't

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
when you make a fabric yo-yo it doesn't

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
when you make a fabric yo-yo it doesn't
really<00:00:19.710> look<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.189> flower<00:00:20.660> although<00:00:21.660> you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
really look like a flower although you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.820 
really look like a flower although you
can<00:00:21.960> use<00:00:21.990> them<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.410> lot<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.680> other

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
can use them for a lot of other

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.130 
can use them for a lot of other
different<00:00:23.340> things<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.390> find<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
different things I just find that the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.200 
different things I just find that the
instructions<00:00:25.949> aren't<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.460> great<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.970> come

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
instructions aren't that great that come

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.060 
instructions aren't that great that come
with<00:00:27.359> these<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.779> they're<00:00:28.500> also<00:00:28.680> pretty

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
with these and they're also pretty

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.070 
with these and they're also pretty
expensive<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.910> since<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.599> don't<00:00:30.779> use<00:00:30.929> them

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
expensive and since I don't use them

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.470 
expensive and since I don't use them
that<00:00:31.140> often<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.890> decided<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.880> come<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that often I decided to come up with a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.450 
that often I decided to come up with a
better<00:00:33.870> way<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.320> make<00:00:34.559> them<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.309> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
better way to make them so that you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
better way to make them so that you
don't<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.940> use<00:00:36.090> any<00:00:36.450> other<00:00:36.930> equipment<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
don't have to use any other equipment so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.190 
don't have to use any other equipment so
this<00:00:38.610> one's<00:00:38.820> made<00:00:39.030> out<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.140> regular

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
this one's made out of just a regular

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.410 
this one's made out of just a regular
cotton<00:00:40.860> fabric<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.640> one's<00:00:41.879> made<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
cotton fabric and this one's made out of

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.000 
cotton fabric and this one's made out of
a<00:00:42.510> lighter<00:00:42.719> fabric<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.649> see<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
a lighter fabric so you can see it's a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.630 
a lighter fabric so you can see it's a
lot<00:00:44.160> flowier<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> show<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.680> how

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
lot flowier so I'm going to show you how

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.439

I<00:00:47.670> made<00:00:47.969> them<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:49.340> cut<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.059> regular

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
I made them so I cut just a regular

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.180 
I made them so I cut just a regular
piece<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.809> clothing<00:00:52.020> cotton<00:00:52.530> two<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> half

gathering stitch all the way along and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.859 
gathering stitch all the way along and
it<00:01:34.740> doesn't<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.579> neat<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.750> be

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
it doesn't have to be neat so it can be

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.399 
it doesn't have to be neat so it can be
a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:37.110> bit<00:01:37.320> messy<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.100> okay<00:01:38.490> if

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you're not the greatest hand seller

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
you're not the greatest hand seller
because<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.630> won't<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.140> when<00:01:43.290> you're

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
because you won't see it when you're

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
because you won't see it when you're
done<00:01:43.590> either<00:01:43.920> which<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.490> good<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.570> make

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
done either which is good so just make

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.499 
done either which is good so just make
really<00:01:46.140> big<00:01:46.320> stitches<00:01:46.850> all<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> way<00:01:48.210> along

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
really big stitches all the way along

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
really big stitches all the way along
and<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.110> only<00:01:49.290> important<00:01:49.860> thing<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and the only important thing is that

gathered<00:04:54.900> little<00:04:55.080> circle<00:04:55.680> so<00:04:56.600> because<00:04:57.600> I

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
gathered little circle so because I

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.010 
gathered little circle so because I
didn't<00:04:58.140> hide<00:04:58.890> my<00:04:59.310> raw<00:04:59.850> edges<00:05:00.150> of<00:05:00.480> my<00:05:00.630> fabric

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
didn't hide my raw edges of my fabric

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.050 
didn't hide my raw edges of my fabric
when<00:05:01.140> I<00:05:01.170> started<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.740> just<00:05:01.950> ironed<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.580> directly

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
when I started I just ironed it directly

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.500 
when I started I just ironed it directly
in<00:05:03.240> half<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:04.620> can<00:05:04.770> see<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.610> raw<00:05:05.820> ends<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.390> my

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
in half you can see the raw ends of my

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.270 
in half you can see the raw ends of my
fabric<00:05:06.900> in<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.140> middle<00:05:07.380> but<00:05:07.830> what<00:05:08.040> I'm<00:05:08.160> gonna

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
fabric in the middle but what I'm gonna

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.950 
fabric in the middle but what I'm gonna
do<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.580> fix<00:05:08.760> that<00:05:08.940> is<00:05:09.390> I'm<00:05:09.630> going<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:09.810> put<00:05:09.930> a

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
do to fix that is I'm going to put a

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.020 
do to fix that is I'm going to put a
little<00:05:10.140> button<00:05:10.500> in<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.710> center<00:05:11.010> so<00:05:11.700> that<00:05:11.730> it

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
little button in the center so that it

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.890 
little button in the center so that it
covers<00:05:12.390> it<00:05:12.510> up<00:05:12.600> and<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:15.450> then<00:05:15.600> you're<00:05:15.720> just

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
covers it up and so then you're just

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.750 
covers it up and so then you're just
gonna<00:05:16.020> take<00:05:16.260> your<00:05:16.680> thread<00:05:17.400> again<00:05:18.200> and<00:05:19.760> this

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
gonna take your thread again and this

time<00:05:20.820> for<00:05:21.750> buttons<00:05:22.140> I<00:05:22.290> always<00:05:22.590> recommend

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
time for buttons I always recommend

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.800 
time for buttons I always recommend
doubling<00:05:23.610> your<00:05:23.760> thread<00:05:24.060> because<00:05:24.420> you<00:05:24.540> want<00:05:24.750> it

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
doubling your thread because you want it

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.240 
doubling your thread because you want it
to<00:05:24.960> be<00:05:25.050> stronger<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:25.560> you<00:05:25.680> want<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:25.950> to<00:05:26.040> take

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
to be stronger and you want it to take

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.060 
to be stronger and you want it to take
less<00:05:26.910> time<00:05:26.940> when<00:05:27.630> you're<00:05:27.780> doing<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.350> but<00:05:28.560> when

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
less time when you're doing it but when

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.740 
less time when you're doing it but when
I'm<00:05:29.220> doing<00:05:29.490> any<00:05:29.730> other<00:05:29.850> kind<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.330> hand<00:05:30.540> sewing

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.840 
I'm doing any other kind of hand sewing
I<00:05:30.990> always<00:05:31.290> just<00:05:31.500> use<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.710> single<00:05:32.520> layer<00:05:32.700> of

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
I always just use a single layer of

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.880 
I always just use a single layer of
thread<00:05:33.120> which<00:05:33.330> means<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:33.870> only<00:05:34.260> tie<00:05:34.530> the<00:05:34.590> knot

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
thread which means you only tie the knot

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.090 
thread which means you only tie the knot
in<00:05:35.550> one<00:05:35.610> end<00:05:36.090> of<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:37.140> thread<00:05:37.350> instead<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:37.890> both

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
in one end of the thread instead of both

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:45.960 
in one end of the thread instead of both
of<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.430> ends<00:05:38.670> together

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.610 

okay<00:05:46.750> so<00:05:46.810> then<00:05:47.110> you're<00:05:47.260> just<00:05:47.410> going<00:05:47.590> to

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
okay so then you're just going to

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.260 
okay so then you're just going to
position<00:05:48.100> the<00:05:48.190> button<00:05:48.490> where<00:05:48.640> you<00:05:48.670> want<00:05:49.060> it

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
position the button where you want it

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.370 
position the button where you want it
and<00:05:50.160> going<00:05:51.160> from<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:52.450> back<00:05:52.720> of<00:05:53.020> your<00:05:53.140> little

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
and going from the back of your little

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:01.629 
and going from the back of your little
flower

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.189 

you're<00:06:02.210> gonna<00:06:02.360> just<00:06:02.599> start<00:06:02.810> to<00:06:02.960> sew<00:06:03.080> your

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
you're gonna just start to sew your

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.600 
you're gonna just start to sew your
button<00:06:03.259> on<00:06:04.689> also<00:06:05.689> as<00:06:06.470> a<00:06:06.530> side<00:06:07.009> note<00:06:07.039> it's

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
button on also as a side note it's

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.390 
button on also as a side note it's
easier<00:06:08.449> to<00:06:09.259> sew<00:06:09.439> the<00:06:09.620> button<00:06:09.919> on<00:06:10.009> the<00:06:10.159> flower

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
easier to sew the button on the flower

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.290 
easier to sew the button on the flower
if<00:06:10.849> you<00:06:11.719> have<00:06:12.080> a<00:06:12.590> button<00:06:13.400> that<00:06:13.580> opens<00:06:13.759> at<00:06:14.270> the

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
if you have a button that opens at the

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.909 
if you have a button that opens at the
top<00:06:14.629> and<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:14.900> holes<00:06:15.080> go<00:06:15.319> directly<00:06:15.800> through

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
top and the holes go directly through

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.459 
top and the holes go directly through
rather<00:06:16.550> than<00:06:16.819> the<00:06:16.969> kinds<00:06:17.300> of<00:06:17.389> buttons<00:06:17.599> that

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
rather than the kinds of buttons that

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:20.559 
rather than the kinds of buttons that
are<00:06:18.500> smooth<00:06:19.039> across<00:06:19.430> the<00:06:19.669> top<00:06:19.909> and<00:06:20.210> they<00:06:20.300> have

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
are smooth across the top and they have

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.409 
are smooth across the top and they have
like<00:06:21.530> a<00:06:21.560> loop<00:06:21.860> of<00:06:22.039> plastic<00:06:22.610> on<00:06:22.759> the<00:06:22.879> back<00:06:23.090> of

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
like a loop of plastic on the back of

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.420 
like a loop of plastic on the back of
them<00:06:23.599> because<00:06:24.050> that's<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.830> kind<00:06:25.039> of<00:06:25.129> button

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
them because that's the kind of button

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.219 
them because that's the kind of button
that<00:06:25.580> I<00:06:25.610> used<00:06:25.909> on<00:06:26.060> this<00:06:26.360> flower<00:06:26.629> and<00:06:26.840> it<00:06:27.080> was<00:06:27.199> a

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
that I used on this flower and it was a

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.279 
that I used on this flower and it was a
lot<00:06:27.560> harder<00:06:27.949> to<00:06:28.280> get<00:06:28.490> underneath<00:06:29.449> there<00:06:30.020> and

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
lot harder to get underneath there and

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.830 
lot harder to get underneath there and
sew<00:06:30.680> that<00:06:30.889> button<00:06:31.099> on<00:06:31.370> nice<00:06:31.669> and<00:06:31.879> tight<00:06:32.180> so<00:06:32.210> I

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
sew that button on nice and tight so I

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.809 
sew that button on nice and tight so I
definitely<00:06:33.680> recommend<00:06:33.919> these<00:06:34.219> kinds<00:06:34.729> of

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:34.819 
definitely recommend these kinds of

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.640 
definitely recommend these kinds of
buttons<00:06:35.000> that<00:06:35.270> have<00:06:35.690> the<00:06:35.900> holes<00:06:36.139> that<00:06:36.469> go

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
buttons that have the holes that go

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:55.650 
buttons that have the holes that go
straight<00:06:37.129> through<00:06:37.340> the<00:06:37.520> front

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.410
