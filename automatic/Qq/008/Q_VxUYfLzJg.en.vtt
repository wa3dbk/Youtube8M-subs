00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.530

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.650
 hello everyone how about in this video os 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.160
 I bring a new contest so that 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.800
 try the 3 m wave set 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.539
 imperfect are 5 products that I'm going to 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.789
 show right now and the other under me 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.210
 I think you can see how I have the 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.550
 hair I have done the modality of waves 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.890
 surfers and the truth is that it has 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.690
 liked the result that gives the hair like 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.879
 with a lot of volume you can see that I have my hair 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.309
 I do not have it that way and it has not cost me anything 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.680
 to do it I have been these waves for 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.329
 here that I like how is this is a 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.640
 way of doing this that will take so much 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.090
 de andrÃ©s imperfecta is a bit like 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.710
 imitating how they have water hair 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.739
 of the sea the surfers in a that this 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.540
 I have to use waves waves 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.310
 soft that is how we have left then that 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.960
 working with the iron undoing 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.210
 how much and is ready is a very 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.340
 soft very easy to do the first 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.409
 two products are these that are the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.079
 shampoo and wave conditioner 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.360
 imperfect this you already know as of 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.490
 normal way we apply the shampoo myself 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.950
 I apply it twice, we apply it 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.259
 once I massage both well for everything 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.780
 hair and rinse second time massage 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.759
 masters again well and we clarify this 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.829
 shampoo I liked because it is very soft 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.360
 It gives as much creaminess to the hair 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.710
 little that we apply in fact not 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.119
 you need to throw a lot here like this 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.770
 we throw more than enough in shampoos that 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.780
 are born a lot of foam and encourage your face 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.700
 foam before we apply more than the bill 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.289
 to see this swim with a little me 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.000
 I usually throw it out so I extend it a little 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.069
 like all the hair and then I'm going 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.159
 Massaging the soft scalp with 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:51.100
 the fingertips and it's already clarified 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.810
 after the shampoos and we use the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.119
 Conditioner also walks without 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.179
 perfect the conditioner has 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.470
 delighted I always use conditioner 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.450
 because if I do not have my hair like this 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.920
 rough and when combing I take it more 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.179
 hair in front and there I like that 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.530
 be very soft 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.390
 I always use conditioner with which 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.519
 I tried a lot of conditioners 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.380
 and he liked it a lot I 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.790
 I say it here we go that I do not have why 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.410
 say what I'm doing is this 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.340
 draw but it really has 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.540
 liked it very much he applied it normally 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.610
 I do not get to the scalp at all 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.130
 from here more or less down is 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.139
 very soft and nothing else to apply it already 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.280
 notes that hair that slides me 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.020
 love but 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.910
 then you see that there is no hair left 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.860
 super loose there is nothing left in the middle neither 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.780
 heavy or nothing remains with volume and very 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.819
 alright so this would be the second 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.709
 project I insist for it so that 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.480
 participate because whoever takes it 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.459
 I think you will love the following 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 two products are these two that are the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.180
 mousse to get the waves effect 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.209
 soft and spray to get the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.830
 waves effect the mousse if 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.690
 we want the soft waves effect what 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.069
 we have to do is we wash and 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.239
 we conditioned the hair with both 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.730
 products that you just showed 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.700
 then we apply the mousse on the hand and 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.620
 we extend it from stockings to ends 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.680
 combing the hair well and once done 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.019
 that we dry once dry we go through the 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.170
 other illas doing waves and with the 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.120
 hands of spain masters this product what 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.790
 get is that the waves remain 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.310
 defined but messy a little bit 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.140
 soft not very marked waves are worth 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.180
 then they are well defined but 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.950
 are suavitas and volume has 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.050
 seaweed extract and this also 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.030
 has is to treat the marinas and this 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.130
 product is for waves surfing has been 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.900
 used me now what we're going to do 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.790
 it is we wash our hair 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.250
 with the shampoo and the condition 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.980
 and comb the hair and apply the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.420
 spray all over the hair is a spray like 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.430
 a liquid worthy we take flick flock 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.890
 it flows through all the hair what we do 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.290
 once done that is drying the hair with 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.629
 the dryer I eat upside down and move 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.280
 so dry it for the most part let's say that 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.859
 we remove the fat but that is still 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.569
 a little bit wet and once it's like that 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.459
 almost dry but still a bit humid 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.959
 We divide the hair into three sections 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.599
 we do as well as if it were a headband 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.030
 let's say and we take the back and 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.439
 afterwards so two sections 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.109
 would be these two actions and then the 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:11.200
 headband is the back and each 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:15.270
 section we take it and we make it a 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.900
 Pacifier we make it like that so like that 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.670
 everything all everything and we roll up and once 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.130
 let's have it rolled up in the churrito 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.740
 we grabbed it with a fork here and 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.810
 with the dryer we are going to dry like that in that 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.390
 posture is worth the 3 churretes that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.370
 we will have one here back one here and another 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.710
 here we dry with the dryer well fine 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.080
 to dry the hair completely and 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.240
 then we let go and when you let go is when 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.690
 we have our hair like this with this kind of 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.330
 wave what wave what is called surf 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.730
 ok and what this spray does is contribute 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.230
 a lot of texture and a lot of light a lot of volume 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.810
 Well, you see how I have it to my hair and 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.760
 if you can touch it it's like chubby 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.590
 soft and loose but like chubby with 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.540
 then good volume then to your 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.760
 taste and I usually do a little bit like that 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.230
 to give it a little volume too 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.170
 It depends how you have used the hair 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.970
 if you have it already a bit curly then with 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.040
 the fingers what you have to do is give 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.810
 shape your curls me as I do not have 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.060
 curly because what I do is a bit 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.920
 so to have this aspect that takes that 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.990
 I really like that it's like with volume 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.880
 but it's kind of messy with 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.800
 bad crazy good then these would be 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.180
 the two products first wash and 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.880
 condition with him 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.669
 and the conditioner and then the mousse 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.039
 for the soft waves with the iron and 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.490
 mess with hands and spray 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.770
 textured for surfer waves with 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.990
 the pacifiers and the dryer and finally 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.669
 the fifth product the fixative spray 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.410
 imperfect waves that what it does is 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.169
 keep the hairstyle but leaving it 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.759
 loose and avoiding frizz one 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.610
 once we finish either of the two 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:50.100
 things we apply it and the hair is left 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.050
 well you see very loose but keeps the 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.970
 shape of the waves not so now that you 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.800
 I have told what these five are 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.690
 products how they are used and for what 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.599
 they are worth and I have already created a desire

 contest as I tell you are going to be these 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.830
 five products the complete set is worth 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.139

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.120
