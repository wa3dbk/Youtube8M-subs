00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.840
 hello girls and very welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.089
 today I bring you a short review of the 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.120
 new shades in maybelline cream 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:16.710
 which are ours are from the line of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.500
 arzu copper that is now spring 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.330
 of 2014 so they came out very 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.450
 little for sale 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.900
 I know that many girls are trying 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.690
 to get them over here and the truth that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.390
 I did not even know that I had already left 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.629
 this collection but I saw it when I went to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.300
 the pharmacy the other day and I called the 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.230
 attention so I said we do that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 buy because I know how are you 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.199
 maybelline cream shades that are 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.170
 very good and the colors are not my 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.649
 favorite colors so that's why the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.649
 I bought 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 here I have 5 of the colors actually 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.579
 6 are 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.560
 but the sixth was a black monkey and the 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.229
 true that I never paint with black 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.250
 so I thought that for me I did not have 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.520
 I mean buy the black but those who 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.030
 I bought are nur brown and one 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.030
 Golden 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 I'm going to start with the two nude shades 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.719
 from here it's called 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.990
 and this one here is called beijing 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:50.640
 This is the worst neuro 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 I tried it once and I liked it a lot 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.869
 it is so that as the name says it is a 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.270
 Very very good jour for the base 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.990
 you can put any color on top 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.220
 and it highlights you and most of all the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.220
 me the function that these have is that I 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.530
 last all day the color that I put 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.780
 because my eyelids are very oily 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.049
 then it very easily starts to me 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.590
 move the makeup and this makes me 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.920
 I last all this in the beijing 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.010
 beauty 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.319
 there is a champagne color a little bit 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.160
 softest doradito 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.960
 there is 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:49.860
 this if what you have is that when you 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.130
 apply I feel that it is not very uniform 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.460
 let's say that in some areas the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.690
 color is stronger and in other areas it is 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.230
 less strong 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.870
 that's something I did not like the same 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.780
 I think it's beautiful if I'm going to 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.070
 keep using the next two are the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.070
 brown colors 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:20.340
 east of here is the click is country and this 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.760
 from here is the complement knot 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.720
 the lichen spies 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:32.110
 That's when you open it 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.110
 there is look at the pigmentation that has 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.870
 already this is one of the first 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.950
 provides 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.610
 at work and I used it just like that 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.060
 no other color up and lasted me 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.940
 perfectly 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.760
 all day of work and after the 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.220
 night when I go to university 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.840
 I also had a good time so I loved it 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.420
 it's a brown and tsonga 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.490
 complement 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.840
 This reminds me a lot 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.840
 bronze delivery 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.049
 but what is 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.049
 there is the component 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.180
 very nice the color is also like a 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:29.840
 little more pulling to gray or something like that 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:36.940
 definitely this is the most brown of 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.940
 all and finally we have the one that armed 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:48.890
 that's when I opened it is divine 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:52.270
 it is a more golden golden 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:56.690
 maybe pulling a little copper 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:01.000
 because if it looks like it has toned 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.000
 a red pact there is 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.740
 I can bring it closer so they can see each other 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.220
 all right 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.840
 but it is beautiful this color is that good 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.550
 these are the five colors that you buy 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.000
 they are the most numbers because I tell them 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:24.009
 I am very basic for colors for 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.660
 me is not nothing else I liked a lot 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:31.600
 the one that I liked least is the one here 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.710
 beijing beauty 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.790
 and the one I liked the most was the brown 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:43.270
 He cited the click in space of the most colors 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.280
 clear yet my favorite is the pearl and 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.150
 turn on the number 70 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:53.980
 that number changes nothing but these are 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:57.300
 pretty cute and if I had to 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.880
 to buy again I think they would buy 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.000
 more than anything this brown and both of 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:09.180
 down the beige jury I would not go back to 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.070
 buy the nord complÃ©ment more or less 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.560
 just that I'm telling you that the one 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.220
 I do not like is the beauty racing 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.860
 which is the one I'm wearing today I do not know if 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.750
 you will notice something not 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:28.389
 and they came out I think it was seven dollars 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.180
 each one more or less and well I'm the 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:34.050
 I'm really happy with them if 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.050
 I will continue to enjoy them 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.650
 I have to hate something to stop it 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.810
 use and the truth that seem colors 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.389
 that he 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.030
 that are for every day that the 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.720
 you can do more dramatic or less 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:54.020
 dramatic you can mix them with other 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.480
 bases and I have loved I did not tell them there 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.050
 one more that is in black that I did not buy it 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.770
 but I just wanted to show you these in a 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:07.660
 video so they would see better the 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:11.210
 consistency are very very creamy 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.810
 they really are very creamy when barely 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.810
 you buy them 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.490
 because they are new but I hope they do not 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.730
 dry very quickly because I opened them 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.160
 everyone so I'm going to have to go to 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.350
 using every day I'm great I hope 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.160
 that are very well and see you in the 

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.160
 next video
