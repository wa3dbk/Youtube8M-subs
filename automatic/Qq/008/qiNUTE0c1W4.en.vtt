sport is that it has the battery pack

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.740 
sport is that it has the battery pack
integrated<00:00:43.640> into<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.090> downtube<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.690> the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
integrated into the downtube of the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.130 
integrated into the downtube of the
frame<00:00:45.050> there<00:00:45.320> this<00:00:45.980> is<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.190> 36<00:00:46.700> volt<00:00:46.960> 8.7<00:00:47.960> amp

cells<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.790> nice<00:00:52.909> thing<00:00:52.940> about<00:00:53.140> the

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
cells and the nice thing about the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.710 
cells and the nice thing about the
position<00:00:54.650> here<00:00:54.949> is<00:00:55.070> that<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.820> battery<00:00:56.360> weight

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
position here is that the battery weight

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.660 
position here is that the battery weight
is<00:00:56.960> pretty<00:00:57.170> low<00:00:57.589> and<00:00:57.920> centered<00:00:58.309> on<00:00:58.400> the<00:00:58.489> bike

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
is pretty low and centered on the bike

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.970 
is pretty low and centered on the bike
so<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.150> provides<00:00:59.480> for<00:00:59.780> good<00:01:00.050> overall<00:01:00.379> handling

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
so it provides for good overall handling

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.189 
so it provides for good overall handling
and<00:01:01.699> it's<00:01:01.879> also<00:01:02.030> pretty<00:01:02.300> well<00:01:02.510> balanced<00:01:02.960> for

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
and it's also pretty well balanced for

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.710 
and it's also pretty well balanced for
you<00:01:03.559> know<00:01:03.650> lifting<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.220> on<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.550> a<00:01:04.580> car<00:01:05.030> rack<00:01:05.300> or

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
you know lifting it on to a car rack or

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.170 
you know lifting it on to a car rack or
carrying<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.260> bike<00:01:06.440> upstairs<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.909> also

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
carrying the bike upstairs it also

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.960 
carrying the bike upstairs it also
easily<00:01:08.780> is<00:01:09.110> removable<00:01:09.860> by<00:01:10.040> unlocking<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:10.820> from

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
easily is removable by unlocking it from

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.250 
easily is removable by unlocking it from
the<00:01:11.060> other<00:01:11.180> side<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.630> I'll<00:01:11.690> show<00:01:11.870> that<00:01:12.050> here

bike and then extend the handle on the
battery<00:01:31.010> pack<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.460> then<00:01:31.670> just<00:01:31.880> pull<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.150> out

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
battery pack and then just pull it out

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.970 
battery pack and then just pull it out
like<00:01:32.300> that<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:33.140> pack<00:01:33.350> weighs<00:01:33.530> about<00:01:33.650> four<00:01:33.890> and

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
like that the pack weighs about four and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.650 
like that the pack weighs about four and
a<00:01:34.040> half<00:01:34.160> pounds<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:34.790> it's<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.120> pretty<00:01:35.480> light

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
a half pounds so it's a pretty light

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.140 
a half pounds so it's a pretty light
weight<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.860> here's<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.100> look<00:01:37.250> at<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.610> frame

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
weight so here's a look at the frame

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.360 
weight so here's a look at the frame

with the battery removed and you can see
the<00:01:40.490> battery<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.000> charger<00:01:41.450> down<00:01:41.630> here<00:01:41.990> both

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
the battery and charger down here both

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.870 
the battery and charger down here both
of<00:01:42.620> them<00:01:42.740> are<00:01:42.860> pretty<00:01:43.010> small<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.580> lightweight
