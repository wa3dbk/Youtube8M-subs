00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Last week in the end of the program 'This is Infinite' they opened to the public a music video of a duet music of Infinite Woohyun and SHINEE Key.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
These days duet activity between idols is popular. Among them SM The Ballad is in the center of this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The music 'Breath' song by Jonghyun of SHINEE &amp; Taeyeon of Girls Generation is gaining a lot of attention.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Besides them there is a Japanese version of Breath song by Max of TVXQ &amp; Krystal of f(x)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Also Chen of EXO &amp; Jang Leein sang Chinese version of Breath and is gaining a lot of attention too.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Sad to say we were only able to meet Jonghyun &amp; Taeyeon's performance on stage.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So WIDE camera prepared a video of the recital scenes of The SM Ballad. We will now show you!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
On 15th of February, main vocalists of SM gathered together and heated up the recital scenes just by their voices.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We were able to hear behind stories of this album which hasn't been released to the public.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Isn't this the first time singing with Jonghyun and Taeyeon?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yes

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Be frank! Didn't you have any problem when singing together?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Harsh question just from the start.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I was so thankful to Taeyeon for singing so sweetly. Actually I did the recording first thus I worried a lot.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Why?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I worried about whether or not I sang the music well but Taeyeon solved all my worries at one strike. She made up for all my shortages. Her voice is so beautiful.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But I think Jonghyun has various kinds of voices. So I felt more comfortable when singing.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Giving and taking. They were busy praising on each other. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No need to speak. We were able to confirm their harmony through this one stage. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This song's lyrics is a very faint and heartrending story. A couple parted from each other but were not able to forget about each other.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So they are earnestly wanting to hear even the sound of breath of each other. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The chinese version of this song was sang by Chen of EXO &amp; Jang Leein. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This is the example of same song but different atmosphere.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I am so honor to sing and be on stage with SM seniors through this album. On the other hand I am feeling quite nervous today.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I am in the group EXO which is the youngest team in EXO and today I will be on stage with SM seniors today so I will do my best.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I was only able to hear their harmonious voice through the album but I am so moved by sincerity after listening to the music directly from them.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Right after the stage, Chen sang another duet song with Krystal. I didn't know their voice was this much harmonious.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Also the harmony of their handsome and pretty appearance shows off the best chemistry between them. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
After the release of SM The Ballad, fans are busy imagining virtual duet group among idols. Top 3 of the virtual duet groups imagined by fans are!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Top 3 is Jessica &amp; Krystal who will inherit the sister family tree of K-Pop. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
All Korea's girl groups started out as a group of sisters.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Welcoming the glorious days of idols I think it would be great to let out a group of sisters.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
In the concert these two showed off a joint performance. Fans really want to see them on TV. Hope to see you again!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Top 2 is the collaboration stage of the top diva vocalist Ailee and Hyolyun.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
They both showed different versions of the same song. They were both praised from the fans. Next time I see you, I hope you two are singing together. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Top1 is the virtual duet activity between GD and Zico.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
When these two distinctive members make a collaboration stage, I can't help wonder how they would perform on stage.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Fans made an editted image of GD and ZICO.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Unbelievable!

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I will keep my eyes on whether or not fans' wishes will come true.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
SM The Ballad brought about popular trend of duet activities among many idol groups.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
They excluded performances and just with their sweet voices they were able to heat up the recital scenes until the last minute of the concert.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
S.M The Ballad's recital scenes showed beyond one's imagination. Their impressive story will be continued.[E
