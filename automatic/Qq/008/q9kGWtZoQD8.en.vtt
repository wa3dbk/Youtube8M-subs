00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
you do an arm workout you'll notice that

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.729 
you do an arm workout you'll notice that
your<00:00:45.790> arms<00:00:46.210> like<00:00:46.360> swell<00:00:46.840> up<00:00:47.050> they<00:00:47.290> grow<00:00:47.500> like<00:00:47.530> a

your arms like swell up they grow like a
good<00:00:47.890> half<00:00:48.160> an<00:00:48.340> inch<00:00:48.489> by<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.730> end<00:00:48.910> of<00:00:49.000> the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
good half an inch by the end of the

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.970 
good half an inch by the end of the
workout<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:49.630> have<00:00:49.720> veins<00:00:49.960> galore<00:00:50.440> well

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
workout and you have veins galore well

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.830 
workout and you have veins galore well
that's<00:00:51.190> because<00:00:51.340> you've<00:00:51.520> literally<00:00:51.910> engorge

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
that's because you've literally engorge

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.960 
that's because you've literally engorge
them<00:00:53.110> with<00:00:53.290> blood<00:00:53.530> by<00:00:53.980> activating<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.670> muscle

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
them with blood by activating the muscle

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.190 
them with blood by activating the muscle
every<00:00:55.059> time<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.390> squeeze<00:00:55.660> at<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:55.900> top<00:00:55.960> of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
every time you squeeze at the top of

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.049 
every time you squeeze at the top of
that<00:00:56.290> rep<00:00:56.530> you're<00:00:57.010> literally<00:00:57.280> forcing<00:00:57.850> blood

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
that rep you're literally forcing blood

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.340 
that rep you're literally forcing blood
into<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.449> muscle<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:58.839> that's<00:00:59.050> that's

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
into the muscle and that's that's

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.689 
into the muscle and that's that's
swelling<00:00:59.890> the<00:00:59.949> muscle<00:01:00.250> up<00:01:00.370> with<00:01:00.489> blood

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
swelling the muscle up with blood

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.160 
swelling the muscle up with blood
getting<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.059> veins<00:01:01.300> filled<00:01:01.629> up<00:01:01.809> with<00:01:01.930> blood

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
getting the veins filled up with blood

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.920 
getting the veins filled up with blood
so<00:01:02.800> that's<00:01:03.070> what<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.370> pump<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.910> you'll<00:01:04.690> also

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
so that's what the pump is you'll also

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.420 
so that's what the pump is you'll also
notice<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.470> at<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.710> end<00:01:05.830> of<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.980> full<00:01:06.220> arm

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
notice that at the end of a full arm

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.730 
notice that at the end of a full arm
workout<00:01:06.880> for<00:01:07.030> an<00:01:07.120> example<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:08.200> can<00:01:08.380> flex<00:01:08.590> your

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
workout for an example you can flex your

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.170 
workout for an example you can flex your
arms<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.190> they'll<00:01:09.310> be<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.430> good<00:01:09.700> deal<00:01:09.850> bigger

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
arms and they'll be a good deal bigger

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.390 
arms and they'll be a good deal bigger
than<00:01:10.390> usual<00:01:10.540> veins<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.470> whatnot<00:01:11.770> but<00:01:11.980> there's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
than usual veins and whatnot but there's

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.070 
than usual veins and whatnot but there's
really<00:01:12.520> no<00:01:12.700> lines<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.120> definition<00:01:13.570> left<00:01:13.780> into

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
really no lines of definition left into

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.960 
really no lines of definition left into
them<00:01:14.230> in<00:01:14.320> fact<00:01:14.650> sometimes<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.610> feel<00:01:15.760> like<00:01:15.820> you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
them in fact sometimes you feel like you

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.640 
them in fact sometimes you feel like you
can<00:01:16.120> barely<00:01:16.240> even<00:01:16.390> flex<00:01:16.810> them<00:01:16.990> after<00:01:17.260> workout

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
can barely even flex them after workout

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.710 
can barely even flex them after workout
well<00:01:18.220> that's<00:01:18.370> because<00:01:18.490> they're<00:01:18.730> so<00:01:19.180> over

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
well that's because they're so over

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.960 
well that's because they're so over
engorged<00:01:20.260> with<00:01:20.320> blood<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:20.890> that's<00:01:21.730> what<00:01:21.880> you

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
engorged with blood and that's what you

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.240 
engorged with blood and that's what you
don't<00:01:22.270> want<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.630> do<00:01:22.780> backstage<00:01:23.260> there<00:01:23.950> has<00:01:24.220> to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
don't want to do backstage there has to

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.350 
don't want to do backstage there has to
be<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.550> happy<00:01:24.760> medium

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
be a happy medium

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.080 
be a happy medium
you<00:01:25.510> want<00:01:25.720> to<00:01:25.840> use<00:01:26.290> lightweight<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:27.880> want

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
you want to use lightweight and you want

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.600 
you want to use lightweight and you want
to<00:01:28.180> definitely<00:01:28.360> activate<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.230> muscles<00:01:29.620> get

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
to definitely activate the muscles get

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.340 
to definitely activate the muscles get
the<00:01:30.790> veins<00:01:31.150> out<00:01:31.450> basically<00:01:31.870> wake<00:01:32.200> your

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
the veins out basically wake your

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.020 
the veins out basically wake your
muscles<00:01:32.680> up<00:01:32.800> turn<00:01:33.070> them<00:01:33.190> on<00:01:33.310> harden<00:01:33.760> them<00:01:33.850> up<00:01:33.940> a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
muscles up turn them on harden them up a

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.520 
muscles up turn them on harden them up a
little<00:01:34.210> bit<00:01:34.360> but<00:01:34.720> you<00:01:34.780> don't<00:01:34.810> want<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.140> overdo

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
little bit but you don't want to overdo

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.530 
little bit but you don't want to overdo
it<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:35.980> pump<00:01:36.220> them<00:01:36.340> up<00:01:36.400> too<00:01:36.700> much<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
it and pump them up too much to the

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.700 
it and pump them up too much to the
point<00:01:37.660> where<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:37.870> can't<00:01:38.080> even<00:01:38.230> hold<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.500> foot

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
point where you can't even hold a foot

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.950 
point where you can't even hold a foot
posed<00:01:38.920> on<00:01:39.070> stage<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:40.300> completely<00:01:40.720> cover

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
posed on stage and you completely cover

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.420 
posed on stage and you completely cover
up<00:01:41.140> all<00:01:41.290> your<00:01:41.410> lines<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:41.860> definition<00:01:42.310> with

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
up all your lines and definition with

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.540 
up all your lines and definition with
blood<00:01:42.670> that<00:01:43.270> will<00:01:43.420> backfire<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.130> key<00:01:45.310> is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
blood that will backfire so the key is

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.590 
blood that will backfire so the key is
to<00:01:45.610> use<00:01:46.120> really<00:01:46.390> light<00:01:46.750> weights<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:49.420> go

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
to use really light weights and just go

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.090 
to use really light weights and just go
for<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.870> good<00:01:50.080> amount<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.440> reps<00:01:50.680> really<00:01:50.950> just

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
for a good amount of reps really just

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.350 
for a good amount of reps really just
pumping<00:01:51.370> up<00:01:51.490> don't<00:01:51.820> worry<00:01:51.970> about<00:01:52.090> slow

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
pumping up don't worry about slow

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.300 
pumping up don't worry about slow
negatives<00:01:52.870> don't<00:01:53.110> worry<00:01:53.260> about<00:01:53.470> pausing<00:01:54.220> at

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
negatives don't worry about pausing at

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.650 
negatives don't worry about pausing at
the<00:01:54.370> bottom<00:01:54.760> because<00:01:55.180> none<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.480> has

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
anything to do with pumping up that's

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.990 
anything to do with pumping up that's
all<00:01:56.770> muscle<00:01:57.130> hypertrophy<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.700> strength

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
training with a pump up literally just

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.530 
training with a pump up literally just
keep<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.160> muscle<00:02:00.430> activated<00:02:01.090> so<00:02:01.210> fast

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
keep the muscle activated so fast

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.480 
keep the muscle activated so fast
movements<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.200> squeeze<00:02:03.010> that<00:02:03.190> blood<00:02:03.370> in

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
movements just squeeze that blood in

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.660 
movements just squeeze that blood in
there<00:02:03.700> um<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:04.680> basically<00:02:05.680> focus<00:02:06.190> on<00:02:06.280> hitting<00:02:06.460> my

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
pump up legs I cringe when I see

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.759 
pump up legs I cringe when I see
bodybuilders<00:02:13.060> backstage<00:02:13.510> doing<00:02:14.050> lunges<00:02:14.500> or

doing squats like I almost laughed to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.119 
doing squats like I almost laughed to
myself<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.260> biggest<00:02:17.650> mistake<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.069> the

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
myself it's the biggest mistake in the

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.339 
myself it's the biggest mistake in the
world<00:02:18.340> your<00:02:18.730> legs<00:02:19.120> work<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.810> opposite<00:02:20.230> of

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
world your legs work the opposite of

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.619 
world your legs work the opposite of
everything<00:02:20.590> else<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.879> more<00:02:22.060> blood<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.330> flow

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
everything else the more blood you flow

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.110 
everything else the more blood you flow
into<00:02:22.810> your<00:02:22.900> legs<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:24.310> more<00:02:24.459> bloated<00:02:24.730> they<00:02:24.940> get

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
into your legs the more bloated they get

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.530 
into your legs the more bloated they get
and<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:26.319> lose<00:02:26.500> all<00:02:26.530> your<00:02:26.860> lines<00:02:27.390> whereas<00:02:28.390> in

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and you lose all your lines whereas in

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.970 
and you lose all your lines whereas in
the<00:02:28.629> upper<00:02:28.810> body<00:02:28.989> obviously<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.590> more<00:02:29.769> blood

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the upper body obviously the more blood

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.040 
the upper body obviously the more blood
you<00:02:30.010> flow<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.459> there<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> point<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.870> better

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
you flow in there to a point the better

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.229 
you flow in there to a point the better
it<00:02:32.200> looks<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.739> never<00:02:33.099> ever<00:02:33.400> touch<00:02:33.879> your<00:02:34.060> legs

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
it looks so never ever touch your legs

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.339 
it looks so never ever touch your legs
that's<00:02:34.420> why<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.599> lot<00:02:34.689> of<00:02:34.840> trainers<00:02:35.200> actually

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
that's why a lot of trainers actually

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.530 
that's why a lot of trainers actually
will<00:02:36.340> recommend<00:02:36.700> not<00:02:36.819> even<00:02:37.030> training<00:02:37.420> legs

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
will recommend not even training legs

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.910 
will recommend not even training legs
that<00:02:37.689> we

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
that we

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.490 
that we
for<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.099> show<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:39.120> other<00:02:39.300> key<00:02:39.690> factor<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.380> to

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
for a show the other key factor is to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500 
for a show the other key factor is to
keep<00:02:40.620> yourself<00:02:40.950> warm<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.940> didn't<00:02:42.180> see<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.420> in

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
keep yourself warm you didn't see it in

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.570 
keep yourself warm you didn't see it in
this<00:02:42.630> footage<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.020> another<00:02:43.470> footage<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.489> can

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
walking onto the stage because you want

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.890 
walking onto the stage because you want

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
feet touch a cold towel floor again you

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.240 
feet touch a cold towel floor again you
lose<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.900> vascularity<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.709> lose<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.980> pump

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
lose that vascularity you lose that pump
