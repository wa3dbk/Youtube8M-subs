this is one of the brand new units that
just<00:05:09.940> came<00:05:10.090> out<00:05:10.210> recently<00:05:10.450> so<00:05:11.440> he's<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.620> super

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
just came out recently so he's a super

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.920 
just came out recently so he's a super
ray<00:05:12.010> of<00:05:12.070> course<00:05:12.310> for<00:05:12.550> star<00:05:12.850> he<00:05:13.360> is<00:05:13.510> a<00:05:13.690> light

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
ray of course for star he is a light

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.570 
ray of course for star he is a light
let's<00:05:14.170> say<00:05:14.260> he's<00:05:14.380> a<00:05:14.440> light<00:05:14.650> elemental<00:05:15.250> type

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
let's say he's a light elemental type

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.640 
let's say he's a light elemental type
light<00:05:15.850> light<00:05:16.180> type<00:05:16.390> or<00:05:16.540> whatever<00:05:16.810> I<00:05:17.080> don't

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
light light type or whatever I don't

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.020 
light light type or whatever I don't
know<00:05:17.740> I<00:05:17.770> didn't<00:05:18.130> do<00:05:18.190> too<00:05:18.340> much<00:05:18.370> research<00:05:18.850> on

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
know I didn't do too much research on

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.640 
know I didn't do too much research on
this<00:05:19.180> guy<00:05:19.390> at<00:05:19.570> all<00:05:19.720> so<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:19.990> don't<00:05:20.260> really<00:05:20.320> know

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
this guy at all so I don't really know

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.770 
this guy at all so I don't really know
what<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.010> hell<00:05:21.220> is<00:05:22.030> that<00:05:22.060> you're<00:05:22.450> gonna<00:05:22.570> be

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
what the hell is that you're gonna be

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.050 
what the hell is that you're gonna be
able<00:05:22.870> it<00:05:23.050> looks<00:05:23.200> like<00:05:23.350> he<00:05:23.470> does<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.890> ten<00:05:24.880> percent

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
able it looks like he does a ten percent

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.300 
able it looks like he does a ten percent
reduction<00:05:25.420> to<00:05:26.050> damage<00:05:26.440> from<00:05:26.530> dark<00:05:26.740> so<00:05:26.920> I<00:05:26.950> I

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
reduction to damage from dark so I I

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.160 
reduction to damage from dark so I I
heard<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:27.820> this<00:05:27.940> badge<00:05:28.270> is<00:05:28.420> actually<00:05:28.900> a

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
heard that this badge is actually a

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.620 
heard that this badge is actually a
reduction<00:05:29.890> type<00:05:30.070> of<00:05:30.280> units<00:05:30.820> or<00:05:31.330> something

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
reduction type of units or something

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.090 
reduction type of units or something
like<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:31.780> so<00:05:32.020> most<00:05:32.230> of<00:05:32.320> their<00:05:32.500> leaders<00:05:32.830> has<00:05:33.070> a

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
like that so most of their leaders has a

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.980 
like that so most of their leaders has a
reduction<00:05:33.670> type<00:05:33.850> so<00:05:34.060> this<00:05:34.450> guy<00:05:34.570> does<00:05:34.720> a<00:05:34.750> ten

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
reduction type so this guy does a ten

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.750 
reduction type so this guy does a ten
percent<00:05:35.080> reduction<00:05:35.350> to<00:05:35.830> dark<00:05:36.430> type<00:05:36.610> so

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
percent reduction to dark type so

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.950 
percent reduction to dark type so
definitely<00:05:37.120> I<00:05:37.180> guess<00:05:37.540> that<00:05:37.720> it<00:05:37.810> could<00:05:37.930> be

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
definitely I guess that it could be

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.550 
definitely I guess that it could be
pretty<00:05:38.170> good<00:05:38.440> on<00:05:38.590> a<00:05:39.000> mono<00:05:40.000> light<00:05:40.360> team<00:05:40.660> and<00:05:40.960> is

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
pretty good on a mono light team and is

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.440 
pretty good on a mono light team and is

dealt during spark for three turns or
something<00:05:59.800> like<00:05:59.919> that<00:05:59.980> so<00:06:00.280> that's<00:06:00.400> pretty

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
something like that so that's pretty

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.400 
something like that so that's pretty
cool<00:06:00.730> that's<00:06:01.360> not<00:06:01.510> bad<00:06:01.690> at<00:06:01.720> all<00:06:01.870> I<00:06:01.930> mean<00:06:02.020> he

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
cool that's not bad at all I mean he

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.900 
cool that's not bad at all I mean he
doesn't<00:06:02.710> hit<00:06:02.830> that<00:06:03.010> much<00:06:03.280> but<00:06:03.460> that's<00:06:03.610> okay

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
doesn't hit that much but that's okay

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.190 
doesn't hit that much but that's okay
i'm<00:06:04.030> pretty<00:06:04.390> sure<00:06:04.570> it's<00:06:04.780> a<00:06:04.810> pretty<00:06:05.020> powerful

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
i'm pretty sure it's a pretty powerful

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.740 
i'm pretty sure it's a pretty powerful
move<00:06:05.620> and<00:06:06.400> like<00:06:06.490> i<00:06:06.580> said<00:06:06.640> he<00:06:06.850> does<00:06:07.030> so<00:06:07.300> i<00:06:07.330> guess

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
move and like i said he does so i guess

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.120 
move and like i said he does so i guess
i<00:06:07.960> guess<00:06:08.080> i'm<00:06:08.290> thinking<00:06:08.620> i'm<00:06:08.710> thinking<00:06:08.740> here

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
i guess i'm thinking i'm thinking here

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.080 
i guess i'm thinking i'm thinking here
if<00:06:09.430> you<00:06:09.729> i<00:06:10.150> guess<00:06:10.660> if<00:06:10.810> you<00:06:11.640> if<00:06:12.640> you<00:06:12.760> have<00:06:12.880> a<00:06:12.910> lot

if you i guess if you if you have a lot

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.390 
if you i guess if you if you have a lot
of<00:06:13.120> units<00:06:13.450> that<00:06:13.510> sparking<00:06:14.169> or<00:06:14.350> whatever<00:06:15.040> this

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
of units that sparking or whatever this

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.820 
of units that sparking or whatever this
this<00:06:15.460> definitely<00:06:16.290> this<00:06:17.290> is<00:06:17.350> definitely<00:06:17.500> a

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
this definitely this is definitely a

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.890 
this definitely this is definitely a
book<00:06:18.070> yeah<00:06:18.550> definitely<00:06:19.060> a<00:06:19.150> book<00:06:19.450> for<00:06:19.660> three

book yeah definitely a book for three

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.360 
book yeah definitely a book for three
turns<00:06:20.140> i'm<00:06:20.410> pretty<00:06:20.650> sure<00:06:20.830> that's<00:06:20.979> what<00:06:21.100> it<00:06:21.160> is

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
turns i'm pretty sure that's what it is
