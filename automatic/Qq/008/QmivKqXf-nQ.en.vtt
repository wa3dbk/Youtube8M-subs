friend on a spawn point kept killing
them<00:00:24.689> timed<00:00:25.050> how<00:00:25.199> long<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.500> took<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> kill<00:00:25.920> him

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
them timed how long it took to kill him

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.730 
them timed how long it took to kill him
I<00:00:26.160> took<00:00:26.460> an<00:00:26.699> average<00:00:26.849> now<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.840> reason<00:00:28.019> why<00:00:28.349> um

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
I took an average now the reason why um

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.250 
I took an average now the reason why um
this<00:00:29.490> might<00:00:29.730> not<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:29.970> accurate<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:31.080> on

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
this might not be accurate is because on

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.170 
this might not be accurate is because on
the<00:00:31.769> very<00:00:32.009> last<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> tested<00:00:32.940> which

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the very last one that I tested which

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.770 
the very last one that I tested which
was<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> storm<00:00:33.780> rifle<00:00:34.170> um<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:35.510> realized<00:00:36.510> now<00:00:36.750> I

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
was the storm rifle um I realized now I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
was the storm rifle um I realized now I
can<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.230> back<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:37.620> about<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.920> my<00:00:38.399> friend

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
can go back and think about it my friend

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.040 
can go back and think about it my friend
was<00:00:38.700> jumping<00:00:39.120> around<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.450> he<00:00:39.629> wasn't<00:00:39.930> really

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
was jumping around and he wasn't really

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
was jumping around and he wasn't really
wanted<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.500> participate<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> test<00:00:41.640> but

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
wanted to participate in the test but

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
wanted to participate in the test but
you<00:00:42.540> know<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> had<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.050> calm<00:00:43.260> him<00:00:43.410> down<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you know sit him down but like you're

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.959 
you know sit him down but like you're
doing<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> test<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> know<00:00:47.340> once<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.789> did

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
doing the test and you know once I did

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.090 
doing the test and you know once I did
it<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.710> three

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it was you know we have like three

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
it was you know we have like three
minutes<00:00:50.309> left<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> game<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.629> it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
minutes left in the game and so it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.330 
minutes left in the game and so it's
like<00:00:51.840> come<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.050> let<00:00:52.230> me<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.770> three

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
like come on let me just get these three

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.979 
like come on let me just get these three
left<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> forgot<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.210> put<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> UM

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
left because I forgot to put on the UM

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.920 
left because I forgot to put on the UM
unlimited<00:00:55.680> time<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.600> happened<00:00:57.899> was

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
unlimited time and so what happened was

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.110 
unlimited time and so what happened was
is<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.070> rushed<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> time<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
is I think I rushed the time on the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.689 
is I think I rushed the time on the
storm<00:01:00.539> rifle<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:01.559> those<00:01:02.010> times<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.640> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
storm rifle so I think those times are a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
storm rifle so I think those times are a
little<00:01:02.789> off<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.899> nevertheless<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.830> average

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
little off but nevertheless the average

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
little off but nevertheless the average
is<00:01:05.369> still<00:01:05.640> come<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.270> fairly<00:01:06.600> accurate

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
is still come out to be fairly accurate

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
is still come out to be fairly accurate
I<00:01:07.290> believe<00:01:07.590> anyway<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> assault<00:01:09.119> rifle

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
I believe anyway so the assault rifle

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
I believe anyway so the assault rifle
had<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.570> average<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:10.049> two<00:01:10.110> point<00:01:10.680> eight<00:01:10.830> one

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
had an average of two point eight one

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
had an average of two point eight one
eight<00:01:11.430> three<00:01:11.549> two<00:01:12.180> point<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.540> eight<00:01:12.659> three

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
eight three two point one eight three

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.320 
eight three two point one eight three
seconds<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.560> kill<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.430> suppressor<00:01:14.970> had<00:01:15.119> two

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
seconds to kill the suppressor had two

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.359 
seconds to kill the suppressor had two
point<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.720> five<00:01:16.140> seconds<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> kill<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
point one five seconds to kill and the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.490 
point one five seconds to kill and the
storm<00:01:17.610> rifle<00:01:17.880> at<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.420> point<00:01:18.689> nine<00:01:18.869> three

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
storm rifle at one point nine three

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.620 
storm rifle at one point nine three
seconds<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.979> kill<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> reason<00:01:20.759> why<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> say

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
seconds to kill and the reason why I say

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.359 
seconds to kill and the reason why I say
that<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.930> storm<00:01:22.170> rifle<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:22.860> off<00:01:23.100> is

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
that the storm rifle is a little off is

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.260 
that the storm rifle is a little off is
because<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:25.170> had<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.590> point<00:01:25.860> eight<00:01:26.009> 1.8<00:01:26.640> 1.9

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
because it had one point eight 1.8 1.9

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.670 
because it had one point eight 1.8 1.9
2.1<00:01:27.950> 1.9<00:01:28.950> again<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.490> 2.1<00:01:30.090> again<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.680> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
2.1 1.9 again and then 2.1 again and the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
2.1 1.9 again and then 2.1 again and the
reason<00:01:31.829> why<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.280> seems<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:32.700> off<00:01:33.030> is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
reason why that seems a little off is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.999 
reason why that seems a little off is
because<00:01:33.540> those<00:01:34.079> numbers<00:01:34.439> show<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
because those numbers show up in the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.679 
because those numbers show up in the
suppressor<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.610> they<00:01:35.700> sought<00:01:35.909> rifle<00:01:36.270> but

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
suppressor and they sought rifle but

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.140 
suppressor and they sought rifle but
they<00:01:36.810> show<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.409> two<00:01:37.439> times<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
they show up one or two times and when I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
they show up one or two times and when I
was<00:01:39.299> watching<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.689> video<00:01:39.900> talking<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
was watching a video talking with the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
was watching a video talking with the
halo<00:01:41.729> um<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.020> halo

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
halo um you know one of the halo

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.249 
halo um you know one of the halo
programmers<00:01:44.009> talking<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> weapons

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
programmers talking about the weapons

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.200 
programmers talking about the weapons
and<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> load<00:01:46.920> outs<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.340> stuff<00:01:47.549> he<00:01:47.970> talked

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and the load outs and stuff he talked

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.569 
and the load outs and stuff he talked
about<00:01:48.329> how<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.079> weapons<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
about how all the weapons like that you

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.639 
about how all the weapons like that you
create<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.049> supposed<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
create like that you get are supposed to

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.740 
create like that you get are supposed to
be<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.520> know<00:01:53.610> basically<00:01:54.149> all<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.720> same

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
be you know basically all the same

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.539 
be you know basically all the same
they're<00:01:55.140> supposed<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.619> basically<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
they're supposed to have basically the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.149 
they're supposed to have basically the
same<00:01:56.700> time<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.180> kills<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.950> rush

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
same time to kills and so I think I rush

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.399 
same time to kills and so I think I rush
the<00:01:59.369> storm<00:01:59.640> rifle<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the storm rifle and I think that that

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
the storm rifle and I think that that
one's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.799> little<00:02:01.950> off<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.610> nevertheless<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
one's a little off but nevertheless the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.740 
one's a little off but nevertheless the
average<00:02:03.899> times<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.500> round<00:02:05.070> 2<00:02:05.340> 2.0<00:02:06.000> seconds

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
average times all round 2 2.0 seconds

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.229 
average times all round 2 2.0 seconds
they<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:07.680> take<00:02:07.920> about<00:02:08.160> two<00:02:08.429> seconds<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.940> kill

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
they all take about two seconds to kill

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.390 
they all take about two seconds to kill
the<00:02:09.780> assault<00:02:10.349> rifle<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> suppressor<00:02:11.129> round

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the assault rifle the suppressor round

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.300 
the assault rifle the suppressor round
down<00:02:11.640> while<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> storm<00:02:12.629> rifle<00:02:12.989> round

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
down while the storm rifle round

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.100 
down while the storm rifle round
up<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.610> two<00:02:13.790> seconds<00:02:14.239> now<00:02:14.780> I'm<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.020> talk

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
up to two seconds now I'm going to talk

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.860 
up to two seconds now I'm going to talk
about<00:02:15.260> my<00:02:15.470> preferences<00:02:16.120> my<00:02:17.120> preference<00:02:17.660> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
about my preferences my preference to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.870 
about my preferences my preference to
use<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.500> suppressor<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.580> only<00:02:19.760> reason

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
use is the suppressor the only reason

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.120 
use is the suppressor the only reason
why<00:02:20.180> use<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.569> suppressor<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.260> probably

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
why use the suppressor is probably

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.520 
why use the suppressor is probably
because<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:23.060> has<00:02:23.300> more<00:02:23.330> rounds<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.260> has<00:02:24.349> about

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
because it has more rounds it has about

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.740 
because it has more rounds it has about
50<00:02:25.010> rounds<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.520> this<00:02:25.640> magazine<00:02:25.880> all<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
50 rounds in this magazine all the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.440 
50 rounds in this magazine all the
assault<00:02:27.080> rifle<00:02:27.440> lacks<00:02:27.709> at<00:02:27.950> 32<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.150> storm

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
assault rifle lacks at 32 but the storm

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.330 
assault rifle lacks at 32 but the storm
rifle<00:02:29.870> has<00:02:30.230> like<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> hundred<00:02:30.739> percent<00:02:31.010> and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
rifle has like a hundred percent and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.390 
rifle has like a hundred percent and
I'll<00:02:31.400> get<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.790> in<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.120> minute<00:02:32.560> now<00:02:33.560> also<00:02:34.370> i

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
I'll get to that in a minute now also i

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.339 
I'll get to that in a minute now also i
use<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.790> suppressor<00:02:35.239> mainly<00:02:35.870> because<00:02:35.900> it

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
use the suppressor mainly because it

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.380 
use the suppressor mainly because it
looks<00:02:36.560> cooler<00:02:36.860> i<00:02:37.130> don't<00:02:37.459> know<00:02:37.550> i<00:02:37.580> just<00:02:37.819> like<00:02:38.209> it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
looks cooler i don't know i just like it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.830 
looks cooler i don't know i just like it
more<00:02:38.599> um<00:02:39.880> maybe<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.030> think<00:02:41.269> it's<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.450> little<00:02:41.690> more

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
more um maybe I think it's a little more

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.020 
more um maybe I think it's a little more
inaccurate<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.920> assault<00:02:43.160> rifle<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.700> think

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
inaccurate in the assault rifle I think

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.190 
inaccurate in the assault rifle I think
the<00:02:44.150> assault<00:02:44.420> rifles<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.780> little<00:02:45.050> more

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
the assault rifles a little more

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.100 
the assault rifles a little more
accurate<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:46.130> whatever<00:02:46.519> I<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.299> a<00:02:47.330> lot<00:02:47.420> so

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
accurate but whatever I like it a lot so

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.020 
accurate but whatever I like it a lot so
what<00:02:49.069> I<00:02:49.100> want<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.310> talk<00:02:49.400> about<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.760> storm

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030

don't<00:03:14.989> like<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.410> because<00:03:15.590> they<00:03:15.830> think<00:03:15.890> that

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
don't like that because they think that

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.610 
don't like that because they think that
makes<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.640> gun<00:03:16.790> worse<00:03:17.109> truly<00:03:18.109> it<00:03:18.290> does<00:03:18.470> not

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
makes the gun worse truly it does not

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.080 
makes the gun worse truly it does not
make<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:19.010> gun<00:03:19.160> worse<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.549> reason<00:03:19.850> why<00:03:20.030> it

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
make the gun worse the reason why it

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.880 
make the gun worse the reason why it
doesn't<00:03:20.420> make<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.660> gun<00:03:20.810> worse<00:03:21.019> is<00:03:21.260> because

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
doesn't make the gun worse is because

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.650 
doesn't make the gun worse is because
with<00:03:22.130> with<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.910> suppressor<00:03:23.180> on<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.510> assault

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
with with the suppressor on the assault

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.349 
with with the suppressor on the assault
rifle<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.440> have<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.799> reload<00:03:25.190> right<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:26.120> run

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
rifle you have to reload right you run

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.420 
rifle you have to reload right you run
out<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.480> ammo<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.140> reload<00:03:27.709> just<00:03:28.130> like<00:03:28.250> any

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
out of ammo you reload just like any

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.390 
out of ammo you reload just like any
other<00:03:28.489> gun<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.660> with<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.109> storm<00:03:30.530> rifle<00:03:31.100> you

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
other gun but with the storm rifle you

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.130 
other gun but with the storm rifle you
don't<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:31.970> reload<00:03:32.359> you<00:03:32.840> just<00:03:32.989> have<00:03:33.079> to

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
don't have to reload you just have to

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.900 
don't have to reload you just have to
wait<00:03:33.290> for<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.560> cool<00:03:33.739> down<00:03:33.799> so<00:03:34.609> my

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
wait for it to cool down so my

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.910 
wait for it to cool down so my
suggestion<00:03:35.359> class<00:03:35.750> for<00:03:36.019> this<00:03:36.140> would<00:03:36.620> be<00:03:36.769> the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
suggestion class for this would be the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.729 
suggestion class for this would be the
storm<00:03:37.220> rifle<00:03:37.579> as<00:03:37.670> primary<00:03:38.239> running<00:03:39.109> firepower

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
storm rifle as primary running firepower

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.190 
storm rifle as primary running firepower
and<00:03:40.069> then<00:03:40.700> have<00:03:40.940> probably<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.569> suppressor<00:03:42.170> or

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
and then have probably a suppressor or

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.259 
and then have probably a suppressor or
the<00:03:42.440> assault<00:03:42.739> rifle<00:03:43.069> or<00:03:43.220> any<00:03:43.670> other<00:03:43.850> gun<00:03:44.120> you

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
the assault rifle or any other gun you

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.420 
the assault rifle or any other gun you
want<00:03:44.510> in<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.720> background<00:03:45.170> or<00:03:45.380> in<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.950> bag<00:03:46.130> or

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
want in the background or in the bag or

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.900 
want in the background or in the bag or
as<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.359> secondary<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:49.220> then<00:03:49.459> what<00:03:49.579> you<00:03:49.670> need<00:03:49.819> to

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
as a secondary and then what you need to

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.690 
as a secondary and then what you need to
do<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.239> one<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:50.900> storm<00:03:51.230> rifle<00:03:51.620> overheats<00:03:52.190> you

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
do is one that storm rifle overheats you

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.920 
do is one that storm rifle overheats you
know<00:03:52.790> even<00:03:52.970> if<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.269> just<00:03:53.299> killed<00:03:53.630> someone<00:03:53.810> you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
know even if you just killed someone you

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.930 
know even if you just killed someone you
switch<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.739> other<00:03:54.829> weapon<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:55.700> let's<00:03:55.850> say

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
switch to the other weapon so let's say

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.460 
switch to the other weapon so let's say
it's<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.150> suppressor<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:57.019> switched<00:03:57.319> your

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
it's a suppressor you switched your

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.129 
it's a suppressor you switched your
suppressor<00:03:58.130> but<00:03:58.549> keep<00:03:58.760> in<00:03:58.940> mind<00:03:58.970> let's<00:03:59.870> put<00:04:00.049> it

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
suppressor but keep in mind let's put it

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.900 
suppressor but keep in mind let's put it
this<00:04:00.170> way<00:04:00.440> if<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:01.040> have<00:04:01.220> an<00:04:01.310> assault<00:04:01.579> riffle<00:04:01.850> a

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
this way if you have an assault riffle a

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.000 
this way if you have an assault riffle a
suppressor<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.840> run<00:04:03.019> out<00:04:03.139> of<00:04:03.470> ammo<00:04:03.859> in<00:04:03.920> the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
suppressor you run out of ammo in the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
suppressor you run out of ammo in the
assault<00:04:04.250> rifle<00:04:04.549> you<00:04:04.639> switch<00:04:04.850> to<00:04:04.970> your

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
assault rifle you switch to your

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.670 
assault rifle you switch to your
suppressor<00:04:05.510> when<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.019> switch<00:04:06.200> back<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.500> the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
suppressor when you switch back to the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.750 
suppressor when you switch back to the
assault<00:04:07.040> rifle<00:04:07.069> you're<00:04:07.370> gonna<00:04:07.489> have<00:04:07.670> to

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
assault rifle you're gonna have to

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.610 
assault rifle you're gonna have to
reload<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.359> assault<00:04:08.630> rifle<00:04:08.989> but<00:04:09.440> when<00:04:09.530> you

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
reload the assault rifle but when you

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.590 
reload the assault rifle but when you
switch<00:04:09.859> back<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.310> storm<00:04:10.670> rifle<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.389> won't

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
switch back to the storm rifle you won't

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.120 
switch back to the storm rifle you won't
have<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:12.049> because<00:04:12.350> that's<00:04:12.620> already<00:04:12.829> cooled

I haven't checked to see how long it

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.190 
I haven't checked to see how long it

takes for it to recharge compared to
like<00:04:24.349> how<00:04:24.560> long<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.860> takes<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.159> reload<00:04:25.460> other

suppressing<00:04:57.860> um<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:59.360> thing<00:04:59.510> is<00:04:59.570> is<00:04:59.960> you

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
suppressing um and the thing is is you

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.990 
suppressing um and the thing is is you
might<00:05:00.230> say<00:05:00.440> oh<00:05:00.680> well<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:01.340> know<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.820> doesn't

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
might say oh well you know that doesn't

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.050 
might say oh well you know that doesn't
really<00:05:02.180> mean<00:05:02.390> anything<00:05:02.500> but<00:05:03.500> truly<00:05:04.100> it<00:05:04.550> does

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
really mean anything but truly it does

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.300 
really mean anything but truly it does
the<00:05:05.390> reason<00:05:05.750> why<00:05:05.900> is<00:05:05.960> because<00:05:06.160> after<00:05:07.160> that

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
the reason why is because after that

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.120 
the reason why is because after that
storm<00:05:07.580> rifle<00:05:08.030> cools<00:05:08.540> down<00:05:08.750> you<00:05:09.590> can<00:05:09.770> switch

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
storm rifle cools down you can switch

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.100 
storm rifle cools down you can switch
back<00:05:10.460> to<00:05:10.820> your<00:05:11.180> assault<00:05:11.390> rifle<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:11.870> let's<00:05:11.990> say

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
back to your assault rifle and let's say

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.900 
back to your assault rifle and let's say
you<00:05:12.200> get<00:05:12.350> in<00:05:12.440> that<00:05:12.470> predicament<00:05:12.800> again<00:05:13.280> you

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
you get in that predicament again you

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.810 
you get in that predicament again you
both<00:05:14.150> use<00:05:14.360> 32<00:05:14.780> rounds<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.590> both<00:05:15.770> reload<00:05:16.220> you

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
both use 32 rounds you both reload you

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.000 
both use 32 rounds you both reload you
switch<00:05:17.120> weapons<00:05:17.390> let's<00:05:18.170> say<00:05:18.320> that<00:05:18.350> person

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
switch weapons let's say that person

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.220 
switch weapons let's say that person
used<00:05:19.220> MO<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.790> their<00:05:19.940> pistol<00:05:20.330> before<00:05:20.450> trying

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
used MO and their pistol before trying

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.270 
used MO and their pistol before trying
to<00:05:21.290> kill<00:05:21.500> someone<00:05:21.740> else<00:05:21.950> and<00:05:22.100> they<00:05:22.160> never

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
to kill someone else and they never

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.950 
to kill someone else and they never
reload<00:05:22.730> it<00:05:22.880> they<00:05:23.240> have<00:05:23.390> to<00:05:23.420> sit<00:05:23.690> there<00:05:23.840> and

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
reload it they have to sit there and

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.020 
reload it they have to sit there and
reload<00:05:24.350> either<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.890> their<00:05:25.010> guns<00:05:25.250> well<00:05:25.730> you

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
reload either of their guns well you

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.340 
reload either of their guns well you
already<00:05:26.240> have<00:05:26.540> that<00:05:26.720> one<00:05:26.960> that's<00:05:27.140> already

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
already have that one that's already

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.810 
already have that one that's already
cooled<00:05:27.710> off<00:05:27.860> you<00:05:28.100> don't<00:05:28.160> have<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.460> waste<00:05:28.610> your

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
cooled off you don't have to waste your

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.150 
cooled off you don't have to waste your
time<00:05:28.880> reloading<00:05:29.570> that<00:05:29.720> one<00:05:29.870> so<00:05:30.590> that's<00:05:30.980> my

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
time reloading that one so that's my

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.400 
time reloading that one so that's my
little<00:05:31.340> trick<00:05:31.670> on<00:05:31.850> that<00:05:32.170> definitely<00:05:33.170> if<00:05:33.350> you

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
little trick on that definitely if you

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.100 
little trick on that definitely if you
leave<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.220> alone<00:05:34.430> for<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.300> long<00:05:35.510> enough<00:05:35.690> time

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
leave it alone for a long enough time

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.380 
leave it alone for a long enough time
you<00:05:36.140> will<00:05:36.860> come<00:05:36.890> back<00:05:37.160> with<00:05:37.730> a<00:05:37.760> completely

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
you will come back with a completely

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.900 
you will come back with a completely
functional<00:05:38.750> gun<00:05:39.200> and<00:05:39.440> you<00:05:40.430> know<00:05:40.550> one<00:05:40.730> of<00:05:40.760> the

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
functional gun and you know one of the

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.430 
functional gun and you know one of the
things<00:05:40.970> that<00:05:41.420> a<00:05:41.690> lot<00:05:41.870> of<00:05:41.900> people<00:05:42.080> don't<00:05:42.320> like

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
things that a lot of people don't like

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.950 
things that a lot of people don't like
about<00:05:42.590> this<00:05:42.950> is<00:05:43.130> if<00:05:43.700> you<00:05:43.850> miss<00:05:44.090> shots<00:05:44.360> it<00:05:44.630> will

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
about this is if you miss shots it will

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.130 
about this is if you miss shots it will
it<00:05:45.440> will<00:05:46.240> you<00:05:47.240> know<00:05:47.360> obviously<00:05:48.430> overheat<00:05:49.430> um

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
it will you know obviously overheat um

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.780 
it will you know obviously overheat um
but<00:05:51.140> the<00:05:51.650> assault<00:05:51.950> rifle<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.370> suppressor

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
but the assault rifle the suppressor

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.060 
but the assault rifle the suppressor
will<00:05:53.300> waste<00:05:53.540> ammo<00:05:54.020> even<00:05:54.380> if<00:05:54.470> you're<00:05:54.620> missing

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
will waste ammo even if you're missing

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.970 
will waste ammo even if you're missing
and<00:05:55.250> you<00:05:56.180> know<00:05:56.300> it's<00:05:56.510> kind<00:05:56.660> of<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:56.900> thing<00:05:57.140> is<00:05:57.410> I

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
and you know it's kind of the thing is I

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.120 
and you know it's kind of the thing is I
feel<00:05:58.970> like<00:05:59.030> the<00:05:59.330> storm<00:05:59.600> rifle<00:05:59.960> does<00:06:00.380> overheat

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
feel like the storm rifle does overheat

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.340 
feel like the storm rifle does overheat
faster<00:06:01.640> than<00:06:01.760> you<00:06:01.910> waste<00:06:02.180> ammo<00:06:02.720> with<00:06:03.200> the

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
faster than you waste ammo with the

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.250 
faster than you waste ammo with the
assault<00:06:03.620> rifle<00:06:03.650> and<00:06:04.010> suppressor<00:06:04.990> but<00:06:05.990> you

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
assault rifle and suppressor but you

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.870 
assault rifle and suppressor but you
know<00:06:06.350> the<00:06:06.860> reason<00:06:07.160> why<00:06:07.190> I<00:06:07.340> say<00:06:07.640> that<00:06:07.670> is

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
know the reason why I say that is

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.640 
know the reason why I say that is
because<00:06:08.060> if<00:06:08.600> you<00:06:08.990> take<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.290> assault<00:06:09.590> rifle

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
because if you take the assault rifle

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.800 
because if you take the assault rifle
and<00:06:10.010> you<00:06:10.100> stop<00:06:10.340> shooting<00:06:10.820> let's<00:06:11.360> say<00:06:11.480> you<00:06:11.570> stop

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
and you stop shooting let's say you stop

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.750 
and you stop shooting let's say you stop
shooting<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:12.110> you<00:06:12.230> have<00:06:12.350> 16<00:06:12.710> bullets<00:06:12.890> left<00:06:13.250> we

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
shooting and you have 16 bullets left we

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.220 
shooting and you have 16 bullets left we
used<00:06:13.880> to<00:06:13.940> have<00:06:14.060> those<00:06:14.210> 16<00:06:14.600> bullets<00:06:14.780> no<00:06:15.050> matter

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
used to have those 16 bullets no matter

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.870 
used to have those 16 bullets no matter
what<00:06:15.440> but<00:06:15.560> with<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.800> storm<00:06:15.860> rifle<00:06:16.370> if<00:06:16.580> you

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
what but with the storm rifle if you

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.700 
what but with the storm rifle if you
stop<00:06:17.090> shooting<00:06:17.420> it<00:06:17.540> starts<00:06:17.870> don't<00:06:18.260> you<00:06:18.590> know

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
stop shooting it starts don't you know

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.460 
stop shooting it starts don't you know
the<00:06:18.920> overheat<00:06:19.760> meter<00:06:20.000> I<00:06:20.090> guess<00:06:20.420> starts<00:06:21.050> going

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
the overheat meter I guess starts going

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.860 
the overheat meter I guess starts going
down<00:06:21.770> but<00:06:22.130> it<00:06:22.220> goes<00:06:22.370> down<00:06:22.490> a<00:06:22.550> slower<00:06:23.030> rate<00:06:23.150> so

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
down but it goes down a slower rate so

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.630 
down but it goes down a slower rate so
truly<00:06:24.230> once<00:06:24.590> you<00:06:24.680> start<00:06:24.920> shooting<00:06:25.190> again<00:06:25.310> it

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
truly once you start shooting again it

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.340 
truly once you start shooting again it
jumps<00:06:26.000> back<00:06:26.150> up<00:06:26.390> and<00:06:26.540> will<00:06:26.630> overheat<00:06:27.080> quicker

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
jumps back up and will overheat quicker

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.490 
jumps back up and will overheat quicker
then<00:06:28.010> you<00:06:28.190> will<00:06:28.430> use<00:06:28.760> those<00:06:28.970> 16<00:06:29.480> bullets<00:06:29.630> in

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
then you will use those 16 bullets in

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.530 
then you will use those 16 bullets in
this<00:06:30.680> horrible<00:06:31.040> if<00:06:31.310> that<00:06:31.550> makes<00:06:31.760> sense<00:06:31.910> so

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
this horrible if that makes sense so

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.840
