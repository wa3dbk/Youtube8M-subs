00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
galaxy s3 but from my point of view it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.800 
galaxy s3 but from my point of view it
is<00:00:21.810> actually<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.619> downsized<00:00:23.430> version<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:24.480> the

one point nine gear the international

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.869 
one point nine gear the international
version<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> lot<00:01:01.500> better<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
version is a lot better but in the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
version is a lot better but in the
benchmark<00:01:03.449> tests<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.049> won't<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
benchmark tests you won't see a lot of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.250 
benchmark tests you won't see a lot of
difference<00:01:05.309> even<00:01:06.000> though<00:01:06.240> american<00:01:07.080> version

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
difference even though american version

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.670 
difference even though american version
this<00:01:07.560> clock<00:01:07.799> speeds<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.460> 1.9<00:01:09.360> k<00:01:09.720> hurts<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
this clock speeds at 1.9 k hurts it's a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.580 
this clock speeds at 1.9 k hurts it's a
little<00:01:10.979> slower<00:01:11.310> than<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> Exynos<00:01:12.479> 5<00:01:12.750> octa

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
little slower than the Exynos 5 octa

little slower than the Exynos 5 octa
core<00:01:13.770> version<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.509> video<00:01:15.869> i'll<00:01:16.110> be

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
core version so in this video i'll be

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
core version so in this video i'll be
running<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.130> benchmark<00:01:17.700> test<00:01:18.030> better<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
running the benchmark test better to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.039 
running the benchmark test better to
test<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.290> cpu<00:01:19.979> GPU<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.150> overall<00:01:21.750> system

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
test the cpu GPU or the overall system

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.640 
test the cpu GPU or the overall system
and<00:01:22.470> how<00:01:23.009> fast<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.670> samsung<00:01:24.270> galaxy<00:01:24.810> s4<00:01:25.409> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and how fast the samsung galaxy s4 is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.770 
and how fast the samsung galaxy s4 is
this<00:01:26.100> video<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.610> good<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.030> people<00:01:27.060> who<00:01:27.509> may
