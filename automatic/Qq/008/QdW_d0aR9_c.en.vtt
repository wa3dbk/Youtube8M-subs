00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.939
 Bad mood 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.479

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.840
 It is the activity 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.320
 Along with that, the observation that it will be delighted immediately is also falling 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.700

 What kind of homepage is usually English in both Japanese and English 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.040

 Moromiri 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.000
 The amount of stock went to the mail still body 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 Surely every day 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.330
 I thought that medical treatment for Japanese and coach would be reached 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.000
 I have an issue 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.490
 Japanese people are investigating 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.490
 But I also feel 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.020
 on the other hand 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.020

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 Good organization 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.519
 Memory design curve 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.809
 For example

 After all Tsurumi homepage

 I would use it already 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.729
 I see too much as a bar counter 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.659
 Just for the sake of leaving the contents 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.129
 Small 1 to 1 gap is rampant, which is hard to lower per month 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.279

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.719
 Occupies internet video 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.799
 Listen to Shima's situation 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.739

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.099
 When the buying stock price was not big &amp; 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.159
 So far 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.519
 It will be very convenient for Mr. Kunimura 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.999
