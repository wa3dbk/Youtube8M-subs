00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.040
 or that there are very good guys 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.799
 Welcome to this new gameplay of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.430
 game lego marvel superheroes and we're 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.080
 with a new character unlock 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.180
 good in this video because I'm going to buy 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.460
 two characters that unlock in the 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.419
 secret level was one of the last 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.429
 videos of this game that I uploaded to the epp and 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.159
 these two characters are the captain 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.349
 america classic and union jack so 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.900
 let's go for the first one who is the captain 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.410
 classic america that will cost us 150 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.870
 thousand pieces or lego coins are going to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.870
 put us with him here we have it 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.809
 well, as far as powers are concerned, 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.690
 same as the normal American captain with 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.280
 which we usually play I go to 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.519
 get me with the normal america captain 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.440
 you see that his suit is darker than the 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.829
 captain america classic that we just 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.829
 to buy 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.780
 let's get back to the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.720
 captain america classic there we have it 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.430
 I think the only change there 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.590
 between these two characters 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.180
 it's just his suit as for 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.270
 powers as I told you before because they have 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.030
 the same 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.710
 well now let's go with the next 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.950
 unlocking that is the union jack here 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.579
 we have it and it will cost us 150 thousand 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 pieces or coins of the ego we are going to 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.110
 buy 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.110
 there we have it 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.420
 it's similar to the captain america but 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.690
 you will find it changes a little bit not me 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.280
 referred the color of the suit is worth 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.390
 how much power is this because it has a 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.080
 gun 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.730
 and it runs pretty fast by the way 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.950
 but good in these two characters not 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.810
 they are as powerful as 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.810
 others that we had unlocked before 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.340
 but they're pretty good it 's good guys 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.899
 I hope you liked this gameplay 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.520
