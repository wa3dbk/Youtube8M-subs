00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
yards away I think we've already

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.219 
yards away I think we've already
established<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.479> this<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.899> shooter

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
established that this is a shooter

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.139 
established that this is a shooter
bucket<00:01:59.680> I<00:01:59.860> mean<00:02:00.009> look<00:02:00.159> at<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.399> character<00:02:00.939> look

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
bucket I mean look at the character look

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.249 
bucket I mean look at the character look
at<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.390> mask<00:02:01.689> this<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.799> very<00:02:02.979> mature<00:02:03.250> deer

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
at the mask this is a very mature deer

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.059 
at the mask this is a very mature deer
so<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.500> part<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.009> no<00:02:06.189> brainer<00:02:06.520> 20<00:02:07.210> yards<00:02:08.069> good

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
so that part is no brainer 20 yards good

nervous about the angle but you know
that<00:02:14.410> shit<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.830> ground<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.620> there's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
that shit on the ground but there's

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.440 
that shit on the ground but there's
plenty<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.250> room<00:02:18.340> here<00:02:18.519> even<00:02:18.970> behind<00:02:19.180> that

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
plenty of room here even behind that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.449 
plenty of room here even behind that
that<00:02:19.690> front<00:02:19.989> shoulder<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.560> sneak<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.950> into<00:02:21.099> the

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
that front shoulder to sneak it into the

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.150 
that front shoulder to sneak it into the
to<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.090> lungs<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.569> just<00:02:22.780> have<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.200> hug<00:02:23.950> in

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
to the lungs you just have to hug in

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.039 
to the lungs you just have to hug in
tight<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.819> where<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.360> shoulder<00:02:25.900> goes

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
tight to where that shoulder goes

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.839 
tight to where that shoulder goes
through<00:02:26.410> there<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.799> I<00:02:26.980> think<00:02:27.549> this<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.730> a

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
through there and I think this is a

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.390 
through there and I think this is a
doable<00:02:28.180> shot<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.980> give<00:02:29.980> him<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.190> good<00:02:30.340> news

already yeah I'm gonna be a little bit

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.289 
already yeah I'm gonna be a little bit
slower<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.930> shot<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.640> i'm<00:02:36.849> going<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> let

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
slower on the shot and i'm going to let

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.979 
slower on the shot and i'm going to let
him<00:02:37.599> walk<00:02:38.049> one<00:02:38.470> more<00:02:38.769> step<00:02:39.370> because<00:02:40.330> in<00:02:40.630> most

him walk one more step because in most
of<00:02:41.260> my<00:02:41.290> setup<00:02:41.860> I've<00:02:42.099> created<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.329> diversion

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
of my setup I've created a diversion

of my setup I've created a diversion
already<00:02:44.319> so<00:02:45.010> if<00:02:45.069> this<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.400> my<00:02:45.579> setup<00:02:46.090> I've<00:02:47.079> got

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
already so if this is my setup I've got

your spot up a little bit higher yep a
million<00:04:13.470> higher<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.070> that's<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.760> big<00:04:15.030> fall<00:04:15.420> too

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
million higher and that's a big fall too

many<00:04:15.660> bow<00:04:16.200> hunters<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.890> me<00:04:17.130> included<00:04:17.280> there's

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
many bow hunters and me included there's

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.640 
many bow hunters and me included there's
a<00:04:17.940> learning<00:04:18.060> curve<00:04:18.299> there<00:04:18.690> but<00:04:19.260> when<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.500> get

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
a learning curve there but when you get

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.800 
a learning curve there but when you get
those<00:04:19.799> steep<00:04:20.190> angles<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:21.209> got<00:04:21.420> to<00:04:21.600> take<00:04:21.780> that

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
those steep angles you got to take that

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.620 
those steep angles you got to take that
near<00:04:22.410> lungs<00:04:22.740> at<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.370> highest<00:04:23.640> point<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.330> can

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
near lungs at the highest point you can

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.600 
near lungs at the highest point you can
because<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.680> take<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:26.040> too<00:04:26.220> low<00:04:26.430> it's

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
because if you take it too low it's

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.370 
because if you take it too low it's
going<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:26.850> double<00:04:27.180> its<00:04:27.480> our<00:04:27.720> lung<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.230> you're

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
going to double its our lung and you're

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.600 
going to double its our lung and you're
not<00:04:28.530> going<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.770> get<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.890> double<00:04:29.250> lung<00:04:29.400> and

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
not going to get a double lung and

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.850 
not going to get a double lung and
you're<00:04:29.730> going<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.000> be<00:04:30.230> disciplined<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.710> the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
you're going to be disciplined and the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.170 
you're going to be disciplined and the
closer<00:04:32.160> you<00:04:32.430> are<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.760> deer<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.060> the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
closer you are to the deer and the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.180 
closer you are to the deer and the
sharper<00:04:33.600> your<00:04:33.750> angle<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.740> gets<00:04:35.040> very

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
sharper your angle it gets very

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.570 
sharper your angle it gets very
difficult<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.420> catch<00:04:36.660> both<00:04:37.470> belongs<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.400> then

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
difficult to catch both belongs and then

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.250 
difficult to catch both belongs and then
you<00:04:38.700> got<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:38.880> start<00:04:39.150> hoping<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.690> praying<00:04:39.810> for

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
you got to start hoping and praying for

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.190 
you got to start hoping and praying for
taking<00:04:41.040> out<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.400> arteries<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.450> veins<00:04:42.510> and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
taking out the arteries and veins and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.560 
taking out the arteries and veins and
ore<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.860> heart<00:04:44.100> just<00:04:44.670> goes<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:45.060> show<00:04:45.090> closer

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
ore the heart just goes to show closer

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.990 
ore the heart just goes to show closer
isn't<00:04:46.050> always<00:04:46.170> better<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:47.130> know<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.310> kind<00:04:47.940> of

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
isn't always better you know I kind of

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.340 
isn't always better you know I kind of
cases<00:04:48.330> it's<00:04:48.510> not<00:04:48.690> how<00:04:48.870> did<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.020> taking<00:04:49.320> that

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
cases it's not how did it taking that

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.160 
cases it's not how did it taking that
shot<00:04:49.650> of<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:50.040> minute<00:04:50.910> before<00:04:51.030> yeah<00:04:51.930> without

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
shot of a minute before yeah without

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.980 
shot of a minute before yeah without
their<00:04:52.620> things<00:04:53.130> but<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.820> think<00:04:54.450> without<00:04:54.690> being

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
their things but I think without being

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.230 
their things but I think without being
able<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.320> say<00:04:55.560> yeah<00:04:55.860> no<00:04:56.460> ground<00:04:56.760> shrinkage

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
able to say yeah no ground shrinkage

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.830 
able to say yeah no ground shrinkage
here<00:04:57.510> great<00:04:57.960> beautiful<00:04:59.300> you<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.480> for<00:05:00.720> you

love<00:05:01.200> that<00:05:01.410> extra<00:05:01.770> thing<00:05:02.010> he's<00:05:02.220> got<00:05:02.490> but<00:05:02.700> I

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
love that extra thing he's got but I

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.280 
love that extra thing he's got but I
really<00:05:03.150> think<00:05:03.180> I'd<00:05:03.570> have<00:05:03.690> taken<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:04.020> shot<00:05:04.230> a

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
really think I'd have taken the shot a

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.810 
really think I'd have taken the shot a
little<00:05:04.500> bit<00:05:04.710> sooner<00:05:04.980> than<00:05:05.070> what<00:05:05.280> he<00:05:05.370> did<00:05:05.580> I

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
little bit sooner than what he did I

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.640 
little bit sooner than what he did I
agree<00:05:06.210> Larry<00:05:06.419> out<00:05:06.600> I<00:05:06.630> would<00:05:07.110> have<00:05:07.230> shot<00:05:07.260> when

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
agree Larry out I would have shot when

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.880 
agree Larry out I would have shot when
we<00:05:07.770> first<00:05:08.040> saw<00:05:08.220> that<00:05:08.400> near<00:05:08.640> broad
