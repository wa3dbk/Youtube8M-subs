00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
on the water ripple so we can speed it

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.050 
on the water ripple so we can speed it
up<00:01:39.340> and<00:01:39.790> we<00:01:40.780> can<00:01:40.810> slow<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:41.320> down<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.759> for

good<00:01:59.799> side<00:02:00.009> to<00:02:00.159> side<00:02:00.340> comparison<00:02:00.939> but<00:02:01.750> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
good side to side comparison but the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.700 
good side to side comparison but the
brightness<00:02:03.670> looked<00:02:04.659> because<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.320> colors

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
brightness looked because of the colors

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.469

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
little bit brighter in most of the color

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.880 
little bit brighter in most of the color
patterns<00:02:10.030> due<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.049> color<00:02:11.260> effects<00:02:11.620> and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
patterns due to the color effects and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.060 
patterns due to the color effects and
the<00:02:12.610> wide<00:02:12.930> cracked<00:02:13.930> glass<00:02:14.110> although<00:02:15.010> you

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
the wide cracked glass although you

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.789 
the wide cracked glass although you
can't<00:02:15.549> speed<00:02:15.970> up<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.269> fixture<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:17.500> can

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
can't speed up the fixture you can

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.320 
can't speed up the fixture you can
change<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.430> colors

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
change the colors

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.680 
change the colors
so<00:02:20.020> this<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.710> blue<00:02:20.920> color<00:02:21.130> compared<00:02:21.790> and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
so this is the blue color compared and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.120

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.450 
little bit brighter Wow quite a bit
brighter<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.920> peculiar<00:02:41.920> because<00:02:42.070> the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
brighter and it's peculiar because the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.460 
brighter and it's peculiar because the
American<00:02:42.850> DJ's<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.510> claiming<00:02:43.960> they<00:02:44.080> have<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.230> 10

American DJ's is claiming they have a 10

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.040 
American DJ's is claiming they have a 10
watt<00:02:44.650> LED<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.820> cha<00:02:45.970> they<00:02:46.120> says<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.510> has<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> 22

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
watt LED the cha they says it has a 22

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.290 
watt LED the cha they says it has a 22
watt<00:02:47.380> LED<00:02:47.740> so<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.550> lensing<00:02:48.970> must<00:02:49.180> be

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
watt LED so the lensing must be

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.140 
watt LED so the lensing must be
completely<00:02:49.780> different<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.730> both<00:02:51.730> fixtures

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
completely different on both fixtures

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.560 
completely different on both fixtures
now<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.840> chalet<00:02:53.410> has<00:02:53.650> about<00:02:54.090> 43<00:02:55.090> degree<00:02:55.360> beam

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
now the chalet has about 43 degree beam

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.010 
now the chalet has about 43 degree beam
angle<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.580> Hector<00:02:57.580> has<00:02:57.760> his<00:02:58.150> loaded<00:02:58.840> with

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
angle and Hector has his loaded with

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.800 
angle and Hector has his loaded with
about<00:02:59.170> 50<00:02:59.770> degree<00:03:00.070> beam<00:03:00.280> angle<00:03:00.430> lens<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.360> has

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
about 50 degree beam angle lens and has

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.720 
about 50 degree beam angle lens and has
replaceable<00:03:02.200> lenses<00:03:02.710> in<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.920> American<00:03:03.280> DJ<00:03:03.520> so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
replaceable lenses in the American DJ so

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.640 
replaceable lenses in the American DJ so
you<00:03:03.790> can<00:03:04.000> change<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.300> lenses<00:03:04.600> out<00:03:04.750> American

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
you can change the lenses out American

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.060 
you can change the lenses out American
DJ<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.220> can't<00:03:06.280> image<00:03:06.730> Ave<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.620> guess<00:03:08.860> the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
DJ you can't image Ave so I guess the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.010 
DJ you can't image Ave so I guess the
biggest<00:03:09.280> difference<00:03:09.760> is<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.150> water<00:03:10.540> texture

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
biggest difference is the water texture

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.460 
biggest difference is the water texture
or<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:12.130> liquid<00:03:12.490> texture<00:03:13.290> depending<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.380> what

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
or the liquid texture depending on what

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.950 
or the liquid texture depending on what
you<00:03:14.590> want<00:03:14.800> now<00:03:15.400> my<00:03:15.700> recommendation<00:03:16.240> would<00:03:16.900> be

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
you want now my recommendation would be

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.520 
you want now my recommendation would be
to<00:03:17.110> get<00:03:17.320> both<00:03:17.590> lights<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:20.080> can<00:03:20.110> do<00:03:20.350> some

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
to get both lights and you can do some

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.960 
to get both lights and you can do some
really<00:03:20.860> cool<00:03:21.130> patterns<00:03:21.550> with<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.820> both

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
really cool patterns with the both

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.220 
really cool patterns with the both
lights<00:03:22.270> so<00:03:22.990> if<00:03:23.110> we<00:03:23.230> change<00:03:23.530> one<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.920> orange<00:03:24.400> and

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
lights so if we change one to orange and

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.930 
lights so if we change one to orange and
we<00:03:26.230> change<00:03:26.530> one<00:03:26.770> to<00:03:26.920> yellow<00:03:27.250> let<00:03:27.610> me<00:03:27.670> see<00:03:27.760> if<00:03:27.850> I

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
we change one to yellow let me see if I

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.210 
we change one to yellow let me see if I
can<00:03:28.090> find<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.330> color<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:29.260> looks<00:03:29.380> like<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.739> cool

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
can find that color it looks like a cool

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.530 
can find that color it looks like a cool
fire<00:03:30.640> pattern<00:03:32.520> go<00:03:33.520> it<00:03:33.610> across<00:03:33.850> them<00:03:34.000> yeah<00:03:34.270> but

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.120 

I'm<00:03:51.850> liking<00:03:52.270> it

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
I'm liking it

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.820 
I'm liking it
so<00:03:54.940> they<00:03:55.660> both<00:03:55.870> have<00:03:55.930> completely<00:03:56.440> different

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
so they both have completely different

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.120 
so they both have completely different
looks

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
looks

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.950 
looks
they<00:03:57.550> both<00:03:57.880> are<00:03:57.910> about<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.570> same<00:03:58.750> brightness

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
they both are about the same brightness

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.570 
they both are about the same brightness
American<00:03:59.590> DJ<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.860> just<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.070> little<00:04:00.340> tiny<00:04:00.460> bit

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
American DJ is just a little tiny bit

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.650 
American DJ is just a little tiny bit
brighter<00:04:00.940> um<00:04:01.740> but<00:04:02.740> not<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.250> much<00:04:03.550> to<00:04:03.940> matter

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
brighter um but not that much to matter

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.820 
brighter um but not that much to matter
and<00:04:05.460> I<00:04:06.600> guess<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:07.720> all<00:04:07.840> becomes<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.440> your<00:04:08.590> taste

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
and I guess it all becomes in your taste

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.250 
and I guess it all becomes in your taste
of<00:04:09.070> what<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.520> like<00:04:09.760> better<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.300> actually<00:04:10.930> like

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
of what you like better I actually like

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.670 
of what you like better I actually like
both<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:12.610> I'm<00:04:13.240> going<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.510> have<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.440> go<00:04:14.530> out<00:04:14.590> and

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
both so I'm going to have to go out and

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.890 
both so I'm going to have to go out and
get<00:04:14.830> myself<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.430> couple<00:04:15.640> of<00:04:15.850> American<00:04:16.180> DJs<00:04:16.510> also

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
get myself a couple of American DJs also

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.199 
get myself a couple of American DJs also
and<00:04:17.170> do<00:04:17.800> a<00:04:17.830> couple<00:04:18.040> overlays<00:04:18.550> like<00:04:18.700> this<00:04:19.030> I

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
and do a couple overlays like this I

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.520 
and do a couple overlays like this I
think<00:04:19.270> they<00:04:19.510> work<00:04:19.750> really<00:04:20.080> well<00:04:20.230> together

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
think they work really well together

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.100 
think they work really well together
great<00:04:20.920> fixtures<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.550> work<00:04:22.000> together<00:04:22.180> all

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
great fixtures to work together all

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.800 
great fixtures to work together all
right<00:04:23.170> so<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.530> abyss<00:04:23.830> led<00:04:24.310> from<00:04:25.120> Chow<00:04:25.390> Bay<00:04:25.540> and

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
right so the abyss led from Chow Bay and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.950 
right so the abyss led from Chow Bay and
the<00:04:25.990> h2o<00:04:26.560> from<00:04:27.100> American<00:04:27.580> DJ<00:04:27.910> great<00:04:28.600> both

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
the h2o from American DJ great both

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.770 
the h2o from American DJ great both
great<00:04:29.230> fixtures<00:04:30.150> patterns<00:04:31.150> are<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.330> little<00:04:31.600> bit

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
great fixtures patterns are a little bit

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.150 
great fixtures patterns are a little bit
different<00:04:32.140> so<00:04:32.290> it<00:04:32.410> all<00:04:32.560> depends<00:04:32.920> on<00:04:32.950> your

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
different so it all depends on your

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.010 
different so it all depends on your
style<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.700> what<00:04:33.760> kind<00:04:34.540> of<00:04:34.600> effect<00:04:34.720> you're

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
style and what kind of effect you're

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.590 
style and what kind of effect you're
trying<00:04:35.200> to<00:04:35.290> go<00:04:35.380> with<00:04:35.560> I<00:04:36.340> know<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.330> need

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
trying to go with I know that I need

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.800 
trying to go with I know that I need
some<00:04:38.170> type<00:04:38.380> at<00:04:38.560> some<00:04:38.860> type<00:04:39.180> water<00:04:40.180> effects<00:04:40.570> and

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
some type at some type water effects and

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.930 
some type at some type water effects and
tight<00:04:41.110> looks<00:04:41.440> every<00:04:42.370> once<00:04:42.520> in<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.640> while<00:04:42.790> and

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
tight looks every once in a while and

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.640 
tight looks every once in a while and
also<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.180> need<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.540> wide<00:04:43.810> crack<00:04:44.080> glass<00:04:44.350> look

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
also I need that wide crack glass look

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.880 
also I need that wide crack glass look
also<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:45.640> I<00:04:46.030> think<00:04:46.510> my<00:04:46.870> only<00:04:47.020> option<00:04:47.440> is<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.590> get

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
also so I think my only option is to get

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.300 
also so I think my only option is to get
both<00:04:48.040> fixtures<00:04:48.720> as<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:50.170> don't<00:04:50.230> believe<00:04:50.890> you<00:04:51.160> can

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
both fixtures as I don't believe you can

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.180 
both fixtures as I don't believe you can
interchange<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:52.000> glass<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.660> them<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.170> do<00:04:53.800> have

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
interchange the glass in them I do have

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.060 
interchange the glass in them I do have
some<00:04:54.520> glass<00:04:54.930> that<00:04:55.930> came<00:04:56.170> out<00:04:56.320> of<00:04:56.350> my<00:04:56.590> American

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
some glass that came out of my American

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.060 
some glass that came out of my American
DJ<00:05:00.210> image<00:05:01.210> 250<00:05:01.750> image<00:05:02.080> 2<00:05:02.290> 50s<00:05:02.650> so<00:05:02.860> it's<00:05:03.010> a

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
DJ image 250 image 2 50s so it's a

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.130 
DJ image 250 image 2 50s so it's a
larger<00:05:03.550> crack<00:05:03.790> glass<00:05:03.940> style<00:05:04.420> and<00:05:04.600> I'm<00:05:04.780> sure

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
larger crack glass style and I'm sure

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.450 
larger crack glass style and I'm sure
that<00:05:05.500> it's<00:05:05.620> going<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.800> be<00:05:05.920> something<00:05:06.130> similar

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
that it's going to be something similar

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.820 
that it's going to be something similar
to<00:05:06.670> this<00:05:06.850> inside<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.450> fixture<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:07.990> this<00:05:08.680> is

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
to this inside the fixture so this is

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.950 
to this inside the fixture so this is
the<00:05:08.950> larger<00:05:09.310> crack<00:05:09.520> glass<00:05:09.640> and<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.750> other

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
the larger crack glass and the other

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.510 
the larger crack glass and the other
crack<00:05:11.290> glass<00:05:11.440> would<00:05:11.800> be<00:05:11.920> something<00:05:12.220> similar

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
crack glass would be something similar

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.400 
crack glass would be something similar
that<00:05:12.760> you'd<00:05:12.880> see<00:05:13.030> in<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.150> shower<00:05:13.360> door<00:05:13.660> in<00:05:13.960> the

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
that you'd see in a shower door in the

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.710 
that you'd see in a shower door in the
shop<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.740> fixture<00:05:15.460> it's<00:05:15.790> a<00:05:15.880> really<00:05:16.150> tight<00:05:16.420> glass

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
shop a fixture it's a really tight glass

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.450 
shop a fixture it's a really tight glass
while<00:05:17.050> they<00:05:17.200> probably<00:05:17.680> see<00:05:17.860> both<00:05:18.040> of<00:05:18.070> these<00:05:18.280> in

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
while they probably see both of these in

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.530 
while they probably see both of these in
shower<00:05:18.700> doors<00:05:18.940> that's<00:05:19.150> kind<00:05:19.300> of<00:05:19.330> where<00:05:19.450> they

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
shower doors that's kind of where they

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.870 
shower doors that's kind of where they
come<00:05:19.690> from<00:05:19.720> so<00:05:20.160> all<00:05:21.160> right<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:21.490> we<00:05:21.580> did<00:05:21.700> it<00:05:21.790> from

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
come from so all right so we did it from

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.880 
come from so all right so we did it from
scratch<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.360> little<00:05:22.480> bit<00:05:22.660> here<00:05:22.840> and<00:05:23.050> we<00:05:23.290> took

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
scratch a little bit here and we took

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.300 
scratch a little bit here and we took
apart<00:05:24.040> our<00:05:24.460> abyss<00:05:24.790> LED<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.710> we<00:05:26.710> pulled<00:05:27.130> out

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
apart our abyss LED and we pulled out

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.640 
apart our abyss LED and we pulled out
the<00:05:27.340> lenses<00:05:27.970> as<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:28.480> can<00:05:28.630> see<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.990> lenses<00:05:29.440> are

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
the lenses as you can see the lenses are

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:37.680 
the lenses as you can see the lenses are
a<00:05:29.760> small<00:05:30.760> crack<00:05:31.240> glass<00:05:35.370> and<00:05:36.370> these<00:05:37.210> are<00:05:37.480> my

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
a small crack glass and these are my

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.940 
a small crack glass and these are my
lenses<00:05:38.110> out<00:05:38.260> of<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:39.450> American<00:05:40.450> DJ<00:05:40.600> image<00:05:41.380> 250

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
lenses out of the American DJ image 250

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.190 
lenses out of the American DJ image 250
which<00:05:42.550> I'm<00:05:42.700> assuming<00:05:42.820> they<00:05:43.510> are<00:05:43.540> really<00:05:43.990> close

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
which I'm assuming they are really close

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.500 
which I'm assuming they are really close
to<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.440> ones<00:05:44.620> in<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:44.800> h2o<00:05:45.400> now<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.240> don't<00:05:46.330> want

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
to the ones in the h2o now I don't want

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.710 
to the ones in the h2o now I don't want
to<00:05:46.600> pull<00:05:46.720> Hector's<00:05:47.020> light<00:05:47.200> apart<00:05:47.500> but<00:05:48.720> that's

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
to pull Hector's light apart but that's

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.450 
to pull Hector's light apart but that's
kind<00:05:49.990> of<00:05:50.050> about<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.440> same<00:05:50.620> crack<00:05:51.310> glass

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
kind of about the same crack glass

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.700 
kind of about the same crack glass
pattern<00:05:51.910> that<00:05:52.000> we<00:05:52.120> had<00:05:52.300> so<00:05:53.020> I<00:05:53.050> just<00:05:53.410> tried<00:05:53.620> to

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
pattern that we had so I just tried to

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.080 
pattern that we had so I just tried to
install<00:05:54.070> these<00:05:54.370> in<00:05:54.730> the<00:05:55.860> abyss<00:05:56.860> fixture<00:05:57.460> but

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
install these in the abyss fixture but

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.090 
install these in the abyss fixture but
they<00:05:58.270> don't<00:05:58.450> quite<00:05:58.690> line<00:05:59.320> up<00:05:59.350> the<00:05:59.650> focusing

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
they don't quite line up the focusing

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.360 
they don't quite line up the focusing
isn't<00:06:00.400> isn't<00:06:00.580> isn't<00:06:01.390> quite<00:06:01.810> there<00:06:02.020> so<00:06:02.890> a

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
isn't isn't isn't quite there so a

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.390 
isn't isn't isn't quite there so a
little<00:06:03.610> bit<00:06:03.760> different<00:06:03.820> installation<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.400> for

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
little bit different installation so for

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.469 
little bit different installation so for
those<00:06:06.520> of<00:06:06.640> you<00:06:06.700> guys<00:06:06.850> I<00:06:06.910> want<00:06:07.210> to<00:06:07.300> try<00:06:07.419> to

this<00:06:14.050> back<00:06:14.230> together<00:06:14.380> and<00:06:14.710> just<00:06:15.610> a<00:06:15.730> quick

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
this back together and just a quick

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.010 
this back together and just a quick
quick<00:06:17.290> note<00:06:17.500> for<00:06:18.419> let's<00:06:19.419> just<00:06:19.570> look<00:06:19.750> at<00:06:19.900> the

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
quick note for let's just look at the

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.220 
quick note for let's just look at the
glass<00:06:20.230> coverage<00:06:21.600> now<00:06:22.600> I'm<00:06:22.720> sure<00:06:22.870> you<00:06:22.990> can<00:06:23.110> get

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
glass coverage now I'm sure you can get

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.920 
glass coverage now I'm sure you can get
a<00:06:23.260> different<00:06:23.560> glass<00:06:23.740> like<00:06:24.280> this<00:06:24.610> and<00:06:24.930> install

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
a different glass like this and install

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.650 
a different glass like this and install
it<00:06:26.110> but<00:06:27.010> this<00:06:27.220> particular<00:06:27.510> fitting<00:06:28.510> right

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
it but this particular fitting right

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.970 
it but this particular fitting right
here<00:06:28.840> on<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.020> American<00:06:29.380> DJ's<00:06:29.650> are<00:06:29.770> a<00:06:29.800> little

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
here on the American DJ's are a little

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.780 
here on the American DJ's are a little
bit<00:06:30.130> different<00:06:30.460> so<00:06:32.220> okay<00:06:33.220> so<00:06:33.280> I<00:06:33.400> was<00:06:33.520> able<00:06:33.760> to

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
bit different so okay so I was able to

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.320 
bit different so okay so I was able to
take<00:06:34.060> the<00:06:34.650> focus<00:06:35.650> lens<00:06:36.100> the<00:06:36.669> American<00:06:37.000> DJ<00:06:37.090> have

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
take the focus lens the American DJ have

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.390 
take the focus lens the American DJ have
the<00:06:37.419> focus<00:06:37.720> lens<00:06:37.930> so<00:06:38.050> you<00:06:38.080> can<00:06:38.260> actually<00:06:38.410> focus

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
the focus lens so you can actually focus

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.540 
the focus lens so you can actually focus
the<00:06:39.850> pattern<00:06:40.750> on<00:06:40.990> your<00:06:41.020> walls<00:06:41.440> or<00:06:41.830> your<00:06:42.220> floors

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
the pattern on your walls or your floors

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.060 
the pattern on your walls or your floors
wherever<00:06:42.880> you're<00:06:43.000> going<00:06:43.120> to<00:06:43.150> focus<00:06:43.479> it<00:06:44.070> and

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
wherever you're going to focus it and

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.030 
wherever you're going to focus it and
took<00:06:45.310> a<00:06:45.430> look<00:06:45.550> inside<00:06:45.940> at<00:06:46.330> the<00:06:46.660> glass<00:06:47.040> let's

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
took a look inside at the glass let's

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.320 
took a look inside at the glass let's
see<00:06:48.130> if<00:06:48.190> you<00:06:48.250> can<00:06:48.370> see<00:06:48.520> that<00:06:50.400> it's<00:06:51.400> not<00:06:51.729> quite

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
see if you can see that it's not quite

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.860 
see if you can see that it's not quite
as<00:06:52.540> tight<00:06:53.470> as<00:06:53.770> the<00:06:53.919> SHA<00:06:54.100> of<00:06:54.190> a<00:06:55.440> yet<00:06:56.440> it's<00:06:56.710> not<00:06:57.010> as

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
as tight as the SHA of a yet it's not as

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.780 
as tight as the SHA of a yet it's not as
broad<00:06:58.870> as<00:06:59.229> this<00:06:59.470> glass<00:07:00.250> right<00:07:00.490> here

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
broad as this glass right here

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.820 
broad as this glass right here
it's<00:07:01.150> about<00:07:01.300> in<00:07:01.570> between<00:07:01.870> between<00:07:02.229> this<00:07:02.560> and

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
it's about in between between this and

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.930 
it's about in between between this and
the<00:07:03.010> shelve<00:07:03.220> a<00:07:03.310> 1<00:07:03.720> so<00:07:04.720> um<00:07:04.960> Wow<00:07:06.010> what<00:07:06.580> -<00:07:06.760> cool

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
the shelve a 1 so um Wow what - cool

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.030 
the shelve a 1 so um Wow what - cool
fixtures<00:07:07.389> I'm<00:07:08.139> not<00:07:08.350> sure<00:07:08.530> why<00:07:08.710> the<00:07:08.770> power

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
fixtures I'm not sure why the power

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.120 
fixtures I'm not sure why the power

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130 
difference on the SHA they says a lot

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.400 
difference on the SHA they says a lot
brighter<00:07:12.510> LED<00:07:13.510> but<00:07:13.870> it's<00:07:14.020> about<00:07:14.229> the<00:07:14.380> same

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.410 
brighter LED but it's about the same

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.550 
brighter LED but it's about the same
kind<00:07:14.770> of<00:07:14.800> output<00:07:15.160> so<00:07:15.310> it<00:07:15.400> must<00:07:15.550> be<00:07:15.640> the<00:07:15.729> lensing

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
kind of output so it must be the lensing

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.050 
kind of output so it must be the lensing
so<00:07:17.560> that<00:07:17.890> I<00:07:17.919> guess<00:07:18.130> it<00:07:18.250> just<00:07:18.280> depends<00:07:18.729> on<00:07:18.850> the

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
so that I guess it just depends on the

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.760 
so that I guess it just depends on the
on<00:07:19.630> the<00:07:19.840> lenses<00:07:20.200> that<00:07:20.260> you<00:07:20.380> have<00:07:20.590> from<00:07:20.740> your

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
on the lenses that you have from your

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.580 
on the lenses that you have from your
manufacturers<00:07:21.430> so<00:07:22.050> when<00:07:23.050> you<00:07:23.169> look<00:07:23.350> at<00:07:23.440> your

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 
manufacturers so when you look at your

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.330 
manufacturers so when you look at your
LEDs<00:07:23.950> I<00:07:24.300> don't<00:07:25.300> do<00:07:25.660> a<00:07:25.690> quick<00:07:26.080> oh<00:07:26.350> don't<00:07:27.070> don't

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.340 
LEDs I don't do a quick oh don't don't

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.300 
LEDs I don't do a quick oh don't don't
do<00:07:27.490> a<00:07:27.520> direct<00:07:27.940> comparison<00:07:28.830> LED<00:07:29.830> for<00:07:30.039> LED

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.310 
do a direct comparison LED for LED

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.800 
do a direct comparison LED for LED
because<00:07:30.550> it<00:07:30.880> looks<00:07:31.090> like<00:07:31.270> you<00:07:31.450> can<00:07:31.630> have<00:07:31.780> a

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
because it looks like you can have a

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.080 
because it looks like you can have a
hotter<00:07:32.080> LED<00:07:33.010> at<00:07:33.100> a<00:07:33.190> lower<00:07:33.370> wattage<00:07:33.580> depending

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.090 
hotter LED at a lower wattage depending

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.260 
hotter LED at a lower wattage depending
on<00:07:34.180> their<00:07:34.360> of<00:07:34.860> their<00:07:35.860> input<00:07:36.340> power<00:07:36.490> to<00:07:36.820> the<00:07:36.940> LED

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.270 
on their of their input power to the LED

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.650 
on their of their input power to the LED
also<00:07:37.539> the<00:07:38.470> lensing<00:07:39.190> capabilities<00:07:39.760> so<00:07:40.300> this<00:07:40.570> is

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660 
also the lensing capabilities so this is

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.909 
also the lensing capabilities so this is
