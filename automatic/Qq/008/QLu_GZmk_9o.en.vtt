00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.049
 clip charts here you can see one 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.460
 Clenched charge of the best clips 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.650
 is it with us today with sports and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.830
 There was only this summer 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.389
 one football yes ok was added yet 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.250
 doping scandal when cycling in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.380
 france and a little tennis in 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.980
 england but if they think that was 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.260
 already everything 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
 Then take a look at the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.109
 best table manners now help times 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.740
 not if the table itself is not 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.539
 has manners 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.670
 I think it's a bit too 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.710
 I brazenly mean it may well many men 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.480
 those who dream of it 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.050
 Eating with two women in arm down 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.180
 allowed 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.030
 but for that you should clear up 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.410
 already take a little time 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.820
 athletes always assume that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.399
 It's easier for a woman to be closer 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.920
 but you should completely 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.800
 pay particular attention to how and where 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.510
 Here is our first introduction 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.500
 good captain probably just in the back 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.670
 kombüse the cozy 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.710
 mittagsschläfchen 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.899
 It is clear that he does not notice anything 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.590
 but somehow his parents are there too 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.300
 to blame 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.949
 i mean who as a child in the swing 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.920
 be like ge lag closes on one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.970
 kutter course a constantly 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.860
 but the thing with the solid ground 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
 it's not always that under the feet either 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.189
 what you would want 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.409
 that's exactly what the next man can do for him 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.869
 sing a song or directly the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.280
 People in the floor below that come 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.259
 if you just cant on a cassette 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.820
 picking up sounds there you are very fast 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.979
 on the descending branch 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.110
 but the earlier you learn the more 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.600
 better and thus the child does not have to 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.829
 Stay longer on the crooked track 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.530
 but still applies to the whole 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.450
 small eyes on especially if one 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.650
 Camera is nearby, otherwise you are 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.689
 very fast in the club charts 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.720
 for example, as a new release number 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.860
 14 if you have someone to offer in 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 to rock the sleep 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.549
 but I'm not so sure anyway 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.250
 whether it is a recording from the holiday 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.899
 was or was from a Chinese 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.119
 torture prison yes you should just 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.320
 take care what you want when you are 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.000
 For example, a locked door 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.590
 then you have to open 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.810
 to inform about it like that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.759
 That's what Mazda wants to do 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.710
 build a new wooden hut and he 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.360
 The old one can tear it down 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.020
 cottage directly from so I think it's great 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.939
 or 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.039
 for me are the best lumberjack of the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.780
 year except they had that 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.009
 maybe not planned that way 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.910
 then you have the title of course 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.410
 leave again 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.180
 maybe directly to the next man 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.460
 Although he is not a lumberjack 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.530
 but he knows what he wants and also if 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.690
 will never have it often depend on 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.150
 pretending he sounds like it 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.790
 But complicated is quite simple here 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.930
 our promotional clip of the day and the violinist 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.760
 since it was already over 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.500
 I would have loved to see him 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.210
 still raindrops and leaves ins 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.770
 the face lets fly 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.210
 main actor of our next clips 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.020
 maybe you want something too 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.790
 readjust 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.040
 maybe the foaming waterfall 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.900
 or at least he really does 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.380
 everything to get wet 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.610
 to see in our city number 10 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.170
 backs are known to be a good one 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.580
 flirt means there you will be completely 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.710
 obviously the protective instinct 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.420
 with the other people however 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.000
 you should do it with his awkwardness 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.080
 Also do not exaggerate possibility 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.060
 to practice headstand 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.890
 but I have to admit I think so 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.510
 the whole effort with the horse and the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.360
 course quite over the top 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.590
 or besides, the rider would have it too 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.390
 a bit longer in the head 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.670
 can stay when the horse is already 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.420
 It has really been prepared so beautifully 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.730
 unfairly 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.860
 Well, while I'm protesting 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.959
 there is a collection ready for you 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.090
 the best clips and with the whole 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.920
 very small 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.420
 what do we learn from this waterproof 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.390
 Cameras can probably to more places 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.040
 use as one suspects one 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.020
 you need waterproof computer 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.910
 but not us if we do 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.500
 our homepage flows with a true one 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.420
 flood new clips fill up 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.250
 at kabeleins de you will find that 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.020
 our new ideas and ours 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.940
 charts and when you watch the movies 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.500
 then you can look there 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.540
 also your vote for the funniest 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.160
 submit clips and the best the 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.830
 then of course make it into ours 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.630
 heads the first clip in the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.440
 top group has something in common again 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.660
 to do water 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.540
 small children like to sit down 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.830
 a bucket as a helmet on his head 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.020
 if you ask yourself now why you 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.750
 probably do that because the grandfather is like that 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.510
 Whether it's voluntary or not 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.709
 here is place five you can 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.410
 namely also won 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.940
 our current winners are the little ones 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.440
 Klaus and the invisible woman 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.190
 Congratulations 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.959
 how embarrassing with our track music who 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.799
 that certainly did not happen to him and the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.180
 There's also the rest for your cellphone 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.520
 order the song love 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.770
 Generation as a ringing tone send them 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.330
 just send an sms with love to the 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.770
 41 500 on the video text page 383 or 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.789
 Also on kabeleins de there are more 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.259
 infos about the work of the beekeeper is even 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.180
 not to estimate high enough 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.370
 if they are not careful enough 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.520
 are annoying and he sees 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.710
 bees are pretty nasty out of here 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.060
 third place 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.860
 So I think the little leather 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.169
 Tie was guilty which has the man 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.860
 simply torn down 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.930
 she was probably from a cow 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.849
 made the former where waited where 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.389
 Today the golf course is a fair one 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.349
 punish so for habitat annihilator 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.539
 they should be on such spectacular 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.150
 recordings on video then have it here 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.800
 just send it by mail and please 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.080
 do not forget on kabeleins de die 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.180
 clips again and our top 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.680
 five to choose 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.840
 it has a place today 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.150
 Surveillance video done we experience 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.520
 a brazen theft also 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.080
 still in broad daylight but one plays 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.210
 have to admit that you do not like that 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.639
 can be really angry because the thief is 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.620
 just sooo sweet the sacrifice, however 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.599
 and that's exactly what makes the case that way 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.370
 they are difficult to decide for themselves 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.789
 Bye and have fun with your number 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.789
 one
