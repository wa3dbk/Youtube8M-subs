00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello all my name is already gÃ³mez half 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.609
 of contact can be found in the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.859
 description of the video my accounts of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.870
 facebook and twitter if they have any 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.849
 question in this video let's see how 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.219
 create a recovery unit for 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 our windows 8.1 our windows 8 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.560
 also inclusive for our windows 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.109
 8.1 update and then these units of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.480
 recovery we will use it for itself 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.130
 at some point we have some error 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.439
 start in our team we are going to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 to be able to use is there what errors 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 it can be the errors these that always 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.829
 warns us that there is a missing file in the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.410
 ce disk in the windows folder that are 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.940
 the most common then with this unit 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.820
 of recovery we are going to be able to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.489
 have our team again can 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.170
 perform a recovery easily and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.879
 we will not have to resort to other 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.789
 more extensive recoveries as per 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.100
 example the letter of the manufacturer itself 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.079
 this recovery unit we are going to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.899
 perform in a usb memory we can 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.989
 create it on an external hard drive or on 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.820
 a very partition of what is ours 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.739
 team then to create this unit 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 of recovery we connect our 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.880
 usb memory or our 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.090
 on our external hard drive that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.120
 we have available for this we must 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.160
 have at least 512 mb available for 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.360
 the task and what we are going to do is 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.960
 being here on the home screen 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.000
 let's write recovery so that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.610
 let us see who in what is the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.440
 search let's have this option that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.120
 tells us to create a unit of 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.610
 recovery let's click on it 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.220
 here he asks us if we want to launch 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.290
 or create the media creator of 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.479
 recovery let's say yes and 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.190
 here we have the assistant for the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.890
 creation of the recovery unit 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.360
 here it tells us that you can use a unit 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.490
 of recovery as help for 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.270
 solve problems with your pc though 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.880
 it can not be started if your pc includes 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.979
 it included a recover a partition of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.540
 recovery can also copy it in 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.759
 the recovery unit to use it 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.440
 to restore or reset your pc these 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.630
 Recovery units are different 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.700
 or are different from the means of 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.709
 installation we will not have a half 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.180
 full installation we're just going to 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.700
 have the necessary files to 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.900
 we 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.060
 start our team and power 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.980
 recover it we will give it then click 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.870
 in the next let's hope it detects 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.610
 in the unit that is connected and by 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.440
 defect shows us the unit that is 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.349
 there connected to the letter f and it tells us 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.750
 that we must have at least 512 mb 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.400
 available and all will be eliminated 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.200
 the data that is there in the unit 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.300
 so we must bear in mind that 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.880
 this unit will be formatted to let's give it 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.470
 click on next here gives us the the 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.170
 notice that all the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.819
 data let's tell you click on create and go 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.099
 to start creating our unit 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.290
 recovery in the usb memory that I have 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.880
 currently connected as you can see is 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.150
 a removable disk format it with 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.549
 patent was 32 and starts there the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.170
 copied as you can see here in my 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:04.269
 removable usb drive for 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.860
 recovery of my team then we go 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.019
 to give her a little time here this is not 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.360
 it's going to take a long time 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.620
 minute while that I'm recommending 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.110

 team we are going to start by means of the 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.900
 usb or if we have the start 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.420
 we must automatically modify what 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.180
 would be the start of our team to 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.160
 be able to start over there for the usb 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.350
 then once there rebooted we are going to 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.450
 be able to access what is the area of 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.340
 recovery of our team and our

 team automatically goes to 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.650
 if you need any file like that it does 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.169
 have some startup error or more 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.090
 there he will recover it then as 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.650
 can see tells us that the unit of 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.080
 recovery is ready let's give it 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.110
 click on end if we go to the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.290
 usb drive let's see that here we have 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.930
 some of us already have spaces and busy 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.820
 to enter our unit and here we go 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.610
 to see necessary files for what 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.990
 it would be the recovery and the dribbling of 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.050
 our team here we can see the 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.120
 important book folder in what is the 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.400
 drip from our team we see files 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.160
 so necessary that sometimes they are the ones 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.380
 more s 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.410
 or break in our windows as is the 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.240
 boot manager bud manager point f there 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.280
 let's see then also the folder 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.220
 de fi with options of boot and others 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.620
 then this is the video of how to create 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.110
 a recovery disc or how to create 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.320
 a recovery unit also what 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.840
 we can perform in what would be dvds or 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.150
 cds but it is something that is not being 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.280
 using a lot then rather it 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.920
 they use what are the usb drives 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.600
 only the external hard drives then 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.120
 I hope you find this helpful
