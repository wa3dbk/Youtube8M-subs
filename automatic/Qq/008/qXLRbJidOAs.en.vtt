00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.130
 good kids here we are in a new 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.229
 Android tutorial and today I 'm going to 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.809
 explain a very easy way to be able to 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.639
 see all the channels that we want in 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.679
 our android phone or tablet already 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.780
 that works in the same way as a 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.580
 very easy way as I say this program 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.289
 it's called esp live player 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.269
 then I will explain how to download it 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.369
 and install it and add all the channels 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.199
 but tell you that you can see channels 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.449
 from for example those of the tdt of 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.279
 Spain as antenna 335 the sixth by 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.189
 example we can also see channels 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.260
 children's documentary channels 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.260
 football channels like television game 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.620
 channel + league eg channels 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.300
 international movie channels 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.370
 series channels there are many 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.079
 options and we can even add 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.360
 channel lists for adults then 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.190
 this is already destined to what you want 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.219
 do with this program so nothing 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.600
 kids we started with the good video 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.399
 As you can see, we are already in the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.899
 phone and the first thing we will do is 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.670
 install the application this application 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.710
 as I said, it's called esp live 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.260
 You have it below in the description 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.460
 of this video on a mega link to 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.080
 download it 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.950
 once downloaded and unzip the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.320
 winrar 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.289
 is inside the winrar and the application 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.880
 that is called sp live apk you pass it to 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.189
 your phone the same as you pass it 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.659
 to the external memory or to the internal 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.179
 phone you go to your browser 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.460
 files in my case les file explorer and 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.259
 you look for me I passed the external and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.049

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.549
 point apk click on it and the 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.920
 we install we accept all the 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.280
 conditions and such and we give to install 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.869
 Once installed , we have the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.729
 perfectly apply what we 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.909
 would be to add the lists of 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.380
 channels that interest us most these 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.000
 lists of the channels you also have them 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.549
 down in the description on a link to 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.619
 mega and they are inside a notebook 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.110
 in the notebook you will have a series 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.209
 of addresses organized of course 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.039
 for example it puts national channels and the 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.869
 Direction of film channels and direction 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.700
 and so for example sports series 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.759
 international children's documentaries 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.349
 adult music movies premieres you have 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.530
 a lot of directions to add to 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.810
 Program 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.399
 Once you want or know which one you are going to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.319
 add you can add all to the program 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.390
 gives exactly the same you are here up 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.370
 where it puts the three dashes and you go to 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.020
 streaming lists like it was before and 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.910
 up here on the right you will see a 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.500
 series of windows with one more click eyes 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.690
 there and that's where you have to put the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.550
 address that interests us most in my 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.290
 case I'm going to make the phone go away because 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.870
 if I can not I can not put what I'm going to put 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.910
 movie example and it's http two points 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.450
 Peace bing bar 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.900
 dot com 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.970
 bar and here be careful to put it well 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.500
 as you put it with the capital letters according to 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.080
 he puts them on and such because if he does not 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.730
 will add the list well that 7 h 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.190
 of uppercase and lowercase to put it well 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.450
 because if he is not going to add us well what 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.540
 which is the channels see and rf vale 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.290
 It's worth it, we have it here as you go 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.910
 to see added and we just have to give 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.500
 here where it puts load list I do not know if what 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.420
 you will see well but good put load list 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.239
 You are going to load it as you see it puts us 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.459
 synchronization in progress and as you see 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.590
 automatically added us here the 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.380
 list of movie channels as you can 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.270
 to be seeing click on it 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.650
 and it will put us synchronizing to 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.020
 synchronize all channels and how 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.930
 you see we have channels like channel + channel + 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.080
 two cats action each the christine for 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.360
 a chanel hollywood string bus fox 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.390
 you also have channels in latinos and their 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.370
 Latinos you have a lot of them like 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.550
 you see the greatest in Latinos and the first 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.660
 above, they are the most normal in 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.970
 Spain as they are channel plus and the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.480
 show every plus 2 every plus bull 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.770
 and you simply give the channel that most 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.960
 like in my case I'm going to give this for 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.450
 example that puts you channel + 2 and it will come out 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.480
 this menu down with simply giving 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.360
 I will now load the channel as you go 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.550
 see you give s &amp; p live and ready the channel 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.890
 it takes very little time the truth and you 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.650
 I advise you to do it with a Wi-Fi network 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.840
 because it really consumes data and many 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.910
 so nothing is loading the channel 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.799
 and once loaded and I advance you that 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.959
 there are no pulls of any kind 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.060
 the channel works very well and as you can see 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.450
 it looks amazing let's put it on 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.700
 big 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.340
 here you have it and as you can see we can see 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.760
 the television perfectly without jerks 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.740
 without failures very fluid and in a quality 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.960
 frightening that is like every plus 2 in 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.580
 hd so nothing this same you have to 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.110
 do with each of the channels that 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.910
 you want movie channels channels 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.220
 documentary series whatever you want 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.840
 add is the list and you will already have 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.100
 available all channels to see 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.050
 so I was a kid I hope that I have 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.030
