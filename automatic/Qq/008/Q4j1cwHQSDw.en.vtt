00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
what's up guys blog buster here again I

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.889 
what's up guys blog buster here again I
think<00:00:02.340> computers<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:03.060> today<00:00:03.449> we're<00:00:03.629> taking<00:00:03.720> a

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
think computers and today we're taking a

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.769 
think computers and today we're taking a
look<00:00:03.929> at<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.290> 16<00:00:05.190> gig<00:00:05.400> memory<00:00:05.609> kit<00:00:05.940> from<00:00:06.240> g.skill

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
look at a 16 gig memory kit from g.skill

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.560 
look at a 16 gig memory kit from g.skill
it's<00:00:07.080> there<00:00:07.410> Ripjaws<00:00:08.010> Z<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.090> it's<00:00:09.240> designed

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
it's there Ripjaws Z and it's designed

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.589 
it's there Ripjaws Z and it's designed
for<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.960> intel<00:00:10.290> x79<00:00:10.950> platform<00:00:11.670> normally<00:00:12.509> we

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
for the intel x79 platform normally we

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.200 
for the intel x79 platform normally we
don't<00:00:12.719> take<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.960> look<00:00:13.230> at<00:00:13.730> memory<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.910> much<00:00:15.059> I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
don't take a look at memory that much I

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.760 
don't take a look at memory that much I
mean<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.420> know<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.660> boxing<00:00:16.109> videos<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> memory

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
mean I know in boxing videos and memory

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.220 
mean I know in boxing videos and memory
is<00:00:17.100> not<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.430> exciting<00:00:18.270> but<00:00:18.449> we<00:00:18.690> kind<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.080> just

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
is not that exciting but we kind of just

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.300 
is not that exciting but we kind of just
wanted<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.529> show<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.710> since<00:00:20.010> we've<00:00:20.130> never

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
wanted to show you since we've never

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.490 
wanted to show you since we've never
reviewed<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.760> memory<00:00:21.090> what<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.170> know<00:00:22.289> what

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
reviewed this memory what you know what

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.960 
reviewed this memory what you know what
it's<00:00:22.769> all<00:00:22.859> about<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.580> looks<00:00:23.760> like<00:00:23.910> so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
it's all about and what it looks like so

let's just get to the good part open it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:36.180 
let's just get to the good part open it
up<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.619> check<00:00:25.740> out<00:00:26.039> what's<00:00:26.160> inside

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.860 

like<00:00:37.190> most<00:00:37.399> memory<00:00:37.790> kits<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.329> ripjaws<00:00:38.690> he

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
like most memory kits the ripjaws he

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.340 
like most memory kits the ripjaws he
comes<00:00:39.140> in<00:00:39.290> a<00:00:39.350> nice<00:00:39.530> clam<00:00:39.920> shell<00:00:40.190> package<00:00:40.730> um

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
kid it is what it's going to be running

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.240 
kid it is what it's going to be running
at<00:00:53.659> how<00:00:54.260> much<00:00:54.440> memory<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.860> in<00:00:54.949> it<00:00:55.100> and

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
at how much memory is in it and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.470 
at how much memory is in it and
everything<00:00:55.309> like<00:00:55.610> that<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:55.820> let's<00:00:56.120> just<00:00:56.390> go

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
everything like that so let's just go

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.219 
everything like that so let's just go
ahead<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:56.690> open<00:00:56.839> these<00:00:57.079> up<00:01:01.300> now<00:01:02.300> take<00:01:03.050> these

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
ahead and open these up now take these

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:13.900 
ahead and open these up now take these
out<00:01:03.470> here<00:01:11.890> once<00:01:12.890> we<00:01:13.009> have<00:01:13.039> everything<00:01:13.310> out<00:01:13.640> now

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
out here once we have everything out now

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.700 
out here once we have everything out now
you<00:01:13.970> can<00:01:14.300> see<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:14.450> g.skill<00:01:14.929> also<00:01:15.289> provides

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
you can see that g.skill also provides

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.620 
you can see that g.skill also provides
you<00:01:15.830> with<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.160> small<00:01:17.060> little<00:01:17.210> sticker<00:01:17.509> you

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
you with this small little sticker you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.060 
you with this small little sticker you
can<00:01:17.750> put<00:01:17.869> on<00:01:17.960> your<00:01:17.990> case<00:01:18.289> they<00:01:18.530> people<00:01:18.830> know

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
can put on your case they people know

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.980 
can put on your case they people know
they're<00:01:19.220> using<00:01:19.490> g.skill<00:01:19.910> memory<00:01:20.270> there<00:01:20.899> are

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
they're using g.skill memory there are

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.499 
they're using g.skill memory there are
four<00:01:21.259> total<00:01:21.619> memory<00:01:21.770> sticks<00:01:22.160> and<00:01:22.509> therefore

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
four total memory sticks and therefore

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.320 
four total memory sticks and therefore
gig<00:01:23.690> each<00:01:23.929> so<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:24.649> is<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.009> total<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.429> 16<00:01:25.850> gig<00:01:26.090> it

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
gig each so that is a total of 16 gig it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.300 
gig each so that is a total of 16 gig it
is<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.750> 16<00:01:27.289> gig<00:01:27.500> kit<00:01:27.830> each<00:01:28.429> one<00:01:29.149> of<00:01:29.450> these<00:01:29.960> has<00:01:30.710> is

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
is a 16 gig kit each one of these has is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.880 
is a 16 gig kit each one of these has is

ripjaws ii just kind of want to show you
what<00:02:12.350> they<00:02:12.470> look<00:02:12.500> like<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:13.040> heat<00:02:13.190> spreader<00:02:13.430> is

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
what they look like the heat spreader is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.229 
what they look like the heat spreader is
a<00:02:13.640> bit<00:02:14.180> larger<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.760> want<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:16.970> keep<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.180> in

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
a bit larger so you want to keep that in

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.880 
a bit larger so you want to keep that in
mind<00:02:17.480> when<00:02:17.630> purchasing<00:02:18.019> these<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.650> one

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
mind when purchasing these and one

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.800 
mind when purchasing these and one
person<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.310> purchasing<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.150> cpu<00:02:20.600> cooler

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
person is purchasing a cpu cooler

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.900 
person is purchasing a cpu cooler
because<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.769> heat<00:02:22.100> spreader<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.549> a<00:02:22.579> bit

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
because the heat spreader is a bit

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.910 
because the heat spreader is a bit
larger<00:02:23.359> than<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.540> actual<00:02:23.840> memory<00:02:24.680> stick

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
larger than the actual memory stick

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.580 
larger than the actual memory stick
itself<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:26.180> again<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:26.959> bob<00:02:27.230> busker

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
itself but again this is bob busker
