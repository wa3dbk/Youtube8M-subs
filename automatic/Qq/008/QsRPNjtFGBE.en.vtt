00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.169
 hello to all that so welcome once 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.030
 more to the channel today is pulling out a block of 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.289
 about two hours or so to be able 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.419
 schedule the videos that I will present 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.189
 during the month of August I will tell you 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.080
 it's 12 o'clock at night so I'm very 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.210
 very tired all day but I'm going to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.369
 try to make all the videos today 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.019
 I bring the book hole in my mail box 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.009
 July is to say that good gentlemen 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.169
 all the books that have reached me 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.609
 shelves to my house during this month 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.199
 July I want to tell you that this month has 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.520
 been quite scarce in that if 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.530
 you have literary I got 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.000
 many many books so do I go 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.010
 to teach the only book that I bought 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.330
 during this month of July was the name 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.980
 of the wind from patrick rothfuss in 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.720
 paperback edition of the publisher 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.430
 I want to tell you that I had 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.990
 very many very much desire to be able 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.670
 buy this book that I wanted to have it 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.440
 purchased in large edition in hardcover 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.450
 but it was excessively expensive so the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.450
 very affordable pocket edition that what 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.890
 that cost me 9 95 euros was very good 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.300
 acquisition I'm going to propose during the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.860
 month of july read patrick's book 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 gold but tucked the curtain still of 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.160
 can read it so I think I'm going to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.540
 postpone during the month of August may 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.409
 September will surely go 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.850
 September because in August 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.740
 and many people have told me 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.840
 recommended this novel this writer and 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.369
 I really want to know what the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.649
 patrick rothfuss pen because it is that 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.659
 you have told so many wonders about him and 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.399
 I'm so nervous about being able to read what 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.649
 The truth is that I think he would buy me 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.020
 the second part because there are going to be three 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.969
 books the second one is already published on 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.740
 third they will do it very soon so 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.509
 I guess I'll like it because I do not know 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.740
 although it is very chubby what the 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.060
 edition is a softcover edition 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:38.739
 without flaps has a total of 872 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.959
 pages I take eight hundred of two 

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.640
 pages you have to give the easy thing 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.959
 to read is not going to be but he told me that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.759
 it's tremendously addictive that you read 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.020
 practically nothing although good I guess 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.670
 that will be like a game of thrones once 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.200
 it stays with you the story you can not 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.879
 leave it the next book sent it to me 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.739
 the author herself and is the song number 

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:54.670
 7 of the in speaks a book that is of themes 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.770
 today published with the publisher 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.810
 planet this book was number one the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.609
 digital format through amazon and 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.840
 they decided to publish themselves on paper now 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.700
 I 'm reading this book 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.530
 about 20 pages and I'm looking forward to finishing 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.399
 to record the video to be able to finish it 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.709
 because the truth is that I liked it 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.060
 very much you will see in some little thing 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.520
 what do I have pending for the channel 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.209
 Book edition is a cover edition 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.560
 soft with flaps I came dedicated by 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.540
 the author, which seems to me a detail 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.970
 very beautiful and has a total of 470 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.830
 pages in the acknowledgments and the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.880
 letter is quite pretty big wants 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.830
 say this is a reading that I am 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.599
 really enjoying you want to tell a 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.130
 little bit further on from her and that 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.810
 I really appreciate very much sand that 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.340
 I have proposed in his novel because 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.750
 I am incredibly enjoying the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.250
 next book that I'm going to teach you is 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.680
 bar is the second part of the trilogy 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.540
 of fire light written by sophie jordan 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.950
 after reading file to this first 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.959
 part of the trilogy the truth is that I 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.610
 really liked the theme of the dragons in 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.380
 green something quite interesting but the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.000
 romance between the protagonists then 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.860
 as always I'm limping because I do not believe 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.989
 the advances at first glance but I 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.610
 it was curious to see how he continued 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.319
 the island I am has improved over the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.790
 first part but there's still something that 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.080
 it does not finish me in the story 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.060
 that does not mean that it does not go to 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.470
 continue with hayden which is the third 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.390
 part that is to teach you a little bit more 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.980
 forward taste an edition in red 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.500
 this time he has played with one more color 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.849
 purple so bright the cover are very 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.930
 very nice the truth is that if I compare 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.610
 the first with the second I have to 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.720
 to be 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.720
 teaches the edition of the novel because it is 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.580
 Precious is softcover with flaps 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.350
 I will show you how it is inside 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.150
 I know if you can appreciate it but it's from a 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.700
 lovely purple color and has like 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.020
 borders throughout the back cover that is 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.090
 super pretty here you have the title and of 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.360
 truth is a very very very very 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.709
 taken care of the part inside each 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.540
 beginning of chapter has here a 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.610
 edging the numbering goes with a border 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.170
 here the truth is that it is a very 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.430
 very nice to novel the next and 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.560
 last book that I will show you 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.060
 this bucholz was sending mona the 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.709
 dance 'elberg is a book that does not 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.330
 belongs to the youth genre as you can 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.800
 see or you know apart from literature 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.720
 juvenile also from other genres 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.640
 literary and the seller is one of my 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.470
 I do not know, I do not know, it's fashionable, it was 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.840
 a book that attracted me completely is 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.370
 I did not like something that I liked 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.110
 he called powerfully 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.640
 that I had to read it is a book that 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.989
 I have not read yet I have many 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.640
 want to do it because the truth is that 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.440
 it looks great there has not been 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.420
 no review through the internet what 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.830
 which I do not know if I thought it was good or 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.140
 bad but I'll show you the edition of 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.330
 the novel is softcover with flaps 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.069
 here you can see the author has a total 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.069
 of 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.069
 400 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.480
 58 pages and the truth is that the lyrics 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.530
 it's pretty big 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.030
 I hope it is one of the next 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.890
 readings during this beginning of the month 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.180
 August and enjoy it because the 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.830
 truth is that I really want to 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.720
 to be able to immerse myself in this good story 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.130
 So far the jester or email has arrived 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.270

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.720
 month to main where I have seen so 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.160
 little books is that I have not had 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.290
 practically no free time to 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.580
 wander me through a bookstore or buy 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.070
 quietly because it has been like a 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.540
 month very very oppressive and August because 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.680
 you know I'm not going to ask for many books 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.840
 because I will be outside during 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.920
