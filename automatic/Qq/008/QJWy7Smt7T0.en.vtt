over<00:02:45.239> there<00:02:45.360> what<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.570> thought<00:02:45.750> was<00:02:45.840> kind<00:02:45.959> of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
over there what I thought was kind of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.750 
over there what I thought was kind of
cool<00:02:46.170> about<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> mouse<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.640> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
cool about the mouse but it is that it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.400 
cool about the mouse but it is that it
actually<00:02:47.940> has<00:02:48.239> an<00:02:48.420> up-and-down<00:02:48.630> scroll<00:02:49.170> key

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
actually has an up-and-down scroll key

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.600 
actually has an up-and-down scroll key
over<00:02:49.620> there<00:02:49.739> as<00:02:49.860> well<00:02:50.040> which<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.280> kind<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.489> nice

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
over there as well which is kind of nice

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.190 
over there as well which is kind of nice
and<00:02:50.820> useful<00:02:51.000> okay<00:02:51.870> I'm<00:02:51.930> going<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.080> go<00:02:52.140> ahead

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
and useful okay I'm going to go ahead
