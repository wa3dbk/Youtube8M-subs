00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
something I saw them do it was like an

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.990 
something I saw them do it was like an
outdoorsy<00:00:17.190> kind<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.430> video<00:00:17.699> they<00:00:17.910> were

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
outdoorsy kind of video they were

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.150 
outdoorsy kind of video they were
showing<00:00:18.180> how<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:19.050> know<00:00:19.170> start<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.740> fire<00:00:19.920> or

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
showing how to you know start a fire or

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.820 
showing how to you know start a fire or
something<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.260> we'll<00:00:22.260> probably<00:00:22.410> not<00:00:22.590> start<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
something and we'll probably not start a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.080 
something and we'll probably not start a
fire<00:00:22.980> since<00:00:23.220> there<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> Zippo<00:00:23.760> involved

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
fire since there was a Zippo involved

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.839 
fire since there was a Zippo involved
but<00:00:24.650> he<00:00:25.650> pulled<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:25.949> his<00:00:26.010> Zippo<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.670> had

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
but he pulled out his Zippo and I had

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.849 
but he pulled out his Zippo and I had
this<00:00:27.119> kind<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.449> black<00:00:27.660> rap<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this kind of black rap on it which I

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.710 
this kind of black rap on it which I
assume<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.670> assumed<00:00:30.179> at<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.359> time<00:00:30.510> was<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
assume I assumed at the time was a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.310 
assume I assumed at the time was a
ranger<00:00:31.109> band<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.140> they

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
ranger band and I was right and they

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.870 
ranger band and I was right and they
never<00:00:34.440> really<00:00:34.559> talked<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.760> when<00:00:35.850> I

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
never really talked about it but when I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.400 
never really talked about it but when I
saw<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.450> dawned<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.840> me<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.200> he<00:00:37.230> was

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
saw it it dawned on me that he was

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.400 
saw it it dawned on me that he was
putting<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.950> there<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.280> waterproofing

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
putting it on there for waterproofing

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.680 
putting it on there for waterproofing
well<00:00:40.410> probably<00:00:40.800> waterproofing<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.670> also<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
well probably waterproofing and also the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.100 
well probably waterproofing and also the
side<00:00:42.870> effect<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.200> conserving<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.579> fuel<00:00:44.820> in

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
side effect of conserving the fuel in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.869 
side effect of conserving the fuel in
the<00:00:46.110> Zippos<00:00:46.620> which<00:00:46.800> has<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> tendency<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the Zippos which has a tendency to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.900 
the Zippos which has a tendency to
evaporate<00:00:48.360> crazy<00:00:48.780> quick<00:00:49.219> as<00:00:50.219> I'm<00:00:50.520> sure<00:00:50.730> most

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
evaporate crazy quick as I'm sure most

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.979 
evaporate crazy quick as I'm sure most
of<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.210> know<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.480> you're<00:00:51.600> watching<00:00:51.899> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
of you know if you're watching this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.270 
of you know if you're watching this
video<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.550> I've<00:00:53.670> been<00:00:53.789> doing<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
video so I've been doing this for I

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.799 
video so I've been doing this for I
think<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.610> under<00:00:56.820> three<00:00:57.090> weeks<00:00:57.120> now<00:00:57.600> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
think just under three weeks now I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
think just under three weeks now I
filled<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.949> once<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> beginning<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
filled it up once at the beginning of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
filled it up once at the beginning of
the<00:01:00.359> three<00:01:00.570> weeks<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.440> yet<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.800> refill<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the three weeks I have yet to refill it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.729 
the three weeks I have yet to refill it
it<00:01:02.609> still<00:01:02.969> lights<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.600> charm

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it still lights up like a charm

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
it still lights up like a charm
so<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> thought<00:01:05.280> I'd<00:01:05.369> make<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> video<00:01:05.729> because

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so I thought I'd make a video because

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.149 
so I thought I'd make a video because
normally<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:07.650> my<00:01:07.890> flute<00:01:08.100> would

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
normally you know all my flute would

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.330 
normally you know all my flute would
haven't<00:01:08.490> gone<00:01:08.640> long<00:01:08.850> before<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.340> real

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
haven't gone long before then so real

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.899 
haven't gone long before then so real
quick<00:01:12.049> this<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.560> know<00:01:13.680> Ranger<00:01:14.580> bandit

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it's a bicycle inner tube the size that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.399 
it's a bicycle inner tube the size that
I<00:01:19.439> used<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.729> from<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.450> old<00:01:21.659> tire<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> had<00:01:22.259> just

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
I used was from this old tire I had just

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.490 
I used was from this old tire I had just
lying<00:01:22.619> around<00:01:22.799> which<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.470> 20<00:01:25.470> x<00:01:25.650> 1.5<00:01:27.140> 175<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
lying around which is 20 x 1.5 175 on a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.370 
lying around which is 20 x 1.5 175 on a
white<00:01:28.619> has<00:01:28.770> two<00:01:28.950> sizes<00:01:29.310> listed<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.840> just

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
white has two sizes listed this is just

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
white has two sizes listed this is just
some<00:01:31.530> random<00:01:31.680> tire<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.340> sure<00:01:32.520> any<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.630> know

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
some random tire I'm sure any you know

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.450 
some random tire I'm sure any you know
approximately<00:01:34.850> this<00:01:35.850> diameter<00:01:36.950> tire<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
approximately this diameter tire the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
approximately this diameter tire the
tube<00:01:38.670> will<00:01:38.820> work<00:01:39.829> but<00:01:41.329> you<00:01:42.329> cut<00:01:42.600> yourself<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
tube will work but you cut yourself a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.350 
tube will work but you cut yourself a
length<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:44.030> throw<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> over<00:01:45.299> your

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
length of it and throw it over your

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.429 
length of it and throw it over your
Zippo<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:45.899> simple<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.229> that

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
Zippo it's as simple as that

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.590 
Zippo it's as simple as that
I'm<00:01:46.649> getting<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.159> off<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.850> pretty<00:01:48.090> simple<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I'm getting it off it's pretty simple I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.660 
I'm getting it off it's pretty simple I
find<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.350> easier<00:01:49.439> easy<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> roll

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
find it's easier easy it's just to roll

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.399 
find it's easier easy it's just to roll
your<00:01:50.790> finger<00:01:51.060> down<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.390> side<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:54.320> light<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
your finger down one side and light it

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.910 
your finger down one side and light it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
up like I said this has been three weeks

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.709 
up like I said this has been three weeks

this<00:02:06.119> hasn't<00:02:06.329> been<00:02:06.479> kept<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.990> some<00:02:07.170> kind<00:02:07.350> of

this hasn't been kept in some kind of

this hasn't been kept in some kind of
ideal<00:02:07.829> conditions<00:02:08.700> or<00:02:08.849> anything<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.270> just

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
ideal conditions or anything it's just

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.360 
ideal conditions or anything it's just
been<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.629> my<00:02:09.690> pocket<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.349> don't<00:02:10.979> smoke<00:02:11.250> or

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
been in my pocket I don't smoke or

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.710 
been in my pocket I don't smoke or
anything<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.849> don't<00:02:11.970> probably<00:02:12.300> take<00:02:12.569> mine

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
anything so I don't probably take mine

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.270 
anything so I don't probably take mine
out<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:12.870> lie

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
out and lie

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.699 
out and lie
as<00:02:13.400> much<00:02:13.580> as<00:02:13.730> most<00:02:13.940> folks<00:02:14.209> but<00:02:15.170> during<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
as much as most folks but during the

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.230 
as much as most folks but during the
course<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.190> testing<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.610> have<00:02:16.640> taken<00:02:17.060> it

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
course of this testing I have taken it

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.780 
course of this testing I have taken it
out<00:02:17.300> every<00:02:17.540> day<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.920> know<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.459> let<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.730> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
out every day and you know just let it a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.970 
out every day and you know just let it a
handful<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.180> times<00:02:20.270> basically<00:02:21.140> done<00:02:21.770> this

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
handful of times basically done this

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.370 
handful of times basically done this
which<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.910> usually<00:02:23.569> what<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.750> do<00:02:23.840> with<00:02:24.050> Zippos

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
which is usually what I do with Zippos

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.900 
which is usually what I do with Zippos
like<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.680> said<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:24.860> don't<00:02:25.040> really<00:02:25.310> smoke

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
like I said I don't really smoke

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.309 
like I said I don't really smoke
well<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.180> smoked<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.510> pipe<00:02:26.630> occasionally<00:02:27.140> but<00:02:27.290> I

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
well I smoked a pipe occasionally but I

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.420 
well I smoked a pipe occasionally but I
don't<00:02:27.500> really<00:02:27.590> use<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:30.340> like<00:02:31.340> I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
don't really use this for it and like I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.580 
don't really use this for it and like I
said<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.360> far<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.690> seems<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.989> have<00:02:33.140> mitigated

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
said so far it seems to have mitigated

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.990 
said so far it seems to have mitigated
the<00:02:33.680> evaporation<00:02:34.130> quite<00:02:34.610> well<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:37.340> easy<00:02:37.730> it

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
the evaporation quite well it's easy it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.699 
the evaporation quite well it's easy it
also<00:02:38.150> adds<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.569> lot<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.810> grip<00:02:39.080> it<00:02:39.290> keeps<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.620> from

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
also adds a lot of grip it keeps it from

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.020 
also adds a lot of grip it keeps it from
wanting<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> slip<00:02:40.250> out<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.489> your<00:02:40.580> pocket<00:02:40.940> all

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
wanting to slip out of your pocket all

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.290 
wanting to slip out of your pocket all
the<00:02:41.120> time<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:42.800> suspect<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.850> makes<00:02:44.120> it

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
the time and I suspect it makes it

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.090 
the time and I suspect it makes it
pretty<00:02:44.450> damn<00:02:44.720> waterproof<00:02:45.170> which<00:02:45.860> we're<00:02:46.010> going

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
pretty damn waterproof which we're going

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.729 
pretty damn waterproof which we're going
to<00:02:46.160> test<00:02:46.340> right<00:02:46.730> now<00:02:47.200> I've<00:02:48.200> never<00:02:48.410> done<00:02:48.620> this

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
to test right now I've never done this

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.990 
to test right now I've never done this
before<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.220> can't<00:02:49.459> guarantee<00:02:49.610> it's<00:02:49.910> going

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
before so I can't guarantee it's going

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.220 
before so I can't guarantee it's going
to<00:02:50.090> work<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:51.260> we'll<00:02:51.410> find<00:02:51.620> out<00:02:51.769> together<00:02:53.230> I'm

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
to work but we'll find out together I'm

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.160 
to work but we'll find out together I'm
just<00:02:54.380> going<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.530> toss<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.190> India<00:02:56.170> chicken

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
just going to toss it India chicken

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.170 
just going to toss it India chicken
canna<00:02:57.560> science<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:01.190> I'm<00:03:01.640> going<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:01.850> assume

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
canna science and I'm going to assume

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.570 
canna science and I'm going to assume
that<00:03:02.239> if<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:03.019> dropped<00:03:03.440> your<00:03:03.560> Zippo<00:03:03.920> into<00:03:04.550> a

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
that if you dropped your Zippo into a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.340 
that if you dropped your Zippo into a
bunch<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.150> water<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.600> probably<00:03:05.810> would<00:03:06.230> have

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
bunch of water you probably would have

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.350 
bunch of water you probably would have
gotten<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.709> out<00:03:06.800> you<00:03:07.670> know<00:03:07.790> around<00:03:08.180> this

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
gotten it out you know around this

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.240 
gotten it out you know around this
amount<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.750> time<00:03:11.650> now<00:03:12.650> it's<00:03:12.769> gonna<00:03:12.860> be<00:03:12.950> harder

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
amount of time now it's gonna be harder

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.490 
amount of time now it's gonna be harder
to<00:03:13.280> get<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.330> rubber<00:03:14.870> off<00:03:14.959> cuz<00:03:15.230> it's<00:03:15.410> all

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
to get the rubber off cuz it's all

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.720 
to get the rubber off cuz it's all
soaking<00:03:15.800> wet

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.910 

apart<00:03:24.540> from<00:03:24.690> being<00:03:24.959> more<00:03:25.200> difficult<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.800> get

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
apart from being more difficult to get

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.580 
apart from being more difficult to get
off<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:27.060> underside<00:03:27.420> here<00:03:27.630> seems<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.200> be<00:03:28.349> dry

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
off the underside here seems to be dry

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.559 
off the underside here seems to be dry
and<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:30.000> lights<00:03:30.420> up<00:03:30.599> fine<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:33.209> only<00:03:33.239> thing<00:03:33.480> I

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
and it lights up fine the only thing I

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.750 
and it lights up fine the only thing I
can<00:03:33.690> say<00:03:33.900> about<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.860> first<00:03:35.250> light

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
can say about it is that the first light

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.550 
can say about it is that the first light
after<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.270> has<00:03:36.390> not<00:03:36.630> been<00:03:36.810> lit<00:03:37.050> for<00:03:37.080> quite<00:03:37.530> a

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
after it has not been lit for quite a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.960 
after it has not been lit for quite a
while<00:03:37.830> because<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.610> fuel<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:38.910> not

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
while because the fuel is not

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.900 
while because the fuel is not
evaporating<00:03:39.800> it's<00:03:40.800> not<00:03:40.950> like<00:03:41.100> explosive<00:03:41.790> or

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
evaporating it's not like explosive or

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.840 
evaporating it's not like explosive or
anything<00:03:42.120> but<00:03:42.959> there<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.739> some<00:03:43.950> kind<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.190> fuel

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
anything but there is some kind of fuel

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.550 
anything but there is some kind of fuel
vapor<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.600> you've<00:03:45.930> probably<00:03:46.230> seen<00:03:46.410> before

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
vapor that you've probably seen before

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.559 
vapor that you've probably seen before
that<00:03:47.130> they'll<00:03:47.400> get<00:03:47.520> trapped<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:48.239> know<00:03:48.270> under

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
that they'll get trapped you know under

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.360 
that they'll get trapped you know under
the<00:03:48.690> lid<00:03:48.840> here<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.319> first<00:03:49.709> light<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.190> do

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
the lid here so the first light you do

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.330 
the lid here so the first light you do
sometimes<00:03:51.120> kind<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.540> go<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.840> you'll<00:03:52.620> see<00:03:52.800> you

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
sometimes kind of go and you'll see you

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.520 
sometimes kind of go and you'll see you

really fast it's gone in you know a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.840 
really fast it's gone in you know a
fraction<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.989> second<00:03:58.489> again<00:03:59.489> it's<00:03:59.670> one<00:03:59.819> of

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
fraction of a second again it's one of

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.830 
fraction of a second again it's one of
those<00:03:59.970> things<00:04:00.120> you're<00:04:00.269> used<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.540> if<00:04:00.690> you're

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
those things you're used to if you're

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.800 
those things you're used to if you're
used<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.080> zip<00:04:01.290> boats<00:04:01.470> but<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.940> far<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.209> good

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
used to zip boats but so far so good

grip stays in your pocket the only real
downside<00:04:09.780> is<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.680> know<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.370> got<00:04:11.459> to

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
downside is that you know you got to

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.250 
downside is that you know you got to
roll<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.360> thing<00:04:12.569> down<00:04:12.720> before<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.110> use<00:04:13.230> your

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
roll this thing down before you use your

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.930 
roll this thing down before you use your
Zippo<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:14.160> if<00:04:14.250> you're<00:04:14.430> like<00:04:14.580> me<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:14.850> you

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
Zippo but if you're like me and you

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.240 
Zippo but if you're like me and you
don't<00:04:15.030> actually<00:04:15.269> smoke<00:04:15.480> anyway<00:04:15.989> then<00:04:16.500> it's

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
don't actually smoke anyway then it's

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.060 
don't actually smoke anyway then it's
not<00:04:17.430> really<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.030> big<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.389> deal<00:04:18.510> so<00:04:19.070> just

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
not really that big of a deal so just

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.419 
not really that big of a deal so just
thought<00:04:20.280> I'd<00:04:20.430> share<00:04:20.609> see<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.239> later
