00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.200
 greet you friends this exercise 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.079
 called concentrated lifting on 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.279
 biceps 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.290
 it can be performed in various 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.149
 modifications 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:29.110
 you can perform sitting when you clean 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:33.000
 elbow yourself in the knee can perform 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:37.000
 size when you take your hand away 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.070
 elbow to the opposite hand can 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.220
 perform as i showed at the very beginning 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.560
 standing on your feet when you lean 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.620
 forward you in general, then you can even 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.730
 perform with a barbell when you lift 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.700
 barbell resting your elbows your knees and 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.120
 would even be sitting here a feature of this 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.770
 exercise is that in it 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.230
 very extraordinarily large 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.890
 amplitude of movement during lifting 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.899
 projectile 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.500
 this is the first nuance and the second nuance 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.900
 is that the top point 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.710
 the strongest peak reduction remains 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.690
 that is, when we lift the projectile up 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.080
 the load is not removed from the top, it is the opposite 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.460
 as much as possible we can 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 detain indefinitely this 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.049
 peak maximum reduction and order 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.070
 finish off the most efficiently 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.640
 our biceps 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.720
 This exercise can be performed as 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.430
 supination and without supination if without 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.010
 supination but we do it and just 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.240
 raise dumbbells up if we do 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.340
 supination of us is still turning 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.549
 even better used on spitz but 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.369
 if you perform the rise supination you 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.420
 must remember that in this case dumbbell 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.369
 need to hold on 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.650
 dumbbell need to hold the top 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.659
 That's the way that is, no closer she 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.700
 should be a little finger she should be 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.890
 closer to the thumb for what it is 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.690
 done to make this part 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.670
 dumbbells 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.220
 it was harder than the one next to 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.320
 thumb because exactly here 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.020
 This is the harder part of the dumbbell 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.900
 you will be at the expense of the souvenir i function 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.310
 biceps unfold if you have all 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.110
 will be the opposite in general 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.860
 unfolding biceps function not 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.880
 will be involved in this exercise 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.040
 it is very important that your hand is especially 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.710
 your shoulder was strictly 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.050
 perpendicular to the floor of them god does not tilt 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.230
 forward not back it is desirable that here you are 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.100
 weighed your hand and you have it absolutely 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.490
 calmly hanging out you take the dumbbell 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.370
 when lifting weight elbow can 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.730
 a little bit going forward but it is not 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.660
 prevents concentrate peak load 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.270
 on our biceps 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.070
 the basic rules in this movement are such 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.770
 same as in the rest 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.480
 biceps exercises when you lift 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.959
 weight exhale when you drop weight 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.459
 get air top 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.890
 be sure to make a peak reduction 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.050
 this peak reduction should be more 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.500
 longer than other exercises on 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.180
 biceps 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.300
 because strictly speaking in this and 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.930
 is the whole highlight 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.640
 concentrated biceps flexion 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.470
 any concentrated bending on 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.870
 biceps bullfighting is characterized by the fact that 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.390
 the top points of them are very convenient to do 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.350
 maximum and peak reduction is 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.240
 exercise 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.370
 will not increase you the huge size of your 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.950
 biceps but among professionals there are 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.900
 the view that it forms a beautiful 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.990
 the peak that is beautiful when you are here 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.170
 Slide resource when it starts to hang out 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.080
 up in this I will tell you honestly not 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.230
 sure because biceps shape thing 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.210
 such know genetic does not depend on 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.790
 what exercises did you choose from 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.330
 which parents did you choose if u 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.800
 man from childbirth hand like a sausage then 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.080
 In general, this exercise is nothing to him. 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.080
 will help the other way if you have from 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.090
 nature has a high enough peak 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.550
 biceps then with this exercise you 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.830
 can realize it looks it all 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.290
 as follows we take a dumbbell here 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.010
 us hand loose loose i'm at all 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.830
 I like to do this exercise standing upright 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.050
 opposite hand in the knee against this 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.300
 I put my hand on my palm 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.270
 opposite knee and so in 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.100
 I have a certain stability I'm in 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.670
 I can stand this position enough 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.750
 long hand loose dangles down take 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.810
 dumbbell that's all the other muscles of me 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.100
 I feel very comfortable 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.320
 only biceps feels uncomfortable 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.690
 because he has to work and in 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.430
 this is generally the most important secret in 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.530
 any bodybuilding exercise needs 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.950
 strive to focus the load on 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.470
 target muscle and all other muscles to us 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.140
 in no case should not interfere 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.150
 concentrate this load on the target 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:07.760
 strictly concentrated 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.760
 dumbbell flexing biceps babe
