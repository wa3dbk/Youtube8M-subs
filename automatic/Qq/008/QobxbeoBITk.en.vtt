00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
close slow the move down a little bit by

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.840

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
just rocking backwards and forwards if

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.880 
just rocking backwards and forwards if
you<00:02:29.030> want<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.390> that's<00:02:29.870> actually<00:02:30.530> called<00:02:30.770> a

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
you want to that's actually called a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.310 
you want to that's actually called a
slow<00:02:31.160> comb<00:02:31.520> which<00:02:31.760> we'll<00:02:31.970> come<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.480> later<00:02:32.510> it's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
slow comb which we'll come to later it's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.080 
slow comb which we'll come to later it's
a<00:02:33.380> slight<00:02:33.620> variation<00:02:34.040> obviously<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:34.910> if<00:02:34.970> your

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
a slight variation obviously but if your

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.940 
a slight variation obviously but if your
left<00:02:35.300> hand<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:35.720> there<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.290> then<00:02:36.500> have<00:02:36.770> the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
left hand is there you then have the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.310 
left hand is there you then have the
option<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.520> this<00:02:37.970> case<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:38.480> we're<00:02:38.989> simply

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
option in this case so we're simply

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.760 
option in this case so we're simply
pushing<00:02:39.680> away<00:02:39.830> straight<00:02:40.489> away
