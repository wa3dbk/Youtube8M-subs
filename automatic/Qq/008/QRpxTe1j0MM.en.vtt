00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
god you know it's gonna make my jury

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.300 
god you know it's gonna make my jury
cloudy<00:02:53.959> especially<00:02:54.530> if<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.680> have<00:02:56.140> no

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
cloudy especially if you have no

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.860 
cloudy especially if you have no
rhinestone<00:02:58.310> pieces<00:02:58.880> or<00:02:59.060> whatever<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.450> wouldn't

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
rhinestone pieces or whatever I wouldn't

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.630 
rhinestone pieces or whatever I wouldn't
do<00:02:59.930> it<00:02:59.959> on<00:03:00.110> my<00:03:00.260> rhinestone<00:03:00.740> pieces<00:03:01.130> but<00:03:01.580> you

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
do it on my rhinestone pieces but you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.670 
do it on my rhinestone pieces but you
might<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.480> jury<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:02.900> has<00:03:02.959> little<00:03:03.350> stones

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
might have a jury that has little stones

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.650 
might have a jury that has little stones
in<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.070> these<00:03:04.310> rings<00:03:04.580> don't<00:03:05.330> worry

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
in it like these rings don't worry

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.690 
in it like these rings don't worry
because<00:03:05.870> once<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.230> spray<00:03:06.500> goes<00:03:06.740> on<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.490> may

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
because once the spray goes on it may

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.699 
because once the spray goes on it may
look<00:03:07.910> cloudy<00:03:08.270> initially<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.170> it's<00:03:09.290> gonna<00:03:09.410> dry

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
look cloudy initially but it's gonna dry

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.040 
look cloudy initially but it's gonna dry
clear<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.220> essentially<00:03:11.030> that's<00:03:11.240> all<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.840> do

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
clear and essentially that's all you do

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.080 
clear and essentially that's all you do
you<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.380> gonna<00:03:12.470> let<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:12.920> sit<00:03:13.280> there<00:03:13.519> until

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
you just gonna let it sit there until

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.120 
you just gonna let it sit there until
it's<00:03:14.540> dries<00:03:14.870> for<00:03:15.110> about<00:03:15.320> ten<00:03:15.590> minutes<00:03:15.920> time

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
it's dries for about ten minutes time

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.040 
it's dries for about ten minutes time
you'll<00:03:16.489> be<00:03:16.640> able<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.940> pick<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.269> up<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.600> wear<00:03:18.019> it

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
you'll be able to pick it up and wear it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.270 
you'll be able to pick it up and wear it
if<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.350> feel<00:03:18.500> like<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.830> missed<00:03:19.040> any<00:03:19.190> spots

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
if you feel like you missed any spots

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.100 
if you feel like you missed any spots
you<00:03:19.700> can<00:03:19.850> cut<00:03:20.090> probably<00:03:20.300> go<00:03:20.510> back<00:03:20.690> over<00:03:21.080> it

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
you can cut probably go back over it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.960 
you can cut probably go back over it
right<00:03:21.680> now<00:03:21.890> you'll<00:03:22.160> probably<00:03:22.370> notice<00:03:22.670> it

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
right now you'll probably notice it

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.240 
right now you'll probably notice it
might<00:03:23.180> look<00:03:23.480> like<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.840> has<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:23.989> slightly<00:03:24.410> cloudy

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
might look like it has a slightly cloudy

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.759 
might look like it has a slightly cloudy
hue<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.030> but<00:03:26.660> that's<00:03:27.019> only<00:03:27.350> because<00:03:27.530> the

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
hue to it but that's only because the

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.650 
hue to it but that's only because the
spray<00:03:28.010> just<00:03:28.220> went<00:03:28.459> on<00:03:28.580> when<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:29.030> dries<00:03:29.300> it's

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
spray just went on when it dries it's

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.530 
spray just went on when it dries it's
going<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:30.110> dry<00:03:30.410> down<00:03:30.830> clear<00:03:31.340> not<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.060> big<00:03:32.330> issue

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
going to dry down clear not a big issue

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.780 
going to dry down clear not a big issue
after<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:33.800> wouldn't<00:03:34.160> touch<00:03:34.400> it<00:03:34.459> because

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
after that I wouldn't touch it because

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
after that I wouldn't touch it because
you<00:03:34.880> don't<00:03:34.970> want<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.239> have<00:03:35.360> sticky

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
you don't want to have sticky

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.070 
you don't want to have sticky
fingerprints<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:37.040> your<00:03:37.100> jury<00:03:38.060> pieces<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.050> I

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
fingerprints and your jury pieces so I

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.960 
fingerprints and your jury pieces so I
would<00:03:39.320> just<00:03:39.350> leave<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:39.920> there<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.220> let<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.580> sit

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
would just leave it there and let it sit

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.120 
would just leave it there and let it sit
and<00:03:41.180> dry<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.690> best<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.170> do<00:03:42.410> this<00:03:42.590> in<00:03:42.650> a

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
and dry it's best to do this in a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
and dry it's best to do this in a
ventilated<00:03:43.580> area<00:03:44.560> that's<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.860> let<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.550> dry<00:03:46.760> and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
ventilated area that's it let it dry and

00:03:47.150 --> 00:04:00.290 
ventilated area that's it let it dry and
that's<00:03:47.420> it

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.950
