now let's jump over the table and let's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.560 
now let's jump over the table and let's
actually<00:01:34.740> delve<00:01:35.130> into<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> box<00:01:35.610> alright

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
actually delve into the box alright

the box open whole thing out set it off
the<00:02:35.069> side<00:02:35.310> already<00:02:36.060> then<00:02:36.360> now<00:02:36.569> okay<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.959> will

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the side already then now okay I will

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.869 
the side already then now okay I will
admit<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.680> took<00:02:37.829> me<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> lot<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.310> doggone<00:02:38.670> time

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
admit it took me a lot of doggone time

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.130 
admit it took me a lot of doggone time
but<00:02:39.500> now<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.680> seems<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.510> tab<00:02:42.689> here<00:02:42.720> is

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
but now it seems that on the tab here is

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.780 
but now it seems that on the tab here is
using<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.500> correct<00:02:43.769> way<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:43.980> open<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> box<00:02:44.579> so

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
there we go no more upside-down boxing's

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.470 
there we go no more upside-down boxing's
inside<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.909> can<00:02:48.060> see<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.510> card<00:02:49.700> all<00:02:50.700> of

then let's take a look at the card

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.869 
then let's take a look at the card
itself<00:03:46.160> go<00:03:47.160> ahead<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.400> pull<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.609> out<00:03:47.699> of<00:03:47.730> its

itself go ahead and pull it out of its

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.550 
itself go ahead and pull it out of its
anti-static<00:03:48.329> bag<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> anaesthetic<00:03:49.379> bag

flip it around you guys can see the
sapphire<00:05:17.900> logo<00:05:18.260> though<00:05:18.410> so<00:05:18.740> here's<00:05:19.520> the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
sapphire logo though so here's the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.250 
sapphire logo though so here's the
Sapphire<00:05:20.000> logo<00:05:21.940> six<00:05:22.940> pin<00:05:23.120> power<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:24.170> you're

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
Sapphire logo six pin power so you're

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.250 
Sapphire logo six pin power so you're
gonna<00:05:24.350> have<00:05:24.500> got<00:05:24.590> 150<00:05:25.250> TDP<00:05:27.490> single<00:05:29.260> crossfire

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
gonna have got 150 TDP single crossfire

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.430 
gonna have got 150 TDP single crossfire
connection<00:05:30.770> right<00:05:30.860> here<00:05:30.920> up<00:05:31.130> on<00:05:31.250> top<00:05:32.350> so<00:05:33.350> you

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
connection right here up on top so you

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.800 
connection right here up on top so you
can<00:05:33.560> only<00:05:33.710> do<00:05:33.920> two<00:05:34.220> waik<00:05:34.540> crossfire<00:05:35.540> you<00:05:35.660> won't

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
can only do two waik crossfire you won't

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.770 
can only do two waik crossfire you won't
be<00:05:35.870> doing<00:05:35.990> quad<00:05:36.290> on<00:05:36.410> this<00:05:36.530> card<00:05:36.770> at<00:05:36.890> all<00:05:36.980> so

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
be doing quad on this card at all so

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.000 
be doing quad on this card at all so
that's<00:05:38.780> pretty<00:05:39.020> much<00:05:39.200> it<00:05:39.410> till<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.770> get<00:05:39.860> the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
that's pretty much it till you get the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.970 
that's pretty much it till you get the
card<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.600> all<00:05:41.600> the<00:05:41.750> accessories<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.740> that's

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
card and all the accessories and that's
