00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
playbook and then at some point we'll

playbook and then at some point we'll
give<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.050> overall<00:00:52.460> maybe<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
give you it and overall maybe not a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.099 
give you it and overall maybe not a
review<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:55.010> what<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.100> think<00:00:56.309> about<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:57.109> we've

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
review but what we think about it we've

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.490 
review but what we think about it we've
reviewed<00:00:58.530> several<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.309> box<00:01:00.320> products<00:01:01.320> before

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
reviewed several to box products before

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.439 
reviewed several to box products before
and<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.430> no<00:01:02.520> databases<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.390> do

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and there's no databases that they do

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.899 
and there's no databases that they do
offer<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.229> best<00:01:04.409> protection<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:05.070> by<00:01:05.489> tablets

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
offer the best protection for by tablets

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.630 
offer the best protection for by tablets
and<00:01:06.060> phones<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.070> let's<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.490> figure

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and phones so let's see if we can figure

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.179 
and phones so let's see if we can figure
this<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:08.970> else<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.900> always<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
this one else there is as always on the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.469 
this one else there is as always on the
inside<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> box<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:12.119> instructions

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
inside the box there are instructions

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.770 
inside the box there are instructions
and<00:01:13.939> I'm<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.180> see<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.600> figure

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and I'm going to see if I can figure

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
and I'm going to see if I can figure
this<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.229> myself<00:01:18.470> ok<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.799> there's<00:01:20.070> cut

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
this one out myself ok so there's cut

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.609 
this one out myself ok so there's cut
one<00:01:21.299> off<00:01:21.330> we'll<00:01:21.810> come<00:01:22.020> back<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
one off we'll come back to that in a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:32.420 
one off we'll come back to that in a
second<00:01:23.869> we<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:28.500> silicone<00:01:31.430> rubber

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
second we then have the silicone rubber

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.580 
second we then have the silicone rubber
case<00:01:34.520> which<00:01:35.520> will<00:01:35.880> again<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.450> back<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.930> which

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
case which will again go back to which

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.440 
case which will again go back to which
leaves<00:01:37.860> us<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.460> set<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.000> plastic

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
leaves us with this set this plastic

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
leaves us with this set this plastic
shell<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:40.110> will<00:01:40.290> says<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.590> has<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> screen

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
shell which will says it has a screen

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
shell which will says it has a screen
protector<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.240> well<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.770 

like<00:01:50.350> so<00:01:50.620> as<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:50.980> can<00:01:51.070> see<00:01:51.280> there<00:01:51.730> is<00:01:51.760> a<00:01:51.970> cutout

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
like so as you can see there is a cutout

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.910 
like so as you can see there is a cutout
on<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.920> back<00:01:54.100> there<00:01:54.310> for<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.520> camera<00:01:55.920> inside

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
on the back there for the camera inside

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.880 
on the back there for the camera inside
the<00:01:57.460> plastic<00:01:57.640> shell<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:59.200> these<00:01:59.440> two<00:01:59.650> pieces

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
the plastic shell is these two pieces

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.430 
the plastic shell is these two pieces
off<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:01.270> not<00:02:01.510> quite<00:02:01.690> short<00:02:01.930> they<00:02:02.050> are<00:02:02.200> but

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
off I'm not quite short they are but

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.620 
off I'm not quite short they are but
this<00:02:02.560> spongy<00:02:03.160> which<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.940> obviously<00:02:04.330> can<00:02:04.510> offer

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
this spongy which is obviously can offer

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.740 
this spongy which is obviously can offer
some<00:02:04.870> protection<00:02:04.900> so<00:02:06.090> playbook<00:02:07.090> clearly<00:02:07.570> goes

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
some protection so playbook clearly goes

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.460 
some protection so playbook clearly goes
in<00:02:07.990> there<00:02:08.440> like<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.900> part<00:02:14.200> then

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
in there like so and in that part then

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.980 
in there like so and in that part then
goes<00:02:15.130> on<00:02:15.160> there<00:02:15.910> if<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.330> put<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.720> right<00:02:16.840> way

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
goes on there if I put it the right way

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:35.970 
goes on there if I put it the right way
up<00:02:17.170> what<00:02:32.160> case<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.390> snapping<00:02:34.390> all<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.980> little

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
up what case of snapping all the little

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.510 
up what case of snapping all the little
bits<00:02:36.070> into<00:02:36.310> place<00:02:36.640> which<00:02:36.970> isn't<00:02:38.370> too<00:02:39.370> crazy

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
bits into place which isn't too crazy

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.050 
bits into place which isn't too crazy
ones<00:02:40.090> sit<00:02:40.360> behind<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.750> camera<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.340> what<00:02:42.580> bear

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
ones sit behind a camera so what bear

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:59.699 
ones sit behind a camera so what bear
with<00:02:43.210> me<00:02:43.420> here<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:45.760> go

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.080 

that's<00:03:00.709> more<00:03:00.860> or<00:03:00.890> less<00:03:00.950> done<00:03:01.569> so<00:03:03.519> we<00:03:04.519> then<00:03:04.700> put

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
that's more or less done so we then put

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.059 
that's more or less done so we then put
the<00:03:05.239> silicone<00:03:06.879> sleeve<00:03:07.879> on<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.239> again<00:03:08.689> for

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
the silicone sleeve on it again for

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:28.899 
the silicone sleeve on it again for
extra<00:03:10.069> protection<00:03:26.079> like<00:03:27.079> so<00:03:27.409> and<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.459> as<00:03:28.760> you

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
extra protection like so and so as you

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:38.250 
extra protection like so and so as you
can<00:03:29.000> see<00:03:30.849> we've<00:03:31.849> got<00:03:33.790> buttons<00:03:34.790> accessible<00:03:37.150> to
