00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
years ago actually several years ago but

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.870 
years ago actually several years ago but
I<00:00:19.450> never<00:00:19.510> used<00:00:19.960> it<00:00:20.140> that<00:00:20.290> much<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.640> it<00:00:21.730> looks

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
I never used it that much and it looks

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.410 
I never used it that much and it looks
just<00:00:21.970> like<00:00:22.270> a<00:00:22.330> regular<00:00:22.810> digital<00:00:23.380> camera<00:00:24.390> got<00:00:25.390> a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
just like a regular digital camera got a

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.620 
just like a regular digital camera got a
lens<00:00:26.130> flash<00:00:27.130> but<00:00:27.550> I<00:00:27.610> keep<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:28.000> flash<00:00:28.300> off

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
lens flash but I keep the flash off

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.170 
lens flash but I keep the flash off
because<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.920> pictures<00:00:30.280> always<00:00:30.550> get<00:00:30.910> messed

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
because the pictures always get messed

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.849 
because the pictures always get messed
