 a You're recent on youtube 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:13.850
 I mean that look before bouncing various videos 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:17.620
 It is that there is no Rutteyuu seen a lot of play-by-play video if it just me 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.730
 Yes I watched a lot of recent videos 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.400
 Matsumoto Hitoshi 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.400
 Wide na Show that Koji's Higashino is out 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 It is a custom to come out after seeing a little bit every night, and it is such a 100 yen Thank you in advance 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:42.300
 Well is another right now today of news It is news today that a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:48.210
 PlayStation 4 system software version 1.70 delivered April 30 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.399
 And along with whether it refers to the hdcp signal as good I'll There are off and Nico students corresponding 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.020
 To say that until now 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.590
 If you deliver it the game better to live rather well hdmi management 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.690
 It is a blow 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:08.000
 I think that many people used to deliver even if you use only hdmi 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.510
 When I connect my sister Playstation 4 to playstation 3 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 That 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.650
 I can't deliver 6 I can't deliver, so that's for that signal 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.300
 The protection was on but it was on 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.370
 It was not possible to record from 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:29.350
 Sony said that before PlayStation 4 was released 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:35.470
 If it cancels the protection called hdcp and cancels it by the update 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:39.320
 I was saying that but I did not know whether to actually do 2 It is this April 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.700
 It is no longer an update to deliver in 30 days and this saw O and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.380
 There is no 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:51.500
 If you have a capture card for hdmi , without special settings 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.280
 It is in color that hdmi can be connected to PlayStation 4 to be able to record 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.090
 I can do it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.590
 Well it is also 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:04.670
 When the Well can broadcast to anti live in that Nico 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.290
 Well, also for remote play on the Playstation vita TV 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.119
 If it corresponds 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:14.250
 This is great 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.170
 Until now, it 's only about counting with that book and finger Playstation 4's live game 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.569
 If you are, youtube 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:26.180
 It was not on that delivery site, but a lot of people play along with this 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.180
 You're not going to give the video of station 4 to YouTube 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.850
 Look at the screw breath of other people as being little same that play-by-play will care after all 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.700
 Like the all means 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.700
 Live Please show me in the video up thank you 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:46.020
 No, it's good news for real people 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.380
 The only thing I care about is Nico Nico Live 30 minutes 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.430
 I guess there's something like that frame 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.849
 There is a thing to be reopened each time or to spend money and extend it 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.340
 It 's a bit of a concern about what it looks like on PlayStation 4 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.950
ます 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.120
 It is a bit of a question whether you can live continuously without setting the primary extension 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.140
 c That's a great place 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.980
 For today's system update of news playstation 4 in that I 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.819
 It was 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.659
 How was it by saying yes 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.860
 News of playstation 4 but I forgot to say 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:24.010
 Playstation 4 this last in the kill zone 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.890
 It seems that there was a tournament money, two people who I know 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.000
 2 Suchitsu 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.810
 It seems had been played, but the team's also sound person's 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.360
 Eh, something really 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.260
 that 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.420
 Though it was said variously by tweet, I was not able to see it because of the time difference a little 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.180
 I think a little by punishment of that child 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.470
 I think that was specified that Thank alliance like to have until you tired of 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.980
 I'd have to ask to what can be described as supported by something amazing that the Senate 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.890
 I couldn't say it's a direct congratulation, so I 'm sorry. 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:00.240
 I think that I would like to live again at 500 yen.
