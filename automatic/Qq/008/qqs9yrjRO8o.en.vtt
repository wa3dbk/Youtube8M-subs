00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:08.440
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:10.600
 what are you doing, I hope you are 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.760
 all very well they commented a news 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.550
 that does not come from any websites in 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.250
 what has been a search recipe for 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.689
 the black ops 2 white maps 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.239
 I was looking for black ops maps 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.609
 everyone to see how the gameplays went 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:27.759
 they had gone up something new I have seen a 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:34.059
 gameplay that notes dated 28 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:36.490
 September is saying yesterday and that says 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.670
 what good black ops multiplayer gameplay 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.860
 and the jacket is worth his box will be the name 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.890
 of the map and has been analyzing a 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.350
 little bit and said oysters here here this 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:52.130
 this this ado soil map is not 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:56.360
 It's okay but it's saying by God 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.570
 it sounds a lot to me the map is still a 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.290
 kind of boat or not cruising in the 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.790
 what good will we have to 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.190
 capturing I think it's the barracks and 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.890
 really good was looking and such and 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.280
 diego host change many things but 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.920
 la s the essence is from a dlc that came 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.610
 of the black ops 1 that is the one of hotel the one of 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.890
 hotel del black ops 1 which was a hotel 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.260
 with two towers of buildings one opposite 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.950
 to the other they are in front of each other and 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:33.780
 already in the middle a pool with a kiosk and 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.220
 some lateral shelter areas do not 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.130
 is dominating the diego map but it is that 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.280
 yes exactly the same is what is nailed 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.290
 I do not not to say anything they are commenting 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.910
 that this game is going to be the best color 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.560
 they have taken out and that is what 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.780
 they were commenting and I can not say 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.729
 nothing because I have not played I have not 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.380
 tried we can not say many things 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.180
 but from the people who have tried it and 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.640
 analysts who have been in contact with 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.590
 this game have been saying that that 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.780
 is the best white is the luxury color and 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.380
 that they have taken out so far 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.050
 and comment that really what you see 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.410
 it remains the creativity of the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.900
 maps at least of this yes yes since 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.459
 It's not much because I'm seeing that it's 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.380
 which is exactly the same as 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.090
 structure is the same as the hotel map 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.680
 where it says it came from the black ops 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.159
 one 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.739
 but they have changed instead of putting a 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:30.010
 hotel at the top of a building and it is 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.340
 they have put what is being a boat 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.750
 a cruise I want you to look at the map he 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.640
 what has been the video that is in 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.889

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.079
 you will see and I want you to tell me what 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:44.319
 you think about it because it really is 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.030
 a little bit I do not know how creativity 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.030
 like creativity a little bit 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.650
 has exhausted them a little but I think that 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.870
 I want you to tell me about it and that 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.879
 tell me what you think about it like that 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.129
