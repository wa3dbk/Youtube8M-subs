to the sled that you're training for

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.479 
to the sled that you're training for
basically<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.019> way<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.829> a<00:02:10.979> lot<00:02:11.459> more

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
basically the way is it's a lot more

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.460 
basically the way is it's a lot more
weight<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.060> ATV<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.780> does<00:02:12.930> roll<00:02:13.170> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
weight on the ATV but it does roll it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
weight on the ATV but it does roll it
has<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> little<00:02:13.860> more<00:02:13.980> resistance<00:02:14.420> probably

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
has a little more resistance probably

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.270 
has a little more resistance probably
about<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.569> thousand<00:02:16.019> pounds<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.410> post<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
bones they get it going it's no problem

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.080 
bones they get it going it's no problem
