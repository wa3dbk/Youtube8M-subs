 finished writing all the work 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.940
 man for his mouth everything is basically everything 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.360
 physical effort is not limited to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.449
 to eat sleep well run 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.620
 and she went you little but the soul with him 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.449
 not filled 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.129
 but to the feast the animal is the soul because to her 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.820
 still need every day for a new 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.859
 and all this work on well, it can not 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.140
 fill it endless then of course 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.299
 God bless you before the sound of food 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.010
 assorted that the less need 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.320
 man , the more he will have life and 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.590
 partly because little need 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.490
 oh that her piri piri goes back already this this 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.820
 already regarded as happiness now 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.509
 further 8 excerpt he runs and monitor li 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:29.310
 ha ha min axel what advantage ear 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.689
 cad in front of axel is he who sins 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.200
 because they ca n't handle 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:39.180
 with their desires, pray for a week 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.590
 with a high and he says what 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:47.549
 cad's ear advantage over this 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.649
 sinner that is haham man knowing 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.930
 Haham translates to the one who knows toor 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.310
 he who knows how it works 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.790
 taco hah ammm she like him 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.520
 The advantage over this teller is that 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.850
 he can he can do the commandments he 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.960
 can do what builds 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.450
 his spiritual 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.610
 well your spiritual essence which will 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.790
 live forever that is and in this advantage 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.160
 important in Chacham and a knowledgeable cheese 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.900
 before who doesn't know or before 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.540
 who know but doesn't make it worse 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.410
 then who knows and does not do worse than someone 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.670
 does not know and does not make clear 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.350
 now here is this knowledgeable person 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.330
 can perform the same actions 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.340
 almost the same actions that 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.900
 any other person but he 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.910
 can each action be tied to 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.190
 to serve God to make a commandment of him 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.050
 every practical action perth here 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.500
 said to have all your business in the name 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.209
 heaven 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.060
 that is, and there is a lot 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.890
 here are the commandments of stora that have a book 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.400
 called the book where he talks about 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.470
 mitzvot 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.810
 and about the commandments soon that is relevant 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.320
 today and he is there the preface begin 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.870
 what a check he can do very great 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.120
 things but don't know what is the commandment and he and 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.290
 does it just for himself and so if 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.930
 he knew that through these 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.220
 through the same actions he would 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.880
 raised to forget god says you beg and not 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.670
 paid the book to the high and what he says 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.910
 poor who knows how to go not gotta 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.430
 haim here is not a bastard is not against life here 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.380
 literally very difficult at all here I am not 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.900
 could understand two days probably what is here 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.220
 written because even with comments 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.630
 it doesn't get any easier literally 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.470
 the whole passage sounds so from the beginning to 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.769
 the end is how to understand what 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:47.760
 advantage of uhaha u 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.400
 in front of the cashier in front of the sinner and and that 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.560
 for the poor who know how to go 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.480
 against life at all by him but not at all 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.959
 does you make any sense the door 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.250
 if an atom delve into the comments and 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.620
 so what he wants to say 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.390
 before this was a conversation about what what 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.079
 tangible she 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.200
 but then why are people chasing but not saturated 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.109
 Now 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.450
 and what then to do is the one who 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.030
 smart he can 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.090
 choose what path of life is service 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.730
 God does not need to be rich 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.850
 because the poor man who 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.460
 knowing that and how to go mega you 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.860
 here is not against life opened life is 1 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.350
 the year translates that is check even the poor 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.300
 he can still on the total on the total 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.720
 recruit more mitzvot more spirituality 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.720
 more than real life 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.760
 what gives eternal life here too 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.210
 money is not needed but against this 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.870
 the word there does not mind there is a 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:05:03.300
 it means that now it says it means it means 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:06.210
 u molya not how about not found goals ayan this 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:12.479
 to life well i mean it don't like it 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:14.430
 the word is not the main thing here this is what 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:18.060
 rich poor can perform equally 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.680
 the commandments of god and and maybe that for well 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.979
 you can't say which of them they are 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.990
 will be more valuable because it is written 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.539
 Whether rogar puncture more suffering 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.400
 the greater the reward but it can be hard 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.770
 rich to fulfill the commandment that 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.680
 it there is a lot of temptation for his vanity in 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.200
 him about the problems and can the poor hard 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.289
 he, too, but their complexity that is 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.700
 like a test of wealth test 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.190
 poverty and melt but the same 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.080
 test now can both there and there they 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.180
 but do not pay attention to spirituality a 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.680
 can and there and there pay attention 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.610
 spirituality meaning it is not 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.210
 the determining factor further he says 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:02.340
 so then in the sea and on them meal windows fish he 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:05.490
 said that good to see the way his eyes 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.590
 the soul was also not clear to me what kind of 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.169
 very well with the eyes of the circle of the soul he 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.210
 says it would be good for a person to see 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.060
 with my own eyes where the soul goes 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:18.900
 That would be such a valuable thing. 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.510
 because when you see your check 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.770
 With eyes that oregano will go wildly into eternal 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.289
 life in paradise 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.349
 souls of the righteous souls of sinners they are there 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.190
 torment disappear and well that is and he would 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.530
 saw that 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.419
 true price to everything that happens here 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.419
 but he continues
