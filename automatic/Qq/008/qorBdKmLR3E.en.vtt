but<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.509> think<00:01:24.840> it'd<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:24.990> weird<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.380> he

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
but you know I think it'd be weird if he

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.890 
but you know I think it'd be weird if he
fought<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.950> cape<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:27.090> maybe<00:01:27.240> he<00:01:27.780> has

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
fought with a cape on but maybe he has

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
fought with a cape on but maybe he has
it<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.439> alternate<00:01:29.009> costumes<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.520> don't

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
it on all alternate costumes I don't

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
it on all alternate costumes I don't
know<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.229> first<00:01:31.470> character

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
I'm pretty excited now this is my first

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.840 
I'm pretty excited now this is my first
theory<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.920> thought<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:44.490> were<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
theory I thought they were going to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.789 
theory I thought they were going to
reveal<00:01:45.180> mushroom<00:01:45.659> they<00:01:45.750> will<00:01:45.990> not<00:01:46.170> reveal<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
reveal mushroom they will not reveal I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.920 
reveal mushroom they will not reveal I
thought<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.729> unlock<00:01:47.850> two<00:01:48.270> characters<00:01:48.780> in

thought you can unlock two characters in

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.510 
thought you can unlock two characters in
the<00:01:49.049> campaign<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.890> one<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.220> them<00:01:50.340> would<00:01:50.490> be

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
