properly<00:00:43.100> what<00:00:44.100> I'll<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.489> I'll<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.640> spray

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
properly what I'll do is I'll just spray

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
properly what I'll do is I'll just spray
in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> corner<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.660> my<00:00:45.719> shop<00:00:46.440> towel<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
in the corner of my shop towel here a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.299 
in the corner of my shop towel here a
little<00:00:47.579> bit<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> nitro<00:00:48.120> tech<00:00:48.329> cleaner

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.939 
take the set screw pinch it and clean it
and<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.360> see<00:00:54.510> here<00:00:54.780> there's<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and as you can see here there's a lot of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.410 
and as you can see here there's a lot of
dirt<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.160> grime<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.969> comes<00:00:57.210> off<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
dirt and grime that just comes off the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.520 
dirt and grime that just comes off the
screw<00:00:58.340> that<00:00:59.340> would<00:00:59.579> generally<00:01:00.379> hinder<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
screw that would generally hinder the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.700 
screw that would generally hinder the
bond<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> thread<00:01:03.059> lock<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:04.470> with

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
bond with the thread lock so now with

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.730 
bond with the thread lock so now with
both<00:01:05.100> set<00:01:05.430> screws<00:01:05.700> clean<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
both set screws clean you want to do the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
both set screws clean you want to do the
same<00:01:07.920> thing<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.939> coupler<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.689> pin<00:01:09.960> just

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
same thing with the coupler the pin just

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
same thing with the coupler the pin just
basically<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> metal<00:01:11.340> parts<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:12.479> spray

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
basically all the metal parts just spray

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.469 
basically all the metal parts just spray
a<00:01:12.780> little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.290> cleaner<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.710> everything

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
a little bit of cleaner out everything

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and then what I do is I actually take

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.510 
and then what I do is I actually take
the<00:01:29.880> thread<00:01:30.180> lock<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.740> I'll<00:01:31.860> put<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> small

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the thread lock and I'll put a small

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.819 
the thread lock and I'll put a small
amount<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> thread<00:01:33.299> lock<00:01:33.509> down<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.710> the

amount of the thread lock down in the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.230 
amount of the thread lock down in the
threads<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.140> then<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:39.600> set<00:01:39.869> screw

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
threads and then also on the set screw

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.520 
threads and then also on the set screw
then<00:01:42.240> I'll<00:01:42.360> take<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> set<00:01:42.930> screw<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
then I'll take the set screw and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
then I'll take the set screw and
actually<00:01:44.280> run<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:46.100> into<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> coupler<00:01:47.610> making

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
actually run it into the coupler making

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.270 
actually run it into the coupler making

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the way throughout the threads then I'll

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.620 
the way throughout the threads then I'll
take<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> small<00:01:55.890> amount<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.490> thread<00:01:57.060> lock<00:01:57.270> and
