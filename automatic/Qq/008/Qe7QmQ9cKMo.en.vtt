well<00:00:11.250> we've<00:00:11.400> noticed<00:00:11.730> about<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.150> spot<00:00:12.389> after

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
well we've noticed about the spot after

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.379 
well we've noticed about the spot after
using<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.230> two<00:00:13.469> days<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:14.009> when<00:00:15.000> your<00:00:15.150> stick

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
using it for two days is when your stick

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.420 
using it for two days is when your stick
handling<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.139> doesn't<00:00:16.500> flip<00:00:16.770> up<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.190> its<00:00:17.369> side

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
handling it doesn't flip up on its side

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.570 
handling it doesn't flip up on its side
it<00:00:17.850> stays<00:00:18.090> flat<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.859> when<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:20.010> stick<00:00:20.250> also

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
it stays flat and when your stick also

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.000 
it stays flat and when your stick also
on<00:00:20.699> your<00:00:20.789> stick<00:00:21.000> handling<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:22.260> really<00:00:22.769> feel

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
on your stick handling you really feel

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.040 
on your stick handling you really feel
it<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.279> your<00:00:23.400> stick<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.600> doesn't<00:00:24.930> bounce

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
it on your stick and it doesn't bounce

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.759 
it on your stick and it doesn't bounce
as<00:00:25.260> much<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.680> other<00:00:25.859> pups<00:00:27.349> now<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.410> will<00:00:28.650> be

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
as much as other pups now we will be

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.800 
as much as other pups now we will be
showing<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.250> some<00:00:29.599> demonstrations<00:00:30.599> with

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
showing you some demonstrations with

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.350 
showing you some demonstrations with
this<00:00:30.960> problem<00:00:31.910> our<00:00:32.910> first<00:00:33.120> demonstration

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
this problem our first demonstration

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.930 
this problem our first demonstration
will<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> friction<00:00:34.469> test<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.730> using

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
will be the friction test and I'm using

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.590 
will be the friction test and I'm using
a<00:00:36.180> broom<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.739> more<00:00:38.100> accurate<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.879> unlike

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
a broom so it's more accurate and unlike

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.819 
a broom so it's more accurate and unlike
a<00:00:39.629> stick<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.469> green<00:00:40.829> will<00:00:41.100> curve<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> tip

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.119 

and<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.520> conclusion<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.360> ribeiro<00:00:48.719> arrow

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
and in conclusion the ribeiro arrow

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.380 
and in conclusion the ribeiro arrow
slides<00:00:50.129> easier<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> sonic<00:00:51.750> pump<00:00:53.390> first

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
slides easier and the sonic pump first

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.819 
slides easier and the sonic pump first
second<00:00:54.690> demonstration<00:00:54.930> we'll<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.379> doing<00:00:55.649> some

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
second demonstration we'll be doing some

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.350 
second demonstration we'll be doing some
stick<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> early<00:00:56.340> I'll<00:00:56.820> start<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
stick and early I'll start out with the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
stick and early I'll start out with the
sonic<00:00:57.870> pictures<00:00:58.289> I<00:01:12.950> don't<00:01:13.950> think<00:01:14.159> there's

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
sonic pictures I don't think there's

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.740 
sonic pictures I don't think there's
really<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.820> difference<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.509> can

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
really a difference but you can

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.570 
really a difference but you can
definitely<00:01:15.900> feel<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> difference<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.400> verb

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
definitely feel a difference the verb

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.429 
definitely feel a difference the verb
arrow<00:01:17.790> arrow<00:01:18.090> slides<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.630> lot<00:01:18.750> easier<00:01:19.170> than<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
arrow arrow slides a lot easier than the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.730 
arrow arrow slides a lot easier than the
sonic<00:01:19.770> hook<00:01:19.950> does<00:01:21.290> our<00:01:22.290> next<00:01:22.560> demonstration

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
sonic hook does our next demonstration

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.980 
sonic hook does our next demonstration
will<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> bounce<00:01:23.790> test<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.600> which<00:01:24.780> one

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
will be the bounce test to see which one

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.670 
will be the bounce test to see which one
bounces<00:01:25.380> hi

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.800 

and<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.400> one<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.670> ribeiro<00:01:31.000> arrow<00:01:31.300> bounced<00:01:31.600> a

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
and that one the ribeiro arrow bounced a

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.610 
and that one the ribeiro arrow bounced a
little<00:01:31.840> higher<00:01:33.660> and<00:01:34.660> that<00:01:34.810> when<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.260> sonic

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
little higher and that when the sonic

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.780 
little higher and that when the sonic
mount<00:01:35.830> southern<00:01:36.220> hot

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
mount southern hot

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.840 
mount southern hot
so<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.510> conclusion<00:01:37.720> they<00:01:38.650> both<00:01:38.890> bounced<00:01:39.640> about

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
so in conclusion they both bounced about

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.110 
so in conclusion they both bounced about
this<00:01:40.030> day<00:01:41.910> yeah<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:44.350> hairy

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
this day yeah be hairy

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.640 
this day yeah be hairy
now<00:01:46.120> we'll<00:01:46.450> be<00:01:46.660> taking<00:01:46.810> some<00:01:47.140> shots<00:01:47.290> with<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
now we'll be taking some shots with the

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.650 
now we'll be taking some shots with the
ribeiro<00:01:48.010> puffs<00:01:48.340> first<00:01:48.970> I'll<00:01:49.150> start<00:01:49.240> off<00:01:49.510> with

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
ribeiro puffs first I'll start off with

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.960 
ribeiro puffs first I'll start off with
two<00:01:49.900> rear<00:01:50.140> shots<00:01:50.410> and<00:01:50.680> then<00:01:50.830> I'll<00:01:50.950> end<00:01:51.730> out

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
two rear shots and then I'll end out

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:21.930 
two rear shots and then I'll end out
with<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:20.230> now<00:02:20.410> I'll<00:02:20.620> take<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.070> slappers<00:02:21.640> and
