mean<00:03:16.620> he<00:03:16.770> could've<00:03:17.370> easily<00:03:17.520> just<00:03:18.060> brought<00:03:18.300> a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
mean he could've easily just brought a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.729 
mean he could've easily just brought a
heal<00:03:18.570> spell<00:03:18.600> with<00:03:18.989> him<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.200> kept<00:03:19.380> those<00:03:19.470> hogs

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
heal spell with him and kept those hogs

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.920 
heal spell with him and kept those hogs
up<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.550> uh<00:03:20.580> I'm<00:03:21.030> not<00:03:21.090> sure<00:03:21.420> what<00:03:21.540> he<00:03:21.600> was<00:03:21.720> doing

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
up but uh I'm not sure what he was doing

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.210 
up but uh I'm not sure what he was doing
but<00:03:22.110> we<00:03:22.260> were<00:03:22.350> able<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.590> take<00:03:22.770> out<00:03:22.920> his<00:03:23.010> hogs

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
but we were able to take out his hogs

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.920 
but we were able to take out his hogs
pretty<00:03:23.580> easily<00:03:23.820> with<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.330> wizard<00:03:24.600> R<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
pretty easily with the wizard R and the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.710 
pretty easily with the wizard R and the
Tesla's<00:03:25.320> right<00:03:25.500> over<00:03:25.680> there<00:03:25.850> his<00:03:26.850> Giants

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
Tesla's right over there his Giants

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.530 
Tesla's right over there his Giants
however<00:03:28.080> did<00:03:28.500> break<00:03:29.010> into<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.940> core<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
however did break into the core of the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.570 
however did break into the core of the
base<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.110> allow<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.709> Queen<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.130> get<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:32.400> there

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
base and allow the Queen to get in there

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.949 
base and allow the Queen to get in there
I<00:03:32.760> think<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.150> was<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.300> Queen<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.660> took<00:03:33.810> out

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
I think it was the Queen that took out

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.680 
I think it was the Queen that took out
the<00:03:34.140> dark<00:03:34.590> elixir<00:03:34.800> but<00:03:35.100> now<00:03:35.220> level<00:03:36.000> 15<00:03:36.390> Queen

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
the dark elixir but now level 15 Queen

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.750 
the dark elixir but now level 15 Queen
coming<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.320> hot<00:03:37.560> taking<00:03:38.160> out<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.310> townhall

coming in hot taking out the townhall

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.680 
coming in hot taking out the townhall
I'm<00:03:38.910> gonna<00:03:39.060> go<00:03:39.150> ahead<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.360> fast-forward

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
I'm gonna go ahead and fast-forward

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.780 
I'm gonna go ahead and fast-forward
through<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> little<00:03:40.380> bit<00:03:40.800> but<00:03:41.580> she's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
through that a little bit but she's

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.090 
through that a little bit but she's
about<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.180> go<00:03:42.269> down<00:03:42.450> 64%<00:03:43.140> right<00:03:43.500> there<00:03:43.680> he

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
about to go down 64% right there he

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.410 
about to go down 64% right there he
takes<00:03:44.250> forever<00:03:44.519> down<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:45.150> at<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.300> bottom

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
takes forever down here at the bottom

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.270 
takes forever down here at the bottom
just<00:03:45.600> taking<00:03:46.050> out<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.350> free<00:03:46.650> elixir<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.220> I

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
just taking out this free elixir that I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.530 
just taking out this free elixir that I
have<00:03:47.459> set<00:03:47.730> out<00:03:47.850> there<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.060> don't<00:03:48.150> know<00:03:48.330> why<00:03:48.510> I

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
have set out there I don't know why I

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
have set out there I don't know why I
have<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:48.959> out<00:03:49.080> there<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.290> should<00:03:49.470> probably

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
have that out there I should probably

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.290 
have that out there I should probably
bring<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:49.980> in<00:03:50.130> because<00:03:50.160> right<00:03:50.940> now<00:03:51.060> that's

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
bring that in because right now that's

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.460 
bring that in because right now that's
just<00:03:51.390> free

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
just free

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.210 
just free
that's<00:03:53.400> just<00:03:53.610> free<00:03:53.810> free<00:03:54.860> percentages<00:03:55.860> for
