around lots and lots of paddling if when
you<00:00:31.710> are<00:00:32.009> paddling<00:00:32.550> back<00:00:33.030> out<00:00:33.270> obviously<00:00:34.079> it's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
you are paddling back out obviously it's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.740 
you are paddling back out obviously it's
you<00:00:34.559> know<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:35.430> heart<00:00:35.670> rates<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.030> breathing

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you know your heart rates up breathing

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.540 
breathing too fast and breathing
improperly<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.290> gonna<00:00:43.440> further<00:00:43.890> stress<00:00:44.340> out

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
improperly it's gonna further stress out

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.000 
improperly it's gonna further stress out
all<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.149> muscles<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> neck<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
all these muscles in the neck all the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.260 
all these muscles in the neck all the
muscles<00:00:47.430> around<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> shoulder<00:00:47.850> girdle

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
muscles around the shoulder girdle

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.389 
muscles around the shoulder girdle
because<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:49.079> using<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.620> these<00:00:49.739> accessory

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
because you're using all these accessory

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.760 
because you're using all these accessory
muscles<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.420> aren't<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:52.110> supposed<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
muscles that aren't really supposed to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709 
muscles that aren't really supposed to
be<00:00:52.920> used<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.460> proper<00:00:53.820> breathing<00:00:54.059> mechanics

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
be used for proper breathing mechanics

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.439 
be used for proper breathing mechanics
so<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.860> need<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.160> focus<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.699> slowing<00:00:57.270> down

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
so one you need to focus on slowing down

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.990 
so one you need to focus on slowing down
your<00:00:57.719> breathing<00:00:57.899> breathing<00:00:58.469> calmly<00:00:58.890> big<00:00:59.699> full

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
your breathing breathing calmly big full

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.510 
your breathing breathing calmly big full
inspiration<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.899> exhalations<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.250> also

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
inspiration and exhalations but you also

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.789 
inspiration and exhalations but you also
need<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.059> doing<00:01:03.420> diaphragmatic<00:01:04.229> breathing

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
need to be doing diaphragmatic breathing

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.190 
need to be doing diaphragmatic breathing
so<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.489> were<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> lay<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.030> back<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
so if you were to lay on your back you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.320 
so if you were to lay on your back you
need<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.920> hand<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.460> belly<00:01:08.610> hand

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
stomach should be the first thing to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the people I work with do not breathe

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.749 
the people I work with do not breathe
properly<00:01:18.799> tons<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.950> reasons<00:01:20.100> why<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.430> may

properly tons of reasons why that may

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.490 
properly tons of reasons why that may
have<00:01:20.880> happened<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.900> condition<00:01:22.380> your

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
body to re-establish proper breathing

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.100 
body to re-establish proper breathing
mechanics<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.100> again<00:01:26.460> lay<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.090> back<00:01:27.330> hand
