00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.199
 alternate one by one he himself 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.630

 for this you need to gain sand in the hand and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.250
 sprinkle it evenly in a thin layer 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.710

 gum is not necessary and bruda stack of paper 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.530
 because if the child even committed 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.930
 mistake a flick of the wrist he can 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.440
 It was decided to fix the error start 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.680
 again 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.580
