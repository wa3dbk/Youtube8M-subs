00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:07.899 
so today we have a Nissan Navara d40

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.340 
so today we have a Nissan Navara d40
pickup<00:00:08.290> in<00:00:08.500> the<00:00:08.650> workshop<00:00:09.190> and<00:00:10.049> the<00:00:11.049> issue

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
pickup in the workshop and the issue

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.580 
pickup in the workshop and the issue
we've<00:00:11.709> got<00:00:11.980> with<00:00:12.160> this<00:00:12.369> one<00:00:12.670> is<00:00:13.000> the<00:00:13.660> ABS<00:00:14.260> light

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
we've got with this one is the ABS light

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.210 
we've got with this one is the ABS light
so<00:00:15.400> if<00:00:15.609> you<00:00:15.820> can<00:00:16.090> see<00:00:16.480> here<00:00:16.960> just<00:00:17.890> turn<00:00:18.130> the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
so if you can see here just turn the

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.150 
so if you can see here just turn the
radio<00:00:18.580> off<00:00:18.779> I've<00:00:19.779> got<00:00:19.810> this<00:00:20.259> little<00:00:20.529> abs

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
radio off I've got this little abs

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.419 
radio off I've got this little abs
warning<00:00:21.939> light<00:00:22.259> here<00:00:23.259> so<00:00:23.980> we<00:00:24.130> put<00:00:24.310> the

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:24.429 
warning light here so we put the

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.730 
warning light here so we put the
ignition<00:00:24.910> on<00:00:25.060> let's<00:00:25.779> check<00:00:25.960> it<00:00:26.019> a<00:00:26.230> neutral

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
ignition on let's check it a neutral

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.620 
ignition on let's check it a neutral
start<00:00:27.039> it<00:00:27.189> up<00:00:27.339> and<00:00:27.880> obviously<00:00:28.060> that<00:00:28.269> light

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
start it up and obviously that light

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.630 
start it up and obviously that light
should<00:00:29.079> go<00:00:29.380> out<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:35.110> on<00:00:35.290> our<00:00:35.500> one<00:00:35.800> it's<00:00:36.310> not

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
should go out but on our one it's not

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.420 
should go out but on our one it's not
going<00:00:36.940> out<00:00:37.090> um<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.620> what<00:00:38.800> we're<00:00:38.920> gonna<00:00:39.010> do<00:00:39.190> is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
going out um so what we're gonna do is

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.340 
going out um so what we're gonna do is
show<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:39.700> how<00:00:39.910> to<00:00:39.970> do<00:00:40.210> some<00:00:40.480> basic<00:00:40.510> fault

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
show you how to do some basic fault

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.750 
show you how to do some basic fault
finding<00:00:41.920> um<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:43.540> fix<00:00:43.810> the<00:00:44.410> problem<00:00:44.800> so<00:00:45.580> the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
finding um to fix the problem so the

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.370 
finding um to fix the problem so the
first<00:00:46.000> thing<00:00:46.240> you<00:00:46.330> need<00:00:46.450> to<00:00:46.510> do<00:00:46.750> is<00:00:46.990> check<00:00:47.350> the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
first thing you need to do is check the

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.200 
first thing you need to do is check the
resistance<00:00:48.190> on<00:00:48.640> your<00:00:49.170> ABS<00:00:50.550> sensors<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:52.060> we're

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
resistance on your ABS sensors so we're

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.760 
resistance on your ABS sensors so we're
going<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.360> take<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.570> front<00:00:52.870> wheel<00:00:53.050> off<00:00:53.290> now<00:00:53.530> and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
going to take a front wheel off now and

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.200 
going to take a front wheel off now and
show<00:00:53.980> you<00:00:54.010> how<00:00:54.220> to<00:00:54.310> do<00:00:54.520> that<00:00:54.700> on<00:00:54.940> one<00:00:55.270> wheel<00:00:57.210> so

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
show you how to do that on one wheel so

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.340 
show you how to do that on one wheel so
we're<00:00:58.360> going<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.510> start<00:00:58.810> with<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.110> front

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
we're going to start with the front

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.560 
we're going to start with the front
wheel<00:00:59.560> now<00:01:00.100> you<00:01:00.160> can<00:01:00.490> get<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:00.820> for<00:01:01.060> tread<00:01:01.360> at<00:01:01.510> a

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
wheel now you can get it for tread at a

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.590 
wheel now you can get it for tread at a
garage<00:01:02.100> obviously<00:01:03.100> or<00:01:03.550> Nissan<00:01:03.880> and<00:01:04.059> they<00:01:04.150> just

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
garage obviously or Nissan and they just

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.840 
garage obviously or Nissan and they just
the<00:01:04.750> fault<00:01:04.989> code<00:01:05.229> should<00:01:05.619> tell<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.250> which<00:01:06.490> one

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
the fault code should tell you which one

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.239 
the fault code should tell you which one
it<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.509> but<00:01:08.320> if<00:01:08.469> you<00:01:08.590> don't<00:01:08.770> want<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:08.979> go<00:01:09.039> to<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.249 
it is but if you don't want to go to the

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:10.830 
it is but if you don't want to go to the
expense<00:01:09.549> of<00:01:10.090> going<00:01:10.329> to<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.509> garage<00:01:10.780> and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
expense of going to the garage and

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.319 
expense of going to the garage and
having<00:01:11.079> it<00:01:11.170> fault<00:01:11.409> read<00:01:11.649> you<00:01:11.829> can<00:01:12.159> measure<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
having it fault read you can measure the

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.289 
having it fault read you can measure the
resistance<00:01:13.929> of<00:01:14.200> each<00:01:14.799> brake<00:01:15.130> sensor<00:01:15.399> so<00:01:16.119> we're

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
resistance of each brake sensor so we're

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.999 
resistance of each brake sensor so we're
going<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.450> take<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:16.719> wheel<00:01:16.929> off<00:01:17.109> and<00:01:17.409> then

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
going to take this wheel off and then

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.130 
going to take this wheel off and then
come<00:01:18.249> back<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.729> show<00:01:19.119> you<00:01:19.149> how<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.689> do<00:01:19.990> that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
come back and show you how to do that

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.020 
come back and show you how to do that
with<00:01:20.319> a<00:01:20.350> simple<00:01:20.619> multimeter<00:01:21.280> okay<00:01:21.640> so<00:01:21.939> to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
with a simple multimeter okay so to

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.429 
with a simple multimeter okay so to
identify<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:24.179> width<00:01:25.179> which<00:01:25.960> of<00:01:26.140> your<00:01:26.259> wheel

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
identify the width which of your wheel

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.929 
identify the width which of your wheel
sensors<00:01:26.950> is<00:01:27.069> faulty<00:01:27.490> if<00:01:27.549> you<00:01:27.640> haven't<00:01:27.850> got

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
sensors is faulty if you haven't got

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.569 
sensors is faulty if you haven't got
access<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.600> Diagnostics<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.890> need<00:01:30.069> to<00:01:30.219> find

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
access to Diagnostics you need to find

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.660 
access to Diagnostics you need to find
the<00:01:31.469> connector<00:01:32.469> so<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.770> can<00:01:32.979> see<00:01:33.159> here<00:01:33.429> on<00:01:33.549> the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.539 
the connector so you can see here on the
front<00:01:33.819> wheel<00:01:34.630> you've<00:01:35.200> got<00:01:35.229> your<00:01:35.469> ABS<00:01:35.950> sensor

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
front wheel you've got your ABS sensor

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.029 
front wheel you've got your ABS sensor
will<00:01:36.579> will<00:01:36.909> go<00:01:37.090> into<00:01:37.450> your<00:01:37.569> hub<00:01:37.810> okay<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:38.979> you

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
will will go into your hub okay and you

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.730 
will will go into your hub okay and you
can<00:01:39.189> follow<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.759> electrical<00:01:40.749> wire<00:01:40.960> up<00:01:41.259> and

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
can follow the electrical wire up and

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.370 
can follow the electrical wire up and
find<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.969> connector<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.840> then<00:01:44.200> it's<00:01:44.319> a

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
find the the connector and then it's a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.010 
find the the connector and then it's a
question<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.829> unplugging<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.759> connector<00:01:46.359> now

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
question of unplugging the connector now

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.770 
question of unplugging the connector now
they<00:01:47.770> are<00:01:47.979> on<00:01:48.219> a<00:01:48.249> little<00:01:48.609> slide<00:01:49.149> that<00:01:49.389> you<00:01:49.509> can

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
they are on a little slide that you can

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.480 
they are on a little slide that you can
slide<00:01:50.649> them<00:01:50.859> up<00:01:52.619> okay<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.189> should<00:01:57.219> better

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
slide them up okay so you should better

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.550 
slide them up okay so you should better
release<00:01:57.789> them<00:01:58.030> from<00:01:58.329> from<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.020> docking<00:01:59.439> and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
release them from from the docking and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.289 
release them from from the docking and
then<00:01:59.679> get<00:01:59.799> them<00:01:59.950> loose<00:02:00.189> okay<00:02:00.939> then<00:02:01.090> you've<00:02:01.209> got

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
then get them loose okay then you've got

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.179 
then get them loose okay then you've got
to<00:02:01.389> press<00:02:01.569> that<00:02:01.719> top<00:02:02.020> bit<00:02:02.229> I'll<00:02:02.499> try<00:02:02.829> and<00:02:03.039> do<00:02:03.130> it

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
to press that top bit I'll try and do it

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.270 
to press that top bit I'll try and do it
one-handed<00:02:03.549> but<00:02:03.939> I<00:02:03.999> might<00:02:04.179> struggle<00:02:04.649> tighten

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.230 

that<00:02:09.280> okay

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
that okay

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.290 
that okay
okay<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:11.470> inside<00:02:11.980> you'll<00:02:12.490> see<00:02:12.580> you've<00:02:12.850> got<00:02:13.030> two

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
okay so inside you'll see you've got two

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.330 
okay so inside you'll see you've got two
pins<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:14.560> you're<00:02:14.680> obviously<00:02:14.740> doing<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.280> on

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
pins so so you're obviously doing it on

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.730 
pins so so you're obviously doing it on
the<00:02:15.460> census<00:02:16.060> ID<00:02:16.270> not<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.810> car<00:02:17.050> side<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.620> the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
the census ID not the car side of the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.530 
the census ID not the car side of the
Loom<00:02:17.920> okay<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.730> you'll<00:02:18.820> have<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.090> two<00:02:19.270> pins

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
Loom okay and you'll have the two pins

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.450 
Loom okay and you'll have the two pins
in<00:02:19.780> there<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.890> need<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.160> put<00:02:21.430> a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
in there and you need to put a

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.010 
in there and you need to put a
multimeter<00:02:22.030> on<00:02:22.150> those<00:02:22.330> if<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:22.540> go<00:02:22.690> over<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
multimeter on those if we go over to the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.990 
multimeter on those if we go over to the
bench<00:02:23.230> now<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:24.250> probably<00:02:24.490> easier<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.000> see<00:02:27.000> so

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
bench now it's probably easier to see so

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.740 
bench now it's probably easier to see so
here's<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.800> good<00:02:29.800> front<00:02:30.250> parking<00:02:30.760> sensor<00:02:31.390> so

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
here's a good front parking sensor so

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.350 
here's a good front parking sensor so
you've<00:02:32.260> got<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> two<00:02:32.530> pins<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:34.060> we've<00:02:34.180> got<00:02:34.330> a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
you've got the two pins and we've got a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.450 
you've got the two pins and we've got a
multimeter<00:02:34.930> here<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.830> we've<00:02:35.980> set<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.310> on

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
multimeter here and we've set it on

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.180 
multimeter here and we've set it on
resistance<00:02:37.120> okay<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.530> we've<00:02:38.620> got<00:02:38.770> on<00:02:38.890> to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
resistance okay and we've got on to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.110 
resistance okay and we've got on to
killer<00:02:39.520> ohms<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:40.900> we<00:02:41.140> can<00:02:42.630> probe<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:45.120> two

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
killer ohms and if we can probe the two

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.650 
killer ohms and if we can probe the two
wires<00:02:46.540> get<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.140> two<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.760> that's<00:02:48.970> one<00:02:51.450> okay<00:02:52.450> and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
wires get the two so that's one okay and

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.410 
wires get the two so that's one okay and
then<00:02:52.750> if<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.930> look<00:02:53.170> at<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.730> that's<00:02:54.730> showing<00:02:55.300> a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
then if you look at the that's showing a

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.260 
then if you look at the that's showing a
resistance<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:57.250> we're<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.490> K<00:02:57.820> ohm<00:02:58.030> so

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
resistance of so we're on K ohm so

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.650 
resistance of so we're on K ohm so
that's<00:02:58.420> about<00:02:59.040> 680<00:03:00.040> MA<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:01.210> we<00:03:01.360> meet<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.630> a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
that's about 680 MA what we meet is a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.190 
that's about 680 MA what we meet is a
bit<00:03:01.840> flaky<00:03:02.080> but<00:03:02.830> 680<00:03:03.820> ohms<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.600> about<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.900> good

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
bit flaky but 680 ohms is about a good

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.350 
bit flaky but 680 ohms is about a good
reading<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.190> would<00:03:06.280> expect<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.820> get<00:03:07.060> there

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
reading you would expect to get there

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.420 
reading you would expect to get there
okay<00:03:08.110> now<00:03:08.350> we<00:03:08.950> happen<00:03:09.460> to<00:03:09.490> have<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.850> forty<00:03:10.210> one

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
okay now we happen to have a forty one

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.190 
okay now we happen to have a forty one
okay<00:03:14.670> okay<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:15.730> this<00:03:16.060> forty<00:03:16.480> one<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.840> can<00:03:16.990> see

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
okay okay so this forty one you can see

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.630 
okay okay so this forty one you can see
the<00:03:17.320> resistance<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:17.950> much<00:03:18.130> higher<00:03:18.400> we've

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
the resistance is much higher we've

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.060 
the resistance is much higher we've
changed<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.060> scale<00:03:19.300> up<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.540> two<00:03:20.200> mega<00:03:20.440> ohms<00:03:20.710> to

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
changed the scale up to two mega ohms to

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.650 
changed the scale up to two mega ohms to
mega<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:22.000> coming<00:03:22.330> in<00:03:22.480> at<00:03:23.220> around<00:03:24.220> four

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
mega and it's coming in at around four

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.940 
mega and it's coming in at around four
point<00:03:25.660> four<00:03:25.960> eight<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.410> it's<00:03:26.530> about<00:03:26.650> four

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
point four eight so it's about four

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.550 
point four eight so it's about four
hundred<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.340> eighty<00:03:27.490> coloring<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:28.810> if<00:03:28.930> you

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
hundred and eighty coloring so if you

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.350 
hundred and eighty coloring so if you
really<00:03:29.830> should<00:03:30.190> be<00:03:30.340> looking<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.730> have<00:03:31.180> the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
really should be looking to have the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.020 
really should be looking to have the
resistance<00:03:31.690> in<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.430> range<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.670> what<00:03:33.820> range

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
resistance in the range of what range

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.630 
resistance in the range of what range
would<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.270> say<00:03:34.420> Tom<00:03:34.660> 500<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.680> 1500<00:03:36.430> yen

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
would you say Tom 500 to 1500 yen

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.460 
would you say Tom 500 to 1500 yen
between<00:03:37.030> 500<00:03:37.930> ohms<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:39.480> 1500<00:03:40.480> ohms<00:03:40.660> if<00:03:40.960> you're

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
between 500 ohms and 1500 ohms if you're

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.970 
between 500 ohms and 1500 ohms if you're
outside<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.160> range<00:03:43.560> your<00:03:44.560> stance<00:03:44.800> is

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
outside of that range your stance is

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.410 
outside of that range your stance is
faulty<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.400> that's<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.790> one<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.120> need<00:03:46.240> to

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
faulty and that's the one you need to

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.270 
faulty and that's the one you need to
change<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.350> we'll<00:03:47.530> show<00:03:47.710> you<00:03:47.740> now<00:03:48.010> how<00:03:48.040> to

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
change so we'll show you now how to

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.030 
change so we'll show you now how to
change<00:03:48.790> one
