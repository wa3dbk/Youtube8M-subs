00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.649
 Together in this video I want you 

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:10.440
 we show the companies more of the small ones 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:12.330
 action cam group alternative sj 4000 die 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
 firmware can update and as 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 First we have to do this on the laptop 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 or mac whatever you have and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.020
 uses the current form underneath 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.720
 I have already done that again 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.510
 The link to this I pack okay infobox 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 things the relatively small only 1.6 mb 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.899
 Great after that we go there we have one 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.710
 zip file we have to wrap up and 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.780
 After that the companies get in one 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.859
 image file 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.550
 and when it's finally small where I get the 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.399
 cardreader just the little one 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:56.359
 micro sd card on pc or mac 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.800
 and wrote this file directly into 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.390
 main directory of the plate it with me 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.210
 already on it I say replace now times 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.739
 and otherwise allowed on this micro sd 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.320
 not to be on the map that's all 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.930
 importantly it formats again with 32 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.200
 format or a dirty one for 1000 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.940
 action cam format exactly and how that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.940
 whole now a camera expires that they 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.670
 so now i have the action here 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.010
 cam and the preparatory micro sd card 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.990
 with the firmware that closes now 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.140
 or just put it in 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.510
 and then simply with the power button 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.590
 turn on the front here and then 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.690
 takes a bit 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.680
 here you see it is blinking already here 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.970
 above it also blinks in parallel and 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.550
 that means beware I have something 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.860
 Found almost on the memory card and 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.140
 the installation here now 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.850
 this flickering light led here 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.930
 and the led up here and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.960
 accordingly, the firmware is just 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.550
 installed and listened to the noise 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.830
 that is already done so it is 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.220
 really a very fast thing and 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.239
 we can see it has jake m the 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.530
 manufacturer of the sj 4000 or cobox 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.599
 clearly what changed in the display as 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.260
 we will see an attitude here 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.959
 the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.299
 rest recording time at the memory card 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.090
 then we see what resolution 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.870
 set disregarded current 1080p 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.610
 with 30 pictures per second 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.709
 The three minutes tell me at the moment 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.629
 I think that's the video duration 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.260
 only create three minutes of videos 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.299
 with clay and di resta cow loading time and 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.000
 Of course date and time of the parallel 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.079
 is running and important it is still likely 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.930
 definitely not forgotten 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:46.530
 we have to go into the menu now 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.870
 that also looks different and 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.299
 need the memory card again 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:03:00.599
 reformat a format and okay 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:03:02.849
 say so that the existing companies of 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.950
 File thief file on the disc 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.340
 everything is deleted right now 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.340
 will be deleted 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.659
 of course we say okay and confirm 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.430
 that exactly 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.569
 So that's very important in any case 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.569
 that has to be done 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.620
 yes and that was it, we can see her 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.389
 also have a new logo at the high and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.819
 shut down or on and off 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.410
 now that it jack kemp are exactly 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.780
 So that's how easy the firmware update 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.780
 for the sj 4000 have fun with it
