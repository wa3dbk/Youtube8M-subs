preventative<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:57.270> getting<00:01:57.870> wet<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
preventative I'm going getting wet and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.460 
preventative I'm going getting wet and
in<00:01:58.860> dysfunctioning<00:02:00.020> so<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.230> great

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
in dysfunctioning so that's a great

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.170 
in dysfunctioning so that's a great
asset<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:02.040> great<00:02:02.220> advantage<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:02.940> get

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
asset and great advantage that they get

asset and great advantage that they get
with<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.980> use<00:02:05.400> this<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.940> open<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
with it so to use this you just open it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.200 
with it so to use this you just open it
up<00:02:06.450> right<00:02:06.690> here<00:02:07.220> simply<00:02:08.220> open<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.030> put

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
up right here simply open it up you put

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.270 
up right here simply open it up you put
it<00:02:09.300> inside<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.990> it<00:02:10.170> still<00:02:10.470> perfectly<00:02:11.010> worked

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
it inside and it still perfectly worked

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.750 
it inside and it still perfectly worked
fine<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.660> camera<00:02:12.990> itself<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:14.100> 12

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
fine so the camera itself is a 12

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.210 
fine so the camera itself is a 12
megapixel<00:02:14.820> camera<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.830> taking

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
megapixel camera this is just for taking

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.790 
megapixel camera this is just for taking
images<00:02:17.430> which<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.000> absolutely<00:02:18.480> fantastic

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
images which is absolutely fantastic

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.380 
images which is absolutely fantastic
from<00:02:19.800> some<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.190> pictures<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.520> I'll<00:02:20.760> put

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
from some of the pictures that I'll put

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.540 
from some of the pictures that I'll put
up<00:02:21.540> later<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.500> see<00:02:22.680> how<00:02:22.920> good<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.220> quick

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
up later on you can see how good a quick

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.420 
up later on you can see how good a quick
series<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.480> photos<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.110> then<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.280> video

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
series of the photos and then the video

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.800 
series of the photos and then the video
recording<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.240> actually<00:02:28.610> 1080p<00:02:29.610> 720p<00:02:30.120> or

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
recording is actually 1080p 720p or

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.560 
recording is actually 1080p 720p or

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
device and then if I put it down right

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.960 
device and then if I put it down right
here<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:19.019> can<00:03:19.170> see<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.470> we<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.900> LCD

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
here we can see that we have the LCD

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.000 
here we can see that we have the LCD
screen<00:03:23.970> which<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:25.110> better<00:03:25.500> way<00:03:25.680> for<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:25.920> to

screen which is a better way for you to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.100 
screen which is a better way for you to
navigate<00:03:26.250> for<00:03:26.880> your<00:03:27.000> device<00:03:27.330> if<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.720> compare<00:03:28.080> it

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
navigate for your device if I compare it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.220 
navigate for your device if I compare it
to<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:29.030> GoPro<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.510> doesn't<00:03:30.930> have<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.080> screen

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
to the GoPro it doesn't have a screen

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.870 
to the GoPro it doesn't have a screen
you<00:03:31.410> have<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.709> buy<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.920> separately<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:32.820> a

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
you have to buy it separately so it's a

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.090 
you have to buy it separately so it's a
huge<00:03:33.120> advantage<00:03:33.230> saves<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.380> bit<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.560> cost<00:03:34.890> a

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
huge advantage saves you a bit of cost a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.039 
huge advantage saves you a bit of cost a
bit<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.400> money<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:36.540> might<00:03:36.660> not<00:03:36.810> be<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
bit of money and it might not be the

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.790 
bit of money and it might not be the
best<00:03:37.230> screen<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.100> still

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
best screen but it is still

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.670
