00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
really do this obviously because I said

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.080 
really do this obviously because I said
I<00:06:17.510> highly<00:06:17.720> my<00:06:17.900> hair<00:06:18.080> but<00:06:18.680> it's<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:19.100> try<00:06:19.670> not<00:06:19.850> to

I highly my hair but it's to try not to

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.490 
I highly my hair but it's to try not to
split<00:06:20.240> your<00:06:20.360> hair<00:06:20.570> colors<00:06:20.810> too<00:06:21.020> often<00:06:21.350> or

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
split your hair colors too often or

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.580 
split your hair colors too often or
bleach<00:06:21.710> your<00:06:21.890> hair<00:06:22.900> so<00:06:23.900> I'm<00:06:24.230> kind<00:06:24.470> of

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
bleach your hair so I'm kind of

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.230 
bleach your hair so I'm kind of
contradicting<00:06:25.220> myself<00:06:25.370> because<00:06:25.760> my<00:06:25.880> hair<00:06:26.090> was

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
contradicting myself because my hair was

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.810 
contradicting myself because my hair was
brown<00:06:26.450> I<00:06:27.250> don't<00:06:28.250> know<00:06:28.310> but<00:06:28.520> what<00:06:28.670> I'm<00:06:28.790> really

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
brown I don't know but what I'm really

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.240 
brown I don't know but what I'm really
trying<00:06:29.270> to<00:06:29.420> say<00:06:29.660> is<00:06:29.960> people<00:06:30.470> that<00:06:30.710> will<00:06:31.070> buy

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
trying to say is people that will buy

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.770 
trying to say is people that will buy
like<00:06:31.520> the<00:06:31.640> box<00:06:31.880> dyes<00:06:32.120> it's<00:06:32.420> just<00:06:32.570> something

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
like the box dyes it's just something

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.540 
like the box dyes it's just something
wrong<00:06:32.900> with<00:06:33.080> that<00:06:33.170> but<00:06:33.380> if<00:06:33.500> they<00:06:33.800> will<00:06:34.010> have

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
wrong with that but if they will have

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.220 
wrong with that but if they will have
like<00:06:34.700> dark<00:06:35.000> dark<00:06:35.330> hair<00:06:35.570> and<00:06:35.840> then<00:06:36.050> they'll

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
like dark dark hair and then they'll

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.260 
like dark dark hair and then they'll
bleach<00:06:36.770> it<00:06:36.920> completely<00:06:37.400> and<00:06:37.580> then<00:06:38.060> they<00:06:38.120> won't

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
bleach it completely and then they won't

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.820 
bleach it completely and then they won't
like<00:06:38.420> it<00:06:38.450> so<00:06:38.780> I<00:06:38.810> like<00:06:39.050> bleach<00:06:39.290> it<00:06:39.440> more<00:06:39.680> than

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
like it so I like bleach it more than

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.110 
like it so I like bleach it more than
the<00:06:39.920> little<00:06:40.040> dip<00:06:40.220> dye<00:06:40.370> and<00:06:40.670> then<00:06:40.760> logo<00:06:40.970> back

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
the little dip dye and then logo back

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.150 
the little dip dye and then logo back
dark<00:06:41.390> and<00:06:41.630> like<00:06:41.810> switch<00:06:41.990> all<00:06:42.200> the<00:06:42.320> time<00:06:42.530> and

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
dark and like switch all the time and

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.800 
dark and like switch all the time and
that's<00:06:43.940> like<00:06:44.090> not<00:06:44.240> good<00:06:44.420> for<00:06:44.510> your<00:06:44.630> hair

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
that's like not good for your hair

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.700 
that's like not good for your hair
especially<00:06:44.900> if<00:06:45.290> your<00:06:45.410> hair's<00:06:45.560> already

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
especially if your hair's already

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.130 
especially if your hair's already
damaged<00:06:46.100> like<00:06:46.310> my<00:06:46.400> hair<00:06:46.580> is<00:06:46.790> pretty<00:06:46.940> not<00:06:47.600> not

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
damaged like my hair is pretty not not

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.290 
damaged like my hair is pretty not not
really<00:06:48.260> damaged<00:06:48.710> so<00:06:48.980> it's<00:06:49.610> okay<00:06:49.910> for<00:06:49.940> me<00:06:50.180> to

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
really damaged so it's okay for me to

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.360 
really damaged so it's okay for me to
get<00:06:50.420> the<00:06:50.480> highlights<00:06:50.780> I<00:06:50.900> think<00:06:50.930> but<00:06:51.440> some

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
get the highlights I think but some

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.440 
get the highlights I think but some
people<00:06:52.670> will<00:06:52.790> do<00:06:52.910> it<00:06:53.030> and<00:06:53.210> they're<00:06:53.330> just

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
people will do it and they're just

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.970 
people will do it and they're just
damaging<00:06:53.840> their<00:06:53.930> hair<00:06:54.080> even<00:06:54.290> more<00:06:54.320> and<00:06:54.770> more

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:54.980 
damaging their hair even more and more

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.520 
damaging their hair even more and more
so<00:06:55.550> just<00:06:55.790> kind<00:06:55.970> of<00:06:56.030> limit<00:06:56.450> the<00:06:57.050> times<00:06:57.260> you<00:06:57.410> dye

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
so just kind of limit the times you dye

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.820 
so just kind of limit the times you dye
your<00:06:57.560> hair<00:06:57.890> um<00:06:59.230> you<00:07:00.230> don't<00:07:00.380> really<00:07:00.530> need<00:07:00.770> it

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
your hair um you don't really need it

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.810
