miles<00:02:17.689> because<00:02:18.019> if<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.379> were<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.680> run<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.129> race

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
miles because if I were to run a race

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.729 
miles because if I were to run a race
it'd<00:02:19.610> be<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.760> 5k<00:02:20.269> so<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.840> want<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.230> try<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.409> keep<00:02:21.590> my

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
it'd be a 5k so I want to try to keep my

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.130 
it'd be a 5k so I want to try to keep my
stamina<00:02:22.010> up<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:22.939> I<00:02:22.970> go<00:02:23.150> ahead<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.569> run<00:02:23.840> and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
stamina up so I go ahead and run and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.990 
stamina up so I go ahead and run and
