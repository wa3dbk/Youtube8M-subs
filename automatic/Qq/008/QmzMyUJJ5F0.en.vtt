00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.379
 hello youtube friends today I will teach you 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.349
 how to 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:14.750
 do a trick for the samsung gtb 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.650
 34 of them let's start 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.650
 we are going to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.630
 to keyboard 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:29.890
 and insert the following figures 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.420
 asterisk numeral 0 asterisk 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.830
 numbered 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.830
 this will not come out 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.980
 and perform green or good brain 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.950
 perfect 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.610
 there is one that for example is touch text 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.610
 you press it and you can write 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.950
 with this insurance in the middle 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.710
 what happens we can not go back with 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.030
 this is 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.030
 it does not let you have to leave and go back to 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 insert 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.440
 there is another vibra of duration 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.430
 that for example having a style where 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.430
 where is where is 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.340
 here is 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.869
 vibration this 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.869
 that starts to vibrate a lot 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460
 ah 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.220
 s 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.450
 as I said 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:43.719
 this cell is already quite old not 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.130
 but it is a very good resistant cell 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.190
 I have it done quite a lot this is the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.800
 mold 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.800
 I have changed it but I do not have it again 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.229
 cast 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.320
 there are other things too that has 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.350
 for example lcd network that I want to go back to 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.970
 the screen in red green blue 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.970
 melody is a song 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.290
 actually he told me to try 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.610
 the speaker broke my 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.610
 speaker and that does not work 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.970
 good we have vibration dimming 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.800
 we have careers 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.500
 I never have all the graphics 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.260
 of your feet 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.310
 you can not take pictures 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.310
 more than that 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.600
 good 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.590
 i 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.629
 and now that 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.140
 see you later in the next 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.140
 tutorial
