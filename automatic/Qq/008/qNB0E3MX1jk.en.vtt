00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.550 

split<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.770> hummingbird<00:01:43.580> into<00:01:43.940> two<00:01:44.090> parts<00:01:44.560> the

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
split the hummingbird into two parts the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.110 
split the hummingbird into two parts the
first<00:01:45.590> part<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.250> down<00:01:48.490> that's<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.670> first<00:01:49.910> part

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
first part is down that's the first part

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.600 
first part is down that's the first part
the<00:01:50.840> second<00:01:51.200> part<00:01:51.230> is<00:01:51.530> down<00:01:54.460> that's<00:01:55.460> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
the second part is down that's the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.460 
the second part is down that's the
second<00:01:56.000> part<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.390> strong<00:01:56.600> weapon<00:01:56.930> now

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
second part of the strong weapon now

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.380 
second part of the strong weapon now
after<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.920> first<00:01:58.220> part<00:01:58.460> take<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.910> pinkie<00:01:59.180> off

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
after the first part take the pinkie off

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.390 
after the first part take the pinkie off
and<00:01:59.720> see<00:01:59.960> how<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.200> sounds<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:00.650> this<00:02:01.130> is<00:02:01.250> how

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
and see how it sounds like this is how

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.770 
and see how it sounds like this is how
it<00:02:01.430> sounds<00:02:01.760> like

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.160 

so<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.880> wonderful<00:02:09.330> strumming<00:02:09.660> pattern<00:02:09.990> is

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
so the wonderful strumming pattern is

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.200 
so the wonderful strumming pattern is
that<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:13.440> how<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.800> sounds<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.280> if<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.030> take<00:02:15.150> a

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
that is how it sounds like if you take a

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.820 
that is how it sounds like if you take a
pinky<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.690> will<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> suspended<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.650> major

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
pinky of it will be a suspended a major

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.950 
pinky of it will be a suspended a major
chord<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.300> what<00:02:18.450> happens<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
chord and that is what happens in the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.490 
chord and that is what happens in the
song<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.650> clearly<00:02:19.950> hear<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.250> difference

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
song you can clearly hear the difference

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.710 
song you can clearly hear the difference
it's<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.860> song<00:02:23.070> starts<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.720> it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
progresses from with two full strumming

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.110 
progresses from with two full strumming
patterns<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.860> major<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.640> like<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> shown

then<00:02:45.240> it<00:02:45.510> goes<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.750> two<00:02:46.290> batters<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.220> D<00:02:47.459> major

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
then it goes to two batters on D major

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.870 
then it goes to two batters on D major
not<00:02:48.300> fast<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.290> present<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.280> song<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.700> goes

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
not fast if you present a song it goes

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.980 
not fast if you present a song it goes
like<00:02:51.120> this

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:09.630 

Oh

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.789 

the<00:03:21.439> next<00:03:21.709> part<00:03:21.950> hits<00:03:22.629> b-minor<00:03:23.629> ohm<00:03:24.500> shanthi

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
the next part hits b-minor ohm shanthi

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.880 
the next part hits b-minor ohm shanthi
park<00:03:25.219> the<00:03:25.459> key<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.909> it<00:03:26.810> hits<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.290> beam<00:03:27.500> mansion

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
park the key is it hits the beam mansion

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.330 
park the key is it hits the beam mansion
only<00:03:28.280> on<00:03:28.430> Shanthi<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.090> ohm<00:03:29.769> is<00:03:30.769> after<00:03:31.219> you

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
only on Shanthi so ohm is after you

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.300 
only on Shanthi so ohm is after you
leave<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:31.730> room

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.709 

just<00:03:37.310> like<00:03:37.519> you're<00:03:37.700> spreading<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.510> song

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:38.719 
just like you're spreading of the song

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.920 
just like you're spreading of the song
pattern<00:03:39.200> by<00:03:39.950> having<00:03:40.849> a<00:03:40.909> pinky<00:03:41.209> on<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.689> pinky

pattern by having a pinky on and pinky

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.020 
pattern by having a pinky on and pinky
off<00:03:42.109> on<00:03:42.379> the<00:03:42.500> imager<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:43.459> are<00:03:43.549> spreading<00:03:43.760> this

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
off on the imager you are spreading this

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.929 
off on the imager you are spreading this
strumming<00:03:44.599> pattern<00:03:44.959> here<00:03:45.290> into<00:03:45.769> t<00:03:46.159> minor<00:03:46.519> and

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:46.939 
strumming pattern here into t minor and

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.929 
strumming pattern here into t minor and
a<00:03:47.420> major<00:03:48.189> so<00:03:49.189> it<00:03:49.280> goes<00:03:49.430> like<00:03:49.519> this

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:49.939 
a major so it goes like this

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.159 
a major so it goes like this
Oh<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:51.439> key<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.799> own<00:03:52.040> starts<00:03:52.790> before<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:53.989> hit

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
Oh the key is own starts before you hit

00:03:54.169 --> 00:04:01.629 
Oh the key is own starts before you hit
the<00:03:54.230> B<00:03:54.889> minor<00:03:55.129> oh<00:03:59.739> isn't<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.889> again<00:04:01.159> listen<00:04:01.609> to

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
the B minor oh isn't it again listen to

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.159 
the B minor oh isn't it again listen to
it<00:04:01.790> again<00:04:01.909> carefully<00:04:02.500> down<00:04:03.500> up<00:04:04.129> down<00:04:04.609> pub<00:04:05.180> this

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
it again carefully down up down pub this

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.869 
it again carefully down up down pub this
first<00:04:06.530> part<00:04:06.739> of<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.859> stronger<00:04:07.219> not<00:04:07.489> B<00:04:07.639> minor

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
first part of the stronger not B minor

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.110 
first part of the stronger not B minor
and<00:04:08.209> then<00:04:08.599> it<00:04:08.750> goes<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:08.959> image<00:04:12.579> on<00:04:13.579> a<00:04:13.639> major

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
and then it goes to image on a major

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.740 
and then it goes to image on a major
then<00:04:14.780> one<00:04:15.109> from<00:04:15.469> pattern<00:04:15.919> on<00:04:16.070> a<00:04:16.280> major<00:04:16.660> so<00:04:17.660> it

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
then one from pattern on a major so it

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.640 
then one from pattern on a major so it
goes<00:04:17.959> like<00:04:18.229> this<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:19.039> if<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:20.470> listen<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.500> the

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
goes like this and if you listen to the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:31.680 
goes like this and if you listen to the
song<00:04:21.829> carefully

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.290 

Oh

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:43.810 

Oh

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.400 

the<00:04:44.820> same<00:04:45.060> thing<00:04:45.450> repeats<00:04:45.750> for<00:04:45.990> four<00:04:46.200> times

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
the same thing repeats for four times

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.850 
the same thing repeats for four times
through<00:04:47.070> those<00:04:47.580> lines<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.680> after<00:04:49.680> that<00:04:49.800> a

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
through those lines and after that a

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.890 
through those lines and after that a
little<00:04:50.430> bit<00:04:50.580> tough<00:04:50.850> background<00:04:51.360> music<00:04:51.630> of<00:04:51.750> my

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
little bit tough background music of my

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.610 
little bit tough background music of my
own<00:04:52.140> power<00:04:52.380> chords<00:04:53.010> universe<00:04:54.020> starts<00:04:55.020> like

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
own power chords universe starts like

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.650 
own power chords universe starts like
this

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.630 

so<00:05:03.660> I'm<00:05:04.020> doing<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:04.380> one<00:05:04.620> from<00:05:04.920> pattern<00:05:05.340> on<00:05:05.490> a

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
so I'm doing a one from pattern on a

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.390 
so I'm doing a one from pattern on a
major<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.390> split<00:05:07.230> it<00:05:07.410> with<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.890> split<00:05:08.250> the

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
major and split it with to split the

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.760 
major and split it with to split the
second<00:05:08.850> pattern<00:05:09.180> between<00:05:09.360> D<00:05:09.720> major<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.290> G

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
second pattern between D major and G

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.640 
second pattern between D major and G
major<00:05:11.240> so<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.390> will<00:05:12.540> sound<00:05:12.720> like<00:05:12.870> this<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.410> set

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
major so it will sound like this to set

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.470 
major so it will sound like this to set
the<00:05:13.890> second<00:05:14.250> part<00:05:14.460> of<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.730> second<00:05:15.090> part<00:05:15.390> of

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
the second part of the second part of

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.770 
the second part of the second part of
the<00:05:15.600> same<00:05:15.810> line<00:05:16.080> goes<00:05:17.000> exactly<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.450> same<00:05:18.600> way

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
the same line goes exactly the same way

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.990 
the same line goes exactly the same way
but<00:05:18.930> it's<00:05:19.110> an<00:05:19.290> F<00:05:19.680> sharp<00:05:19.740> minor<00:05:20.250> instead<00:05:20.730> of<00:05:20.850> an

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
but it's an F sharp minor instead of an

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:39.760 
but it's an F sharp minor instead of an
E<00:05:21.150> major<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:21.990> goes<00:05:22.200> like<00:05:22.380> this

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.420 

simple<00:05:40.770> so<00:05:41.129> it's<00:05:41.580> two<00:05:41.819> times<00:05:41.849> of<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.539> same

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
simple so it's two times of the same

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.800 
simple so it's two times of the same
progression<00:05:44.430> but<00:05:44.610> it's<00:05:44.819> an<00:05:44.969> f-sharp<00:05:45.330> minor

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
progression but it's an f-sharp minor

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.850 
progression but it's an f-sharp minor
ones<00:05:46.289> instead<00:05:46.680> of<00:05:46.830> a<00:05:47.249> major<00:05:47.639> and<00:05:48.259> then<00:05:49.259> you

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
ones instead of a major and then you

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.760 
ones instead of a major and then you
have<00:05:50.819> to<00:05:50.999> again<00:05:51.569> carefully<00:05:51.990> look<00:05:52.469> at<00:05:52.560> the

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
have to again carefully look at the

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.559 
have to again carefully look at the
split<00:05:53.039> between<00:05:53.249> D<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:53.610> E<00:05:53.909> here

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
split between D and E here

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.980 
split between D and E here
the<00:05:55.259> next<00:05:55.529> part<00:05:55.770> goes<00:05:56.539> simple<00:05:57.539> it's<00:05:57.779> one

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
the next part goes simple it's one

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:10.890 
the next part goes simple it's one
pattern<00:05:58.289> on<00:05:58.590> a<00:05:58.800> major<00:05:59.099> and<00:05:59.370> B<00:05:59.550> minor<00:06:00.090> like<00:06:00.479> this

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.170 

and<00:06:11.530> then<00:06:11.950> it<00:06:12.040> hangs<00:06:12.250> on<00:06:12.430> to<00:06:12.580> B<00:06:12.700> minor<00:06:12.910> for<00:06:13.150> the

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
and then it hangs on to B minor for the

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.220 
and then it hangs on to B minor for the
next<00:06:13.450> part

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.140 

now<00:06:19.230> observe<00:06:19.740> carefully<00:06:20.190> it's<00:06:20.490> a<00:06:20.580> 3-1

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
now observe carefully it's a 3-1

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.690 
now observe carefully it's a 3-1
