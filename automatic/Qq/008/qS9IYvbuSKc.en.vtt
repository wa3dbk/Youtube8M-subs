 Please pay attention to you here 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.790

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.140
 This is bluetooth only bluetooth 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.310
 bluetooth is that you use a head 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.730
 And can play is also not connected the line 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.730
 It feels like this is great, let's do it later 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.710
 In this Eto'o in the Well of you will be quite a star volume capacity 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.879
 Huh 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.420
 Well or so strange is the feeling that I want will Amego expected 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.210
 Only in this domain 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.489
 I can not tell you it is youtube 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:00.040
 Why should I compare it ? 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:04.879
 Toka Sports Hall of example are tentatively type Museum School wonder if Bailly Nante 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.990
 Edo sound to them in one shot 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.909
 turn 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.820
 It can be about it 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.370
 It doesn't look like a club , isn't it? 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.860
 There is a limit but 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:24.120
 It's just like it's open to the outdoors, so I guess it's a good idea 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.210
 I feel like yes 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.730
 is 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.540
 In Well a little because there is a function of hereabouts Hen Hummer Chun costumes 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:38.230
 Well this will talk later 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.230
 Well, let's start by actually making the sound 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 Let's go a little 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.590
 With the cable that came with your cat 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.590
 It is flowing 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.180
 I guess this is a bit short 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.180
 It is about 30 centimeters what I understand 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.170
 Well good to do this about in 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.170
 I will 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.680
 40 cm 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:16.050
 Do also not a long Movie'm good fortune this is dead long the case for 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.460
 Because I want people will sell anyone this that cheap I please buy above all 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.910
 It sounds like 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.900
 Hey 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.900
 Something appropriate 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.790
 This Reimu Deals 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.790
 Sound comparison 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.310
 It is made of 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.310
 It is up to the goal gradually 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:02.050
 There are also those who say that the sound is weak . 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.950
 Since in many cases Sometimes that volume after the mobile I'd have that is weak 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.440
 that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.440
 I will also invite the setting of Nikkei University 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.540
 me 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.349
 ni 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.349
 me 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.680
 goo 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.260
 I have been angry anymore you were the night I Mutcha I leave this is okay if it is Ne Well this morning 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.610
 And what 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.930
 There is a discharge station in the neighborhood and it is about to rush in 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.690
 It is strong 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:40.440
 Or Let's do eight 9 after in 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.970
 This light, copper leaf air piece 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.970
 It came in Oh 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.810
 That 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.240
 me 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.340
 A little late MÃºsica ah ah A 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.370
 Yes 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:04.130
 I say directly below will be run for every time this is today 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.740
 Oh this sounds quite out of you I sound 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:12.310
 Ah this at all to say that before this mouth light despite Naa 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:17.720
 After this group why directionality is great 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:20.769
 It is narrow and only eight voices are firmly 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.769
 It is ready to be taken 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.240
 Yeah the directivity is quite narrow 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.900
 Nunn 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.950
 that 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.820
 It is the showcase range the sound of the microphone and say what is to say directivity 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.830
 Aid For example 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.660
 Yeah yeah 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:44.920
 Toka or picked up this much that it is picked up mon slow-acting 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:49.120
 There is a thing to pick up 360 degrees after 1 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:52.479
 In the case of this went robbing super car d put 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.320
 I do not know how to supercomputers called a unidirectional 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.919
 Since I take this side only to say unidirectional 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.150
 Only this 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.610
 It feels like it can be taken purely 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.469
 why 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.630
 If you say that you know what the fire protection is like if it 's very good or not, then other sounds 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:14.810
 He who does not enter so much 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.620
 Even if Chong and the night is doing Japan Mini it's Gacha 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:23.009
 I mean that the scope is hard to pick up if here and here a 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:28.759
 It makes you feel that you can pick up only pure voice 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.759
 Oh N er in the sauce 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:40.500
 For example, play music on iphone 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:41.980
 You can sing with this, but you can also be a vocalist or another image show. 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.800
 Yes 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:50.240
 It is good even at a proud competition, and I wonder if you can do that vocal well 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.940
 In any case this 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:59.400
 That ordinary enough to endure vocals 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:02.080
 Quality Na' say the lowest image quality is amazing When was'm with for free to Fu that Do has come dressed 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.100
 I mean I feel 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.240
 To in 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.590
 Well that's why I wonder why karaoke apps 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.129
 Yeah 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.470
 Tsu was what it is the last time 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:19.480
 That identity 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.700
 it is amazing even this I am Joy sound now but life and part of i league was spear 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.910
 this 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.910
 That karaoke husband of joysound 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.420
 It is say, 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:41.950
 I do not have a karaoke app 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:47.770
 Now you have Eto Juju. 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:53.260
 Shiina There are many Yes I Toka apples but There are many Toka Sanae Jonouchi Toka Democratic Party 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:55.449
 But you will feel that able to sing anymore this kind of wind for another single this 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.660
 Yes 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.870
 Well when you sing outside Hano 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:04.860
 It was good to sex you're listening to solve the quiz Rai-kun 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:07.160
 Passing through-if it is an annoying story 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.970
 It is good to live 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.970
 It is a feeling
