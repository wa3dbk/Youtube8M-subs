00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
you bump the wires above this why split

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.750 
you bump the wires above this why split
you<00:02:53.049> can<00:02:53.170> hear<00:02:53.290> some<00:02:53.470> moderate<00:02:53.860> movement<00:02:54.310> but

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
you can hear some moderate movement but
