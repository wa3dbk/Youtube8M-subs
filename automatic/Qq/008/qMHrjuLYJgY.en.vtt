of hub motors direct drive and geared
direct<00:02:44.940> drive<00:02:45.120> simply<00:02:45.540> means<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.870> there<00:02:46.170> is

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
direct drive simply means that there is

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.600 
direct drive simply means that there is

what you need to get a pill yeah and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.259 
what you need to get a pill yeah and
here<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.840> San<00:03:04.050> Francisco<00:03:04.230> he<00:03:05.070> got<00:03:05.280> Hills<00:03:05.550> we

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
here in San Francisco he got Hills we

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.850 
here in San Francisco he got Hills we
have<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.780> rag<00:03:07.350> where<00:03:07.530> we're<00:03:07.680> located

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
have a rag where we're located

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.410 
have a rag where we're located
especially<00:03:08.489> we're<00:03:08.580> almost<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.910> basin<00:03:09.300> so

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
especially we're almost in a basin so

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.729 
especially we're almost in a basin so
there's<00:03:09.570> nothing<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:09.930> hills<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.530> almost

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
there's nothing but hills but I almost

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.860 
there's nothing but hills but I almost
square<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.430> right<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.850> us<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.840> know

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
square to the right of us you know

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.170 
square to the right of us you know
basically<00:03:13.350> another<00:03:14.250> Hills<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.700> left<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:15.060> us

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
basically another Hills the left of us

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.140 
basically another Hills the left of us
so<00:03:15.350> hills<00:03:16.350> are<00:03:16.650> require<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.430> special<00:03:17.940> type<00:03:18.120> of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
so hills are require a special type of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.210 
so hills are require a special type of
motor<00:03:18.480> design<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.590> there's<00:03:19.860> also<00:03:20.010> other

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
motor design but there's also other

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.440 
motor design but there's also other
types<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.640> bikes<00:03:20.820> we<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.239> stealth

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
types of bikes we have the stealth

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.850

great thing about the reader power
cycles<00:04:31.150> was<00:04:31.360> that<00:04:31.540> they<00:04:32.440> had<00:04:32.470> high<00:04:32.919> enough

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
cycles was that they had high enough

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.129 
cycles was that they had high enough

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
torque even though they use lead acid

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.740 
torque even though they use lead acid
batteries<00:04:35.530> but<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.979> was<00:04:36.190> like<00:04:36.300> 2002<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.570> there
