with<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> temperature<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.170> machine

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
with the temperature with this machine

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.110 
with the temperature with this machine
we<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.949> something<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:02.430> called<00:01:02.550> exact

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
we have something that's called exact

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
we have something that's called exact
heat<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.750> has<00:01:04.080> feedback<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.070> consistently

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
heat it has feedback that consistently

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.969 
heat it has feedback that consistently
monitors<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.869> heat<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> oven<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
monitors the heat in the oven so it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.770 
monitors the heat in the oven so it
keeps<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.640> perfect<00:01:09.000> temperature<00:01:09.479> no

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
keeps it at the perfect temperature no

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
keeps it at the perfect temperature no
matter<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.470> baking<00:01:11.010> broiling<00:01:11.280> or

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
matter what you're baking broiling or

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
matter what you're baking broiling or
toasting<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> let's<00:01:13.680> look<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
toasting so let's look at some of the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.910 
toasting so let's look at some of the
other<00:01:14.310> features<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:15.150> mentioned<00:01:15.720> broil<00:01:16.020> same

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
other features I mentioned broil same

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.859 
other features I mentioned broil same
thing<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.460> pick<00:01:17.640> broil<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.299> comes<00:01:18.630> up

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
thing you pick broil it comes up

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
thing you pick broil it comes up
automatically<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> broil<00:01:20.070> temperature

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
automatically on the broil temperature

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
automatically on the broil temperature
and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.509> would<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.750> hit<00:01:22.049> start<00:01:22.409> when

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and then you would just hit start when

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.859 
and then you would just hit start when
you<00:01:23.070> use<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.430> function<00:01:24.000> make<00:01:24.420> sure<00:01:24.720> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you use this function make sure you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.499 
you use this function make sure you
leave<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.229> oven<00:01:25.530> ajar<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.130> helps<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:27.150> make

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
leave your oven ajar it helps to make

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.420 
leave your oven ajar it helps to make
for<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> better<00:01:27.930> broiling<00:01:28.680> result<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> also

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
for a better broiling result it also

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
for a better broiling result it also
helps<00:01:29.880> circulate<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.450> air<00:01:30.479> around<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
helps circulate the air around the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.770 
helps circulate the air around the
machine<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.829> being<00:01:32.040> used<00:01:32.720> okay<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
machine when it's being used okay so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.850 
machine when it's being used okay so
let's<00:01:34.170> look<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.409> some<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> other
