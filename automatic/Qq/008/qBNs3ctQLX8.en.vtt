that<00:01:44.460> you're<00:01:44.640> supposed<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.060> use<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that you're supposed to use so that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.310 
that you're supposed to use so that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
keeps that intact so this is to me it's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.740 
keeps that intact so this is to me it's
a<00:01:49.439> game-changer<00:01:49.650> that's<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> great<00:01:50.909> great<00:01:51.360> idea

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
a game-changer that's a great great idea

some of the guns you can't always take
them<00:02:14.760> apart<00:02:14.850> what's<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:15.930> thoughts<00:02:16.140> let's

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
explain to me by one of the gun

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.280 
explain to me by one of the gun
manufacturing<00:02:18.330> companies<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.930> they're

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
manufacturing companies that they're

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.080 
manufacturing companies that they're
highly<00:02:19.680> machined<00:02:20.010> surfaces<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.640> guys<00:02:20.850> have

highly machined surfaces you guys have

highly machined surfaces you guys have
your<00:02:21.209> own<00:02:21.269> paint<00:02:21.540> guns<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.840> know<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.290> right

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
your own paint guns you know this right

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.160 
your own paint guns you know this right
there's<00:02:22.890> torque<00:02:23.310> tolerances<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.239> with<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
there's torque tolerances with with that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.770 
there's torque tolerances with with that
the<00:02:25.650> fluid<00:02:26.190> heads<00:02:26.489> your<00:02:27.150> needle<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.569> seat

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the fluid heads your needle and seat

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.130 
the fluid heads your needle and seat
it's<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:28.680> critical<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.910> those<00:02:30.600> tolerances

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
it's it's critical that those tolerances

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.960 
it's it's critical that those tolerances
are<00:02:31.260> maintained<00:02:31.769> so<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.220> don't<00:02:32.400> always<00:02:32.790> want

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
are maintained so you don't always want

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.280 
are maintained so you don't always want
to<00:02:33.000> rip<00:02:33.150> apart<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.510> paint<00:02:33.720> gun<00:02:33.780> unless<00:02:34.080> you're

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
to rip apart a paint gun unless you're

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.900 
to rip apart a paint gun unless you're
rebuilding<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.760> maintain

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
rebuilding it so you want to maintain

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.449 
rebuilding it so you want to maintain
that<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.810> highly<00:02:37.440> machined<00:02:37.860> surface<00:02:38.280> and

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
that that highly machined surface and

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.949 
that that highly machined surface and
those<00:02:38.549> mating<00:02:38.970> surfaces<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.660> don't<00:02:39.810> have

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
those mating surfaces so you don't have

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.479 
those mating surfaces so you don't have
air<00:02:40.110> leaks<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.560> things<00:02:40.739> like<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
air leaks and things like that so I

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.479 
air leaks and things like that so I
rarely<00:02:42.360> pull<00:02:42.930> my<00:02:43.049> guns<00:02:43.260> apart<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.280> rarely

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
rarely pull my guns apart and I rarely

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.610 
rarely pull my guns apart and I rarely
have<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:45.000> pull<00:02:45.180> my<00:02:45.299> guns<00:02:45.480> apart<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.019> clean<00:02:46.500> them

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
have to pull my guns apart I clean them

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.259 
have to pull my guns apart I clean them
properly<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:47.340> do<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.760> proper<00:02:48.000> due<00:02:48.239> diligence

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269

I'm<00:02:56.489> Superman<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.209> paint<00:02:57.450> job<00:02:57.660> it's

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
I'm Superman in the paint job it's

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.690

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
because I do the job on cleaning the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.490 
because I do the job on cleaning the
equipment<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.570> preserves<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.079> equipment
