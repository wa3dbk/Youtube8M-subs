 of funding the project structure the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.990

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 concerned once again 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.950
 their willingness to engage in the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.830
 accomplishment of this important 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.439
 road infrastructure that will facilitate 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.799
 rapprochement and exchanges between 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.170
 states at the current stage of the project the lifting 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.549
 of funds started explained the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.880
 Ivorian Minister of Infrastructure 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.369
 economic achi patrick who was 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.560
 in charge of making a point to the press 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.210
 the principle was stopped that this 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.759
 highway will be a highway to see there 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.350
 twice three ways 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.390
 who will there be since the kids 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.630
 to abidjan 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:48.659
 it was stopped that the device 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:54.340
 legal process that will be put in place to 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:57.009
 build and manage this highway will be 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.610
 a supranational device so that goes 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.700
 impose itself on all countries it has been 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.950
 also stopped that once this 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.170
 autumn completed in the frame precisely 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.019
 of this legal device that has been 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.350
 put in place 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:16.720
 not only will we have the means to 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.380
 move faster but the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.030
 barriers of any kind 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.850
 between different countries 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.920
 according to mostly lifted so as to 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.799
 what we can practically go from one 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.170
 point to another without meeting any 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.370
 blocking 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.230
 one of the principles that was also 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.700
 stopped is that the project will be done 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.760
 as part of a public partnership 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.920
 private with a presence of the private no 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.320
 only in the design the lifting 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.430
 funds but also the management of 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.220
 this book that will be built the leaders 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.320
 present state also insisted 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.810
 on the fact that this project by resulted 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.100
 of political will and that if 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.740
 the study on its viability and is 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:10.610
 interesting for 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:14.480
 before this is one of the major points that 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.740
 allows you to move even faster 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.050
 it's really the political will is 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.900
 that this existing political will he 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.830
 there is no concern that funding 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.670
 can get up with the guarantee of 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.790
 the state and with today the ads 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.280
 donors and the interest 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.620
 that they manifested to this project there a 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.190
 equally important points that was 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.420
 addressed was the management process of 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.430
 this project until its end 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.130
 it was decided to set up a 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.180
 steering committee consisting of 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:55.530
 Ministers of the five countries concerned and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.710
 proposal by the President-in-Office of 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.900
 the cedeao presents the most ivory side 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.420
 the chair of this committee was entrusted 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.070
 so in nigeria this proposal has been 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.530
 accepted by all countries is missing 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.690
 such a working session and in place in 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.270
 the context of celebration of the 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.510
 fiftieth anniversary of the uia we can see 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.460
 a strong signal that development and 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.370
 economic integration must be 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.910
 now the priority within the union 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.910
 African
