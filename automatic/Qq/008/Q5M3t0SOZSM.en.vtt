00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
feeling because sin it has a way of

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.600 
feeling because sin it has a way of
shrinking<00:02:36.900> God<00:02:37.140> down<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.830> our<00:02:37.950> minds<00:02:38.490> and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
shrinking God down in our minds and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.980 
shrinking God down in our minds and
puffing<00:02:39.240> us<00:02:39.450> up<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:40.140> our<00:02:40.260> own<00:02:40.320> estimation<00:02:41.990> but

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
puffing us up in our own estimation but

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.560 
puffing us up in our own estimation but
just<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.380> glance<00:02:43.800> into<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.580> universe<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.510> God

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
just a glance into the universe that God

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.380 
just a glance into the universe that God
has<00:02:45.930> made<00:02:46.310> resizes<00:02:47.310> everything<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330
