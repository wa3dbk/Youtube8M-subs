00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
much these were because I don't think

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.840

like some numbers but I just think they

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.530

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.500 
are the coolest earrings and they are
light<00:03:31.959> as<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.319> feather<00:03:33.240> but<00:03:34.240> aren't<00:03:34.420> they
