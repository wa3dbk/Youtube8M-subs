00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
dangerous deadly team at home for a

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.800 
dangerous deadly team at home for a
second<00:03:32.579> if<00:03:32.700> they<00:03:32.819> went<00:03:33.000> in<00:03:33.090> buffalo<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.630> this

the Patriots played the San Francisco
49ers<00:03:37.889> and<00:03:38.370> probably<00:03:38.790> could<00:03:38.970> beat<00:03:39.090> them<00:03:39.239> at

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
49ers and probably could beat them at

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.330 
49ers and probably could beat them at
home<00:03:39.540> yeah<00:03:39.959> i<00:03:39.989> mean<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.349> 14<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.889> 49s

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
obviously have that tougher slate this

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.190 
obviously have that tougher slate this
week<00:03:43.200> coming<00:03:43.410> up<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.769> they<00:03:43.859> you<00:03:43.950> know<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
week coming up if they you know the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.780 
week coming up if they you know the
Seahawks<00:03:46.200> playing<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.709> bills<00:03:47.250> as<00:03:47.489> much<00:03:47.609> easy

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
Seahawks playing the bills as much easy

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.759 
Seahawks playing the bills as much easy
again<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.180> 49ers<00:03:48.660> going<00:03:48.840> into<00:03:49.049> New<00:03:49.440> England

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
again the 49ers going into New England

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:50.930 
again the 49ers going into New England
where<00:03:49.889> by<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.190> way<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> Patriots<00:03:50.730> haven't

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
where by the way the Patriots haven't

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.180 
where by the way the Patriots haven't
lost<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.180> home<00:03:51.359> game<00:03:51.389> since<00:03:51.840> 2002<00:03:52.620> in<00:03:52.769> December

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
lost a home game since 2002 in December

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.699 
lost a home game since 2002 in December
so<00:03:53.430> we<00:03:54.389> might<00:03:54.569> right<00:03:54.780> now<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.200> isn't<00:03:55.380> this<00:03:55.560> is

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
so we might right now this isn't this is

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.500 
so we might right now this isn't this is
a<00:03:55.739> division<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.160> can<00:03:56.340> go<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:57.120> Seattle
