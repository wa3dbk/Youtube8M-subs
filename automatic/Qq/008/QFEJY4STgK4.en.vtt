see there's only four on there I the
more<00:01:23.439> sources<00:01:24.249> you<00:01:24.609> add<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:25.749> Cydia<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:28.060> more

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
more sources you add to Cydia the more

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.050 
more sources you add to Cydia the more
information<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.590> has<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:30.069> process<00:01:30.310> therefore

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
information it has to process therefore

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.770 
information it has to process therefore
it<00:01:31.479> will<00:01:31.630> slow<00:01:31.959> down<00:01:32.130> Cydia<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.630> city<00:01:34.630> is

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
it will slow down Cydia a city is

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.519 
it will slow down Cydia a city is
ability<00:01:35.139> to<00:01:35.649> search<00:01:36.069> and<00:01:36.639> and<00:01:36.880> find<00:01:37.659> things<00:01:38.020> it

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:38.529 
ability to search and and find things it

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:40.230 
ability to search and and find things it
will<00:01:38.709> still<00:01:38.920> do<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.340> but<00:01:39.549> it'll<00:01:39.729> just<00:01:40.029> be<00:01:40.209> a

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
will still do it but it'll just be a

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.419 
will still do it but it'll just be a
little<00:01:40.450> slower<00:01:40.840> tuning<00:01:41.350> that's<00:01:41.560> why<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:41.799> keep

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
little slower tuning that's why I keep

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.559 
little slower tuning that's why I keep
my<00:01:42.819> sources<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.920> just<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.369> bare<00:01:45.729> minimum<00:01:46.090> i

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
my sources down to just a bare minimum i

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.260 
my sources down to just a bare minimum i
would<00:01:46.600> i<00:01:47.319> would<00:01:47.619> keep<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.279> no<00:01:48.459> more<00:01:48.670> than<00:01:48.939> sighs

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
would i would keep it no more than sighs

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.559 
would i would keep it no more than sighs
if<00:01:49.749> i<00:01:49.899> could<00:01:50.079> keep<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.469> at<00:01:50.619> that<00:01:51.179> five<00:01:52.179> or<00:01:52.389> less

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
if i could keep it at that five or less

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.649 
if i could keep it at that five or less
which<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.349> great<00:01:53.740> because<00:01:54.579> you<00:01:55.090> can't<00:01:55.359> imagine

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
which is great because you can't imagine

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.800 
which is great because you can't imagine
the<00:01:55.990> amount<00:01:56.770> of<00:01:57.099> information<00:01:57.549> that<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.299> under

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
the amount of information that is under

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.620 
the amount of information that is under
each<00:01:59.049> one<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.409> these<00:01:59.759> let<00:02:00.759> me<00:02:00.909> show<00:02:01.179> you<00:02:01.209> just

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
each one of these let me show you just

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.539 
each one of these let me show you just
to<00:02:01.779> just<00:02:02.229> just<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.829> understand<00:02:03.369> what<00:02:03.490> I'm

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549

talking about the first number one that

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.669 
talking about the first number one that
I<00:02:06.939> think<00:02:07.029> you<00:02:07.479> should<00:02:07.719> get<00:02:07.899> is<00:02:08.229> going<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.590> be
