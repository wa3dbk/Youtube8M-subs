00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.960
 this story takes place over 15 weeks on the Atlantic islands 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.960
 impudence 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.140
 the 29 degrees north latitude are happy and distribute it 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
 the planet 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.660
 in winter when temperatures fall below zero to 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.660
 midday the darkness is complex 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.180
 during the summer seville at midnight 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.470

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.980
 the little event 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.260

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
 it is intense 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.140

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 it feeds on seals that live in Madrid's sky 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.520
 but this spring in brazil 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 not anywhere 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
 the ice banks 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.710
 the bear needs food this summer 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.710
 the French firm 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.270
 if your ice universe is still heating up 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.270
 goes to emelec 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.030
 but no 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.890
 they are all good
