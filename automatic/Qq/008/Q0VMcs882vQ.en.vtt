okay<00:00:04.730> this<00:00:05.149> is<00:00:05.390> basically<00:00:06.200> dry<00:00:06.500> flaky<00:00:07.100> paint

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.050 
okay this is basically dry flaky paint

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.000 
okay this is basically dry flaky paint
it<00:00:09.050> comes<00:00:09.290> off<00:00:09.440> pretty<00:00:09.679> easy

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
it comes off pretty easy

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:18.890 
it comes off pretty easy
and<00:00:10.190> I'll<00:00:10.370> take<00:00:10.670> it<00:00:10.700> off<00:00:10.910> with<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:11.240> grinder

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:55.780 

[Applause]

all<00:00:56.790> right<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.330> is<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.540> brand<00:00:57.930> new<00:00:58.880> 36<00:00:59.880> grit

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
all right this is a brand new 36 grit

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.980 
all right this is a brand new 36 grit
disc<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:02.250> flakes<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:02.940> tungsten<00:01:03.360> carbide<00:01:03.570> so

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
disc the flakes are tungsten carbide so

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.650 
disc the flakes are tungsten carbide so
it<00:01:04.080> holds<00:01:04.230> up<00:01:04.410> pretty<00:01:04.440> good<00:01:04.680> ok<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.480> the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
it holds up pretty good ok this is the

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.500 
it holds up pretty good ok this is the
disc<00:01:07.070> that's<00:01:08.070> been<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:09.000> maybe<00:01:09.330> about

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
disc that's been in use for maybe about

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
disc that's been in use for maybe about
half<00:01:09.780> an<00:01:09.960> hour<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.410> basically<00:01:11.070> dried<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.730> paint

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
half an hour on basically dried up paint

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
half an hour on basically dried up paint
and<00:01:13.100> there's<00:01:14.100> some<00:01:14.370> spots<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:16.110> where<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and there's some spots that where the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950 
and there's some spots that where the
paint<00:01:17.190> has<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.790> started<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> melt<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
paint has really started to melt on to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.980 
paint has really started to melt on to
the<00:01:19.110> pad<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:21.180> pad<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.600> actually

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the pad but this pad is actually

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:31.789 
the pad but this pad is actually
relatively<00:01:22.710> intact

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.260 

this<00:01:32.799> paint<00:01:33.100> has<00:01:33.250> some<00:01:33.460> bubbles<00:01:33.880> but<00:01:34.060> for<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
this paint has some bubbles but for the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.679 
this paint has some bubbles but for the
most<00:01:34.479> part<00:01:34.780> it's<00:01:34.960> in<00:01:35.110> pretty<00:01:35.320> good<00:01:35.409> shape<00:01:36.689> so

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
most part it's in pretty good shape so

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.270 
most part it's in pretty good shape so
it's<00:01:37.840> going<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.020> be<00:01:38.110> more<00:01:38.259> difficult<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.070> take

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
it's going to be more difficult and take

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.720 
it's going to be more difficult and take
more<00:01:39.460> time<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.820> remove

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:02:21.390 

[Applause]

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
[Applause]

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:34.949 
[Applause]
this<00:02:22.400> took<00:02:22.670> about<00:02:22.790> half<00:02:23.150> an<00:02:23.719> hour<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:24.230> do<00:02:24.560> here

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.699 

okay<00:02:35.709> I've<00:02:35.920> got<00:02:36.189> a<00:02:36.459> brand<00:02:37.150> new<00:02:37.269> disc<00:02:37.689> here<00:02:38.200> and

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
okay I've got a brand new disc here and

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.880 
okay I've got a brand new disc here and
then<00:02:39.700> underneath<00:02:39.969> it<00:02:40.269> I've<00:02:40.689> got<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.650> disc

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
then underneath it I've got the disc

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.520 
then underneath it I've got the disc
that<00:02:42.129> I<00:02:42.250> just<00:02:42.459> finished<00:02:42.849> using<00:02:43.359> from<00:02:44.170> grinding

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
that I just finished using from grinding

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.830 
that I just finished using from grinding
about<00:02:44.799> that<00:02:45.010> 10<00:02:45.340> square<00:02:45.760> foot<00:02:46.090> or<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.659> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
about that 10 square foot or so of the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.039 
about that 10 square foot or so of the
wall<00:02:47.079> and<00:02:48.420> paint<00:02:49.420> was<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.659> pretty<00:02:49.840> good<00:02:49.930> shape

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
wall and paint was in pretty good shape

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.209 
wall and paint was in pretty good shape
except<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.250> was<00:02:51.430> bubbling<00:02:51.939> and<00:02:53.010> I'm<00:02:54.010> going

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 
except it it was bubbling and I'm going

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.160 
except it it was bubbling and I'm going
to<00:02:54.280> see<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.519> paint<00:02:54.879> ISM<00:02:55.150> essentially<00:02:55.689> melted

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
to see the paint ISM essentially melted

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.580 
to see the paint ISM essentially melted
on<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.489> disc<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.530> all<00:02:59.709> around<00:03:00.129> and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
on to the disc and it's all around and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.890 
on to the disc and it's all around and
you'll<00:03:02.590> notice<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.040> when<00:03:03.189> you're<00:03:03.340> doing<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
you'll notice that when you're doing the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.140 
you'll notice that when you're doing the
dragging<00:03:05.579> that<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.909> pad<00:03:07.810> does<00:03:08.200> not<00:03:08.639> bite<00:03:09.639> into

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
dragging that the pad does not bite into

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.129 
dragging that the pad does not bite into
the<00:03:10.269> wood<00:03:10.480> as<00:03:10.659> well<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:12.389> it<00:03:13.389> tends<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.689> smear

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
the wood as well and it tends to smear

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.110 
the wood as well and it tends to smear
the<00:03:14.319> paint<00:03:14.560> around<00:03:14.980> instead<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.730> actually

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
the paint around instead of actually

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.550 
the paint around instead of actually
removing<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.780> what<00:03:19.930> I'll<00:03:20.019> do<00:03:20.169> to<00:03:20.319> clean

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
removing it so what I'll do to clean

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.839 
removing it so what I'll do to clean
this<00:03:20.680> up<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:22.169> put<00:03:23.169> stripper<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.889> let<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.730> sit

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
this up is put stripper on it let it sit

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.819 
this up is put stripper on it let it sit
overnight<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.450> then<00:03:25.689> wash<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:25.900> off<00:03:28.739> okay<00:03:29.739> I've

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
overnight and then wash it off okay I've

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.559 
overnight and then wash it off okay I've
just<00:03:29.859> been<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.370> sanding<00:03:30.819> this<00:03:30.939> deck<00:03:31.329> it's

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
just been of sanding this deck it's

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.649 
just been of sanding this deck it's
taken<00:03:32.019> me<00:03:32.169> about<00:03:32.379> three<00:03:32.889> hours<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:34.269> deck<00:03:34.480> is

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
taken me about three hours the deck is

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.379 
taken me about three hours the deck is
about<00:03:35.019> 300<00:03:35.859> square<00:03:36.099> feet<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.639> in<00:03:36.849> spots<00:03:37.180> I've

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
about 300 square feet and in spots I've

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.689 
about 300 square feet and in spots I've
actually<00:03:37.540> gone<00:03:37.810> down<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.169> the<00:03:38.290> bare<00:03:38.500> wood<00:03:38.739> got

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
actually gone down to the bare wood got

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:44.789 
actually gone down to the bare wood got
another<00:03:39.940> spots<00:03:40.419> have<00:03:41.349> simply<00:03:42.989> done<00:03:43.989> patchwork

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
another spots have simply done patchwork

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.460 
another spots have simply done patchwork
and<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:46.269> would<00:03:46.419> estimate<00:03:46.840> there's<00:03:47.169> probably

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
and I would estimate there's probably

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.080 
and I would estimate there's probably
about<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.650> hundred<00:03:47.919> square<00:03:48.370> foot<00:03:48.519> of<00:03:48.579> sanding

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
about a hundred square foot of sanding

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.319 
about a hundred square foot of sanding
so<00:03:49.299> 100<00:03:49.840> square<00:03:50.049> foot<00:03:50.319> in<00:03:50.530> three<00:03:51.010> hours<00:03:51.340> okay

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
so 100 square foot in three hours okay

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.689 
so 100 square foot in three hours okay
this<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.109> disc<00:03:53.379> that<00:03:53.680> I've<00:03:54.129> used<00:03:54.370> for<00:03:54.489> the

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
this is the disc that I've used for the

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.280 
this is the disc that I've used for the
back<00:03:54.879> deck<00:03:55.209> it's<00:03:55.419> been<00:03:55.599> in<00:03:55.720> use<00:03:55.900> for<00:03:55.930> about

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
back deck it's been in use for about

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.610 
back deck it's been in use for about
three<00:03:56.620> hours<00:03:56.949> on<00:03:57.389> fairly<00:03:58.389> dry<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.199> chipped<00:03:59.439> up

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
three hours on fairly dry and chipped up

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.830 
three hours on fairly dry and chipped up
paint<00:03:59.949> the<00:04:00.639> disc<00:04:00.849> itself<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.449> in<00:04:01.569> pretty<00:04:01.750> good

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
paint the disc itself is in pretty good

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.960 
paint the disc itself is in pretty good
shape<00:04:02.019> there's<00:04:02.530> some<00:04:02.709> spots<00:04:03.040> where<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.639> paint

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
shape there's some spots where the paint

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.119 
shape there's some spots where the paint
is<00:04:04.090> melted<00:04:04.479> down<00:04:04.569> but<00:04:05.409> it<00:04:05.680> could<00:04:05.859> still<00:04:06.069> be

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
is melted down but it could still be

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.210 
is melted down but it could still be
used<00:04:06.430> for<00:04:06.639> a<00:04:06.669> little<00:04:06.970> bit<00:04:07.060> longer<00:04:07.829> if<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:09.009> move

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
used for a little bit longer if I move

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.099 
used for a little bit longer if I move
to<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.430> new<00:04:09.489> deck<00:04:09.879> I<00:04:10.120> would<00:04:10.449> probably<00:04:10.689> put<00:04:10.959> on<00:04:11.079> a

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
to a new deck I would probably put on a

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.530 
to a new deck I would probably put on a
new<00:04:11.379> disc<00:04:11.739> just<00:04:12.549> because<00:04:12.909> if<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.180> could<00:04:13.239> save

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
new disc just because if I could save

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.629 
new disc just because if I could save
some<00:04:13.810> time<00:04:14.049> with<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.590> new<00:04:14.829> disc<00:04:15.099> I<00:04:15.340> would<00:04:15.489> go

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
some time with a new disc I would go

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.659 
some time with a new disc I would go
ahead<00:04:15.729> and<00:04:15.909> do<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:16.889> now<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:17.949> color<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.459> this

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
ahead and do so now the color of this

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.430 
ahead and do so now the color of this
disc<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.209> different<00:04:19.720> than<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.049> other<00:04:20.199> ones

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
disc is different than the other ones

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.920 
disc is different than the other ones
that's<00:04:21.220> because<00:04:21.639> I've<00:04:21.789> stripped<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.659> paint

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
that's because I've stripped the paint

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.629 
that's because I've stripped the paint
off<00:04:23.259> of<00:04:23.289> this<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:24.699> is<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:24.960> reused<00:04:25.960> disc<00:04:26.650> and

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
off of this so this is a reused disc and

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.830 
off of this so this is a reused disc and
the<00:04:28.030> stripper<00:04:29.550> changes<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.729> pulls<00:04:31.210> some<00:04:31.449> metal

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
the stripper changes it pulls some metal

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.839 
the stripper changes it pulls some metal
off<00:04:32.020> of<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.409> disc<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:32.949> don't<00:04:33.370> know<00:04:33.520> if<00:04:33.669> it's

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
off of this disc I don't know if it's

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.330 
off of this disc I don't know if it's
bad<00:04:34.389> or<00:04:34.690> not<00:04:34.810> but<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.409> disc<00:04:35.650> still<00:04:36.039> seems<00:04:36.280> to

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
bad or not but the disc still seems to

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.510 
bad or not but the disc still seems to
work

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
work

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.850 
work
you

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.770 

this<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.190> area<00:04:43.490> underneath<00:04:43.730> where<00:04:44.270> I've

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
this is the area underneath where I've

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.900 
this is the area underneath where I've
been<00:04:44.960> grinding<00:04:45.230> the<00:04:45.560> paint<00:04:45.800> off<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.040> wood<00:04:46.580> and

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
been grinding the paint off the wood and

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.830 
been grinding the paint off the wood and
it<00:04:47.660> throws<00:04:47.900> up<00:04:48.080> a<00:04:48.170> lot<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.470> dust<00:04:49.450> these<00:04:50.450> boards

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
it throws up a lot of dust these boards

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.810 
it throws up a lot of dust these boards
actually<00:04:51.020> primed<00:04:51.560> white<00:04:51.890> you<00:04:52.460> can<00:04:52.610> see

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
actually primed white you can see

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.210 
actually primed white you can see
there's<00:04:53.000> quite<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.240> bit<00:04:53.450> of<00:04:53.480> dust<00:04:53.690> underneath

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.160 

this<00:04:58.220> is<00:04:58.430> an<00:04:58.580> example<00:04:58.910> of<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.300> scouring<00:04:59.810> that

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
this is an example of the scouring that

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.020 
this is an example of the scouring that
can<00:05:00.320> happen<00:05:00.620> from<00:05:00.770> this<00:05:00.950> course<00:05:01.340> just<00:05:01.700> of<00:05:01.910> this

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
can happen from this course just of this

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.810 
can happen from this course just of this
grinder<00:05:04.900> there<00:05:05.900> are<00:05:06.260> it's<00:05:06.740> rotating<00:05:07.400> so<00:05:07.640> there

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
grinder there are it's rotating so there

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.340 
grinder there are it's rotating so there
are<00:05:08.170> patterns<00:05:09.170> of<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:11.240> grinder<00:05:11.960> is<00:05:12.050> left

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
are patterns of that the grinder is left

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.160 
are patterns of that the grinder is left
behind<00:05:12.920> I<00:05:13.310> just<00:05:14.180> highlighted<00:05:14.630> these<00:05:14.870> with

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
behind I just highlighted these with

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.040 
behind I just highlighted these with
them<00:05:15.410> a<00:05:15.650> real<00:05:16.100> dry<00:05:16.310> paintbrush<00:05:16.700> and<00:05:17.150> it's

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
them a real dry paintbrush and it's

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.430 
them a real dry paintbrush and it's
comfortable<00:05:18.910> to<00:05:19.910> the<00:05:20.390> raised<00:05:20.630> rein<00:05:21.050> of<00:05:21.260> these

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
comfortable to the raised rein of these

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.720 
comfortable to the raised rein of these
boards<00:05:22.040> here<00:05:22.730> it<00:05:23.630> will<00:05:24.410> be<00:05:24.620> noticeable<00:05:25.340> if

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
boards here it will be noticeable if

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.760 
boards here it will be noticeable if
you're<00:05:25.940> looking<00:05:26.240> for<00:05:26.510> it<00:05:26.690> on<00:05:26.870> the<00:05:27.470> finished

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
you're looking for it on the finished

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.580 
you're looking for it on the finished
product<00:05:28.510> but<00:05:29.510> if<00:05:29.750> you're<00:05:29.930> not<00:05:30.080> looking<00:05:30.200> for<00:05:30.380> it

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
product but if you're not looking for it

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.460 
product but if you're not looking for it
it's<00:05:30.770> it's<00:05:31.010> pretty<00:05:31.160> so<00:05:32.170> something<00:05:33.170> else<00:05:33.320> this

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
it's it's pretty so something else this

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.500 
it's it's pretty so something else this
grinder<00:05:33.890> does<00:05:34.100> is<00:05:34.460> if<00:05:34.970> you're<00:05:35.150> not<00:05:35.300> paying

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
grinder does is if you're not paying

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.410 
grinder does is if you're not paying
attention<00:05:36.400> it<00:05:37.400> can<00:05:37.550> really<00:05:37.820> dig<00:05:38.030> into<00:05:38.210> the

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
attention it can really dig into the

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.510 
attention it can really dig into the
wood<00:05:38.600> and<00:05:38.870> if<00:05:39.560> you're<00:05:39.740> real<00:05:39.860> careful<00:05:40.070> then<00:05:40.460> you

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
wood and if you're real careful then you

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.310 
wood and if you're real careful then you
have<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:40.700> kind<00:05:40.880> of<00:05:40.910> send<00:05:41.150> that<00:05:41.330> out<00:05:44.110> one<00:05:45.110> thing

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
have to kind of send that out one thing

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.620 
have to kind of send that out one thing
this<00:05:45.500> grinder<00:05:45.950> does<00:05:46.130> not<00:05:46.340> do<00:05:46.580> well<00:05:46.760> is<00:05:47.240> feather

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
this grinder does not do well is feather

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.760 
this grinder does not do well is feather
an<00:05:47.870> edge<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:49.600> can<00:05:50.600> see<00:05:50.690> there's<00:05:51.020> it's<00:05:51.440> pretty

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
an edge you can see there's it's pretty

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.370 
an edge you can see there's it's pretty
rough<00:05:52.010> here<00:05:52.370> so<00:05:53.300> generally<00:05:53.840> I<00:05:53.900> will<00:05:54.080> have<00:05:54.230> to

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
rough here so generally I will have to

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.600 
rough here so generally I will have to
take<00:05:54.560> the<00:05:54.860> paint<00:05:55.160> all<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:55.910> way<00:05:56.000> to<00:05:56.060> an<00:05:56.300> edge

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
take the paint all the way to an edge

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.880 
take the paint all the way to an edge
for<00:05:58.610> a<00:05:58.670> clean<00:05:58.850> finish
