00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:11.459
 okey 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.459
 let's follow the multi-theater 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.079
 by defaul always 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:20.720
 is going to generate 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.099
 this screen 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.130
 with track number one is designed for any instrument 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.439
 the cent consell 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.350
 us what interests us oriental as I will try to work a battery 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.350
 therefore all many tracks 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.670
 and we press add 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.290
 asks us what kind of instrument and the position in which creamy and 15th 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.420
 let's put a request 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.460
 and in this last case the first good time the game the superior of the first 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.920
 it becomes track number one 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.840
 before the bridge, after that we repeat that we are like the flu 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.280
 the offer 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 he asked us his name and in this case alonso with the drummer 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.980
 and we leave the colophon for the pair that it uses 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.210
 triathlon 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.250
 - the height quintet 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.670
 the equine will handle 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.940
 two good classic adagio forms write a score for the table 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.399
 a whole series of numbers that we will show right now 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.500
 With which photos we can describe our battery in Milan mind 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.240
 writing method union he lies tablature 5 we will be 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.970
 i explains that this painting 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.240
 where does each of the numbers come from 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.470
 and the allocation that is given instruments 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.470
 at the bottom too 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.950
 or politicians 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.200
 how do you write 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200
 if this part 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.560
 military 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.150
 open 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 yes 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.350
 efe 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.280
 the one that for more than 30 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.830
 we bring it right now 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.070
 can return to recover it as in this medium percussion p 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:13.619
 very well 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.619
 let's describe it as I was saying a moment ago 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:22.899
 we see at this time will show 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:25.009
 as uncertain 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:30.469
 a silence yes they were then scream with the number key with the r key right now 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.469
 for this occasion groups 2 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.259
 efe 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.639
 yes 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.449
 now 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.449
 I already have 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.149
 four quarters at the heat percent 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.819
 I prefer to play 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.949
 a little alone 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.949
 a little bit of martins 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.769
 p 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.429
 now 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.959
 very good now this same compass 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.959
 weigh the fashion the right button the brahmos copy 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.989
 Picasso asked us then the current 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.569
 let's tell you why today's compass 1 something 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.759
 we move to the right with the keys 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.469
 displacement and what was model 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.119
 lomuto paste 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.119
 twice 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.889
 we press again 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.889
 oscar 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.519
 we are easily creating a bic 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.739
 now for example 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.739
 let's imagine we want to give you some mati 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.559
 we change we expected that they share second the world shares time the second 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:59.289
 weather 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.009
 we face a court 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.939
 inside the notes also comes as insert a time 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.679
 yes obiang the uncertain key on another piece of cloth 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.209
 this time we're going to score another goal 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.579
 boselli 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.749
 do not 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.860
 how can they realize 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.219
 two cons 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:31.219
 if we press the letter l 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.990
 and the note 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.159
 is going to generate that this same 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.089
 setback to be only indicated and here is that last night 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.090
 the complexity of the motorcycle 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.480
 not by impacts but that decided entities
