00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.719
 the superheroes are very fashionable for 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.370
 that they were inspired by women 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.580
 wonder a look with bright colors 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 as red or blue a look with which yes 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.990
 dare you will do kaboom 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.740
 although today we are going to study twist in 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.690
 blue water color and what we are going to do 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.020
 with this aligner is to create the angle 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.550
 external estrogen let's go over 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.190
 starting with the basin and creating a 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.500
 sort of line as if it were a 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.190
 crescent and we're going to connect it with 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.190
 our eyelashes 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.670
 I'm going to put everything here with the tabs 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.519
 it should not be anything very perfect because 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.519
 pretty afterwards he's going to blur it 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.260
 I have two circuits left installed 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.719
 my finger can take uminsa the awarded 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.909
 well and taking the finger and what I'm going to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.980
 make you soften its outer edges 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.629
 and also the interns then it goes to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.640
 create with a little more uniform color 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.640
 of this blue water color 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.460
 make sure to leave in the part of the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.230
 basin a little bit darker the blue 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 this is going to happen naturally but 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.610
 if you can be careful not to be so 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.610
 the basin but the external part 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.430
 if this button you have colorinches the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.470
 sky blues and then take the cap 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.300
 like this brush that like in these 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.090
 wet toys to capture 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.910
 better the pigment and the color so it goes 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.830
 to start in the center and purple post 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.350
 In the whole distance meter tok tok 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.970
 tok and I'm going to concentrate this sky blood 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.970
 is what I have left free of the eyelid 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.970
 same 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.060
 Y 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.060
 benitez 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.710
 now if you like to take a more shadow 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.450
 dark dresses and used them in 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.120
 'midnight although you have to look for what 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.770
 that is for example this as black with 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.810
 silver flashes can look for that 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.880
 be totally black that is blue more 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.400
 dark but simply is to provide 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.800
 depth and with this shadow or to take it 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.900
 as a smallest brush short story aero 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.430
 Previous depends on studies or no time 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.190
 they were clean and I liked a little 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.410
 more so that then it's the dark and what 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.160
 what I'm going to do this is enter more 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.980
 time in this outer part and bring her in 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.980
 from external bottom too 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:52.620
 and apply internal part 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.489
 nothing because it reminds me like colors 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.900
 the coming of superhero and apart is a 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.590
 little desperate to this combination 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.590
 of blues 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:09.550
 Now I will use these to us 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.890
 let's apply it directly to our 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.770
 makeup because it would be very much we have 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.840
 like blue course good orange but for 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.170
 It looks red so you start 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.890
 transfer it from our eyeliner to 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.140
 our hand so first move a 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.700
 little the product to soften it I'm going 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.680
 to pass it to my hand 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.489
 I'm concentrating more or less on the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.489
 Frost here 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.240
 is the amount so that she is happy and 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.970
 of course before I dried myself 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.950
 see here I have something like that and now what 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.540
 I'm going to do is take food and credit 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.100
 pass it to my eyelid 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.990
 so entity that works fast 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.170
 come to love me that of the rattle chau 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.230
 so he plays simply 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.150
 transfer it and has also been votes 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.230
 so that you see that little bit of frost so 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.180
 pretty 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.730
 the amount that I placed in my hand 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.970
 It works for both eyes because I do not want 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.140
 so much frost and apart now well 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.140
 it is managing a tiny bit of brightness 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.390
 great finally we are going to add more 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.880
 hair among the blue theme has been 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:26.400
 use super blue water to recognize 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.460
 like comic book and security in 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.350
 upper and lower stations 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.350
 external room I have blue here below 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.830
 Y 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.990
 but I must use this caps x in waters 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.240
 of the indian that something in red but be 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.520
 something too much under pressure to what already 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.620
 I have super secure eyes and take yourself 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.620
 add a touch of red nothing more 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.880
 so it is well finished as well 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.900
 you can add lips something 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.490
 much more clear 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.470
 remember product we use in the 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.270
 eyes we start with the choice delineator 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.520
 in blue watch the color of the 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.210
 intense color in blue sky is used 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.020
 a shadow cold cruise in midnight 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.020
 eyelashes in tabs 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.120
 they come back and of course I better what 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.470
 that I'm going to use to become 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.540
 wonder woman or something like that 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.910
 but I can take the disk 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.220
 1 708 because it has enough 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.590
 dark and has brightness is definitely 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.210
 more for the night so I hope to receive 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.360
 to try them and leave for the next 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.360
 miner
