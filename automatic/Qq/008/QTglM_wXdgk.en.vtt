 14 to record a live show dvd is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.369
 I need first of all a team tuned

 that every detail is committed to production 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.720
 was also behind the scenes of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.210
 recording of the new dvd of the singer amanda 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.199
 that occurred during the expogrande 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 following the corridor runs from the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.460
 up to the change of clothes everything with 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.930
 very professionalism and dedication 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.260

 Amanda before the show happens 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.789
 A joint effort provides different types of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.789
 services at the same time 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.949
 I cry 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.240
 the stage is necessary to review the sound and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.450
 lighting of instruments and even 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.420
 the film crew looks out for everyone 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.170
 the details since they can not lose any 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.750
 throw 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.870
 during recording of the part beyond the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.350
 you need to test the crane that will 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.160
 ensure accurate images when moving the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.160
 equipment 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.330
 while in the dressing room the rush is not 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.120
 is different 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.580
 the night artist tells us about her 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.610
 impression of one before this great 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.840
 event is an inexplicable dream 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.910
 I am very happy 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.370
 I 'm not nervous, I'm very anxious to 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.370
 It's there on stage already with my fans know 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.940
 completed and mission accomplished and thus 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.950
 age she is not the least she has 18 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.080
 years but so everyone in the middle 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.300
 respect me treats me like a 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.430
 little girl from the backwoods so I never 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.770
 I had problems so I thought that until the 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.330
 have problems with my fans but they 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.979
 they welcomed me in an inexplicable way 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.979
 I'm very happy with all of this. 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.520
 behind the stage the public can not imagine 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.550
 to show them a show. 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.760
 perfect part of the production of 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.860
 great shows explains the experience 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.060
 Mooka and care you have a time of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.070
 legal assembly to do and is in the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.690
 structural nec in the case is that we 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.720
 made a lot of progress and we managed to 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.850
 a very nice result everyone goes 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.820
 to like but so is now the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.890
 you have good songs, it 's a 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.440
 wonderful artist as human 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.630
 so it's now because of structural 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.540
 this assembly the staff you hire the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.450
 right people to do is very 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.080
 commitment to everything happen as the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.490
 costumes and speaking in costume hence the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.350
 another interesting detail from the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.290
 amanda's personality were created 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.870
 some looks is one that has a style that 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.360
 Well it only has two exchanges of 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.640
 but it 's cool because it 's a 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.010
 18 year old girl who has an audience 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.230
 young man too, I think so too 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.240
 from 8 to 80 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.090
 she's going to have fans who are also older 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.300
 that I and she come in with the footprint 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.850
 middle of the backland in a boot 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.480
 country a plaid shirt but with a 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.790
 So modern footprint is not that thing 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.520
 sertanejo is a new sertanejo is a 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.280
 contemporary thing presences in a 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.010
 short time to talk one 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.120
 run to change clothes and 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.780
 return to the stage 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.780
 acting 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.450
 every artist in your show does not stop quiet 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.790

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.750
