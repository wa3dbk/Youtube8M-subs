00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.820
 This fronted Holdings has entered many old churches 12 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.370
 Let's look at carnation 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.959
 It's Oita. 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.269
 I was going to laugh here 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.880
 in this way 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880
 What's up here 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.319
 The army can do 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.319
 I can not eat out 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.530
 So it's been done once more 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.410
 I'm out below 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.100
 I think Gyeongsang 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.330
 It was the one who was in the group 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.920
 in this way 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.240
 I also say about color 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.320
 Because it is only a minute anyway 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.270
 If you put a low interest rate, you can not understand the color 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.550
 I think that will be 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.970
 It returned before the war 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.940
 Though there is Kyoto 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.430
 Second place Roni 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.610
 The influence is 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.410
 This emerging color 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.840
 Cross border today is a win 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.750
 Add this and add some songs 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230
 I would like to use it 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.170
 Real-life table fields 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.490
 If bureaucrats woke up in an instant to explain that they are not good enough 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.890
 Please give me this way 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.850
 By disturbing the English 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 The same color is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.130
 It's weird Kyoto's response 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.040
 It can be said that it is sick 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.220
 It is paper power It uses 400 ml pack 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.640
 I do 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.760
 The explanation function use is about 8 minutes from 7 minutes email 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.770
 Until 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.750
 Please come in 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.320
 It is provided 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.320
 I will use this today's flower phenomenon 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.260
 There will be no effect like this 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.150
 Because it is bent 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.940
 From here 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.770
 I will do it regularly 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.240
 It was said a little bit but it seems like a certain number 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.310
 I wrote Dublin 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.600
 If it is a farm road like this 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 I think I can make old things from next month 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.529
 Today's party 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:19.229
 If you want to make this cut, don't let it go 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.739
 When 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.739
 I wanted to spread beyond the plateau 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.279
 Keep whitening stand 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.279
 I will enter the law of transnational boundaries 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.859
 I'm stuck in that department, so I'm broken 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.939
 is 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.239
 I'm sorry 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.489
 Please expand it to make you laugh as well. 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.119
 At the time of becoming an adult 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.119
 This color is coming along 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.299
 I put it like this 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.599
 As it is only music with a lot of ships at the time 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.599
 Please seal the writer's name 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.619
 As the coating agent has been strengthened 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 The color is getting thinner It looks like it can be used a little more 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.939
 I want to put another flower from my neck and threaten it once more 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.029
 I think 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:36.999
 It was bad
