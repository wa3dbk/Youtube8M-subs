00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
opinion they just kind of came out of

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.819 
opinion they just kind of came out of

the unification match you know it should
have<00:01:30.990> been<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.439> build<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.549> this

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
have been more build that you know this

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.100 
have been more build that you know this

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
kind of thing should happen at a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140 
kind of thing should happen at a
Wrestlemania<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> WWE<00:01:36.060> should

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
Wrestlemania and I think the WWE should

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.910 
Wrestlemania and I think the WWE should
have<00:01:36.299> once<00:01:36.509> again<00:01:36.750> created<00:01:37.470> entirely

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
have once again created entirely

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
have once again created entirely
different<00:01:38.549> championship<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.270> should<00:01:39.479> have

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
different championship it should have

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200 
different championship it should have
been<00:01:39.630> called<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.350> undisputed<00:01:41.280> WWE
