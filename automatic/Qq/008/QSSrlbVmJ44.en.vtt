let's say EA would do but at the same
time<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.570> little<00:02:24.780> bit<00:02:24.900> weird<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:26.190> earn

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
time it's a little bit weird so you earn

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.060 
time it's a little bit weird so you earn
in-game<00:02:26.730> gold<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.420> in-game<00:02:27.870> currency<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.680> you

in-game gold or in-game currency and you

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.740 
in-game gold or in-game currency and you

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.670 
and I think it'd be cool if you purchase
the<00:03:38.850> trophy<00:03:39.239> like<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.600> told<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.080> you

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680

purchased it you know what I mean like

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.670 
purchased it you know what I mean like
it<00:03:41.940> would<00:03:42.060> be<00:03:42.090> there'd<00:03:43.080> be<00:03:43.200> an<00:03:43.320> indicator

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
it would be there'd be an indicator

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.290 
it would be there'd be an indicator
saying<00:03:44.010> oh<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.220> didn't<00:03:44.700> earn<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:45.090> you
