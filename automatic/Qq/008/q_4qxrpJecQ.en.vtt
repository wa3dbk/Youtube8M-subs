00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.709 
theft auto four so no no dating and I
think<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.059> because<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:47.300> 2<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> characters

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
think it's because a 2 of the characters

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510 
think it's because a 2 of the characters
I<00:00:49.230> think<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> characters<00:00:50.309> are

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
I think two of the characters are

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.700 
I think two of the characters are
married<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.239> man<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
married so man that one of them is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
married so man that one of them is
obviously<00:00:53.250> married<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> other<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.180> has

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
obviously married and the other one has

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.279 
obviously married and the other one has
a<00:00:55.879> significant<00:00:56.879> other<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.420> they're<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:58.140> sure

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
a significant other and they're not sure

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.049 
a significant other and they're not sure
if<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.920> girlfriend<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.809> wife<00:01:00.980> um<00:01:02.059> so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
you know what they mean by this but they

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.220 
you know what they mean by this but they
said<00:02:12.490> it<00:02:12.580> felt<00:02:12.790> like<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> boat<00:02:13.450> like

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
controlling a boat um I think I could

controlling a boat um I think I could
kind<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.020> understand<00:02:17.500> but<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:17.920> never<00:02:18.250> really

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
kind of understand but I never really

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.000 
kind of understand but I never really
had<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.670> huge<00:02:19.000> issue<00:02:19.270> with<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.840> maybe<00:02:20.770> just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
had a huge issue with it maybe just

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
had a huge issue with it maybe just
because<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.430> was<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:21.820> used<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:23.820> they<00:02:24.820> did

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
because I was so used to it but they did

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.440 
because I was so used to it but they did
say<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.630> um<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.880> would<00:02:28.000> be<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.420> would

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
say that um that it would be it would

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.960 
say that um that it would be it would
feel<00:02:28.720> more<00:02:28.990> like<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.320> race<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.490> racing<00:02:30.760> game

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
feel more like a race like a racing game

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.880 
feel more like a race like a racing game
the<00:02:31.690> control<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.320> car<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.500> mean<00:02:32.800> it
