00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 how about friends we go with the sequence 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.649
 scientific today we're going to talk about the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.710
 influence of the stars on health in 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.120
 the environment and in the mind in this case 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.570
 the star king sends his light to the satellite 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.490
 to the moon and the moon as a satellite that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.010
 emits its light to the earth and the moon 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.090
 lacks its own light what happens when the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.090
 sun gives its light to the moon and the moon the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.040
 reflects as today that full moon of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.950
 Fears Urge a Biochemical Change 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.890
 physiological in all beings of the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.380
 but that everything is clear in the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.130
 sea the water element 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.510
 and is influenced by the ions that 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.690
 are the airplanes are the electric charge 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.490
 of the air of the ions that the moon generates 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.190
 in its fullness already originates that the 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.800
 tide rise and the tide going up 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.240
 original that the sea is to eliminate 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.390
 trash societies substances and the wave is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.580
 extend to about 30 to 40 meters then 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 many people who do not know this is 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.210
 now in the afternoon at noon or tomorrow in 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.640
 the test in the wave is lengthened or 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.720
 the shore is stretched by the tide that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.960
 It goes up from impresses the children also 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.020
 yes they know today tomorrow and past there 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.450
 full moon but it is not to scare 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.229
 but so that we have a little bit more 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 careful as to the influence on the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.000
 character above all 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 people for one who is in his rule in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.490
 your menstrual period today tomorrow in 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.690
 these days there is metrorrhagia that is more 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.590
 quantity 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.040
 from fluids that are exacerbated by blood 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.040
 the one that brings out the tooth to bleed more 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.050
 because the clotting time 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.420
 decreases that did not show us the other 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.720
 Juan ran had a great physiologist and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.150
 gynecologist does not know what's wrong with him and his 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.940
 rules are very abundant and suddenly 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.990
 is very irritated lunatic suddenly the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.570
 he is driving he wants to 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.850
 accelerate is that serotonin is 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.980
 increases in the brain by action 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.530
 of the electric charge of soil ions 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.760
 then when there is too much serotonin 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.030
 it is almost as if he climbs into his idol the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.860
 catecholamines magic of adrenaline 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.140
 if there is a biochemical imbalance in the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.880
 brain especially when people eat 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.300
 bad especially when people are missing 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.960
 of magnesium I suggest today try 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.480
 take with your juice are on magnesium 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.990
 we do not see on the screen without a 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.230
 I pack their oranges 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.900
 and in the afternoon try to lie down 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.990
 early because with 'full moon' I do not 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.960
 he's looking at the moon all night 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.460
 dawn half bloated new boot gao 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.420
 try not to drink a lot of fluids in the 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.250
 night today I really tell you 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.310
 try not to fill up because the address 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.440
 it's a little slow if you eat a better sweet potato 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.830
 the baked sweet potato instead of 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.580
 parboiled a noodles au gratin 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.850
 baked apple fret day sound and 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.000
 there is an interesting business like that 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.990
 potentializes is fullness, so when there 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.150
 full moon take advantage of the 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.570
 first to purify yourself do a little bit of 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.240
 Second diet drink lots of water with lemon 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.280
 detoxifies the ox teacher as saying 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.600
 who cares web page that appears in 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.770
 ok ok screen 30 years ago said those 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.610
 Tips problems in the name of 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.500
 christ if you meet a semicircle if 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.750
 you are just an important one and send your 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.470
 problems to the moon comes the function 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.530
 goal 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.810
 of the moon is to absorb as a 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.370
 vacuum the density of the earth that 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.710
 long ago the earth disappeared and 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.140
 negotiated for the moon the clean moon so 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.290
 how clean the sea says that all the 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.530
 density and that the master guides with their 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.090
 love the full your divine love protect 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.510
 the astronauts for their courage their 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.490
 courage yes it is good to undertake 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.850
 for how to make a project we are 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.650
 leaving the growing room full moon 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.160
 if you are going to always plant vegetables 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.980
 Cauliflower cabbage type head when 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.860
 Pass the full moon already in two days 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.960
 always root vegetables in this room 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.810
 growing that should end you have to 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.640
 have planted leafy vegetables already and here 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.130
 14 days I will explain what to do in 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.320
 a new one because the new one can 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.150
 rejuvenate the diet of the new moon 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.720
 so that it stays as new from here to 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:57.080
 two weeks but today is full moon 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.420
 As soon as you do not fill up full moon today 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.750
 send your problems to the moon today in a 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.420
 full be careful that the wave makes 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.020
 the shore extends 40 meters today nor 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.510
 ceases that the tooth I have friends who are 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.750
 buried can overcome a full health 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.380
 if it is a super emergency 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:21.750
 bleeds more the operation lasts triple 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.419
 imagine, there is more anesthesia more 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.520
 more infection information 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.139
 also thrombosis that who will be moon 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.400
 full where there are many lunatics 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:35.370
 attention with this the one that is angry and 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.650
 blood is the temperament gets more 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.560
 chronic and sanguine look at the one 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.300
 melancholic phlegmatic gets more 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.840
 phlegmatic or will be crying 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.780
 depressed as they are polarized then it continues 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.639
 that you have to be to avoid getting depressed 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.919
 take on Tuesday sun in the morning and in the 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.560
 night double dose so much is going to 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.930
 reassure the choleric and will take it 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.990
 from the expression to the melancholic as it is 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.780
 they do not polarize because because the 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.520
 magnesium is helium magnesium binding that 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.650
 helps to throw away the excess liquid by 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.240
 that's like a diuretic and it helps that 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.830
 people have better ability to 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.660
 concentration because it helps the 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.820
 neurotransmitters and when you sleep 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.160
 your nap will now produce more me the 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.530
 atony of the brain that melatonin a 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.860
 cerebral antioxidant that they need more

 greece manna sun 2 grams 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.840
 that the minimum dose there was a lot 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.909
 to improve memory then when 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.710
 you approach the trees because they have 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.469
 come here to the field, whatever the 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.950
 plants because because the plants you can 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:40.650
 put the tips bounce ions 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.990
 what is an electrical charge that the moon 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.660
 it increases the bad ions they call 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.330
 the positive ions you realize would be 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.280
 a quality without shoes on the sea do 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.230

 perfect a good massage session 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.700
 to relax and above all is that 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.240
 Your life is as healthy as you can eat

 his brown rice is now doing 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.560
 a hot drink even if it's hot 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.480
 matter is to try to freshen 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.660
 listen to a relaxing music like that of 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.660
 bach 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.590
 but baroque music can be a 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.570
 beethoven music if the two medium 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.729
 depressed for example the ninth 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.180
 great symphony the characteristic 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.180
