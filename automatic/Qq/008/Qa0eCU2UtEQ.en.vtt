00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
like most people do I feel like it gives

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.100 
like most people do I feel like it gives
you<00:01:05.260> more<00:01:05.500> leverage<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:06.900> manipulate<00:01:07.900> both

sizes<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:15.159> is<00:01:15.340> standard<00:01:15.780> calm<00:01:16.780> flow

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
sizes and this is standard calm flow

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:35.760 
sizes and this is standard calm flow
fault<00:01:17.590> on<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.920> turn

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.919 

I<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.880> through<00:01:37.149> vetting<00:01:37.420> these<00:01:37.600> type<00:01:37.899> of

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
I like through vetting these type of

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.800 
I like through vetting these type of
events<00:01:38.049> because<00:01:38.829> it's<00:01:39.100> hits<00:01:40.030> their<00:01:40.329> perceived

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
events because it's hits their perceived

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.419 
events because it's hits their perceived
a<00:01:41.020> son<00:01:41.259> named<00:01:41.439> range<00:01:41.679> so<00:01:41.979> they're<00:01:42.159> going<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.340> be

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
a son named range so they're going to be

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.550 
a son named range so they're going to be
making<00:01:42.609> moves<00:01:43.000> at<00:01:43.240> boards<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.810> we<00:01:44.020> hit<00:01:44.229> and

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
making moves at boards that we hit and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.049 
making moves at boards that we hit and
we<00:01:45.429> can<00:01:45.610> represent<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.360> high<00:01:46.509> card<00:01:46.780> board
