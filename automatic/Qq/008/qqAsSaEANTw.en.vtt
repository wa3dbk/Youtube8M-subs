00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.000
 Welcome to the exhibition stand 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.440
 the always group at the amb 2010 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.340
 Today I present you the 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.170
 vertical world machine new ct 200h the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.180
 Machine is with high power drive 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.250
 equipped the at the main donut 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.140
 and adress froe torques and 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.300
 speeds 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.370
 gears with module 4 up to one 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.710
 diameter of about 200 millimeters 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.900
 can thus be very efficiently 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.430
 eat the removal of hot chips like 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.379
 For example, with the troops 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.300
 Processing for the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.680
 vertical machine no problems 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.360
 is 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.190
 As you can see, the donation is falling 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.810
 straight down into the donation conveyor 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.730
 and will be right out of the 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.650
 Workroom challenged 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.330
 for short seasons also ensures the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.700
 always typical violent principle of 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.590
 machines the work spindle takes that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 Germany conveyor belt horses for 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 irritation high maximum increases for the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.630
 work is supported and drives in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.180
 Connection from the workroom again 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.980
 out 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.840
 this integrated automation 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.940
 concept is characterized by short paths 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 and is therefore very fast 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.820
 in the vc 200 we unite the topic 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.590
 typical vertical machine concept with 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.420
 the know how of kÃ¶ppern the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.520
 Specialists in tooth cleaning 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 The result is a worldwide machine 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.520
 the highest productivity at 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.680
 consistent quality 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.540
 here 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.880
 We also have a measuring function in the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.650
 Machine integrated on the way of the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.840
 machining position for unloading 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.270
 position will be on teeth 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.020
 using a knife 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.549
 measure 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.580
 because the probe outside the 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.560
 worker 1 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.680
 the measurement of donations remains open 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.210
 and dirt completely unaffected 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.220
 measured is thereby in the working 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.460
 tension and spanned errors are thus 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.460
 locked out
