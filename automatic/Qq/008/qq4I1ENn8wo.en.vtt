00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.040
 I thought that I did not drink 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.830
 I was not doing it because of the sauce 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.170

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.849
 listened very rich the two I have done it 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.560
 I'm very worried about Maria when 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.240
 tune-ups are very followed and very 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.860
 serious is already worrying me but in 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.580
 The two have generally looked very rich 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.979
 Marica very many thanks 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.830
 ricardo we hear you good as you 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.240
 you know is this challenge always have it 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.280
 harder the artists that have to 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.560
 change gender to another 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.419
 record sing in another style and 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.669
 really here who who had 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.490
 really the the wall that jump the abb 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.620
 I think marc knows that this song 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.190
 it's going better as we all know about 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.060
 historical to the real marking this 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.760
 but I think 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.270
 baby that you have passed the test well I think 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.460
 who have found good solutions 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.889
 thinking about how he sees the real baby 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.750
 would face the song would face the 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.330
 difficulties that this song puts you and 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.250
 I think both have gone well the challenge 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.510
 I think this is the first concert of 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.790
 I am the one in which I feel that both 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.280
 they are more amazing than solos 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.260
 when the two is the hardest part 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.330
