00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.290
 today I'm a little finger I'll tell you two of the book the pile of red 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.260
 and had the worst day of last year in Brazil by the intrinsic publisher that 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.200
 which is the first book of your life of who holds not no who 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.079
 yen 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.409
 big ones 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:18.409
 laughs 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:20.890
 I do not make this joke at home. 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 there are not many secrets 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.970
 muricy is shameful books on an industrial scale I do not know if this is good 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.010
 or bad but the fact that he never takes a vacation we can see that the time of 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.300
 space and one book and another is simple months 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.220
 but I must say that I was very impressed with this book 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.360
 mainly because he is much more organized and even more 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.650
 that the books of prisoners a work prior to the culture 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.450
 in this book we met quoted on December 6 when separating from children 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.110
 after his mother died 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 seydi was created by his after good bid while carter traveled by the world 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.180
 With his father he told his uncle yes. 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.969
 told himself everything he said 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.290
 The club in the fars dams 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.250
 all the elements of the book are based on real discoveries about 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.280
 of the executive 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 then we have the chance of the life of the marlos were trained to invoke the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.010
 power of the gods to attack him and if necessary 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.970
 This is part of the life of 16 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.960
 this mismatch we wanted one of the most powerful to exist many centuries 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.290
 about the intrinsic publisher's decision that the first one I liked quite a lot 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.090
 transition 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.910
 especially impressed by the adaptations she made to us 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.640
 can understand english puns 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 the team of six emitters also did not leave to desire to find dream in another 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.960
 of typing that does not hurt the eyes, then everything is in peace 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.740
 the layout must have followed the North American model but it is very good 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.220
 also always with the used magic appeared the corresponding bc 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.690
 and the name of the narrator in exchange every two chapters alternating between and cuts 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.010
 Desire always appears featured so no one gets lost 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.190
 this story of having assaulted him and senators 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.390
 here it is very well because it is a works as a regulator of the group then the 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.140
 people already have a story but the matter now perfect the book is not 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.080
 if you have something judged what you learn in your books you need 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.009
 less monsters and more heart but character development 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.009
 and in that he continues to fail miserably 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.319
 but I can not fail to mention that the imbalance organization may have 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.590
 It's been the best time I've done it, it's pretty cheap Everything fits and adds 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:48.319
 points 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.059
 I must also say that I loved the end of the book because that's when I realized that 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:56.099
 I had at hand a story with a middle beginning and an end at the same time as 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.989
 he made me curious to see the continuation 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.409
 ask me a lot about whether this book deserves the 3rd picture nests 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.939
 do not care much 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.339
 but be heard four by the whole of the work the outcome of it moved me 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.339
 enough for ten points or more 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.190
 Egyptian gods came to deaths 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.140
