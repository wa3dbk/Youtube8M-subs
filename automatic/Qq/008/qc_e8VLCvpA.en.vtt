00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
can see is four into the lathe this is a

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.260 
can see is four into the lathe this is a
a<00:01:30.539> cam<00:01:31.539> levered<00:01:32.170> compound<00:01:33.130> slide<00:01:33.520> lock<00:01:33.940> and

this fixes but what is in my opinion a
major<00:01:38.369> shortcoming<00:01:39.369> or<00:01:39.429> is<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.550> sort<00:01:39.789> of

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819

believe in his description of the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.920 
believe in his description of the
product<00:03:26.819> before<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.209> buy<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.390> you'll<00:03:27.660> see

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
product before you buy it you'll see

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.789 
product before you buy it you'll see
some<00:03:28.260> about<00:03:28.500> it

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
some about it

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.740 
some about it
I<00:03:28.920> did<00:03:29.579> one<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.760> do<00:03:29.940> want<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.239> say<00:03:30.390> though<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.569> I

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
I did one I do want to say though that I

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.119 
I did one I do want to say though that I
did<00:03:31.079> made<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.440> whole<00:03:31.680> thing<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.299> my<00:03:33.299> lathe<00:03:33.599> and

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
did made the whole thing on my lathe and

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.339 
did made the whole thing on my lathe and
on<00:03:35.129> my<00:03:35.489> drill<00:03:35.730> press<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.150> did<00:03:36.329> not<00:03:36.510> use<00:03:36.840> my<00:03:37.079> mill

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
on my drill press I did not use my mill

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.610 
on my drill press I did not use my mill
so<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:39.060> can<00:03:39.239> be<00:03:39.269> done<00:03:39.359> I<00:03:39.540> think<00:03:39.659> the<00:03:40.260> stock

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
so that can be done I think the stock

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.649 
so that can be done I think the stock
was<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> couple<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.430> pieces<00:03:41.609> of<00:03:41.849> aluminum<00:03:42.060> a

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
was a couple of pieces of aluminum a

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.360 
was a couple of pieces of aluminum a
couple<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.620> pieces<00:03:43.799> of<00:03:43.950> drill<00:03:44.340> rod<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:46.370> you

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
couple of pieces of drill rod and you

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.360 
couple of pieces of drill rod and you
know<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.519> couple<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.030> tap<00:03:48.659> sizes<00:03:49.349> once<00:03:50.040> again

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
know a couple of tap sizes once again

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.170 
know a couple of tap sizes once again
you<00:03:50.579> can<00:03:50.909> see<00:03:50.940> all<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.359> online<00:03:52.549> but<00:03:53.549> I'm<00:03:53.730> not

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
you can see all that online but I'm not

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.970 
you can see all that online but I'm not
a<00:03:54.209> lot<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.690> cost<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:55.079> materials<00:03:55.560> unless<00:03:55.829> you

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
a lot of cost of materials unless you

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.569 
a lot of cost of materials unless you
don't<00:03:56.130> own<00:03:56.419> the<00:03:57.419> taps<00:03:57.690> or<00:03:57.959> something<00:03:58.579> and

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
don't own the taps or something and

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.550 
don't own the taps or something and
really<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.880> great<00:04:00.180> project<00:04:00.480> for<00:04:00.930> me<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.470> was

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
really a great project for me it was

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.339 
really a great project for me it was
probably<00:04:01.739> one<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.370> more<00:04:03.349> precision

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
probably one of the more precision

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.020 
probably one of the more precision
demanding<00:04:05.040> projects<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.549> I've<00:04:05.639> had<00:04:05.849> out

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
demanding projects that I've had out

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.180 
demanding projects that I've had out
there<00:04:06.209> because<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:07.109> do<00:04:07.290> have<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.590> hold<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.980> to

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
there because you do have to hold it to

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.930 
there because you do have to hold it to
plus<00:04:08.690> zero<00:04:09.690> or<00:04:09.840> my<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.590> minus<00:04:11.010> about<00:04:11.519> one<00:04:11.819> or

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
plus zero or my and minus about one or

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.150 
plus zero or my and minus about one or
two<00:04:11.970> foul<00:04:12.419> on<00:04:13.139> some<00:04:13.319> of<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.440> dimensions<00:04:13.709> which

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
two foul on some of the dimensions which

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.580 
two foul on some of the dimensions which
can<00:04:14.459> be<00:04:14.879> tricky<00:04:15.090> for<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.540> for<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.840> new<00:04:16.139> file<00:04:16.349> like

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
can be tricky for it for a new file like

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.680 
can be tricky for it for a new file like
me<00:04:16.739> when<00:04:16.950> you're<00:04:17.039> holding<00:04:17.669> that<00:04:17.700> tolerance<00:04:18.449> on

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
me when you're holding that tolerance on

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.790 
me when you're holding that tolerance on
both<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.729> lacrosse<00:04:20.729> angle<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.449> the<00:04:21.660> depth<00:04:22.650> of

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
both the lacrosse angle and the depth of

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.310 
both the lacrosse angle and the depth of
the<00:04:22.919> part<00:04:23.479> but<00:04:24.479> I<00:04:24.510> finish<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.020> other<00:04:25.169> night

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
the part but I finish it the other night

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.140 
the part but I finish it the other night
and<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.620> worked<00:04:25.830> great<00:04:26.099> so<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.760> not<00:04:26.849> further

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
and it worked great so it's not further

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.810 
and it worked great so it's not further

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
like it is even though it's technical

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.560 
like it is even though it's technical
and<00:05:32.290> a<00:05:32.320> little<00:05:32.530> bit<00:05:32.650> complicated<00:05:33.390> there<00:05:34.390> are<00:05:34.540> a

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
and a little bit complicated there are a

and a little bit complicated there are a

lot of parts to be made where you know

lot of parts to be made where you know
if<00:05:37.780> you<00:05:37.900> screw<00:05:38.230> up<00:05:38.290> one<00:05:38.500> thing<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:38.950> don't<00:05:39.070> have

a you know dozens of hours in one part

a you know dozens of hours in one part
so<00:05:41.920> you<00:05:42.130> can<00:05:42.580> kind<00:05:42.790> of<00:05:42.820> break<00:05:43.030> it<00:05:43.240> out<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.570> take

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
so you can kind of break it out and take

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.420 
so you can kind of break it out and take
your<00:05:43.720> time<00:05:44.020> I<00:05:44.080> took<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.470> couple<00:05:44.650> of<00:05:44.860> weeks<00:05:45.100> just

your time I took a couple of weeks just
working<00:05:45.760> nights<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.270> make<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:47.100> but<00:05:48.100> I<00:05:48.190> don't

it set up now here for single-point
threading<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:59.320> then<00:05:59.710> if<00:05:59.800> I<00:05:59.860> want<00:06:00.040> to<00:06:00.100> move<00:06:00.220> it

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
threading and then if I want to move it

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.920 
threading and then if I want to move it
to<00:06:00.340> sixty<00:06:00.760> degrees<00:06:01.090> which<00:06:01.270> will<00:06:01.420> allows<00:06:01.600> me<00:06:01.780> to

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
to sixty degrees which will allows me to

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.190 
to sixty degrees which will allows me to
use<00:06:02.140> simple<00:06:03.690> trigonometry<00:06:04.690> to<00:06:04.840> move<00:06:05.140> my

on<00:06:17.530> your<00:06:17.770> depth<00:06:18.040> so<00:06:18.970> that's<00:06:19.150> it

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
on your depth so that's it

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.080 
on your depth so that's it
