creature<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.620> stripped<00:02:13.190> out<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.459> color<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.650> I

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
creature I stripped out the color and I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.509 
creature I stripped out the color and I
found<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.980> match

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
found a match

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.970 
found a match
I<00:02:16.550> think<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.150> isn't<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.540> match<00:02:17.980> those

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
I think that isn't that a match those

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.759 
I think that isn't that a match those
canines<00:02:19.430> match<00:02:19.730> almost<00:02:20.060> perfectly<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:21.620> might

canines match almost perfectly you might

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.920 
canines match almost perfectly you might
be<00:02:21.890> asking<00:02:22.280> what's<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.150> match<00:02:23.360> from<00:02:23.600> what<00:02:23.840> did

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
be asking what's the match from what did

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.680 
be asking what's the match from what did

all<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.500> criteria<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:40.280> we<00:02:40.459> need<00:02:40.640> here<00:02:41.739> say

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
all the criteria that we need here say

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.400 
all the criteria that we need here say
how<00:02:42.799> about<00:02:42.860> lined<00:02:43.540> where<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.690> skull<00:02:44.989> would<00:02:45.200> be

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
how about lined where the skull would be

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.819 
how about lined where the skull would be
the<00:02:45.709> head<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.870> then<00:02:47.870> I've<00:02:47.989> superimposed<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
the head and then I've superimposed the

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.979 
the head and then I've superimposed the
skull<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.970> can<00:02:50.150> see<00:02:50.269> it's<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> pretty<00:02:50.660> darn

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
skull you can see it's a pretty darn

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.920 
skull you can see it's a pretty darn
close<00:02:51.320> fit<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:52.390> teeth<00:02:53.620> match<00:02:54.620> exactly<00:02:55.930> the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
close fit the teeth match exactly the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.069 
close fit the teeth match exactly the
canines<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.920> we<00:02:58.430> have<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.790> paws<00:02:59.209> which<00:02:59.810> are

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
canines and we have the paws which are

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.220 
canines and we have the paws which are
consistent<00:03:00.739> and<00:03:01.540> it's<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.690> small<00:03:02.959> animal

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
consistent and it's a small animal

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.259 
consistent and it's a small animal
apparently<00:03:03.950> unless<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.609> guy's<00:03:04.790> dog<00:03:05.030> is

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
apparently unless the guy's dog is

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.990 
apparently unless the guy's dog is
gigantic<00:03:05.739> so<00:03:06.739> what<00:03:06.829> do<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:06.980> think<00:03:07.160> European

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
gigantic so what do you think European

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.590 
gigantic so what do you think European
badger<00:03:08.209> maybe<00:03:09.310> possibly<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:11.120> hare<00:03:11.329> even

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
badger maybe possibly the hare even

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.370 
badger maybe possibly the hare even
matches<00:03:11.989> up<00:03:13.480> there's<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.600> little<00:03:14.720> bit<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.049> hair

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
matches up there's a little bit of hair

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.120 
matches up there's a little bit of hair
left<00:03:15.859> there<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:18.380> what<00:03:18.470> do<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.590> guys<00:03:18.709> think<00:03:18.769> do

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
left there so what do you guys think do

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.800 
left there so what do you guys think do
you<00:03:19.160> think<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:19.549> is<00:03:19.730> some<00:03:19.940> unknown<00:03:20.150> critter

you think this is some unknown critter
or<00:03:20.900> do<00:03:21.109> you<00:03:21.200> think<00:03:21.230> maybe<00:03:22.420> possibly<00:03:23.420> because

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
or do you think maybe possibly because

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.880 
or do you think maybe possibly because
we<00:03:24.170> know<00:03:24.370> they're<00:03:25.370> badgers<00:03:25.880> we<00:03:26.150> know<00:03:26.299> they<00:03:26.420> die

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
we know they're badgers we know they die
