and looking at their influences so we'll

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.580 
and looking at their influences so we'll
be<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.940> back<00:00:33.270> into<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> past<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.290> seeing

how some of these things started and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.020 
how some of these things started and
then<00:00:36.989> we're<00:00:37.440> further<00:00:37.739> modified<00:00:38.370> by<00:00:38.610> artists

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
then we're further modified by artists

record for Chess Records something

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.440 
record for Chess Records something
unusual<00:01:32.430> happened<00:01:32.850> there<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.060> those

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
unusual happened there on those

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.060 
unusual happened there on those
recordings<00:01:34.080> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> sense<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.680> he<00:01:34.920> was

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
recordings in the sense that he was

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.530 
recordings in the sense that he was
working<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.490> musicians<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.450> were

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
working with musicians that were

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.510 
working with musicians that were
primarily<00:01:36.750> involved<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.650> blues<00:01:37.890> playing<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
primarily involved in blues playing and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.020 
primarily involved in blues playing and
so<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:40.200> shuffle<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.920> those<00:01:41.370> recordings

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
so they shuffle on those recordings

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330 
so they shuffle on those recordings
whereas<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.020> guitar<00:01:43.320> parts<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:43.830> played<00:01:44.070> more

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
whereas the guitar parts are played more

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.790 
whereas the guitar parts are played more
or<00:01:44.430> less<00:01:44.580> straight<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.780> let<00:01:45.930> me<00:01:46.020> demonstrate

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
or less straight so let me demonstrate

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.590 
or less straight so let me demonstrate
the<00:01:47.250> difference<00:01:47.610> between<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.150> two<00:01:48.330> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the difference between the two a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.690 
the difference between the two a
straight<00:01:49.020> feel<00:01:49.259> would<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.650> like<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.369> with

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
straight feel would be like so with

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.430 
straight feel would be like so with
eighth<00:01:50.850> notes<00:01:53.390> whereas<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> shuffle<00:01:54.930> feel<00:01:55.170> is

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
eighth notes whereas a shuffle feel is

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.840 
eighth notes whereas a shuffle feel is
like<00:01:55.800> as<00:01:56.100> follows

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.390 

so<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.660> rhythm<00:02:00.960> example<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.740> we're<00:02:02.130> hearing

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
so in a rhythm example one we're hearing

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.130 
so in a rhythm example one we're hearing
it<00:02:02.580> played<00:02:02.790> straight<00:02:03.180> against<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.900> rhythm

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it played straight against the rhythm

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.740 
it played straight against the rhythm
track<00:02:04.440> while<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.979> shuffle<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:06.060> may<00:02:06.300> sound<00:02:06.600> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
track while they shuffle it may sound a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749 
track while they shuffle it may sound a
little<00:02:06.780> incomplete<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:07.860> when<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.160> solos<00:02:08.580> are

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
little incomplete but when the solos are

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
little incomplete but when the solos are
brought<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.149> afterwards<00:02:09.630> on<00:02:09.959> top<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.590> I

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
brought in afterwards on top of it I

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.680 
brought in afterwards on top of it I
think<00:02:10.770> you'll<00:02:11.100> hear<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.400> JAL<00:02:14.390> okay<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.570> we<00:02:15.660> go

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
think you'll hear at JAL okay here we go

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.150 
think you'll hear at JAL okay here we go
with<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:15.989> rhythm<00:02:16.170> part<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.739> fingering

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
with the rhythm part and the fingering

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.180 
with the rhythm part and the fingering

hear a note that we don't want and
that's<00:03:23.350> going<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.650> conclude<00:03:24.209> those<00:03:25.209> sixes<00:03:25.720> by

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
that's going to conclude those sixes by

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.590 
that's going to conclude those sixes by
going<00:03:26.200> down<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.920> 2nd<00:03:27.340> fret<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:28.209> second<00:03:28.510> or

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
going down to the 2nd fret the second or

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.710 
going down to the 2nd fret the second or
fourth<00:03:28.840> frets<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.920> from<00:03:30.760> there<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.270> short

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
fourth frets and from there a short

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.430 
fourth frets and from there a short
figure<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.850> take<00:03:34.030> us<00:03:34.180> back<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.810> 5<00:03:35.050> chord

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
figure to take us back to the 5 chord

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.840 
figure to take us back to the 5 chord
which<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.890> way<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.160> chord<00:03:36.400> progression

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
which is the way the chord progression

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.880 
which is the way the chord progression
is<00:03:36.940> working<00:03:37.269> at<00:03:37.390> this<00:03:37.510> point<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.470> I'll<00:03:38.650> run

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
is working at this point so I'll run

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:50.550 
is working at this point so I'll run
that<00:03:39.100> from<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.760> 5<00:03:40.300> chord<00:03:40.630> for<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:49.530> there<00:03:50.530> you

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
that from the 5 chord for you there you

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.769 
that from the 5 chord for you there you
go
