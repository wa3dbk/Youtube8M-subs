00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:03.680 
okay here is the veldt meister a cot ad

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.010 
okay here is the veldt meister a cot ad
this<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:05.160> very<00:00:05.700> similar<00:00:06.000> model<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.720> akan

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
this is very similar model to the akan

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.459 
this is very similar model to the akan
72<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.240> actually<00:00:09.240> about<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.630> same<00:00:09.780> size<00:00:10.050> as

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
72 and actually about the same size as

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.830 
72 and actually about the same size as
the<00:00:10.620> opal<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:12.090> difference<00:00:12.420> between<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
the opal the difference between the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.460 
the opal the difference between the
models<00:00:13.759> the<00:00:14.759> other<00:00:14.880> cot<00:00:15.210> also<00:00:15.599> has<00:00:15.780> 34<00:00:16.230> keys

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
models the other cot also has 34 keys

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.330 
models the other cot also has 34 keys
and<00:00:16.859> five<00:00:17.039> switches<00:00:17.810> but<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.859> one

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and five switches but on this one

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.960 
and five switches but on this one
there's<00:00:20.670> 80<00:00:21.150> buttons<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.350> 16<00:00:22.859> by<00:00:23.160> 5<00:00:23.490> so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
there's 80 buttons and it's 16 by 5 so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.320 
there's 80 buttons and it's 16 by 5 so
if<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.150> notice<00:00:24.480> there's<00:00:25.410> no<00:00:25.560> diminished<00:00:26.039> row

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
if you notice there's no diminished row

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.189 
if you notice there's no diminished row
but<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.510> has<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.050> same<00:00:28.289> range<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.519> notes<00:00:29.869> 16<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
but it has the same range of notes 16 of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.920 
but it has the same range of notes 16 of
them<00:00:33.320> has<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> 96<00:00:35.040> piece<00:00:35.280> similar<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> 96<00:00:36.750> bass

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
them has a 96 piece similar to a 96 bass

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.840 
them has a 96 piece similar to a 96 bass
without<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.380> diminished<00:00:37.890> row<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:39.559> comparing

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
without a diminished row and comparing

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.490 
without a diminished row and comparing
the<00:00:41.850> three<00:00:42.120> models<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.020> this

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the three models that are kind of this

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.790 
the three models that are kind of this
size<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.370> opal<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.899> tua<00:00:46.079> cots<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
size the the opal and the tua cots the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.600 
size the the opal and the tua cots the
opal<00:00:47.160> has<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> little<00:00:47.670> smaller<00:00:47.940> Keys<00:00:49.489> 37<00:00:50.489> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
opal has a little smaller Keys 37 of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.920 
opal has a little smaller Keys 37 of
them<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.030> basically<00:00:51.360> they're<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.750> bit

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
them so basically they're a little bit

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.439 
them so basically they're a little bit
closer<00:00:52.199> together<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:52.949> shorter<00:00:53.460> this

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
closer together in a little shorter this

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.680 
closer together in a little shorter this
one<00:00:54.660> has<00:00:55.230> has<00:00:55.739> has<00:00:56.129> pretty<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:57.360> know<00:00:57.390> pretty

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
one has has has pretty you know pretty

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.020

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
little longer so overall a really nice

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.899 
little longer so overall a really nice
kind<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.409> intermediate<00:01:07.920> advanced<00:01:08.400> accordion

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
kind of intermediate advanced accordion

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.000 
kind of intermediate advanced accordion
