00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.090
 I have my four-year card 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.040
 the year director 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.180
 that different though 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.960
 can get 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.790
 makes the year with this switch to motorsport 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.490
 are you going to be champion this year 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.790
 it becomes very difficult to go eric in December when the women were driving 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.430
 see 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.220
 teams that go and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.070
 a German side 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.189
 and yes i have 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.000
 if you fall every 20 and 40 years it should be possible but it is 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:31.440
 very difficult 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.330
 what will this year bring 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.500
 what could you say i still have a lot to learn 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.540
 yes I want to learn as much as possible this year than next year for the title 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.790
 for you 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.870
 during the first training the competition could learn something from the men 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.890
 bleach mill and van bavel as the trainer after the first and second time 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.860
 jeroen bleach mill on the open sea are also teammates tom van babel 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.830
 please note we do not believe among others 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.720
 minsk anp a striking that would start in 28th place during the 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.250
 first match 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.490
 almost all cars uses hope to engine we are on the four laps 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.869
 must hear wasps honda rider was alexander wall in twelfth place 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.879
 during the second training, bleach mill entered because of a 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.629
 Broken battery thought they had nothing to do with it 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.540
 Unfortunately he finished in 20th place Alexander Wall trains to 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.909
 proportions and 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.649
 barry drought on one 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.909
 many people chose the slicks 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.959
 and we did, but in the end it turned out to be just a bit faster 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.189
 only we have no research at all we know of resigning others 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.649
 also done 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:40.389
 by values ​​has saved far too long and that is just a great pity 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.819
 the standard in which 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.119
 you can say that 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.119
 actually the experience is the fact that thinking 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.729
 so very annoying that i minutes 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.799
 and tires was there for quite a while 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.799
 I was almost certain it was going to be trusting 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.219
 an international group to the attic circuit in the 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.789
 was too strong for the Dutch jeroen bleach mill 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.909
 and what about djordje also pantano that Italians look one in part 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.499
 drive and all of the aforementioned the German who has been in for ten years 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:11.690
 formula 3 is driving 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.599
 the start is always difficult in a formula 3 car 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.560
 but you ron pale mill but this time no mistake and just grab the 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.919
 none of the first thousands of 3 championship competitions lead 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.029
 very first Formula 3 race because he made his debut during last year 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:28.409
 manned masters 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.870
 jeroen pale mill and must defend 21 under this position something you find difficult 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.969
 first because he is under medication because of a very heavy one 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:37.159
 sore throat 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.159
 pantano on the outside the yellow de lada alcohol a daring action a whole 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.560
 nice action jeroen bleach mill back to the second place 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:52.219
 khamis team that also does well for pantano small there 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:54.590
 on the website of the economy 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.819
 falls back to third place an animal at Mr. pin all the way on it 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.590
 circuit it seems as if bleach mill is going out a little bit weekend 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.140
 there must also be third place 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.460
 pass by who is for andré lotterer now the two into the German 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.560
 the fourth Stefan Mücke 3 behind the Joop Pantano type is still the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.590
 leader looks at a fourth place for bleach mill and 15 for 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.340
 his teammate Tom van Bavo from Formula Ford into Formula 3 and that is 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.340
 yet a very deserving debut for the young pellatz 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.680
 back there again alexander muller once drove formula 3000 wall again 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.770
 back in formula 3 but it is yoshio pantano who wins the first race 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.070
 suburbs of books andre lotterer and bleach mill in fourth place 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.370
 Mike's last lands let his engine stall during the start for the race on 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.090
 Sunday 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.900
 christian henry lime 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.160
 that has shell feel all there in time 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.740
 who pits the bike over the pit wall 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.199
 even one of the van amersfoort technicians 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.580
 gets hurt 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.130
 soon after the start was watching so you see the danger of being without any 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.020
 very small corner 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.530
 the Dutchman a Belgian of bavel and bleach mill and free back they started 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.510
 were on the rise, which became the last reason men seemed to be off the track 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.930
 driven by other participants and had to stop the fight 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.419
 that also shares the pantano via shorts that took the lead for a while 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.330
 but finally second behind all distances became muller but before ellen 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.170
 van dijk in huis, who achieved his best result and his family three career 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.240
 took out 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.240
 if you have to start so far in the back you cannot expect much 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:30.379
 the teacher of almost impossible and we noticed that was real 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.699
 very difficult 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.979
 and this shows, among other things, by grace both sitting and thereby one 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.680
 good thing it was a pity
