00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
team-building the experience for us just

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.989 
team-building the experience for us just
sounded<00:01:14.409> like<00:01:14.439> something<00:01:14.829> I've<00:01:15.640> never<00:01:15.850> done

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:15.999 
sounded like something I've never done

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:18.330 
sounded like something I've never done
before<00:01:16.149> it<00:01:16.840> was<00:01:17.109> something<00:01:17.649> exciting

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
before it was something exciting

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.010 
before it was something exciting
something<00:01:18.759> that<00:01:19.090> this<00:01:19.299> firm<00:01:19.600> had<00:01:19.840> never

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
something that this firm had never

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.690 
something that this firm had never
really<00:01:20.350> done<00:01:20.530> before<00:01:20.679> and<00:01:21.219> I<00:01:21.429> thought<00:01:21.609> it

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
really done before and I thought it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.219 
really done before and I thought it
would<00:01:21.789> be<00:01:21.880> cool<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.060> be<00:01:22.210> part<00:01:22.329> of<00:01:22.780> that<00:01:22.899> first

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
would be cool to be part of that first

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.770 
would be cool to be part of that first
group<00:01:23.619> fundraising<00:01:24.609> actually<00:01:25.270> was<00:01:25.600> much

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
group fundraising actually was much

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.389 
group fundraising actually was much
easier<00:01:25.840> than<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.469> thought<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.740> would<00:01:26.799> be<00:01:27.009> and

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
easier than I thought it would be and

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.760 
easier than I thought it would be and
for<00:01:27.670> me<00:01:27.819> not<00:01:28.329> really<00:01:28.659> having<00:01:28.990> done<00:01:29.409> something

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
for me not really having done something

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.010 
for me not really having done something
like<00:01:29.799> that<00:01:29.920> before<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.880> was<00:01:31.210> really<00:01:31.659> surprised

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
like that before I was really surprised

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.559 
like that before I was really surprised
at<00:01:32.170> how<00:01:32.340> quickly<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.759> buttons<00:01:34.060> came<00:01:34.329> in

at how quickly the buttons came in

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.379 
at how quickly the buttons came in
