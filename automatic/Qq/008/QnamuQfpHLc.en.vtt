a brush I could live without the brush
but<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.400> mean<00:02:41.639> even<00:02:42.329> like<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.230> would<00:02:43.409> be<00:02:43.439> nice<00:02:43.709> if

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
but I mean even like it would be nice if

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.869 
but I mean even like it would be nice if
she<00:02:43.980> came<00:02:44.099> with<00:02:44.189> a<00:02:44.250> stand<00:02:44.549> because<00:02:44.639> she

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
she came with a stand because she

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.309 
she came with a stand because she
doesn't<00:02:45.060> always<00:02:45.450> want<00:02:45.659> to<00:02:45.750> ride<00:02:45.870> her<00:02:46.109> horse

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
doesn't always want to ride her horse

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.159 
doesn't always want to ride her horse
and<00:02:46.849> then<00:02:47.849> over<00:02:48.329> here<00:02:49.310> it's<00:02:50.310> an<00:02:51.019> pardon<00:02:52.019> my

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
and then over here it's an pardon my

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.240 
and then over here it's an pardon my
language<00:02:52.349> but<00:02:52.560> it's<00:02:52.769> probably<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.189> be

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
language but it's probably going to be

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.179 
language but it's probably going to be
terribly<00:02:53.639> wrong<00:02:53.909> I'll<00:02:54.150> say<00:02:54.329> this<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:54.659> it's

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:55.189 
terribly wrong I'll say this but it's

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.360 
terribly wrong I'll say this but it's
