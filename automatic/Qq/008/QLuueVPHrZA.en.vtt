00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:20.419
 ai staff finally arrived as the 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.880
 awaited sticker that I ordered before 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:30.680
 carnival 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:34.090
 today is April 15, 2014 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.090
 I asked 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.770
 at the beginning of May 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.589
 the carnival will happen a lot of 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:54.519
 trouble but finally arrived 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:54.519
 however this sticker does not have 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:23.549
 I came back here to get a glue 31 and do 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.329
 a control here for something motorcycle column 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.329
 like this 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.750
 good if you want I have to 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.810
 Think of a way to sell to you. 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.190
 with the possibility of being delivered with 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.050
 another 30 days 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.680
 I do not have to change for sure I had 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.470
 very no problem but it was the only place that 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.560
 I managed to find that I'm buying. 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:07.220
 with my company and will pass on to 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:09.709
 You and I have to see the way 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.650
 payment because I pay for later 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.860
 receive from you as soon as the merchandise 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.840
 it will not be possible that I am without 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.959
 capital 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:30.380
 So we'll negotiate this from there. 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:31.310
 I'll be selling there twenty-one 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.570

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.570
 I think it's in good price 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.000
 if you have interest we will 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.110
 talking still, right? 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.110
 It's the way it is, that's it.
