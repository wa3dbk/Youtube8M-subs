00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
can't be 3 4 12 so that's what's going

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.699 
can't be 3 4 12 so that's what's going
to<00:02:00.880> happen<00:02:01.240> let's<00:02:01.810> jump<00:02:02.079> into<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.349> new<00:02:02.469> game

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
to happen let's jump into a new game

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.859 
to happen let's jump into a new game
with<00:02:03.219> these<00:02:03.399> rules<00:02:03.700> they're<00:02:04.179> not<00:02:04.329> new<00:02:04.569> rules

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
and 32 is a decent result i was a little

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.980 
and 32 is a decent result i was a little
bit<00:04:21.760> worth<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.150> was<00:04:22.270> going<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.540> bring<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.810> back

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
bit worth it was going to bring it back

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.080 
bit worth it was going to bring it back
but<00:04:23.530> we<00:04:23.950> managed<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.250> hold<00:04:24.460> off<00:04:24.669> until<00:04:24.880> the

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
really good now i have done a little bit

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.499 
really good now i have done a little bit
of<00:04:29.319> shuffling<00:04:29.800> put<00:04:30.340> kan<00:04:30.580> jian<00:04:30.789> as<00:04:31.030> i<00:04:31.060> sent

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
of shuffling put kan jian as i sent

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.020 
of shuffling put kan jian as i sent
aboard<00:04:31.690> who<00:04:32.229> has<00:04:32.410> swapped<00:04:32.710> with<00:04:33.069> SI<00:04:33.550> SE<00:04:33.789> and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
aboard who has swapped with SI SE and

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.149 
aboard who has swapped with SI SE and
then<00:04:34.509> i've<00:04:34.690> moved<00:04:34.960> our<00:04:35.259> italian<00:04:35.830> left<00:04:36.009> back

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
then i've moved our italian left back

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.490 
then i've moved our italian left back
into<00:04:36.849> a<00:04:36.879> more<00:04:37.270> defensive<00:04:37.810> position<00:04:38.289> so<00:04:38.470> he

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
into a more defensive position so he

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.740 
into a more defensive position so he
should<00:04:38.800> help<00:04:39.009> out<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.370> fair<00:04:39.879> bit<00:04:40.120> down<00:04:40.720> the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
should help out a fair bit down the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.210 
should help out a fair bit down the
wings<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.229> things<00:04:41.650> like<00:04:41.889> that<00:04:41.949> which<00:04:42.190> is

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
wings and things like that which is

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.399 
wings and things like that which is
really<00:04:42.610> really<00:04:42.759> good<00:04:43.000> I've<00:04:43.270> then<00:04:43.750> picked<00:04:44.080> up<00:04:44.259> a

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
really really good I've then picked up a

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.950 
really really good I've then picked up a
league<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:45.190> link<00:04:46.000> which<00:04:46.300> is<00:04:46.330> really<00:04:46.659> good<00:04:46.810> our

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
league to link which is really good our

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.529 
league to link which is really good our
first<00:04:47.229> centre-back<00:04:48.069> Dembele<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.639> button<00:04:49.419> for

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
first centre-back Dembele a button for

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.629 
first centre-back Dembele a button for
550<00:04:50.259> coins<00:04:50.500> whilst<00:04:51.190> it<00:04:51.310> doesn't<00:04:51.520> have<00:04:51.610> the

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
550 coins whilst it doesn't have the

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.499 
550 coins whilst it doesn't have the
best<00:04:51.909> at<00:04:52.210> 68<00:04:53.050> pace<00:04:53.340> 66<00:04:54.340> defending<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:54.909> 62

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
best at 68 pace 66 defending and 62

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.480 
best at 68 pace 66 defending and 62
heading<00:04:55.810> he<00:04:56.319> seems<00:04:56.620> quite<00:04:56.800> decent<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:57.430> I

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
heading he seems quite decent and I

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.070 
heading he seems quite decent and I
reckon<00:04:57.849> he<00:04:57.970> can<00:04:58.120> do<00:04:58.240> better<00:04:58.419> than<00:04:58.539> those<00:04:58.810> stats

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
reckon he can do better than those stats

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.320 
reckon he can do better than those stats
so<00:04:59.530> that<00:04:59.650> means<00:04:59.830> our<00:05:00.009> goalkeeper<00:05:00.340> now<00:05:01.060> has

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
so that means our goalkeeper now has

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.180 
so that means our goalkeeper now has
nine<00:05:01.509> chemistry<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.500> when<00:05:02.650> I<00:05:02.680> start<00:05:02.979> to<00:05:03.069> build

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
nine chemistry and when I start to build

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.339 
nine chemistry and when I start to build
up<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.370> defense<00:05:03.759> a<00:05:03.849> bit<00:05:04.000> more<00:05:04.150> our<00:05:04.599> centre

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
up the defense a bit more our centre

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.170 
up the defense a bit more our centre
backs<00:05:05.560> will<00:05:05.740> also<00:05:06.159> have<00:05:06.400> no<00:05:06.610> chemistry<00:05:06.880> this

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
backs will also have no chemistry this

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.879 
backs will also have no chemistry this
is<00:05:07.300> going<00:05:07.569> well<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:08.319> I<00:05:08.349> hope<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:08.710> did<00:05:08.860> enjoy

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
is going well so I hope you did enjoy
