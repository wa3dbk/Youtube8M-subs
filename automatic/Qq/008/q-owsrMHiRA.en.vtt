little<00:05:03.380> screwdriver<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:04.040> paperclip<00:05:04.730> and<00:05:05.030> just

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
little screwdriver a paperclip and just

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.330 
little screwdriver a paperclip and just
pull<00:05:05.420> it<00:05:05.480> out<00:05:05.540> just<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.930> tad<00:05:06.140> bit<00:05:09.220> then<00:05:10.220> when

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
pull it out just a tad bit then when

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.920 
pull it out just a tad bit then when
you're<00:05:10.490> done<00:05:10.670> with<00:05:10.910> that<00:05:10.940> look<00:05:11.360> at<00:05:11.510> both<00:05:11.720> of

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
you're done with that look at both of

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.690 
you're done with that look at both of
them<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.170> make<00:05:12.290> sure<00:05:12.350> that<00:05:12.740> they're<00:05:12.980> right<00:05:13.430> in

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
them to make sure that they're right in

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.960 
them to make sure that they're right in
the<00:05:13.910> center<00:05:15.070> you'll<00:05:16.070> see<00:05:16.160> there<00:05:16.730> are<00:05:16.820> two

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
the center you'll see there are two

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.000 
the center you'll see there are two
little<00:05:17.150> openings<00:05:17.690> at<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:17.930> bottom<00:05:18.410> and<00:05:18.680> then

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
little openings at the bottom and then

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.370 
little openings at the bottom and then
there's<00:05:19.190> a<00:05:19.310> little<00:05:19.460> opening<00:05:19.970> at<00:05:20.150> the<00:05:20.180> top<00:05:20.380> of

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
there's a little opening at the top of

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.030 
there's a little opening at the top of
each<00:05:21.680> of<00:05:22.040> those<00:05:22.460> larger<00:05:23.060> openings<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:24.040> it's

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
each of those larger openings and it's

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.909 
each of those larger openings and it's
right<00:05:25.250> that<00:05:25.490> smaller<00:05:25.880> little<00:05:26.330> opening<00:05:26.919> that

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
right that smaller little opening that

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.340 
right that smaller little opening that
is<00:05:28.250> where<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.910> wire<00:05:29.120> needs<00:05:29.450> to<00:05:29.720> be<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:30.110> needs

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
is where the wire needs to be it needs

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:43.589 
is where the wire needs to be it needs
to<00:05:30.440> be<00:05:30.530> sticking<00:05:30.919> out<00:05:31.100> a<00:05:31.130> little<00:05:31.280> bit

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.549 

once<00:05:44.259> you've<00:05:44.469> realigned<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.219> two<00:05:45.429> wires<00:05:46.559> the

00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:47.559 
once you've realigned the two wires the

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:53.429 
once you've realigned the two wires the
next<00:05:47.889> thing<00:05:48.039> to<00:05:48.159> do<00:05:48.369> is<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:49.330> put<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:53.169> motor

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:53.439 
next thing to do is to put the motor

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:57.299 
next thing to do is to put the motor
back<00:05:53.860> in<00:05:54.039> your<00:05:54.939> motor<00:05:55.919> but<00:05:56.919> I<00:05:56.949> want<00:05:57.129> to<00:05:57.219> draw

00:05:57.299 --> 00:05:57.309 
back in your motor but I want to draw

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:06.079 
back in your motor but I want to draw
your<00:05:57.520> attention<00:05:57.580> to<00:05:58.379> is<00:05:59.379> those<00:05:59.619> two<00:05:59.770> plates<00:06:00.189> I

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.149 

see<00:06:07.089> the<00:06:07.209> two<00:06:07.360> little<00:06:07.569> plates<00:06:07.899> have<00:06:08.800> a<00:06:08.830> little

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
see the two little plates have a little

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.429 
see the two little plates have a little
covering<00:06:09.580> that<00:06:09.699> goes<00:06:09.909> around<00:06:10.319> on<00:06:11.319> the

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
covering that goes around on the

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.989 
covering that goes around on the
left-hand<00:06:11.830> side<00:06:11.949> you<00:06:12.279> see<00:06:12.459> it<00:06:12.520> comes<00:06:12.729> from<00:06:12.879> the

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:12.999 
left-hand side you see it comes from the

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.149 
left-hand side you see it comes from the
left<00:06:13.240> and<00:06:13.719> goes<00:06:13.929> down<00:06:14.080> one<00:06:14.379> plate<00:06:14.709> and<00:06:15.009> goes

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
left and goes down one plate and goes

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.820 
left and goes down one plate and goes
over<00:06:15.839> back<00:06:16.839> up<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:17.349> goes<00:06:17.469> over<00:06:17.649> the

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
over back up and goes over the

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.889 
over back up and goes over the
right-hand<00:06:18.279> plate<00:06:19.439> those<00:06:20.999> actually<00:06:21.999> line<00:06:22.509> up

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:22.899 
right-hand plate those actually line up

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:26.309 
right-hand plate those actually line up
to<00:06:23.349> allow<00:06:23.559> you<00:06:23.619> to<00:06:24.009> slide<00:06:24.399> this<00:06:25.319> motor

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
to allow you to slide this motor

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.999 
to allow you to slide this motor
compartment<00:06:26.680> down<00:06:27.189> and<00:06:27.939> back<00:06:28.809> into<00:06:29.110> the<00:06:29.649> body

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
compartment down and back into the body

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.879 
compartment down and back into the body
of<00:06:30.459> yours<00:06:30.699> isn't<00:06:30.879> that<00:06:31.499> so<00:06:32.499> that's<00:06:32.649> what<00:06:32.800> we

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
of yours isn't that so that's what we

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:46.709 
of yours isn't that so that's what we
will<00:06:33.099> do<00:06:33.189> now<00:06:44.309> then<00:06:45.309> the<00:06:45.490> final<00:06:45.819> thing<00:06:46.059> is<00:06:46.269> to

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:46.719 
will do now then the final thing is to

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:55.019 
will do now then the final thing is to
simply<00:06:47.050> screw<00:06:47.439> the<00:06:52.469> bottom<00:06:53.469> let<00:06:53.619> go<00:06:54.029> and

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:55.029 
simply screw the bottom let go and

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:58.009 
simply screw the bottom let go and
you're<00:06:55.240> done

00:06:58.009 --> 00:06:58.019 

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:00.299 

so<00:06:59.019> I<00:06:59.050> hope<00:06:59.229> this<00:06:59.349> little<00:06:59.499> homemade<00:06:59.949> video

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:00.309 
so I hope this little homemade video

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:02.489 
so I hope this little homemade video
helps<00:07:00.669> you<00:07:00.819> put<00:07:01.029> your<00:07:01.209> visit<00:07:01.659> that<00:07:01.869> back<00:07:02.169> into

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:02.499 
helps you put your visit that back into

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.959 
helps you put your visit that back into
action<00:07:02.759> so<00:07:03.759> the<00:07:03.909> steps<00:07:04.180> briefly<00:07:04.629> are<00:07:04.899> again

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:05.969
