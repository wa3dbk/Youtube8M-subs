00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.149 
backlinks and there's the search for
backlinks<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.790> backlinks<00:01:48.390> are<00:01:49.040> websites<00:01:50.040> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
backlinks so backlinks are websites that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.969 
backlinks so backlinks are websites that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
search engines use that to determine how

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.539
