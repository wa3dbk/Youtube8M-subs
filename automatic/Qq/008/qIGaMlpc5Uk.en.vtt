00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.790 
you want to wait 20 minutes to 30
minutes<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.550> get<00:01:34.509> it<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.080> give<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.410> briquettes

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
minutes to get it to give the briquettes

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.260 
minutes to get it to give the briquettes
time<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.220> become<00:01:36.490> greyish

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.580 

it's<00:01:42.270> been<00:01:42.420> about<00:01:42.539> twenty<00:01:42.929> to<00:01:43.200> thirty<00:01:43.409> minutes

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it's been about twenty to thirty minutes

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.819 
it's been about twenty to thirty minutes
pretending<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.179> coals<00:01:45.390> are<00:01:45.539> gray<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
pretending and the coals are gray so the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.539 
pretending and the coals are gray so the
next<00:01:47.039> step<00:01:47.310> would<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> add<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.539> wood<00:01:48.719> chips

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
next step would be to add the wood chips

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.749 
next step would be to add the wood chips
and<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.450> wood<00:01:51.630> chips<00:01:51.929> are<00:01:52.520> hickory<00:01:53.520> smoke

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and the wood chips are hickory smoke

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.819 
and the wood chips are hickory smoke
that's<00:01:54.030> what<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.360> chose<00:01:54.569> for<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:54.990> turkey<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that's what I chose for this turkey and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.160 
that's what I chose for this turkey and
so<00:01:56.549> they've<00:01:56.670> been<00:01:56.700> soaking<00:01:57.149> overnight<00:01:57.600> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
so they've been soaking overnight in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.160 
so they've been soaking overnight in
water<00:01:58.819> so<00:01:59.819> if<00:02:00.179> you're<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.569> kitchen<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
you want to strain the wood chips of the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.819 
you want to strain the wood chips of the
water<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.209> throw<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> colander<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.259> fine

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
water I throw in a colander that's fine

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.690 
water I throw in a colander that's fine
I'm<00:02:05.159> outside<00:02:06.049> pretending<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:08.069> I'll

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
I'm outside pretending to be so I'll

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.910 
I'm outside pretending to be so I'll
just<00:02:08.910> kind<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.269> shake<00:02:09.479> them<00:02:09.629> free<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.259> and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
just kind of shake them free here and

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.589 
just kind of shake them free here and
you<00:02:11.250> need<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.549> soak<00:02:11.760> them<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.269> when<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.480> put

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
you need to soak them so when you put

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.150 
you need to soak them so when you put
the<00:02:12.690> wood<00:02:12.840> chips<00:02:13.079> in<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.440> hot<00:02:13.620> coals<00:02:13.650> they

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
the wood chips in on the hot coals they

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.670 
the wood chips in on the hot coals they
don't<00:02:14.310> light<00:02:14.459> on<00:02:14.579> fire<00:02:14.819> having<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.780> water<00:02:16.260> in

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
don't light on fire having the water in

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.380 
don't light on fire having the water in
the<00:02:16.829> wood<00:02:17.040> will<00:02:17.549> prevent<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:17.940> from<00:02:18.000> lighting

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
the wood will prevent them from lighting

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.990 
the wood will prevent them from lighting
on<00:02:18.450> fire<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.930> they<00:02:19.079> would<00:02:19.230> go<00:02:19.319> into<00:02:20.000> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
on fire so they would go into and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.430 
on fire so they would go into and
sprinkle<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.690> over<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.400> coals<00:02:27.140> okay<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.200> all

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
sprinkle it over the coals okay so all

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.600 
sprinkle it over the coals okay so all
the<00:02:28.530> wood<00:02:28.650> chips<00:02:28.890> are<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.400> was<00:02:29.519> about

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
the wood chips are in and that was about

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.910 
the wood chips are in and that was about
three<00:02:29.940> cups<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.200> now<00:02:31.349> we<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.650> move<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.799> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
three cups and so now we can move to the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.960 
three cups and so now we can move to the
next<00:02:31.950> step<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:35.280> next<00:02:35.310> step<00:02:35.519> would<00:02:35.790> be<00:02:35.849> to

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
next step and the next step would be to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.630 
next step and the next step would be to
take<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.720> next<00:02:36.989> black<00:02:37.170> bowl<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:38.010> goes<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.430> on

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
take the next black bowl that goes in on

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.690 
take the next black bowl that goes in on
top<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.040> what's<00:02:41.220> going<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.459> create

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
top and this is what's going to create

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.590

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.949 
the last steps that I'm going to do is
take<00:04:18.470> this<00:04:18.979> type<00:04:19.190> of<00:04:19.220> thermometer<00:04:19.820> that<00:04:20.299> has<00:04:20.539> a

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
take this type of thermometer that has a

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.980 
take this type of thermometer that has a
long<00:04:21.590> cord<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.849> put<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.389> into<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.750> thigh<00:04:23.930> of

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
long cord and put it into the thigh of

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.450 
long cord and put it into the thigh of
the<00:04:24.139> turkey<00:04:24.560> just<00:04:24.680> like<00:04:24.889> you<00:04:25.099> would<00:04:25.280> if<00:04:25.370> you

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
the turkey just like you would if you

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.129 
the turkey just like you would if you
are<00:04:25.580> roasting<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.000> turkey<00:04:26.030> in<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:26.479> oven<00:04:26.510> and

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
are roasting a turkey in the oven and

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.510 
are roasting a turkey in the oven and
having<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:27.530> type<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.830> thermometer<00:04:27.979> is<00:04:28.250> great

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
having this type of thermometer is great

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.250 
having this type of thermometer is great
for<00:04:28.729> smoking<00:04:29.090> because<00:04:29.389> it<00:04:29.510> allows<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:30.020> to

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
for smoking because it allows you to

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.439 
for smoking because it allows you to
have<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:30.949> thermometer<00:04:31.280> in<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:32.000> then<00:04:32.360> the

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
have the thermometer in and then the

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.750 
have the thermometer in and then the
reader<00:04:32.660> strung<00:04:33.410> out<00:04:33.590> through<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.949> door<00:04:34.190> and

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
reader strung out through the door and

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.210 
reader strung out through the door and
that<00:04:35.210> means<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.620> don't<00:04:36.770> have<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:37.039> take

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
that means that you don't have to take

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.700 
that means that you don't have to take
the<00:04:37.340> lid<00:04:37.520> on<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:37.789> off<00:04:38.120> which<00:04:38.599> will<00:04:38.870> change<00:04:39.380> the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
the lid on and off which will change the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.890 
the lid on and off which will change the
amount<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.490> heat<00:04:40.729> inside<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.300> smoker<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:41.780> we

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
amount of heat inside the smoker and we

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.909 
amount of heat inside the smoker and we
really<00:04:42.139> want<00:04:42.289> to<00:04:42.320> keep<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:42.680> consistent

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
really want to keep that consistent

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.610 
really want to keep that consistent
throughout<00:04:43.699> so<00:04:44.539> I'm<00:04:44.870> going<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.080> go<00:04:45.229> ahead<00:04:45.320> and

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
throughout so I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.570 
throughout so I'm going to go ahead and
put<00:04:45.740> this<00:04:45.830> into<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.099> thigh

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.070 

so<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.699> thermometer<00:04:52.150> is<00:04:52.240> in<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.479> thighs<00:04:52.719> and

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
so the thermometer is in the thighs and

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.860 
so the thermometer is in the thighs and
now<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.289> strength<00:04:53.710> through<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.949> door

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.300 

and<00:05:01.410> then<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.710> will<00:05:01.830> give<00:05:01.949> me<00:05:02.040> an<00:05:02.130> easy

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
and then this will give me an easy

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.760 
and then this will give me an easy
visual<00:05:02.610> for<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:02.820> temperature<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:04.500> when<00:05:04.650> that

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
visual for the temperature so when that

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.980 
visual for the temperature so when that
says<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.490> lid<00:05:05.699> is<00:05:05.910> ready<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.210> go<00:05:06.330> on
