let's go to real temp and see what the

what I was hoping for somewhere in the
mid<00:00:15.370> 30s<00:00:15.400> but<00:00:15.999> it's<00:00:16.870> decreased<00:00:17.410> about<00:00:17.860> 3<00:00:18.460> maybe

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
mid 30s but it's decreased about 3 maybe

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.109 
mid 30s but it's decreased about 3 maybe
4<00:00:18.910> degrees<00:00:19.510> Celsius<00:00:20.039> it's<00:00:21.039> not<00:00:21.220> bad<00:00:21.430> every<00:00:21.699> bit

just means that over time it creates a

while<00:01:04.030> we're<00:01:04.180> waiting<00:01:04.299> I<00:01:04.570> thought<00:01:04.780> I'd<00:01:04.900> point

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
while we're waiting I thought I'd point

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.010 
while we're waiting I thought I'd point
out<00:01:05.260> something<00:01:05.740> if<00:01:06.040> we<00:01:06.610> look<00:01:06.760> up<00:01:06.909> here<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.810> has

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
out something if we look up here it has

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.170 
out something if we look up here it has
the<00:01:08.320> base<00:01:08.500> clock<00:01:08.799> and<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.490> multiplier<00:01:09.940> and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
the base clock and the multiplier and

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.680 
the base clock and the multiplier and
the<00:01:10.720> multiplier<00:01:11.170> right<00:01:11.380> now<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:11.799> 21<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:13.630> you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
the multiplier right now is 21 if you

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.240 
the multiplier right now is 21 if you
remember<00:01:14.229> in<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.440> first<00:01:14.470> lesson<00:01:14.890> we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
remember in the first lesson we

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.550 
remember in the first lesson we
mentioned<00:01:16.060> turbo<00:01:16.420> mode<00:01:16.659> that's<00:01:17.290> what's

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
mentioned turbo mode that's what's

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.649 
mentioned turbo mode that's what's
kicking<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:18.009> here<00:01:18.340> what<00:01:18.729> turbo<00:01:19.030> mode<00:01:19.210> does<00:01:19.420> is

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
kicking in here what turbo mode does is

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.590 
kicking in here what turbo mode does is
it<00:01:20.229> allows<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.979> multiplier<00:01:21.550> to<00:01:21.820> go<00:01:21.940> up<00:01:22.119> by<00:01:22.300> 1

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
it allows the multiplier to go up by 1

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.200 
it allows the multiplier to go up by 1
to<00:01:23.320> do<00:01:23.470> an<00:01:23.590> automatic<00:01:23.950> overclock<00:01:24.550> when<00:01:25.119> the
