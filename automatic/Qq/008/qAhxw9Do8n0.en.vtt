 who are just beginning to become coaches like a youth team lose 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 and that should 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.580
 I do not do a Germany tour by bike but 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.980
 with the company car 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.980
 and there is of course Percent Chemnitzer 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.990
 Percentage is being made for the meanwhile very good youth work TM 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.490
 No to a good team there 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.930
 although the third line 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.830
 Parma 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.450
 come in the running I support picture and that goes on 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.690
 best by 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.360
 Percent 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539
 go and talk to the trainers 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.190
 and try motivation and a little bit higher 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.770
 to bring the know-how into the system 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.220
 They said it and make a business trip with the vehicle across 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.490
 Germany our pagan ones in ALERT in gear trainings 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.819
 four routes alone, how many appointments they have there all year round 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.980
 was symbolic every weekend AR sets this weekend 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.030
 For example, the 2 I was just in the pop star on Monday for the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.270
 Brandenburg 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.790
 Basketball banned a training today I'm here I was at 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 in many first division 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.080
 Second division teams as well as according to binder-maier 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.729
 for example in Rhöndorf and others Indians in the next week 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.019
 so percent 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.639
 everywhere in Germany I try a contribution 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.119
 so do for it 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:20.709
 that is better in youth work whose we need a strong base 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.549
 We have strong youth coaches and we need well-trained young players 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.209
 in order to go further and that 's what I' ve thought of this year 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.239
 Banner written that it is important to have fun 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.980
 not the same for the coach a successful and and 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.569
 helpful event 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.459
 they said youth work very important they have that as one 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.560
 Great goal written on their flags to advance youth work 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.490
 a few years ago they were also big supporters of the blokes 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.200
 junior basketball league casting since 2006 gives the youth basketball 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.220
 Bundesliga since this season 2009 the start they see already first results 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.160
 have the introduction of this nationwide offspring lie 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.419
 Brought progress 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.230
 that we have harshly invited 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.810
 Pollmann brought great progress percent because first comes the youth 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.179
 Basketball in the focus 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.260
 the first league the second league 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.620
 have meanwhile made a higher contribution to this Red is here 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.729
 All percent is that these are 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.060
 professionalism 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.979
 but also with commitment to be lived under 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.589
 So not only the amateur athlete is still extreme 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:26.320
 important as a germ cell 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.529
 but it is also the professional sport that the 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:34.729
 Development of highly talented young players has written on the flags 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.010
 and it forms from the Ser 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.080
 in both the JBBL and the NBBL 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.680
 the level gets better and better 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.730
 and that helps of course to have good national teams percent 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.470
 u17 and u18 have 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.750
 then for the first time ever to date, the percentage in Swiss 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.119
 Tonius Timmermann the biggest 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:57.939
 Youth tournament in Europe at all 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.189
 In this case, the semi-final reached Urach's interest in the end become second 17 after 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.720
 a great game by her 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.070
 Americans who are a year older have beaten 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.979
 with third parties 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.010
 So all these things make you feel better 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.659
 one notices that more and more young German players also the league of the branch under 2 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.120
 Lie a face 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.340
 So there are many good things that make you optimistic about the future 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.379
 let look 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:25.099
 they just mentioned it last week that Albert Schweizer tournament one 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.110
 in Mannheim ended big consequences for the two Germans 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.620
 Teams 17 and u 18 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.000
 they were certainly there which German junior players from these 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.080
 Teams liked them the most 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.610
 to draw attention 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.970
 the entire clan you simply that more and more talents come along well too 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.189
 are enough to play in the breakout in the second division 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.830
 I want first germs can take out individually that is still in the age 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.639
 always problematic because because the guys then percent too easily if the 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.710
 National coach suddenly from them 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.460
 talks about them and praises them too much, but there are certainly more than 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.539
 a hand full 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.930
 Percent of players the 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.539
 Have cheers level 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.610
 Party against Western European competition 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.650
 It was like that 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.750
 This can only work as a satisfactory development so far 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.400
 judge 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.830
 if we look one more age the young German 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.760
 Players who are now in their early 20s 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.740
 There are a number of players in the Bundesliga playing this song 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.800
 Tibor Pleiß Robin Benzing r 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.740
 Jake Philipp Schwethelm Percent, for example, now Lukarsch Rider 

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:34.499
 After he returns, we have them around 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:37.309
 Development with benevolence observed a few years ago, Sierre seemed almost 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.079
 already as if the young German players would have no chances in 

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.870
 have the Bundesliga and now you have so many 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.210
 Percent attention is also a team picks quite naturally expand 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.749
 yes they have quite young planned the most important 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:49.610
 all young players 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.089
 because we have the last summer at the European Championships in Poland 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.149
 have a chance believed in themselves and they are outstanding 

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:59.460
 Europe has come across this young generation of Germans 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.439
 National player very surprised and 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:03.919
 happy because everyone thought like Nowitzki 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.680
 no longer comes and Dino Kolata he or example 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.710
 do not play a scooter then Germany sinks in absolute 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.219
 mediocre 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.449
 he that's all but not happening would have been great also successful 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.320
 have played the European champion 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.410
 Russia, for example, was beaten and who against the Croats achieved that 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.180
 last 8 only who is defeated by a 2 points defeat 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.270
 Zurich missed 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.319
 So there's a great generation of young players named Hansi Percent 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:33.090
 all mentioned with whom we 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.069
 of course, next year will continue to work and 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.340
 Mr basketball fans in Germany still have a lot of fun 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.240
 I'm sure of that 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.120
 We now had names called the leap into the Bundesliga 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.590
 to have 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.460
 a young German player did not go to the Bundeswehr until last summer 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.260
 but has warned the big jump across the pond in the US Lise 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.810
 Hermes 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.969
 plays their extra percentage for the Gonzaga Bulldogs 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:01.909
 they have tracked their percent its development there he could 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:04.820
 the second round of the ENSI Retro name more numerous 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.669
 Jaffe we ​​tracked that and percent 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:10.930
 Price was in her view the right way to the USA and niece 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.340
 easy to go to the Bundesliga 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.820
 that is very intense, of course, we have pursued course we have 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.919
 long talked about whether it is the right way for him in the 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:20.639
 UniStar to go or 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.379
 the organ or Tibor 

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:28.239
 Bar in the outrigger but he has decided for Gonzaga us 

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.239
 As I said for a long time, I talked about it 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:35.839
 he advocates and he has played a great season he has been there 

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:39.469
 one of the best freshman so really great scene No 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:42.369
 he could possibly set that if he wanted 

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:45.509
 already in life the NBA percent that is now yes 

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:49.899
 also public decided at least close one year at least 

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.389
 Vienna to play for Don Sager 

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:57.710
 um so I've visited him as well as Türk and Chris Kaman percent 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.150
 In that sense, a correct decision is a great development 

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.050
 reason 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.020
 of course expect him too 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.849
 great things in the national team 

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:09.050
 we take a very short break
