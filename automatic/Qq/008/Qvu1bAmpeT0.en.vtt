I<00:00:12.870> became<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.440> bicycle<00:00:13.920> safety<00:00:14.280> advocate<00:00:14.700> when

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
I became a bicycle safety advocate when

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.120 
I became a bicycle safety advocate when
I<00:00:15.330> moved<00:00:15.630> here<00:00:15.809> from<00:00:15.929> new<00:00:16.109> from<00:00:16.410> Australia<00:00:16.920> two

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
I moved here from new from Australia two

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.580 
I moved here from new from Australia two
years<00:00:17.369> ago<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:18.140> thought<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.320> would<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
years ago I thought this would be a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.250 
years ago I thought this would be a
wonderful<00:00:20.039> place<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> ride<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> bike

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
wonderful place to ride a bike

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.420 
wonderful place to ride a bike
particularly<00:00:22.260> looking<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> bike<00:00:22.830> lanes<00:00:23.100> I

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
particularly looking at the bike lanes I

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.189 
particularly looking at the bike lanes I
even<00:00:24.210> contemplated<00:00:24.570> letting<00:00:25.080> my

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
even contemplated letting my

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.839 
even contemplated letting my
eight-year-old<00:00:25.830> son<00:00:26.099> ride<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.519> these<00:00:26.609> bike

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
eight-year-old son ride in these bike

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.700 
eight-year-old son ride in these bike
lanes<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.449> from<00:00:27.599> time<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.930> time<00:00:27.960> we<00:00:28.260> did<00:00:28.470> I

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
lanes and from time to time we did I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.400 
lanes and from time to time we did I
quickly<00:00:29.609> came<00:00:29.939> across<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.779> landscaping

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
quickly came across the landscaping

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.040 
quickly came across the landscaping
trucks<00:00:31.940> which<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.149> combination<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
trucks which in combination with the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.139 
trucks which in combination with the
speeding<00:00:34.410> cars<00:00:34.649> makes<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.489> very<00:00:35.670> unsafe

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
speeding cars makes a very unsafe

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.479 
speeding cars makes a very unsafe
situation<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.350> determined<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:37.980> my<00:00:38.250> son

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
situation and I determined that my son

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
situation and I determined that my son
would<00:00:38.670> never<00:00:38.790> ride<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.180> these<00:00:39.270> bike<00:00:39.510> lanes<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
would never ride in these bike lanes and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.280 
would never ride in these bike lanes and
I<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:40.770> only<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.030> group<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.510> with

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
I now only do it in a group or with

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.500 
I now only do it in a group or with
special<00:00:43.500> care<00:00:43.890> yeah<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.969> we're<00:00:45.090> looking<00:00:45.360> at

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
special care yeah what we're looking at

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.410 
special care yeah what we're looking at
is<00:00:45.660> where<00:00:45.899> we're<00:00:46.590> watching<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.870> gardener's

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420

no room for error yes I remember the

no room for error yes I remember the

don't<00:01:59.800> even<00:01:59.980> think<00:02:00.130> there<00:02:00.550> was<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.730> bike<00:02:01.090> lane

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
don't even think there was a bike lane

closed sign at that time there was just

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
tried to merge into the traffic lane too

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.000 
tried to merge into the traffic lane too
I<00:02:12.220> remember<00:02:12.430> wondering<00:02:13.240> why<00:02:14.230> wasn't<00:02:14.770> there<00:02:14.980> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
I remember wondering why wasn't there a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.320 
I remember wondering why wasn't there a
sign<00:02:15.510> at<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.570> previous<00:02:17.140> intersection

telling me that the lane ahead was

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.290 
telling me that the lane ahead was
closed<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.310> felt<00:02:21.820> trapped<00:02:26.580> now<00:02:27.580> on<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.150> uphill
