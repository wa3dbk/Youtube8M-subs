00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.740
 hello how welcome are you to this 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.200
 mobile episode is decisive 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.180
 about times this time I wanted to 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.219
 bring from the 97 this portal as it is from 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.530
 the most used and then I said because 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.730
 I did not bring the mobile decision set that 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.830
 I will present below this 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.570
 done iván is the most common of nature 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.460
 alamán obviously with subject that is the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.490
 jons go the shares send matches the 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.650
 milestones 52 on the hp 252 in the attack and 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.020
 six points in the speed the skill 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.520
 of doing the technique that elevates 50 by 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.800
 hundred the movements that have a 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.940
 power base of 60 or less we're going to 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.980
 put the bullet shot obviously 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.570
 priority and is alive is for the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.070
 predictions in case your opponent 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.990
 some excessive change and return that 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.460
 they have the advantage the super power for 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.950
 because one of type 0 as fierce 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.810
 all and all those and also the course 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.820
 to not let poc escape is like 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.470
 you see well already and among others but 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.260
 well now let's move on by moving 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.239
 pool and they give being here in 96 they will look 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.649
 to be also is of nature allamand 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.170
 obviously with his same skill the 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.970
 tennis on the object as the aberri dock 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.579
 the remains or the lumbar and any those 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.489
 three the eps most distributed in 252 in the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.749
 hp 252 in the attack but still six 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.150
 points in the defense to hold a 

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:09.550
 little more hits 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.710
 the movements are the following is the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.630
 guardáns the volley pong the rush for 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.890
 recover life the book by of that 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.630
 movement that goes down very simple since 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.180
 it is also this rise is initial 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.220
 of an gives more power has what is the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.720
 break or the super power but I would 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.160
 I would recommend the break better since the 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.570
 super bower hits much stronger but 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.400
 the defense also goes down because you only 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.930
 brings consequences later in the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.300
 objects I would also recommend more what 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.710
 is the lumbar and since the ok to see and not 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.510
 it suits you a lot because then most 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.910
 of time they throw them under rain and then 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.650
 the rain protects you 50% of the attacks 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.970
 of fire that you can with the remains is not 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.770
 so much because you still recover life with the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.360
 I breathe but well then after that 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.920
 let's move on to the next move is 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.410
 say it's the box 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.390
 but good today here in it is embroider 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.369
 you can see that nature adam 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.600
 and also the object is very similar 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.340
 this way of being that we just saw 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.869
 but this one carries what is of object what 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.550
 what is life expect in the skill 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.930
 in it the points of effort that 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.910
 it's already different that they are nothing more than 100 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.950
 points in the hp to resist more or 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.240
 minus the 250 hits and others in the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.850
 attack if you have to paste enough 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.170
 that's why he brings the live form and 158 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.759
 points in the speed to win the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.739
 speed although another bit not very 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.269
 fast for example as magnesium even that 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.930
 but good the movements are the 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.640
 following 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.340
 sword overflowed to rise a lot 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.750
 the attack blow bullets the boot by this 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.280
 movement that hits pretty hard and the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.049
 super power this is new the set is a 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.700
 set to scare the team to sweep 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.219
 how fast but then good after 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.000
 this mobile set let's move on to the next 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.530
 is the move set 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.060
 escarp eres t mobile 7 is more 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.459
 concentrated what is the speed already 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.349
 that is a feat is the jolie has the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.700
 inability to extend the object as 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.950
 he says his name is going to bring what is the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.530
 choice to scale the effort points 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.359
 go 250 2 in attack 250 2 in the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.010
 speed and six points in the gp the 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.419
 movements are the following is the going 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.950
 and back to have the advantage of 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:50.079
 find a pokémon that does not suit you 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.120
 the accommodation the iron that this 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.250
 movement that is 80's power and you 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.919
 pass back or the bullet hit that 60 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.930
 of being able to consolidate technique but you have to 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.730
 remember to give priority to the corpse of the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.620
 cac in your opinion and well you know there are 100 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.879
 to put the pursuit that 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.620
 movement for a little more character 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.209
 as he had a ghost that I 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.590
 I recommend more or the area laws that 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.480
 It is convenient to finish it because the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.340
 team fight that in addition that its time its 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.709
 power base because it's also 60 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.480
 doubles 90 rises to 90 and then also 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.829
 super power level than this one of motion 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.419
 well you know that it is very work 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.780
 find them by like the team 0 but 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.069
 well 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.870
 after downloading for we arrived at 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.330
 next that is the set button to be 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.400
 well here on the button to be this 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.720
 S &amp; P mode of my favorites is from natural 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.580
 outside and also more concentrated in the 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.860
 speed technical skill 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.810
 the object will carry the remains 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.810
 We'll give you leather points 252 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.150
 in hp 252 in speed and 6 in the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.860
 special defense because they do not carry together 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.560
 in attack because this mode 7 is more 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.270
 concentrated to spend all the moments 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.010
 that you do to another because so the 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.709
 movements are the following carries the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.390
 agility to double the speed 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.340
 guardáns to raise t much the attack 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.989
 you have to want substitute or in case of 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.820
 that wants to leave in attack to hit the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.500
 beat balance and dad peace that is the 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.090
 I relay this movement after you 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.680
 you have increased with an activity one 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.269
 once sword and if you get to leave a 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.340
 substitute do what is the button pass 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.900
 the pokemon people almost certainly opening 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.850
 all the team and well these were the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.739
 two can be from sidor I hope that they 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.360
 I hope you will be served and well 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.640
 they know how to give a like civilians liked the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.140
 video comment what they thought they share 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.880
 the presidency surprises and if you like 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.329
 because very competitive we see ourselves in another 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.329
 goodbye
