00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.540 
two strand twists that I put in her hair
last<00:00:30.900> night<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.199> put<00:00:31.650> about<00:00:31.800> eight<00:00:32.040> twist<00:00:32.369> in

last night I put about eight twist in
her<00:00:32.640> hair<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:32.880> then<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.239> wrapped<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
her hair and then I wrapped it up in a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.860 
her hair and then I wrapped it up in a
silk<00:00:34.200> wrap<00:00:34.520> um<00:00:35.520> somehow<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.149> fell<00:00:36.450> off<00:00:36.480> last

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
silk wrap um somehow I fell off last

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.600 
silk wrap um somehow I fell off last
night<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:37.829> why<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.040> kind<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.370> fuzzy

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
night so that's why it's kind of fuzzy

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.910 
night so that's why it's kind of fuzzy
in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.879> front<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.840> that's<00:00:39.989> an<00:00:40.110> easy<00:00:40.350> fix<00:00:40.500> with

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
in the front but that's an easy fix with

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.670 
in the front but that's an easy fix with
that<00:00:41.070> shea<00:00:41.309> moisture<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:43.110> again<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.559> we're

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
that shea moisture so again what we're

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.260 
that shea moisture so again what we're
going<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.129> unravel<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> twist

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
going to do is just unravel the twist

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.520 
going to do is just unravel the twist
and<00:00:45.829> get<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:48.079> untangled<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
and get it all untangled now if I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.709 
and get it all untangled now if I
wouldn't<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.010> put<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.579> twist<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.420> her<00:00:51.510> hair

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
wouldn't have put the twist in her hair

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.260 
wouldn't have put the twist in her hair
last<00:00:51.989> night<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.860> had<00:00:53.039> been<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.399> matted<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.030> so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
last night it had been so matted and so

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.990 
last night it had been so matted and so
tangled<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.129> took<00:00:56.850> me

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
tangled up it would have just took me

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.569 
tangled up it would have just took me
forever<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.750> her<00:00:57.930> hair<00:00:58.170> pretty<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.980> not
