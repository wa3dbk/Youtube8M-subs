00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:07.374
 Hello everyone and welcome to my imperfect kitchen! 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.975
 Today we will prepare appetizers together 

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:13.579
 Savory muffins with gorgonzola pears and walnuts 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.317
 ideal for an informal buffet, a picnic or a snack. 

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:22.021
 To make our muffins we will need: 

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:26.392
 a scale, a muffin pan, paper cups, 

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:28.995
 two bowls and a wooden spoon. 

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.931
 We light the oven at 180 degrees. 

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.874
 In a large bowl 

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.543
 we pour 150 gr. of flour 00 

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.784
 For convenience I weighed all the ingredients first 

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.419
 but to avoid dirtying too many things I recommend you 

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:56.556
 to weigh them in the same bowls 

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:59.159
 as you go to insert them. 

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:00.627
 After the flour, 

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.663
 I insert 8 gr. of yeast 

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.333
 and finally, a pinch of salt. 

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:12.972
 I mix quickly and set aside. 

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.975
 This is the bowl with our powders. 

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.779
 I take another bowl 

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:24.551
 and here I am going to mix together the liquid part of the muffins. 

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.654
 I start from the egg, 

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.662
 30 gr. of oil, 

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:38.198
 and finally, 120 gr. of milk. 

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.468
 Quickly beat with a fork 

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.937
 the liquid part of our dough. 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.782
 At this point, we have a powder bowl 

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.419
 and a bowl with the liquid part. 

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.288
 Let's continue with the powder bowl 

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:07.093
 and let's go and pour the liquid part of the mixture. 

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:17.003
 I recommend, I know that many of you will know it already but 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.739
 the secret to the success of the muffins 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.743
 is to quickly mix the ingredients 

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:26.379
 because otherwise, at the end of cooking, the muffin 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.314
 will be rubbery. 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:34.553
 Then, to the other ingredients already in the bowl 

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:38.591
 which I need to complete the dough: 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:44.531
 40 gr. of walnut kernels, 

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.934
 100 gr. of diced pear pulp, 

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.836
 I recommend rather small, 

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:57.944
 and finally 100 gr. of coarsely chopped gorgonzola. 

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:06.386
 At this point, with a wooden spoon 

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:09.589
 I'll have to mix all the ingredients quickly. 

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.987
 The dough is ready to be poured into the paper cups. 

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:51.798
 I insert the dough into the paper cups. 

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:54.766
 Avoid filling it to the brim, 

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:56.902
 because the muffin is cooking 

00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:57.904
 will tend to grow a little. 

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:13.019
 Here are our six muffins ready to be baked. 

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:23.329
 See you at the end of cooking. 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.399
 To prepare this recipe we used: 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.094
 After about 25 minutes, I take the muffins out of the oven. 

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:08.374
 The appearance of these muffins is rustic but definitely inviting 

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:11.577
 the scent is very good. Now we will not have to do anything but 

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:15.081
 put them to cool on a wire rack before consuming them. 

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:18.451
 Hi everyone, see you at the next videorecetta! 

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.687
