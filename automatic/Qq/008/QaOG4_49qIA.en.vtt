00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.950
 hi 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.930
 today I came to bring a different idea 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.830
 for you to customize a shorts with 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.830
 fringe 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.090
 and I did a very easy tutorial as well 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:04.080
 it really does not have a secret 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.080
 the shorts was a cause I cut 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.920
 and then I put on that 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.870
 fringes that is a style that I love that 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.120
 I think it gets super super better. 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.870
 different and runs away from the 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:27.890
 basic customization everyone can 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:31.520
 which is with king only shredded and such must 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.060
 wearing shorts you can use this 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.240
 style here which is a strip of heat if 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.430
 You are already against this in a shop in 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.560
 It's true that mine is leather 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.509
 which is a fraud that I already had at home and 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.869
 I used more in dressers if 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.090
 suede fringing can be used 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.770
 the color of the short or put in the car 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.640
 different to highlight just as I 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:00.229
 I did or if you did not find you could 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.340
 buy this type of thread here is the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.340
 leather cord 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.560
 that is used enough to make 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.990
 jewelry to make with the bracelets 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.140
 so it's pretty easy to find 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.650
 besides bugger that the only difference 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.070
 is that if you buy the wire 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.280
 You'll have to make him transform. 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:33.430
 envy then you will measure the size 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:35.260
 What you want is going to cut and then 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.060
 time to apply will give a little bit 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.090
 more work he's going to have to get 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.850
 a lung is going to put here as well 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:48.580
 Quickly the tutorial and after the goal 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.910
 some pictures of how chats were left in the 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.910
 body
