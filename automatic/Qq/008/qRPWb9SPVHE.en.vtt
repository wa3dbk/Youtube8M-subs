there<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> episode<00:01:38.070> started

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
there I like the way the episode started

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.010 
there I like the way the episode started
off<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> robot<00:01:39.299> children<00:01:39.720> came<00:01:39.869> in

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
off and then the robot children came in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.359 
off and then the robot children came in
it<00:01:40.200> kind<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.470> felt<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.799> very

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it kind of felt like a very

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.569 
it kind of felt like a very
anticlimactic<00:01:42.590> ending<00:01:43.590> honestly<00:01:44.280> from<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
anticlimactic ending honestly from a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.429 
anticlimactic ending honestly from a
standpoint<00:01:45.060> I've<00:01:45.630> caught<00:01:45.960> him<00:01:45.990> upset<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
standpoint I've caught him upset I

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
standpoint I've caught him upset I
expected<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.950> lot<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.159> from<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.640> type<00:01:47.850> of

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
expected a lot more from this type of

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.819 
expected a lot more from this type of
ending<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:49.200> though<00:01:49.409> there's<00:01:49.649> is

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
ending but I do know though there's is

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.230 
ending but I do know though there's is
gonna<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> couple<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.759> episodes<00:01:50.939> coming

going to be two other episodes or OVA
episodes<00:01:56.250> most<00:01:56.490> likely<00:01:56.759> those<00:01:56.969> will<00:01:57.210> conclude

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
episodes most likely those will conclude

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.080 
episodes most likely those will conclude
the<00:01:57.780> overall<00:01:58.140> plot<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:59.159> whatever<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.790> I'm

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090

had honestly in truth I felt like the
series<00:02:18.990> should<00:02:19.080> have<00:02:19.200> ended<00:02:19.350> around<00:02:19.560> when

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
series should have ended around when

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.860 
series should have ended around when
killer<00:02:20.070> killin<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.640> because<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> mean<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.480> felt

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
killer killin it because I mean I felt

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.450 
killer killin it because I mean I felt
like<00:02:22.020> tonari<00:02:22.380> no<00:02:22.440> sequin<00:02:22.860> was<00:02:23.040> at<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> perfect

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
like tonari no sequin was at the perfect

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.430 
like tonari no sequin was at the perfect
point<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:24.030> end<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.690> was<00:02:24.780> upsetting<00:02:25.200> at<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
point to end it was upsetting at the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.170 
point to end it was upsetting at the
time<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> was<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.310> perfect<00:02:26.490> point<00:02:26.820> in

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
time but so it was a perfect point in

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.240 
time but so it was a perfect point in
the<00:02:27.330> series<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.260> even<00:02:28.440> thought<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.710> majority

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
the series and I even thought a majority

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.500 
the series and I even thought a majority
of<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.370> spot<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:29.730> gonna<00:02:29.820> end<00:02:30.060> at<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.270> time

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
of a spot it was gonna end at that time

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.660 
of a spot it was gonna end at that time
I<00:02:30.540> think<00:02:30.690> around<00:02:30.900> episode<00:02:31.260> 12<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:32.580> it

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
I think around episode 12 but then it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.130 
I think around episode 12 but then it
continued<00:02:33.030> going<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.360> which<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.630> was<00:02:33.720> happy<00:02:33.870> at

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
continued going on which I was happy at

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.230 
continued going on which I was happy at
first<00:02:34.410> but<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:34.950> felt<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.550> overstayed<00:02:36.060> its

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
first but I felt like it overstayed its

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.230 
first but I felt like it overstayed its
