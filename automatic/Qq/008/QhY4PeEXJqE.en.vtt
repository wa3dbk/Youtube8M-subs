 connection to the club felt an aspect 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.109
 was not particularly exciting 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.000
 fact that she turned off as a child and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.619
 Grinds felt there are the playable 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.449
 characters in video games almost 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.340
 were exclusively male and theirs

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.950
 video game characters are not too good 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.870

 next she writes beuys connection kit 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.820
 downes much like the video game could 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.239
 boys do not think they want to do 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.979

 with minimal lg last danger on just 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.760
 their deeps describing people the claim 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.630
 School present the dictate and politics 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.409
 nz on telling us whether we have to 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.909
 the potters and boxes in the mega star 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.159
 Of course it is always pulling 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.259
 Catholic view very unfavorable that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.179
 just so few heroines back then 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.340
 has given and even today is the 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.459
 video game teeth strongly masculine shaped 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.810
 female characters often become 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.390
 sexualized and as the warmest industries 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.890
 I have personally presented however 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.020
 for me and my individual 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.179
 never a problem of the game experience 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.859
 representation has always been for me 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.399
 the figure in the middle of it is not that 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.890
 gender 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.770
 I always did not care if the hero was the one 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.429
 story is male or female 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.679
 I have identified myself with the 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.959
 Do not characterize the gender characteristics 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.969
 why should I feel limited 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.099
 if i like the toys as well 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.979
 can use like my brother with this one 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.360
 I shared it with me 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.489
 always, of course, too 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.910
 male characters gripped and they 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.009
 played 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.110
 we all had turtles all 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.989
 antagonists but an apple 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.489
 No , I did not need that carnival 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.030
 I was dressed as a leonardo 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.250
 It did not harm me, I did 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.430
 neither felt excluded nor felt excluded 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.569
 I always limited possibilities 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.670
 Video games covers my women's 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.739
 not according to who she has to be 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.120
 they only count stories and 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.670
 use themselves stereotypical 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.440
 tell the role images where 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.440
 but that is changing in our time 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.930
 I have not become a damsfest 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.790
 Although I am not a girl girl no 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.989
 lady 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.689
 However, I feel feminine 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.099
 No doubt my interest and hobbies 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.900
 saved from both 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.849
 i play football and video games but 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.890
 hey i could go shopping for hours too 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.329
 go and i love colleges that 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.700
 heading of laura has articles 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.970
 By the way, this is the video game 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.379
 made me feel like a human being 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.599
 meant is the game left behind the 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.609
 litter of the last in which the 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.069
 protagonists elli no stereotypes 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.329
 served but I really works synonymous 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.620
 Welcome this development 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.480
 I think it's great when 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.430
 game developers and authors all around 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.250
 create plausible authentic figures 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.750
 but damn you do not limit yourself 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.000
 rather, even if you look at one 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.250
 cause sex is reduced 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.989
 just because left elder rescues instead 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.450
 zelda link's still not himself 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.010
 Helpless woman playing games at this moment 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.470
 I would have the character league at the end 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.379
 Maybe I am myself, too 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.790
 even if I have the choice to play 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.280
 I have a male bidder and no 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.900
 female also in the novel I have myself 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.750
 with male protagonists as well 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.419
 Those with female and female can infect 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.519
 yes, I am in spite of everything 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.659
 emancipation 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.699
 However, I also plead for more 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.659
 self-esteem a less strong 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.120
 feel players 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.440
 sometimes man is the one 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.440
 you limit yourself
