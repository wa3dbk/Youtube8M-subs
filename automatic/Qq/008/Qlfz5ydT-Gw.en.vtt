00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.470 
know kind of one of those things where
gets<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.280> highlight<00:02:13.610> Kelowna<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.269> it's<00:02:14.390> a

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
gets to highlight Kelowna and it's a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.449 
gets to highlight Kelowna and it's a
great<00:02:14.660> fit<00:02:14.930> for<00:02:14.959> destination<00:02:15.950> races<00:02:16.310> and

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
great fit for destination races and

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.830 
great fit for destination races and
essentially<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.000> theme<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.360> they<00:02:17.510> run<00:02:17.690> on

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
essentially the theme that they run on

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.199 
essentially the theme that they run on
our<00:02:18.440> races<00:02:18.829> are<00:02:18.950> more<00:02:19.100> more<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.549> an<00:02:19.700> exclusive

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
our races are more more of an exclusive

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.759 
our races are more more of an exclusive
intimate<00:02:20.540> experience<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.410> think<00:02:21.440> that

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
intimate experience and I think that

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.220 
intimate experience and I think that
that<00:02:22.579> creates<00:02:23.450> an<00:02:23.540> environment<00:02:23.720> where<00:02:24.019> people

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
that creates an environment where people

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.660 
that creates an environment where people
want<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.470> want<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.100> more<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.370> our<00:02:25.489> races

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
want to want to do more of our races

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.100 
want to want to do more of our races
