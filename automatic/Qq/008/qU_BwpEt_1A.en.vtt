00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.010
 karamba with you curve pirate today we 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.330
 let's cut the baseball bat go 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.150
 to me on the ship echo and so i moved 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:31.490
 to your workbench is all that to us 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:39.760
 need this scotch scissors and 1 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.760
 ticker and unlimited paper 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.090
 for a start he will start to make 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:52.010
 the bottom of our bits for this 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:57.410
 take a piece we add it carefully 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:04.190
 look here so bend 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:12.560
 the bottom part turned out uneven shit 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:20.720
 Yes, and figs with him continue to fold our 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:24.770
 a sheet of 2 halves along turns 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:29.830
 This is the construction after which we 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.830
 make it even much longer half 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:48.890
 so that 's what we end up with here 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.440
 such a triangle and the upper part we 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:01.770
 just stupidly starting 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:05.610
 squeeze crumple that's what we do 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:12.180
 Now it's a matter of a few 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.820
 once in the end i made five layers of this 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.100
 unit 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:22.590
 look handy thing we lay down our 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.130
 to a side and we will begin to do 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.160
 the upper part and so for this fairly 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.160
 roll our stock into the phone and 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:37.740
 do this too 5 1 like from this thing 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.840
 in the end, put everything together with us 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:46.430
 it will turn out such a sickly design 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.240
 starts doing the top part here this 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:55.710
 do the same spin 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:59.400
 our papers 5 our end the whole thing 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.400
 violently glue tape and after 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.489
 winding tape we have here 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.590
 such a sickly tough and beautiful unit 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.890
 the result we can defend ourselves with this 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.660
 substance but i remind that 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.739
 making and using pi 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.170
 manufacturing and use 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:27.780
