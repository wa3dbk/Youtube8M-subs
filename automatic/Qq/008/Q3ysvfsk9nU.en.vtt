keeping their secrets secret and their

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.380 
keeping their secrets secret and their

too early and it's really disappointing

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.910 
too early and it's really disappointing
because<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:09.030> already<00:01:09.210> saw<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> iphone<00:01:10.080> 5<00:01:10.350> we

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.399 
because we already saw the iphone 5 we
were<00:01:11.070> hoping<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.790> pocket<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.960> hopefully

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
were hoping on pocket now that hopefully

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.780 
were hoping on pocket now that hopefully
there<00:01:13.590> would<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> different<00:01:14.100> design<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
there would be a different design and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
there would be a different design and
what<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.360> were<00:01:15.600> seeing<00:01:15.869> was<00:01:15.960> kind<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> hoax

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
what we were seeing was kind of a hoax

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.950 
what we were seeing was kind of a hoax
and<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.130> trick<00:01:17.369> by<00:01:17.400> Apple<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.540> wasn't<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and a trick by Apple but that wasn't the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.440 
and a trick by Apple but that wasn't the
case<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.560> leaks<00:01:19.799> turned<00:01:20.189> out<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.729> true<00:01:20.939> so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
case the leaks turned out to be true so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.060

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
they did is they made the camera better

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
but not by that much they add a lot of

but not by that much they add a lot of

the<00:03:55.530> number<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.799> megapixels<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.730> still<00:03:57.030> at

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the number of megapixels it's still at

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.210 
the number of megapixels it's still at
eight<00:03:57.359> megapixels<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.709> guess<00:03:58.889> that's<00:03:58.920> to

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
eight megapixels but I guess that's to

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.039 
eight megapixels but I guess that's to
be<00:03:59.250> expected<00:03:59.400> it's<00:04:00.090> not<00:04:00.209> about<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.810> number<00:04:01.019> of

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
be expected it's not about the number of

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.740 
be expected it's not about the number of
megapixels<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:01.980> about<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.940> quality<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.480> the

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
megapixels it's about the quality of the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.789 
megapixels it's about the quality of the
photo<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.230> there's<00:04:04.380> better<00:04:04.560> low-light

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
photo so there's better low-light

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.890 
photo so there's better low-light
performance<00:04:05.010> there's<00:04:05.819> panorama<00:04:06.389> mode<00:04:06.630> and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
performance there's panorama mode and

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.449 
performance there's panorama mode and
some<00:04:07.019> other<00:04:07.230> cool<00:04:07.440> stuff<00:04:07.500> which<00:04:08.280> will

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
some other cool stuff which will

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.420 
some other cool stuff which will
hopefully<00:04:08.609> make<00:04:09.150> what<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.750> think<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.769> was<00:04:11.220> the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
hopefully make what I think the was the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.520 
hopefully make what I think the was the
best<00:04:11.639> camera<00:04:11.940> phone<00:04:12.120> ever<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.780> iphone<00:04:13.139> 4s

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
best camera phone ever the iphone 4s

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.949 
best camera phone ever the iphone 4s
overshadowed<00:04:14.519> by<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.760> iphone<00:04:15.359> 5<00:04:15.599> hopefully

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
overshadowed by the iphone 5 hopefully

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.560 
overshadowed by the iphone 5 hopefully
the<00:04:16.049> pictures<00:04:16.380> are<00:04:16.799> just<00:04:17.310> as<00:04:17.519> good<00:04:17.729> here's<00:04:18.479> a

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
the pictures are just as good here's a

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.729 
the pictures are just as good here's a
little<00:04:18.870> innovation<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.560> i<00:04:19.620> love<00:04:19.890> that

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
little innovation that i love that

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.589 
little innovation that i love that
I<00:04:20.829> really<00:04:21.370> didn't<00:04:21.609> predict<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.150> has<00:04:22.300> three

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
I really didn't predict it has three

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.230 
I really didn't predict it has three
microphones<00:04:22.990> got<00:04:23.470> one<00:04:23.740> on<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.009> earpiece<00:04:24.460> one

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
microphones got one on the earpiece one

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.640 
microphones got one on the earpiece one
on<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.419> bottom<00:04:25.569> for<00:04:25.900> calls<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.259> one<00:04:26.440> on<00:04:26.560> the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
on the bottom for calls and one on the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.110 
on the bottom for calls and one on the
back<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.069> it<00:04:27.160> really<00:04:27.370> helps<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:27.699> take<00:04:27.910> good

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
back so it really helps to take good

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.770 
back so it really helps to take good
audio<00:04:28.509> with<00:04:29.319> video<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.310> finally<00:04:31.180> some<00:04:31.509> really

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
audio with video and finally some really

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.110 
audio with video and finally some really
cool<00:04:31.930> enhancements<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.620> call<00:04:32.979> features<00:04:33.460> it's

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
cool enhancements to call features it's

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.620 
cool enhancements to call features it's
got<00:04:34.509> a<00:04:34.750> why<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:35.680> has<00:04:36.460> wideband<00:04:36.910> audio<00:04:37.210> which

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
got a why it has wideband audio which

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.510 
got a why it has wideband audio which
has<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.930> be<00:04:37.960> supported<00:04:38.440> by<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.560> carrier<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:39.160> be

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
has to be supported by the carrier to be

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.159 
has to be supported by the carrier to be

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
able to allow you to hear lower

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.020 
able to allow you to hear lower
frequencies<00:04:41.889> and<00:04:42.160> higher<00:04:42.400> frequencies

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
frequencies and higher frequencies

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.550 
frequencies and higher frequencies
because<00:04:43.150> right<00:04:43.389> now<00:04:43.419> everything<00:04:44.229> is<00:04:44.259> kind<00:04:44.440> of

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
because right now everything is kind of

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.960 
because right now everything is kind of
in<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.740> middle<00:04:44.889> when<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.220> make<00:04:45.370> a<00:04:45.400> phone<00:04:45.699> call

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
in the middle when you make a phone call

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.150 
in the middle when you make a phone call
it<00:04:46.090> sounds<00:04:46.360> like<00:04:46.419> AM<00:04:46.780> radio<00:04:46.990> with<00:04:47.680> wideband

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
it sounds like AM radio with wideband

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.010 
it sounds like AM radio with wideband
audio<00:04:48.430> it's<00:04:48.910> getting<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.330> little<00:04:49.479> bit<00:04:49.690> closer<00:04:49.870> I

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
audio it's getting a little bit closer I

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.990 
audio it's getting a little bit closer I
guess<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.349> FM<00:04:50.740> radio<00:04:51.130> where<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.639> can<00:04:51.759> hear<00:04:51.970> a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
guess to FM radio where you can hear a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.899 
guess to FM radio where you can hear a
little<00:04:52.270> bit<00:04:52.479> more<00:04:52.780> of<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.349> dynamic<00:04:53.830> range<00:04:54.069> also

iPhone 5 is noise cancellation through
the<00:05:03.490> earpiece<00:05:03.699> so<00:05:04.569> we<00:05:04.690> will<00:05:04.810> listen<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.289> the

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
the earpiece so we will listen to the

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:06.659 
the earpiece so we will listen to the
ambient<00:05:05.740> noise<00:05:06.009> if<00:05:06.220> you're<00:05:06.340> in<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.460> loud<00:05:06.639> bar

ambient noise if you're in a loud bar

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.700 
ambient noise if you're in a loud bar
and<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.270> will<00:05:07.389> change<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.930> audio<00:05:08.080> output

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
and it will change the audio output

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.860 
and it will change the audio output
based<00:05:09.159> on<00:05:09.490> your<00:05:09.759> environment<00:05:10.300> which<00:05:10.750> is
