hey that's Bruno he's wearing a tether

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.249 
hey that's Bruno he's wearing a tether
it's<00:00:05.940> attached<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:06.629> tree<00:00:06.960> right<00:00:07.230> here

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
it's attached to this tree right here

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.230 
it's attached to this tree right here
it's<00:00:07.770> actually<00:00:07.919> attached<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.550> my<00:00:08.670> dog<00:00:08.940> walking

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
it's actually attached to my dog walking

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.669 
it's actually attached to my dog walking
belt<00:00:10.280> attached<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> carabiner<00:00:12.530> which<00:00:13.530> is

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
belt attached to a carabiner which is

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.129 
belt attached to a carabiner which is
attached<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.160> tree<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.570> illustrate<00:00:15.839> a

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
attached to a tree so I can illustrate a

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.370 
attached to a tree so I can illustrate a
point<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:18.619> tether<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.980> actually<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.640> leash

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
point this tether is actually a leash

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.080 
point this tether is actually a leash
that's<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.470> leash<00:00:22.619> handle<00:00:23.039> right<00:00:23.220> there<00:00:23.250> so

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that's a leash handle right there so

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.220 
that's a leash handle right there so
this<00:00:25.130> this<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> very<00:00:26.550> useful<00:00:26.849> device<00:00:27.750> here

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
this this is a very useful device here

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.939 
this this is a very useful device here
because<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> leash<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.230> also<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
because this is a leash that is also a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.940 
because this is a leash that is also a
tether<00:00:32.690> and<00:00:33.690> when<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> tether<00:00:34.380> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
tether and when you have a tether you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.709 
tether and when you have a tether you
can<00:00:35.130> manage<00:00:35.370> your<00:00:35.520> dog

come over there Bruno come on come on we

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.310 
come over there Bruno come on come on we
gotta<00:01:33.270> show<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> people<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.079> tether

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
gotta show the people what this tether

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
gotta show the people what this tether
how<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.770> works<00:01:34.979> right<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> his

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
how this works right so there is his

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.560 
how this works right so there is his
maximum<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.430> far<00:01:38.640> away<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:39.119> he<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.420> get

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
maximum that's as far away as he can get

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.140 
maximum that's as far away as he can get
from<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.900> their<00:01:40.320> tether<00:01:41.100> point<00:01:41.520> which<00:01:41.939> is

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
from that their tether point which is

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.399 
from that their tether point which is
the<00:01:42.299> tree<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.340> use<00:01:44.579> your<00:01:44.610> imagination

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
the tree so if you use your imagination

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.260 
the tree so if you use your imagination
you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:47.390> that<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.689> tether<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.149> be

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you can see that a tether is going to be

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.539 
you can see that a tether is going to be
very<00:01:51.689> useful<00:01:51.890> when<00:01:52.890> you're<00:01:53.040> doing<00:01:53.369> things

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
very useful when you're doing things

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.690 
very useful when you're doing things
like<00:01:53.909> eating<00:01:54.750> dinner<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.490> dog<00:01:56.670> is

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
like eating dinner right if your dog is

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
like eating dinner right if your dog is
not<00:01:57.030> trained<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.450> go<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> spot<00:01:57.960> lie<00:01:58.170> down<00:01:58.409> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
not trained to go to a spot lie down and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.490 
not trained to go to a spot lie down and
stay<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.159> tether<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.360> supremely<00:02:00.990> useful

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
stay a tether can be supremely useful

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.370 
stay a tether can be supremely useful
and<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.939> add<00:02:03.149> some<00:02:03.479> training<00:02:03.960> like

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and then you can add some training like

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.749 
and then you can add some training like
throwing<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.799> few<00:02:04.979> biscuits<00:02:05.159> towards<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
throwing a few biscuits towards the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.639 
throwing a few biscuits towards the
pillow<00:02:05.939> giving<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> dog<00:02:06.960> something<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.469> do

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
pillow giving the dog something to do

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.109 
pillow giving the dog something to do
while<00:02:07.890> he's<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> pillow<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.700> chewing<00:02:08.970> on

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
while he's on the pillow like chewing on

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.710 
while he's on the pillow like chewing on
a<00:02:09.149> bully<00:02:09.360> stick

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
a bully stick

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.440 
a bully stick
and<00:02:09.929> eventually<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.129> tether<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:12.150> may<00:02:12.270> not

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and eventually the tether you may not

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.059 
and eventually the tether you may not
need<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> tether

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
need the tether

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.099 
need the tether
more<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.849> tether<00:02:14.120> can<00:02:14.390> complement<00:02:14.930> any

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:15.109 
more but a tether can complement any

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.720 
more but a tether can complement any
