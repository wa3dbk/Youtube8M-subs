three power modes the standard mode

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:20.139 
three power modes the standard mode
obviously<00:01:18.049> is<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.130> mode<00:01:19.310> dedicated<00:01:19.969> to

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
obviously is the mode dedicated to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.440 
obviously is the mode dedicated to
normal<00:01:20.929> application<00:01:21.770> with<00:01:22.369> coming<00:01:23.179> with<00:01:23.420> a

normal application with coming with a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.679 
normal application with coming with a
significant<00:01:24.049> drop<00:01:24.289> in<00:01:24.499> fuel<00:01:24.649> consumption

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
significant drop in fuel consumption

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.809 
significant drop in fuel consumption
there's<00:01:26.689> an<00:01:26.869> echo<00:01:27.079> mode<00:01:27.409> this<00:01:28.159> second<00:01:28.520> mode<00:01:28.639> is

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
there's an echo mode this second mode is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.789 
there's an echo mode this second mode is
really<00:01:28.850> meant<00:01:29.270> for<00:01:29.420> light<00:01:29.749> duty<00:01:29.959> application

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
really meant for light duty application

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.680 
really meant for light duty application
where<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.429> can<00:01:31.639> even<00:01:32.060> go<00:01:32.599> deeper<00:01:33.020> down

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
where you can even go deeper down

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.560 
where you can even go deeper down
in<00:01:34.780> low<00:01:35.050> fuel<00:01:35.410> consumption<00:01:35.830> rates<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.700> there

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
in low fuel consumption rates and there

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.260 
in low fuel consumption rates and there
and<00:01:37.780> there's<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.170> HP<00:01:38.740> mode<00:01:39.040> it<00:01:39.550> is<00:01:39.580> really

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
and there's the HP mode it is really

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.220 
and there's the HP mode it is really
dedicated<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:41.140> very<00:01:41.650> tough<00:01:42.190> applications<00:01:43.230> so

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
dedicated to very tough applications so

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.830 
dedicated to very tough applications so
with<00:01:45.070> this<00:01:45.280> button<00:01:45.520> in<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.270> console<00:01:46.720> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
with this button in the console the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.840 
with this button in the console the
operator<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:47.440> easily<00:01:47.860> switch<00:01:48.160> from<00:01:48.370> one<00:01:48.580> mode

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
operator can easily switch from one mode

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.730 
operator can easily switch from one mode
to<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.240> other<00:01:49.450> depending<00:01:50.200> on<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.380> actual

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
to the other depending on the actual

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.050 
to the other depending on the actual
application<00:01:50.890> rates<00:01:52.740> then<00:01:53.740> maybe<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.880> last

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
application rates then maybe the last

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.850 
application rates then maybe the last
point<00:01:55.450> about<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.810> e-series<00:01:56.140> cab<00:01:56.530> is

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
point about the e-series cab is

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.470 
point about the e-series cab is
something<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.490> operator<00:01:57.820> will<00:01:58.000> not<00:01:58.210> notice

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
something the operator will not notice

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.040 
something the operator will not notice
until<00:01:58.930> he<00:01:59.470> starts<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.160> engine<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.750> the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
until he starts the engine it's the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
until he starts the engine it's the
noise<00:02:02.290> level<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.520> cab<00:02:03.760> in<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.360> series<00:02:04.810> has<00:02:05.470> four

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
noise level the cab in a series has four

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.300 
noise level the cab in a series has four
decibel<00:02:06.790> lower<00:02:07.420> sound<00:02:08.230> level<00:02:08.740> than<00:02:09.070> the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
decibel lower sound level than the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.280 
decibel lower sound level than the
series<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:09.970> it's<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.179> significant<00:02:10.810> drop<00:02:11.050> in

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
series so it's a significant drop in

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.800 
series so it's a significant drop in
sound<00:02:11.770> level<00:02:12.190> which<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.610> course<00:02:12.640> lead<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.630> less

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
sound level which of course lead to less

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.840 
sound level which of course lead to less
fatigue<00:02:14.320> over<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.770> whole<00:02:15.100> shift<00:02:15.460> for<00:02:15.760> an

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
fatigue over a whole shift for an

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.170 
fatigue over a whole shift for an
operator<00:02:16.210> so<00:02:17.130> efficiency<00:02:18.130> we<00:02:18.550> said<00:02:18.850> it's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
operator so efficiency we said it's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.880 
operator so efficiency we said it's
about<00:02:19.300> few<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:19.960> about<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.260> operator<00:02:20.620> but

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
about few it's about the operator but

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.160 
about few it's about the operator but
it's<00:02:21.010> also<00:02:21.190> about<00:02:21.400> maintenance<00:02:22.170> eseries

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
it's also about maintenance eseries
