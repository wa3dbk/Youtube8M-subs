over 60 years ago I was really really
stuck<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.359> mindset<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.109> was<00:00:31.410> even<00:00:31.679> worried

about<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.369> blending<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:33.030> food<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.690> stage

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
about like blending my food at one stage

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.990 
about like blending my food at one stage
because<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.440> didn't<00:00:34.620> want<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> metal<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:35.760> hit

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
because I didn't want the metal then hit

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.930 
because I didn't want the metal then hit
the<00:00:36.510> bananas<00:00:36.960> hit<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> fruit<00:00:37.890> which<00:00:38.219> left<00:00:38.760> me
