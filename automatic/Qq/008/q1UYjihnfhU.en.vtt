cords and you can see that overall is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.059 
cords and you can see that overall is
very<00:02:48.180> well<00:02:48.780> constructed<00:02:49.439> here<00:02:49.709> we<00:02:49.799> had<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
very well constructed here we had the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.399 
very well constructed here we had the
InFocus<00:02:50.549> logo<00:02:50.879> once<00:02:51.120> again<00:02:51.450> now<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.019> battery

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
InFocus logo once again now the battery

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.890 
InFocus logo once again now the battery
is<00:02:52.500> not<00:02:52.769> removable<00:02:52.829> but<00:02:53.579> it<00:02:53.849> is<00:02:53.969> a<00:02:54.120> 2500

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
is not removable but it is a 2500

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.149 
is not removable but it is a 2500
million<00:02:55.200> batteries<00:02:55.409> so<00:02:55.680> I'm<00:02:55.769> assuming<00:02:56.010> it's

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
million batteries so I'm assuming it's

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.520 
million batteries so I'm assuming it's
gonna<00:02:56.370> last<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.730> long<00:02:56.879> time<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.959> let's<00:02:58.349> go<00:02:58.439> ahead

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
gonna last a long time so let's go ahead

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.289 
gonna last a long time so let's go ahead
and<00:02:58.709> install<00:02:58.859> this<00:02:59.129> back<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.639> let's<00:02:59.879> see<00:03:00.060> what

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
and install this back and let's see what

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.789 
and install this back and let's see what
