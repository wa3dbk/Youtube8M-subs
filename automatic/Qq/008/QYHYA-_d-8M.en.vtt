Mindstorms<00:00:06.839> team<00:00:07.319> today<00:00:07.859> I'll<00:00:08.069> show<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.490> how

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
Mindstorms team today I'll show you how

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.540 
Mindstorms team today I'll show you how
to<00:00:09.269> build<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.570> program<00:00:09.750> using<00:00:10.290> sensors<00:00:10.830> so

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
to build a program using sensors so

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.250 
to build a program using sensors so
we'll<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.910> using<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.780> P<00:00:12.960> brick<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.730> USB<00:00:14.730> cable<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
we'll be using the P brick a USB cable a

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.970 
we'll be using the P brick a USB cable a
computer<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.789> cable<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.930> sensor<00:00:19.289> I'll<00:00:19.590> be

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
computer a cable and a sensor I'll be

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.730 
computer a cable and a sensor I'll be
using<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> touch<00:00:20.520> sensor<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.560> so<00:00:22.560> let's

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
using the touch sensor for this so let's

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.470 
using the touch sensor for this so let's
get<00:00:22.890> started

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
get started

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.939 
get started
we're<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> start<00:00:24.930> by<00:00:25.140> opening<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
we're going to start by opening up the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.920 
we're going to start by opening up the
project<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.580> we've<00:00:26.730> been<00:00:27.000> using<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.480> far<00:00:27.510> in

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
project that we've been using so far in

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.250 
project that we've been using so far in
the<00:00:28.439> other<00:00:28.560> tutorials<00:00:29.810> we're<00:00:30.810> gonna<00:00:30.990> close

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the other tutorials we're gonna close

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.380 
the other tutorials we're gonna close
the<00:00:31.500> content<00:00:31.859> editor<00:00:31.949> again<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:33.239> we'll

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the content editor again and then we'll

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.229 
the content editor again and then we'll
create<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.050> new<00:00:34.200> program<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.600> call<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.170> my

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
create a new program and call it my

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
create a new program and call it my
first<00:00:39.950> sensor<00:00:42.440> now<00:00:43.440> there<00:00:43.649> are<00:00:43.710> many

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
first sensor now there are many

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.080 
first sensor now there are many
different<00:00:44.219> ways<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.760> use<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
different ways that you can use the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.610 
different ways that you can use the
sensor<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.110> showing<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.469> one

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
sensor I'm going to be showing you one

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.940 
sensor I'm going to be showing you one
of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> simplest<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:48.739> demonstrate<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
of the simplest one to demonstrate this

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.979 
of the simplest one to demonstrate this
I'll<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.489> using<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.059> sound<00:00:51.300> blocks<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.870> I'll

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
I'll be using the sound blocks so I'll

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
I'll be using the sound blocks so I'll
start<00:00:52.320> by<00:00:52.410> dragging<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:54.329> sound<00:00:54.629> blocks<00:00:55.640> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
start by dragging in to sound blocks and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.779 
start by dragging in to sound blocks and
I'll<00:00:56.850> select<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> sounds<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.789> I'll

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I'll select the sounds for this one I'll

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.009 
I'll select the sounds for this one I'll
be<00:00:59.850> using<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.710> communication<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
be using go down to communication and

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.609 
be using go down to communication and
then<00:01:04.019> taking<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:05.240> go<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> first<00:01:07.470> one

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
then taking there go for the first one

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.130 
then taking there go for the first one
and<00:01:08.270> I'll<00:01:09.270> take<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:10.710> eb-3<00:01:11.659> for<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> second

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and I'll take the eb-3 for the second

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.100 
and I'll take the eb-3 for the second
one<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:14.130> let's<00:01:14.369> download<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.600> know

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
one now let's download this so we know

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
one now let's download this so we know
where<00:01:16.259> we're<00:01:16.409> starting<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.340> we'll<00:01:17.520> connect

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
where we're starting so we'll connect

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.200 
where we're starting so we'll connect
the<00:01:18.509> P<00:01:18.720> brick<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.290> computer<00:01:20.180> using<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the P brick to the computer using the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.200 
the P brick to the computer using the
USB<00:01:21.299> cable<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:24.710> then<00:01:25.710> once<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.310> pops<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.030> in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
USB cable and then once it pops up in

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.069 
USB cable and then once it pops up in
here<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.479> connected<00:01:28.100> we'll<00:01:29.100> download<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:31.400> and

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
here is connected we'll download it and

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.140 
here is connected we'll download it and
then<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.200> go<00:01:34.320> over<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> P<00:01:35.520> brick<00:01:38.150> open

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
then we go over here to the P brick open

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.090 
then we go over here to the P brick open
the<00:01:39.240> project<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.930> select<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.740> my<00:01:40.890> first

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the project and select the my first

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.590 
the project and select the my first
sensor<00:01:41.430> program<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.909> you're<00:01:45.090> hurt<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
sensor program and as you're hurt you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
sensor program and as you're hurt you
played<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> two<00:01:46.259> sounds<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.890> after<00:01:47.220> each

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
played the two sounds right after each

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.950 
played the two sounds right after each
other<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.659> back<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> software<00:01:50.960> I'm

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
other if we go back to the software I'm

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.460 
other if we go back to the software I'm
gonna<00:01:52.170> introduce<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> new<00:01:52.920> block<00:01:53.159> now

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
gonna introduce you to a new block now

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.080 
gonna introduce you to a new block now
this<00:01:55.640> would<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> weight<00:01:57.030> block<00:01:58.850> what<00:01:59.850> this

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
this would be the weight block what this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.749 
this would be the weight block what this
does<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:01.619> weights<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.280> second

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
does is that it now weights one second

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.600 
does is that it now weights one second
so<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.240> says<00:02:03.450> go<00:02:03.750> then<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> waits<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.159> second

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
so it says go then it waits one second

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.839 
so it says go then it waits one second
and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> says<00:02:06.600> eb-3<00:02:07.220> let's<00:02:08.220> download<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
and then it says eb-3 let's download and

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.120 
and then it says eb-3 let's download and
try<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.060> out

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
try it out

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.150 
try it out
take<00:02:12.130> over<00:02:12.400> here<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.750> like<00:02:13.870> my<00:02:14.320> first<00:02:14.590> project

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
take over here so like my first project

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.260 
take over here so like my first project
and<00:02:16.020> then<00:02:17.020> my<00:02:17.650> first<00:02:17.890> sensor<00:02:18.220> again<00:02:18.780> pause

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
and then my first sensor again pause

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.790 
and then my first sensor again pause
perfect

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
perfect

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.550 
perfect
now<00:02:23.800> wait<00:02:24.580> box<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.450> very<00:02:25.780> easy<00:02:26.020> way<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.350> use

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
now wait box is a very easy way to use

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.090 
now wait box is a very easy way to use
sensors<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.510> I'm<00:02:29.320> gonna<00:02:29.500> show<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:29.800> how<00:02:30.040> to

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
sensors so I'm gonna show you how to

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.890 
sensors so I'm gonna show you how to
combine<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.760> wait<00:02:30.910> block<00:02:31.180> with<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.720> touch

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
combine the wait block with the touch

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.650 
combine the wait block with the touch
sensor<00:02:32.580> before<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.700> go<00:02:33.820> into<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.180> programming

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
sensor before we go into the programming

want<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.400> have<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.720> program<00:03:25.989> say<00:03:26.590> go<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.190> then

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
want to have the program say go and then

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.360 
want to have the program say go and then
wait<00:03:27.820> until<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.270> touch<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:29.080> sensor<00:03:29.320> before<00:03:30.280> it

says eb-3 so what I want to do is I want
to<00:03:33.250> compare<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.690> state<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:36.010> sensor<00:03:37.290> like

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
to compare the state of the sensor like

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.979 
to compare the state of the sensor like
this<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:40.090> state<00:03:40.300> I<00:03:40.330> want<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.600> compare<00:03:40.870> it

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
this and the state I want to compare it

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.740 
this and the state I want to compare it
to<00:03:41.140> is<00:03:41.350> 1<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.920> if<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.130> press<00:03:42.640> this<00:03:42.750> parameter

released pressed and bumped and I wanted
to<00:03:50.380> check<00:03:50.620> if<00:03:50.800> it<00:03:50.950> was<00:03:51.070> pressed<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.870> checked

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
to check if it was pressed so I checked

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.840 
to check if it was pressed so I checked
I<00:03:53.830> select<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.590> it's<00:03:56.770> gonna<00:03:56.920> say<00:03:57.190> go<00:03:57.580> and

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
I select this so it's gonna say go and

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.940 
I select this so it's gonna say go and
then<00:03:58.450> it'll<00:03:58.600> wait<00:03:58.900> for<00:03:59.260> me<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.530> touch<00:03:59.770> the

but as I explained to you there were

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.580 
but as I explained to you there were
different<00:04:25.479> states<00:04:25.750> so<00:04:26.169> I'm<00:04:26.229> going<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.470> show

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
different states so I'm going to show

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.700 
different states so I'm going to show
you<00:04:26.680> what<00:04:26.830> happens<00:04:27.190> if<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.539> select<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:29.410> release

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
you what happens if I select the release

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.409 
you what happens if I select the release
state<00:04:30.009> instead<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.860> we'll<00:04:33.009> download<00:04:33.250> this<00:04:36.419> go

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
state instead so we'll download this go

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:44.189 
state instead so we'll download this go
over<00:04:37.659> here<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:39.389> play<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:40.599> program<00:04:40.960> again<00:04:43.199> so

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
over here and play the program again so

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.839 
over here and play the program again so
as<00:04:44.349> you<00:04:44.500> heard<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:44.979> played<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.520> right<00:04:45.699> after

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
as you heard it played it right after

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.149 
as you heard it played it right after
ditch<00:04:46.150> each<00:04:46.449> other<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:46.960> that's<00:04:47.560> because<00:04:47.949> it

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
ditch each other and that's because it

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.580 
ditch each other and that's because it
was<00:04:48.310> waiting<00:04:48.490> for<00:04:48.639> me<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.419> release<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:50.349> touch

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
was waiting for me to release the touch

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.369 
was waiting for me to release the touch
sensor<00:04:50.979> but<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.610> was<00:04:51.699> already<00:04:52.030> released<00:04:52.259> so<00:04:53.259> if

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:53.379 
sensor but it was already released so if

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:56.480 
sensor but it was already released so if
I<00:04:53.470> press<00:04:53.710> this<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.340> then<00:04:54.550> play<00:04:54.759> the<00:04:54.880> program

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
out so that's how you build a program

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.300 
out so that's how you build a program
using<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.080> touch<00:05:05.409> sensor<00:05:05.800> in<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.069> next

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
using the touch sensor in the next

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.159 
using the touch sensor in the next
episode<00:05:06.729> I'm<00:05:07.000> gonna<00:05:07.240> show<00:05:07.330> you<00:05:07.539> how<00:05:07.780> to<00:05:07.840> build
