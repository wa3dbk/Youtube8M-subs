we<00:00:09.690> saw<00:00:10.580> the<00:00:11.580> MRP<00:00:12.120> enhanced<00:00:12.990> CDI<00:00:13.440> for<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.889> 250

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
we saw the MRP enhanced CDI for the 250

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.330 
we saw the MRP enhanced CDI for the 250
it's<00:00:15.000> got<00:00:15.179> an<00:00:15.269> adjustable<00:00:15.800> timing<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.100> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
it's got an adjustable timing on it and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.120 
it's got an adjustable timing on it and
then<00:00:18.180> we're<00:00:18.330> also<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> install<00:00:19.130> an

your<00:01:04.580> coil<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:06.470> goes<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:06.890> your<00:01:06.979> spark<00:01:07.280> plug

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
your coil this goes to your spark plug

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.380 
your coil this goes to your spark plug
here<00:01:08.770> now<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.830> change<00:01:10.100> out<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.369> CDI<00:01:10.700> very

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
here now to change out the CDI very

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.960 
here now to change out the CDI very
simple<00:01:12.310> unplug<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:19.250> slides<00:01:19.550> right<00:01:19.700> out

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
simple unplug it and it slides right out

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.639 
simple unplug it and it slides right out
of<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.150> plastic<00:01:20.630> holder<00:01:23.320> there's<00:01:24.320> your<00:01:24.530> old

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649

CD<00:01:25.039> I<00:01:25.600> take<00:01:26.600> your<00:01:26.780> new<00:01:26.899> CDI<00:01:27.289> which<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.860> slightly

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
CD I take your new CDI which is slightly

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.310 
CD I take your new CDI which is slightly
larger<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.880> little<00:01:29.360> more<00:01:29.539> of<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.810> fit<00:01:30.110> in

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
larger it's a little more of a fit in

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:41.390 
larger it's a little more of a fit in
here<00:01:30.649> but<00:01:31.430> it'll<00:01:31.580> go

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.920 

and<00:01:42.270> plug<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.530> new<00:01:43.680> one<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:50.150> put<00:01:51.150> your<00:01:51.360> rubber

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and plug the new one in put your rubber

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.180 
and plug the new one in put your rubber
grommet<00:01:52.500> back<00:01:52.800> on<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:55.620> it<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
grommet back on there and that's it and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.080 
grommet back on there and that's it and
as<00:01:56.730> far<00:01:56.790> as<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.180> coil<00:01:58.310> again<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.520> coil<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
as far as the coil again this coil is a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.770 
as far as the coil again this coil is a
lot<00:02:00.330> larger<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.070> 250<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.510> one<00:02:03.660> that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
lot larger for the 250 then the one that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.240 
lot larger for the 250 then the one that
actually<00:02:03.870> comes<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.650> but<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.040> pull

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
actually comes in it but you just pull

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.270 
actually comes in it but you just pull
the<00:02:05.370> one<00:02:05.580> bolt<00:02:05.910> down<00:02:06.230> put<00:02:07.230> this<00:02:07.380> back<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.980> both

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the one bolt down put this back in both

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.250 
the one bolt down put this back in both
your<00:02:08.490> plugs<00:02:08.760> they're<00:02:09.479> color-coded<00:02:10.050> green

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
your plugs they're color-coded green

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.140 
your plugs they're color-coded green
black<00:02:11.540> green<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.570> black<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.730> then<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.910> goes
