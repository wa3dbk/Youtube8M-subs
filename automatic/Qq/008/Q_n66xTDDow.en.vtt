think<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.470> same<00:01:37.800> for<00:01:38.070> anybody<00:01:38.430> any

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
think it's all the same for anybody any

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
think it's all the same for anybody any
kind<00:01:38.910> of<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.690> major<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.800> all<00:01:40.980> just

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
kind of you know major it's all just

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
kind of you know major it's all just
simple<00:01:42.090> angles<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.510> stuff<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.930> engineering

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
simple angles and stuff like engineering

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.800 
simple angles and stuff like engineering
just<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.280> way<00:01:44.460> over<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.030> over<00:01:45.630> those

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
just it's way over like over those

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.620 
just it's way over like over those
implants<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:48.240> rocket<00:01:50.150> summer<00:01:51.150> asked<00:01:51.360> me<00:01:51.480> really

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
implants a rocket summer asked me really

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.180 
implants a rocket summer asked me really
what<00:01:51.810> i<00:01:51.840> thought<00:01:52.080> was<00:01:52.170> harder<00:01:52.500> than<00:01:52.530> blocking

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
what i thought was harder than blocking

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.810 
what i thought was harder than blocking
or<00:01:53.520> engineering<00:01:53.910> is<00:01:54.090> definitely<00:01:54.480> engineering

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
or engineering is definitely engineering

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.860 
or engineering is definitely engineering
what<00:01:56.820> type<00:01:56.970> of<00:01:57.000> engineering<00:01:57.480> do<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.660> want<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
what type of engineering do you want to

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.600 
what type of engineering do you want to
do<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.230> you<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.590> your<00:01:58.650> free<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.160> out<00:01:59.250> um

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
do when you get your free get out um

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.230 
do when you get your free get out um
right<00:02:00.180> now<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.330> studying<00:02:00.780> civil<00:02:01.020> yeah<00:02:01.650> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
right now I'm studying civil yeah and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.990 
right now I'm studying civil yeah and
you<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.360> kind<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.690> like<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> conduct<00:02:04.740> our

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
you know I kind of like to conduct our

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.219 
you know I kind of like to conduct our
construction<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.150> road<00:02:06.300> work<00:02:06.360> parts<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
construction and road work parts of that

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.530 
construction and road work parts of that
so<00:02:07.680> that's<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> whole<00:02:08.850> lot<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.090> angles<00:02:09.390> i

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
so that's not a whole lot of angles i

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.820 
so that's not a whole lot of angles i
just<00:02:09.720> i<00:02:09.810> was<00:02:10.080> only<00:02:10.170> bet<00:02:10.350> they're<00:02:10.500> digging<00:02:10.740> in

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
just i was only bet they're digging in

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.850 
just i was only bet they're digging in
the<00:02:10.890> dirt<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.250> know<00:02:12.290> what<00:02:13.290> was<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.620> hardest

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the dirt you know what was the hardest

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
the dirt you know what was the hardest
part<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.670> transition<00:02:15.150> was<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.840> just

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
part of the transition was it just

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.910 
part of the transition was it just
coming<00:02:16.530> herbs<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.340> um<00:02:18.500> yeah<00:02:19.500> probably

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
coming herbs with it um yeah probably

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.240 
coming herbs with it um yeah probably
just<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.550> first<00:02:21.140> couple<00:02:22.140> days<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.800> was<00:02:22.950> kind<00:02:23.190> of

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
just the first couple days I was kind of

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.880 
just the first couple days I was kind of
hard<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.870> get<00:02:24.870> my<00:02:25.020> head<00:02:25.200> around<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.530> i<00:02:25.650> guess

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
hard to get my head around it i guess

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.250 
hard to get my head around it i guess
and<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.280> know<00:02:26.400> deciding<00:02:27.300> what<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and you know deciding what to do and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.380 
and you know deciding what to do and
sidon<00:02:29.070> what'd<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.340> best<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.760> me<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.090> but

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
sidon what'd be best for me and that but

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.910 
sidon what'd be best for me and that but
then<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:30.690> once<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.959> made<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> transition<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.709> so

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
then like once I made a transition is so

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.830 
then like once I made a transition is so
easy<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.280> know<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.520> I'm<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.450> know<00:02:33.570> all<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
easy you know like I'm you know all the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.110 
easy you know like I'm you know all the

guys are just really welcoming is all

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.580 
guys are just really welcoming is all
the<00:02:36.330> great<00:02:36.510> they're<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:36.930> great<00:02:37.080> guys<00:02:37.320> and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
the great they're just great guys and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.229 
the great they're just great guys and
the<00:02:38.160> guys<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.489> defense<00:02:38.580> would<00:02:38.880> like<00:02:38.970> they<00:02:39.150> were

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
the guys on defense would like they were

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.430 
the guys on defense would like they were
holding<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.510> against<00:02:39.870> me<00:02:39.959> or<00:02:40.080> anything<00:02:40.260> so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
holding it against me or anything so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.920 
holding it against me or anything so
it's<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.180> know<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.450> think<00:02:42.570> everybody

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
it's just you know I think everybody

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.540 
it's just you know I think everybody
kind<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.170> rises<00:02:43.320> was<00:02:43.590> best<00:02:43.890> for<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.070> team<00:02:44.250> and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
kind of rises was best for the team and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.360 
kind of rises was best for the team and
says<00:02:45.360> not<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.050> bad<00:02:46.230> transmission<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.920> guess<00:02:47.190> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
says not a bad transmission I guess you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.790 
says not a bad transmission I guess you
look<00:02:48.000> at<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.420> mean<00:02:48.930> both<00:02:49.200> sides<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.620> ball

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
look at I mean both sides of the ball

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.920 
look at I mean both sides of the ball
need<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.280> needs<00:02:50.760> some<00:02:50.970> experience<00:02:51.570> on<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
need it needs some experience on the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.280 
need it needs some experience on the
line<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:53.130> maybe<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.060> offense<00:02:54.420> was<00:02:54.720> what<00:02:55.140> may

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
line but maybe the offense was what may

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.100 
line but maybe the offense was what may
be<00:02:55.350> more<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.769> calling<00:02:56.250> for<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.700> um<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.690> think

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
be more of a calling for you um I think

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.620 
be more of a calling for you um I think
so<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.280> know<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.550> defense<00:02:59.760> like<00:03:00.209> we<00:03:00.450> got

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
so and you know on defense like we got

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.090 
so and you know on defense like we got
young<00:03:00.870> guys<00:03:01.050> but<00:03:01.260> they're<00:03:01.350> going<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.980> know

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
young guys but they're going to you know

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.430 
young guys but they're going to you know
the<00:03:02.280> Sean<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.760> Grady<00:03:02.970> are<00:03:03.120> great<00:03:03.870> players<00:03:04.140> and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
the Sean and Grady are great players and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.840 
the Sean and Grady are great players and
they're<00:03:04.560> gonna<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:04.860> great<00:03:05.100> players<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.700> I

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
they're gonna be great players and I

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.830 
they're gonna be great players and I
think<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.840> just<00:03:07.610> we<00:03:08.610> needed<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.720> know

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
think we just we needed a you know

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.960 
think we just we needed a you know
oftens<00:03:10.170> lon<00:03:10.320> there's<00:03:10.530> five<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.739> us<00:03:10.980> opposed<00:03:11.760> to

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
oftens lon there's five of us opposed to

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.180 
oftens lon there's five of us opposed to
the<00:03:12.120> two<00:03:12.330> inside<00:03:12.750> guys<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.170> defense<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.950> I

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
the two inside guys on defense so I

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.030 
the two inside guys on defense so I
think<00:03:15.030> we<00:03:15.480> needed<00:03:15.660> more<00:03:15.989> depth<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
think we needed more depth on the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.680 
think we needed more depth on the
offensive<00:03:17.400> line<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.060> could<00:03:18.330> help<00:03:18.480> out<00:03:18.570> with

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
offensive line and I could help out with
