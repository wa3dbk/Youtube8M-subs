00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:01.869
 that's the viewers 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:05.950
 this morning suares and certainly for Flanders still a lot of the 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.610
 Clearances Meanwhile, az does not drink so much coffee there are on this 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.609
 a few more local clearings 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:18.169
 especially pocket a lot of swirls and still get dry at the moment 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.039
 slowly but surely 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.560
 it is about the chance of some bees being stunned professionally 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.369
 France 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.460
 and already received quite some clouds 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.580
 only a few small holes but many states that they do not carry on and while me 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.400
 at the following hours I am still going to expect a left fresh and at a may 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.120
 We expect 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.090
 in the course of the afternoon that chance will increase and then certainly one 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.860
 on the other side of the country that can be extremely intense 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.820
 if nothing with thunder and lightning there 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.680
 it is the eighth and culture of 20 degrees and misses on 22 while doing so 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.670
 go a little cooler in the coastal Kempen 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.690
 with a moderate wind 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.130
 and then tonight mt tonight she is really not just bees or intent 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.210
 Thunderstorms with the side of the country that opportunities in the north will also be one 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.989
 small room had big words 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.100
 we remain a depression under its influence 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.890
 with there is a priest giving full and then in that case with emphasis on 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.250
 the start at zero points 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.469
 and dsm 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.910
 nothing there with thunder and lightning 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.680
 the temperatures remain quite high so again a mild night with 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.210
 minimum of 10 to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.370
 thirteen states and after having wet weather nice sex it gets a little drier off 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.340
 still not being able to keep dry everywhere 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.439
 And then there can always be a number of courses of the remain 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.520
 does other things 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.859
 from depressions then comes supreme the rest of the week they change 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:37.229
 in 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.429
 totally people there is already what they are more likely to have on an island the other saturday 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.770
 a lot of places could stay dry or loser a dry one 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.670
 period 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.259
 But in the course of Sunday there will be the odds on some bees again or again 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.630
 enlarge here we have a malfunction of offline dykes en start you next week 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.230
 get there that happens to be not immediately lost 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.020
 and certainly not be beautiful with its number of bees after a moderate wind 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.980
 and the afm cloths that are also a thunderstorm are locally that really can be 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.850
 become intense in it 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.510
 that it is a bit cooler and temperatures around the midi theater but still remain 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.749
 always quite a soft last year time frank house 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:18.010
 I have saturday making it a little drier on the weather maps although it is a local 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.199
 at still 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:23.569
 stop thanking you for this afternoon and happy to see you daily tonight 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.949
 expect to get a little bit over and over again with a blunder of work 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.199
 and temperatures of 10 to 13 degrees 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.349
 also you have to keep it hit and miss with last renkum or a bit 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.979
 regime 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.199
 and also possible land first and that hour of 15 to 20 degrees 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.330
 the following days it remains volatile with a number of bees, especially on Sundays 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.249
 the best viewers 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.339
 Question 2 today with clearances interspersed with cloud fields 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.549
 and in the course of the afternoon there are also some showers when you do 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.799
 Come for the afternoon it still remained dry in most places after the March 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.369
 afternoon 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.729
 she has here and there a few sets to make the inters a short one 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:06.179
 time 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.029
 viruses times yellow precipitate and in wolvega 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.980
 are still some to make the hard work 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.250
 and they may come tonight and tonight our directions are tonight and 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.430
 tonight it can and certainly not keep dry on the contrary spread everywhere 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.260
 all over the country I can occasionally know what these cases or van dyke may or may not be 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.359
 with a thunderbolt and in the meantime 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.339
 off to 10 to 13 years so it wrestles a soft 8 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.029
 and the beautiful ornamental we remain under the influence of this Christmas depression 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.499
 They also alternate again with a number of knits 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.069
 some places will not leave nearly as good as dry places however 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.800
 there may also be new stacking clouds to develop and may experience to 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.569
 this earth 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.779
 and so that happens to be a squat, we haven't lost much money, I can drive you off 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:55.989
 and see the sun 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.010
 the afghanistan still tops with a number of books and stacking clouds as well 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.279
 and therefore a chance on the number of bees finds this idea 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.170
 if nothing with otherwise and lightning 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.650
 and that it is from 15 to 20 years old still remains the free softer 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.049
 the time of the year 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.499
 and the days thereafter 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:16.150
 remained under the influence of it and depression 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.400
 and that there was a kind of okay Saturday for very changeable weather but the number 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.980
 bees remains limited with some luck 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.379
 it stays dry in that street 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:29.219
 without, on the other hand, the chances are yes, but dry weather is 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:30.130
 which is too small 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.599
 the also comes a malfunction closer to the set 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:37.419
 by Sunday the chances are again higher on a number of prizes and they march 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.570
 usually still 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.990
 maybe a few clearances are there that are less than just beginning 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.940
 For example, next week on Monday and Tuesday the cheese promise to make something 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.350
 drier me 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.140
 and also that Saturday it promised to be drier bit coolers 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.749
 with temperatures than yesterday and rich 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.669
 may I like that there is more about it
