00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.689
 hello today for a big parcel with 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.619
 aliexpress and I punched by track number 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.650
 By track code, these are backlit headphones 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.619
 should in the dark glows I don't know there 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.590
 I will review in detail well do it on 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.760
 another channel if suddenly a hand like me 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:43.420
 made a review will throw off the link so well let's 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.080
 let's open it is that itself under the link itself 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.570
 the package went to me for 17 days, that is, I 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:57.730
 personally he was surprised for the record Senate not 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:01:00.310
 it was necessary to be so appreciated so stand at 5 to 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.350
 estimated at 5 dollars it seems the weight is not 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.350
 indicated so 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.250
 AF stand so well, that's all 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.200
 Only here would not cut the pair 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.369
 wires i don't know where 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:28.659
 and here principle can enter 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:31.590
 neatly do here like 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:36.610
 neatly make such progress 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:46.289
 yes, I'm fine, and that's what 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:49.780
 for us there is nothing so melancholy curl 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:55.229
 here nothing more lies here let 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:59.830
 empty here here by the way the legs themselves 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.689
 I ordered the same color by the way i like 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.360
 seller thank you what the seller 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.209
 brought exactly these, that is, the rules are 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.140
 such that you order another color 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.039
 let's say red comes perfectly 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.470
 other 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:20.730
 how open here I love these 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:24.310
 ways of opening so headphones 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.890
 That's how they look in the dark 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 glow let's roll this up 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.829
 must in the dark at least 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:37.420
 glow wire length in principle 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:39.750
 normal is enough for me so here everything is in 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.700
 on the other side we remove the legs too 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.739
 naturally so i will connect to my 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.160
 phone so now put music here 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:55.959
 so let's 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:59.459
 music so we connect here here 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.459
 what we connect 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.170
 so kind of you don't have to listen somehow 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:20.730
 I do not know how to play 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:31.120
 by the way i didn't expect so ok by the way 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:38.019
 right here so focusing need come on 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:40.569
 the focus is like the world, as you can see 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:46.900
 here it is to play right to 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:51.909
 I don't know how this whole thing is 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.370
 plays this low let's 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:57.269
 let's raise this most likely when 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.549
 the phone talking is types 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:04.030
 pause i put it pause worth the music 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.180
 very comfortable so principle you hear 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.180
 the song 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:13.030
 how do they sit in the ear 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.979
 by the way here is still stuck here so here 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.400
 see further it does not have to go like this 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:26.530
 slightly done let's check on 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:30.610
 ears by the way in the ears plays a very amount 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:34.419
 so sorry if you plot u and noise i 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.150
 just dropped the microphone and let's 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.380
 pause the song in principle headphones 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:45.060
 play very loud so let's preview 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.060
 Focus will do so even better is 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.110
 that's the principle that's how you see these 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.220
 here are the well- made headphones here 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.130
 the second part of 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.710
 I did not like the blue I will 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.960
 I will be positive feedback to the buyer for 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.479
 delivery time first and second for 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.630
 quality for the quality of delivery in the third 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:11.039
 for the quality of the goods is the second parcel but 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.930
 the third floor is not the third such 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.300
 well that is the quickest package 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.479
 which came to me in 17 days 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.160
 15 days delivery was us reached for 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.360
 17 days and 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:29.410
 state of super-duper simply nowhere here I 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.960
 I do not know what you see here at the cutting 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:37.080
 Well, no matter what the quality is good 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.669
 the sound is also great and I like it 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.680
 I will put good reviews 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.509

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.599
 Writing how much I bought 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.240
 bought them for 190 rubles about 5 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:52.870
 dollars around 5 dollars is well 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.570
