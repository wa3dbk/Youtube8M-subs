curve shaped body thing and you draw his

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.679 
curve shaped body thing and you draw his
aren't<00:01:18.439> Ultimatrix<00:01:19.439> sign<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:22.040> then

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
aren't Ultimatrix sign right there then

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.030 
aren't Ultimatrix sign right there then
you<00:01:24.689> draw<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> little<00:01:25.439> bit<00:01:25.590> more<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.860> his

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you draw a little bit more of his

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:38.070 
you draw a little bit more of his
exoskeleton<00:01:27.229> thing<00:01:28.640> that

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.540 

I<00:01:39.840> almost<00:01:40.840> done<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.410> was<00:01:41.530> quick<00:01:41.860> he's<00:01:42.280> really

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
I almost done that was quick he's really

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.020 
I almost done that was quick he's really
easy<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.180> draw<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.660> stuff<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.680> up<00:01:44.860> here<00:01:45.030> hide

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
easy to draw and stuff so up here hide

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.890 
easy to draw and stuff so up here hide
the<00:01:46.300> struck<00:01:47.310> at<00:01:48.310> this<00:01:48.550> type<00:01:49.120> of<00:01:49.150> this<00:01:49.570> thing

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
the struck at this type of this thing

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.370 
the struck at this type of this thing
has<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.320> very<00:01:50.650> top<00:01:51.040> little<00:01:52.050> things<00:01:53.050> you<00:01:53.350> just

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
has a very top little things you just

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.790 
has a very top little things you just
it's<00:01:53.860> black<00:01:54.820> it's<00:01:55.690> like<00:01:55.870> yellow<00:01:56.320> stripes<00:01:56.650> and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
it's black it's like yellow stripes and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.070 
it's black it's like yellow stripes and
then<00:01:56.890> these<00:01:57.100> dots<00:01:57.670> are<00:01:57.880> green<00:01:58.150> and<00:01:58.300> those<00:01:58.870> are

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
then these dots are green and those are

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.400 
then these dots are green and those are
yellow<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.680> yellow<00:02:00.100> stripes<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.960> then<00:02:02.140> you

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
yellow and yellow stripes so then you

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.680 
yellow and yellow stripes so then you
finish<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.860> exoskeleton<00:02:03.670> well<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.300> can't<00:02:04.540> do

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
finish the exoskeleton well you can't do

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.580 
finish the exoskeleton well you can't do
completely<00:02:05.260> all<00:02:05.620> of<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.980> extra<00:02:06.310> skeleton<00:02:07.590> I'm

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
completely all of the extra skeleton I'm

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.200 
completely all of the extra skeleton I'm
going<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.860> draw<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.130> little<00:02:09.340> bit<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.670> short<00:02:09.970> legs

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
going to draw a little bit of short legs

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.180 
going to draw a little bit of short legs
because<00:02:10.750> i<00:02:11.130> only<00:02:12.130> did<00:02:12.640> half<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.000> page<00:02:13.480> down<00:02:14.190> so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
because i only did half the page down so

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.380 
because i only did half the page down so
his<00:02:16.140> legs<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.590> lot<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:17.890> detail<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:18.550> them<00:02:21.390> so

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
his legs have a lot of detail in them so

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.020 
his legs have a lot of detail in them so
you<00:02:22.450> like<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.080> then<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.250> draw<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.459> line<00:02:24.820> right

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
you like that then you draw a line right

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.690 
you like that then you draw a line right
here<00:02:25.420> don't<00:02:26.020> make<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.320> all<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.500> way<00:02:26.650> down<00:02:26.740> and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
here don't make it all the way down and

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.760 
here don't make it all the way down and
do<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.060> again<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:32.260> let's<00:02:32.440> look<00:02:32.560> through<00:02:32.620> that

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
do that again so let's look through that

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.640 
do that again so let's look through that
and<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.220> draws<00:02:33.459> me<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:35.170> then<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.500> do

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
and then you draws me so then you do

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:56.910 
and then you draws me so then you do
that<00:02:35.920> same<00:02:36.580> thing<00:02:36.610> again

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.699 

so<00:02:58.230> there<00:02:59.230> now<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.620> just<00:02:59.890> color<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:01.530> most<00:03:02.530> of

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
so there now I just color and most of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
this exoskeleton and darker mm-hmm you

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.050 
this exoskeleton and darker mm-hmm you
usually<00:03:22.600> do<00:03:22.959> it<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.290> outside<00:03:26.500> do<00:03:27.190> does
