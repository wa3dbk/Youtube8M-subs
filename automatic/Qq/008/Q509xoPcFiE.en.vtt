00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.050 
I like the way he used the hammer in the
ending<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.500> know<00:03:13.620> its<00:03:13.950> sting<00:03:14.280> jumping<00:03:14.880> from

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
ending you know its sting jumping from

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.330 
ending you know its sting jumping from
the<00:03:15.120> top<00:03:15.390> rope<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:16.050> seeing<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:17.070> bully

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the top rope and not seeing that bully

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.100 
the top rope and not seeing that bully
Ray<00:03:17.490> had<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.940> hammer<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.360> bully<00:03:18.900> ray

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
Ray had that hammer and bully ray

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.740 
Ray had that hammer and bully ray
hitting<00:03:19.380> him<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:20.430> hammer<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.450> guess

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
hitting him with the hammer so I guess

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.540 
hitting him with the hammer so I guess
