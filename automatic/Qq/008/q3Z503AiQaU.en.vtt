00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
can see this better okay let's try it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.280 
can see this better okay let's try it
now<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.069> when<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.250> hit<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.930> at<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> same

now so when you hit the a at the same

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.660 
now so when you hit the a at the same
time<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:28.770> little<00:02:28.920> finger<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.280> going<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.459> play

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
a over here right there and so it would

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.210 
a over here right there and so it would
be<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.349> there's<00:02:34.680> your<00:02:34.800> a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.760 

and<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.000> your<00:02:39.150> left<00:02:39.330> hand<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.810> playing<00:02:39.840> a

and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
and

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.670 
and
so<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.040> might<00:02:46.159> want<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.370> practice<00:02:46.519> doing<00:02:46.879> that

so you might want to practice doing that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.190 
so you might want to practice doing that
still<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.799> over<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.099> over<00:02:49.129> to<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.400> phrase

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.110 

QA<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.349> at<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.530> same<00:02:54.709> time<00:02:54.980> right<00:02:55.489> hand<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.909> and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
QA is at the same time right hand a and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.740 
QA is at the same time right hand a and
left<00:02:56.299> hand<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:58.390> okay

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
left hand a okay

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.449 
left hand a okay
so<00:03:00.140> putting<00:03:00.379> the<00:03:00.470> phrase<00:03:00.680> together<00:03:01.069> be<00:03:01.280> like

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
so putting the phrase together be like

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.250 
so putting the phrase together be like
this

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.350 

okay<00:03:06.069> now<00:03:06.250> we<00:03:06.310> have<00:03:06.430> three<00:03:06.640> more<00:03:06.670> notes<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.150> add

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
okay now we have three more notes to add

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.440 
okay now we have three more notes to add
to<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.690> now<00:03:08.650> when<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.099> finish<00:03:09.340> playing<00:03:10.239> your

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
to that now when you finish playing your

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.040 
to that now when you finish playing your
thumb<00:03:10.660> on<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.989> up<00:03:11.110> here<00:03:11.319> one<00:03:11.680> two<00:03:12.190> three<00:03:13.050> you're

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
thumb on a up here one two three you're

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.150 
thumb on a up here one two three you're
right

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
right

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.410 
right
thumbs<00:03:15.489> would<00:03:15.730> come<00:03:15.879> over<00:03:15.970> here<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.569> play<00:03:16.750> see

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
thumbs would come over here and play see

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.809 
thumbs would come over here and play see
then<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:20.620> can<00:03:20.830> practice<00:03:21.099> measure<00:03:21.580> number

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
then you can practice measure number

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.830 
then you can practice measure number
three<00:03:21.970> like<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.330> start<00:03:25.690> off

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
three like this so you start off

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.860 
three like this so you start off
together

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.270 

and<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.160> whole<00:03:30.340> phrase<00:03:30.610> goes<00:03:30.849> like<00:03:31.000> this

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.570 

now<00:03:35.910> when<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.300> play<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:37.200> chord<00:03:37.830> run<00:03:38.130> it's<00:03:38.460> an

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
now when you play this chord run it's an

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.030 
now when you play this chord run it's an
a<00:03:38.730> minor<00:03:39.000> chord<00:03:39.330> run<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:40.350> want<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.650> use<00:03:40.830> the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
pedal off it just did so to keep that

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.910 
pedal off it just did so to keep that
chord<00:03:51.630> running<00:03:51.930> smoothly<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.530> want<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.800> use

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
chord running smoothly you want to use

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.520 
chord running smoothly you want to use
the<00:03:53.160> sustain<00:03:53.520> pedal<00:03:54.080> using<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.170> sustain

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
the sustain pedal using the sustain

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.780 
the sustain pedal using the sustain
pedal<00:03:55.890> would<00:03:55.980> sound<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.340> this

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.000 

okay<00:04:02.790> now<00:04:02.970> we're<00:04:03.870> not<00:04:03.990> measure<00:04:04.230> number<00:04:04.650> four

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
okay now we're not measure number four

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.510 
okay now we're not measure number four
and<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:06.330> next<00:04:06.600> phrase<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.620> changing<00:04:08.190> chords

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
and the next phrase is changing chords

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.180 
and the next phrase is changing chords
so<00:04:09.330> this<00:04:09.450> first<00:04:09.630> part<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.080> based<00:04:10.350> upon<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.800> minor

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
so this first part is based upon a minor

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.330 
so this first part is based upon a minor
chord<00:04:14.750> it's<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.959> minor<00:04:16.200> chord<00:04:16.470> but<00:04:16.680> now<00:04:16.829> we're

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
chord it's a minor chord but now we're

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.900 
chord it's a minor chord but now we're
changing<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.820> E<00:04:18.000> chord<00:04:19.040> like<00:04:20.040> that<00:04:20.280> but<00:04:20.790> they

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
changing to E chord like that but they

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:57.480 
changing to E chord like that but they
spread<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.329> chord<00:04:21.630> out<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.049> so<00:04:22.620> this<00:04:22.830> phrase

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.550 

you
