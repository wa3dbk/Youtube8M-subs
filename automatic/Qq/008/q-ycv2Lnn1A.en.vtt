00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
hey guys I'm Chuck here noticed in some

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.659 
hey guys I'm Chuck here noticed in some
of<00:00:19.140> my<00:00:19.230> videos<00:00:19.259> a<00:00:19.619> lot<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.220> my<00:00:20.369> flying

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
of my videos a lot of you like my flying

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.640 
of my videos a lot of you like my flying
and<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.000> figured<00:00:21.360> I'd<00:00:21.570> show<00:00:22.110> you<00:00:22.140> one<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and I figured I'd show you one of the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.929 
and I figured I'd show you one of the
more<00:00:22.860> important<00:00:23.279> things<00:00:23.310> you're<00:00:23.579> gonna<00:00:23.699> need

more important things you're gonna need

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.670 
more important things you're gonna need
to<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.239> if<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.930> decide<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.259> be<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> pilot

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
to know if you decide to be a pilot

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220 
to know if you decide to be a pilot
Norma<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.910> being<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> autorotation

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
Norma that being the autorotation

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.409 
Norma that being the autorotation
now<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.550> gonna<00:00:29.700> I'm<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.180> gonna

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
now I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.720 
now I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
sugarcoat<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.379> for<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.860> but<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:32.430> you're<00:00:32.550> out

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
sugarcoat it for you but if you're out

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.819 
sugarcoat it for you but if you're out
in<00:00:32.850> combat<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.570> more<00:00:34.200> likely<00:00:34.590> you're<00:00:34.770> gonna

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
in combat is more likely you're gonna

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.729 
in combat is more likely you're gonna
mix<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.370> up<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.640> them<00:00:35.789> a<00:00:36.379> sooner<00:00:37.379> or<00:00:37.590> later

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
mix it up with them a sooner or later

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.350 
mix it up with them a sooner or later
and<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.610> thing<00:00:38.789> you're<00:00:38.910> gonna<00:00:39.030> need<00:00:39.149> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and the one thing you're gonna need to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.049 
and the one thing you're gonna need to
know<00:00:39.480> how<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> do<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.250> put<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.579> bird<00:00:41.820> on

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
know how to do is to put your bird on

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.450 
know how to do is to put your bird on
the<00:00:42.210> ground<00:00:42.420> without<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:43.050> yeah<00:00:43.410> getting<00:00:44.400> a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the ground without it yeah getting a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.870 
the ground without it yeah getting a
hard<00:00:44.730> date<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.570> ground<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.760> well<00:00:47.760> we

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
hard date with that ground so well we

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.130 
hard date with that ground so well we
get<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> air<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.660> I'll<00:00:48.750> show<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:48.989> what

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
get in the air and I'll show you what

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.680 
get in the air and I'll show you what
you<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.380> to<00:00:49.470> do<00:00:50.180> part<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.300> thing<00:00:51.510> you'll

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
you need to do part of the thing you'll

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.210 
you need to do part of the thing you'll
need<00:00:51.810> to<00:00:51.930> understand<00:00:52.380> is<00:00:52.590> how<00:00:52.770> autorotation

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
need to understand is how autorotation

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.630 
need to understand is how autorotation
works<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> helicopter<00:00:55.190> generally<00:00:56.190> when

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
works with the helicopter generally when

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.940 
works with the helicopter generally when
a<00:00:56.670> helicopter<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.300> operating<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.350> pilot

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
a helicopter is operating and the pilot

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.979 
a helicopter is operating and the pilot
pulls<00:00:59.160> up<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> collective<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.239> gain

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
pulls up on the collective to gain

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.979 
pulls up on the collective to gain
altitude<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:02.100> lower<00:01:02.670> altitude<00:01:03.210> he's<00:01:03.780> not

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
altitude or lower altitude he's not

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
altitude or lower altitude he's not
actually<00:01:04.350> causing<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> blades<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.549> spin<00:01:05.820> any

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
actually causing the blades to spin any

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
actually causing the blades to spin any
faster<00:01:06.450> slower<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.140> he's<00:01:07.259> actually<00:01:07.409> doing

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
faster slower what he's actually doing

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.499 
faster slower what he's actually doing
is<00:01:07.920> causing<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> pitch<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> blades<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
is causing the pitch of the blades to

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.800 
is causing the pitch of the blades to
change<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:11.189> blades<00:01:11.640> will<00:01:11.939> actually<00:01:12.240> stay<00:01:12.509> at

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
change the blades will actually stay at

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
change the blades will actually stay at
a<00:01:12.869> pretty<00:01:13.320> constant<00:01:13.590> rpm<00:01:13.920> through<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.579> entire

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
a pretty constant rpm through the entire

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.749 
a pretty constant rpm through the entire
flight<00:01:15.259> now<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.799> an<00:01:17.130> emergency<00:01:17.490> situation

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
flight now in an emergency situation

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.379 
flight now in an emergency situation
when<00:01:18.719> you've<00:01:18.929> lost<00:01:19.139> your<00:01:19.350> engine<00:01:20.069> power

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:20.389 
when you've lost your engine power

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:23.149 
when you've lost your engine power
putting<00:01:21.389> the<00:01:21.479> collective<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.069> gonna

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
putting the collective or as I'm gonna

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.830 
putting the collective or as I'm gonna
refer<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.789> in<00:01:23.880> Arma<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> throttle<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
refer to it in Arma the throttle all the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.800 
refer to it in Arma the throttle all the
way<00:01:24.990> down<00:01:25.310> causes<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> blades<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.329> a<00:01:27.359> free

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
way down causes the blades to do a free

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.830 
way down causes the blades to do a free
spin<00:01:28.079> now<00:01:28.889> what<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.670> does<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.539> free

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
spin now what that does is they free

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.349 
spin now what that does is they free
spin<00:01:31.139> and<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.649> also<00:01:31.829> lowers<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> pitch<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
spin and it also lowers the pitch of the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.840 
spin and it also lowers the pitch of the
blades<00:01:33.600> causing<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.499> blades<00:01:34.709> of<00:01:34.889> spin<00:01:35.219> as<00:01:35.459> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
blades causing the blades of spin as the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.989 
blades causing the blades of spin as the
craft<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:37.049> descending<00:01:37.649> now<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.789> that's

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
craft it's descending now what that's

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.749 
craft it's descending now what that's
what<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.600> does<00:01:39.779> is<00:01:40.109> builds<00:01:41.069> up<00:01:41.189> energy<00:01:41.549> in

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
what that does is builds up energy in

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.169 
what that does is builds up energy in
the<00:01:41.969> blades<00:01:42.209> which<00:01:42.929> you<00:01:43.170> use<00:01:43.469> to<00:01:44.119> transfer<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
the blades which you use to transfer it

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.179 
the blades which you use to transfer it
to<00:01:45.329> lift<00:01:45.599> at<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> last<00:01:46.380> seconds<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.039> your

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
to lift at the last seconds of your

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.029 
to lift at the last seconds of your
landing<00:01:47.639> all<00:01:48.539> right<00:01:48.599> so<00:01:49.289> now<00:01:49.679> what<00:01:49.889> we're

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
landing all right so now what we're

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.279 
landing all right so now what we're
gonna<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.429> I'm<00:01:50.520> gonna<00:01:50.810> bring<00:01:51.810> us<00:01:51.990> around

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
gonna do is I'm gonna bring us around

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.429 
gonna do is I'm gonna bring us around
line<00:01:52.979> us<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.459> that<00:01:53.609> runway<00:01:54.209> and<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:55.319> gonna

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
line us up to that runway and I'm gonna

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.929 
line us up to that runway and I'm gonna
give<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.709> a<00:01:55.770> demonstration<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.490> how<00:01:56.729> you're

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
give you a demonstration on how you're

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.129 
give you a demonstration on how you're
going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.389> a<00:01:57.419> auto<00:01:57.869> rotation<00:01:59.840> all<00:02:00.840> right

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139 
going to do a auto rotation all right

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.690 
going to do a auto rotation all right
now<00:02:01.319> as<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.590> come<00:02:01.799> around<00:02:01.919> towards<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
now as we come around towards the
