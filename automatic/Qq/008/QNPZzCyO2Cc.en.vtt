this<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.830> my<00:00:23.039> new<00:00:23.279> twine<00:00:23.609> benders<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.359> I've

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
this is my new twine benders that I've

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.620 
this is my new twine benders that I've
made<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> first<00:00:26.220> prototype<00:00:26.630> I'll

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
made this is the first prototype I'll

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.439 
made this is the first prototype I'll
share<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.019> second<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> minute<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
share the second of a minute and

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.299 
share the second of a minute and
actually<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.810> does<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.439> raises<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
actually what it does is it raises the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.500 
actually what it does is it raises the
first<00:00:32.579> three<00:00:32.850> screens<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:35.329> excuse<00:00:36.329> me<00:00:36.480> for

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
first three screens and excuse me for

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.810 
first three screens and excuse me for
not<00:00:36.660> knowing<00:00:37.079> more<00:00:37.230> legs<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.670> have

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
not knowing more legs but I just have

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.990 
not knowing more legs but I just have
gotten<00:00:39.120> through<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:40.280> primarily<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.670> made<00:00:41.969> it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
gotten through and primarily I made it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.569 
gotten through and primarily I made it
to<00:00:42.149> put<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> jeep<00:00:44.210> always<00:00:45.210> chiming<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.579> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
to put a jeep always chiming here and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.940 
to put a jeep always chiming here and
try<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:49.410> time<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
try to do that and have time in the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.069 
try to do that and have time in the
crash<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.489> wouldn't<00:00:50.820> make<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.840> right

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
crash that wouldn't make it so right

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.060 
crash that wouldn't make it so right
there<00:00:52.260> are<00:00:52.379> no<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.760> with<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> gba<00:00:54.270> lake<00:00:55.079> city

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so but the way I've got it set up on

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.830 
so but the way I've got it set up on
this<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.190> work<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.609> G<00:01:02.879> bend<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> back

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
this one you work the G bend to the back

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.380 
this one you work the G bend to the back
your<00:01:04.049> hand<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> bees<00:01:07.439> done<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> belt<00:01:08.340> loop

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.760 

and<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.900> e<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.799> done<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.310> another<00:01:14.580> hand<00:01:14.909> left

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
and the e is done with another hand left

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.469 
and the e is done with another hand left
and<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:18.180> G<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.750> some<00:01:18.930> GTA<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.180> bee

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
doesn't B to C sharp and the egos 2e 2f

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620 
doesn't B to C sharp and the egos 2e 2f
and<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:26.189> don't<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:26.970> right<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.570> not

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and I don't know if that is right or not

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
that's just what I got set right now and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.920 
that's just what I got set right now and
it's<00:01:32.040> pretty<00:01:32.220> easy<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.579> use<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:35.520> connect<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it's pretty easy to use to connect the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.770 
it's pretty easy to use to connect the
disconnect<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.680> use<00:01:37.829> an<00:01:37.979> o-ring<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.210> this

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
disconnect I use an o-ring here and this

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.730 
disconnect I use an o-ring here and this
is<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.990> prototype<00:01:40.229> 2<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:42.259> besides<00:01:43.259> making<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
is a prototype 2 and besides making the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.180 
is a prototype 2 and besides making the
quit<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.850> gives<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.360> over<00:01:45.600> travels

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
men and what is adjustable and you do

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.960 
men and what is adjustable and you do
have<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.440> readjust<00:01:54.010> it<00:01:54.400> depending<00:01:54.700> on<00:01:54.790> whether

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
have to readjust it depending on whether

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.690 
have to readjust it depending on whether
you're<00:01:55.060> standing<00:01:55.510> up<00:01:55.600> or<00:01:55.780> sitting<00:01:55.840> down<00:01:56.320> and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
you can see on this this one you can

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.570 
you can see on this this one you can
only<00:02:19.960> do<00:02:20.470> one<00:02:20.830> belt<00:02:21.400> bid<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:23.400> depending<00:02:24.400> on
