they<00:01:41.299> gave<00:01:41.539> him<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:42.049> think<00:01:42.619> they<00:01:42.709> did<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.890> great

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
they gave him I think they did a great

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.219 
they gave him I think they did a great
job<00:01:43.220> on<00:01:43.459> that<00:01:43.819> and<00:01:44.209> he<00:01:44.990> has<00:01:45.200> a

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
job on that and he has a

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.710 
job on that and he has a
glow-in-the-dark<00:01:45.590> head<00:01:46.280> which<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.850> very<00:01:47.330> cool

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
glow-in-the-dark head which is very cool

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.949 
glow-in-the-dark head which is very cool
so<00:01:48.679> here<00:01:49.069> is<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.549> set<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.060> witch-king<00:01:50.299> panel

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
so here is the set the witch-king panel

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.039 
so here is the set the witch-king panel
and<00:01:51.140> for<00:01:51.830> such<00:01:52.039> a<00:01:52.069> small<00:01:52.429> set<00:01:52.759> only<00:01:52.939> 101<00:01:53.659> pieces

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
and for such a small set only 101 pieces

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.199 
and for such a small set only 101 pieces
I<00:01:54.229> think<00:01:54.679> they<00:01:54.830> did<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.069> really<00:01:55.399> good<00:01:55.670> job<00:01:55.729> on<00:01:56.179> it

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
I think they did a really good job on it

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.869 
I think they did a really good job on it
you've<00:01:57.200> got<00:01:57.410> these<00:01:57.560> skeleton<00:01:58.129> pieces<00:01:58.610> that

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:58.879 
you've got these skeleton pieces that

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.600 
you've got these skeleton pieces that
you<00:01:59.000> can<00:01:59.209> clearly<00:01:59.539> make<00:01:59.950> into<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:00.979> skeleton<00:02:01.310> you

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
you can clearly make into a skeleton you

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.820 
you can clearly make into a skeleton you
do<00:02:01.819> have<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.179> full<00:02:02.420> thing<00:02:02.690> you've<00:02:03.560> got<00:02:03.709> the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
do have the full thing you've got the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.859 
do have the full thing you've got the
body<00:02:04.069> and<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.369> arms<00:02:04.759> right<00:02:04.970> here<00:02:05.000> there's<00:02:05.690> the

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
body and the arms right here there's the

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.580 
body and the arms right here there's the
head<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.739> then<00:02:06.950> there's<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.399> leg<00:02:07.879> here<00:02:08.330> and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
head and then there's a leg here and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.110 
head and then there's a leg here and
also<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> leg<00:02:10.069> right<00:02:10.310> back<00:02:10.519> here<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:10.970> can

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
also a leg right back here so you can

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.400 
also a leg right back here so you can
build<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.360> whole<00:02:11.569> skeleton<00:02:12.050> if<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.230> want

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
build the whole skeleton if you want

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.470 
build the whole skeleton if you want
which<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.769> kind<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.040> cool<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.879> they<00:02:14.000> included

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
which is kind of cool that they included

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.559 
which is kind of cool that they included
that<00:02:14.660> instead<00:02:15.470> was<00:02:15.620> having<00:02:15.920> pieces<00:02:16.370> also<00:02:16.940> this

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
that instead was having pieces also this

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.649 
that instead was having pieces also this
little<00:02:17.750> spot<00:02:18.110> right<00:02:18.319> here<00:02:19.330> doesn't<00:02:20.330> look<00:02:20.510> like

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
little spot right here doesn't look like

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.660 
little spot right here doesn't look like
it<00:02:20.780> does<00:02:20.930> anything<00:02:21.290> but<00:02:21.769> when<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.430> put<00:02:22.640> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
it does anything but when you put a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.759 
it does anything but when you put a
figure<00:02:22.909> on<00:02:23.120> here<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:24.050> can<00:02:24.200> actually<00:02:24.530> make<00:02:24.739> it

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
figure on here you can actually make it

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.339 
figure on here you can actually make it
battle<00:02:25.400> which<00:02:25.940> i<00:02:26.180> think<00:02:26.239> was<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.780> really<00:02:26.810> cool

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
battle which i think was a really cool

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.440 
battle which i think was a really cool
little<00:02:27.500> feature<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.069> add<00:02:28.250> you've<00:02:29.000> also<00:02:29.180> got

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
