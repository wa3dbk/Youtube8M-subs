00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.070 

when<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.120> first<00:00:12.360> opened<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:12.780> woodworking

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
when I first opened my woodworking

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.230 
when I first opened my woodworking
school<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.860> did<00:00:14.010> not<00:00:14.220> have<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> miter<00:00:14.670> saw<00:00:14.760> in<00:00:15.120> it

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
school I did not have a miter saw in it

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.790 
school I did not have a miter saw in it
we<00:00:15.360> did<00:00:15.510> all<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.690> our<00:00:15.840> cross<00:00:16.139> cutting<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
we did all of our cross cutting on the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040 
we did all of our cross cutting on the
table<00:00:17.160> saw<00:00:17.310> using<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:18.150> good<00:00:18.330> quality<00:00:18.720> miter

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
table saw using a good quality miter

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.200 
table saw using a good quality miter
gauge<00:00:19.350> now<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.100> key<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.460> making<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.789> system

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
gauge now the key to making that system

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.480 
gauge now the key to making that system
work<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.770> have<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.190> the<00:00:23.279> miter

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
work is that you have to have the miter

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.269 
work is that you have to have the miter
gauge<00:00:23.580> set<00:00:24.240> up<00:00:24.420> correctly<00:00:24.840> once<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.830> you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
gauge set up correctly once you do you

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.980 
gauge set up correctly once you do you
have<00:00:26.400> basically<00:00:26.820> turned<00:00:27.210> your<00:00:27.359> table<00:00:27.779> saw

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
have basically turned your table saw

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 
have basically turned your table saw
into<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> sliding<00:00:29.250> miter<00:00:29.580> saw<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.090> big

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
into a sliding miter saw with big

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.389 
into a sliding miter saw with big
capacity<00:00:31.020> as<00:00:31.439> long<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:31.770> the<00:00:31.859> miter<00:00:32.039> gauge<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
capacity as long as the miter gauge is

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.160 
capacity as long as the miter gauge is
doing<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:32.819> it's<00:00:32.940> supposed<00:00:32.999> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.449> so<00:00:33.659> here's

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
doing what it's supposed to do so here's

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.479 
doing what it's supposed to do so here's
what<00:00:34.319> I<00:00:34.409> mean<00:00:34.589> by<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:34.979> want<00:00:35.129> to<00:00:35.190> make<00:00:35.309> sure

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
what I mean by that we want to make sure

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
what I mean by that we want to make sure
that<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> miter<00:00:35.969> gauge<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.449> cutting<00:00:36.870> perfect

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
that the miter gauge is cutting perfect

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.459 
that the miter gauge is cutting perfect
angles<00:00:38.280> every<00:00:38.819> time<00:00:39.059> now<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:39.870> real<00:00:40.050> tempting

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
angles every time now it's real tempting

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.049 
angles every time now it's real tempting
when<00:00:40.649> you're<00:00:40.920> setting<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.280> tools<00:00:41.519> like<00:00:41.819> this

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
when you're setting up tools like this

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.869 
when you're setting up tools like this
to<00:00:42.690> take<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.109> good<00:00:43.350> quality<00:00:43.739> square<00:00:44.190> put<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
to take a good quality square put it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
to take a good quality square put it
against<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.269> miter<00:00:45.539> gauge<00:00:45.659> put<00:00:46.319> the<00:00:46.440> head<00:00:46.620> of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
against the miter gauge put the head of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.739 
against the miter gauge put the head of
the<00:00:46.799> square<00:00:47.069> against<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.609> blade<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.149> couple

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
the square against the blade a couple

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.209 
the square against the blade a couple
things<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.139> like<00:00:49.289> about<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.859> the<00:00:50.039> big

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
things I don't like about that the big

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.279 
things I don't like about that the big
thing<00:00:50.249> is<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.909> what<00:00:51.479> I<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.109> to<00:00:52.170> know

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
thing is that what I really want to know

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.739 
thing is that what I really want to know
is<00:00:52.499> how<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.010> performs<00:00:53.639> when<00:00:54.359> I'm<00:00:54.479> cutting

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
is how this performs when I'm cutting

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.139 
is how this performs when I'm cutting
not<00:00:55.620> how<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.979> performs<00:00:56.489> when<00:00:56.670> everything<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
not how it performs when everything is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.509 
not how it performs when everything is
sitting<00:00:57.389> still<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.989> whatever<00:00:58.709> dynamics<00:00:59.369> are

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
sitting still so whatever dynamics are

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.309 
sitting still so whatever dynamics are
involved<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.179> table<00:01:00.479> saw<00:01:00.659> is<00:01:00.690> running<00:01:01.170> I

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319 
involved when the table saw is running I

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:02.869 
involved when the table saw is running I
want<00:01:01.799> them<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.190> involved<00:01:02.459> when<00:01:02.760> I'm

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
want them to be involved when I'm

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.470 
want them to be involved when I'm
setting<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.869> miter<00:01:04.110> gauge<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> one<00:01:06.300> way

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
setting up the miter gauge so one way

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.140 
setting up the miter gauge so one way
that<00:01:06.660> people<00:01:06.720> will<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.200> test<00:01:07.470> cuts<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.700> put

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
that people will do test cuts is to put

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
that people will do test cuts is to put
a<00:01:09.180> board<00:01:09.480> in<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.660> miter<00:01:09.870> gauge<00:01:10.100> cut<00:01:11.100> an<00:01:11.220> end

a board in the miter gauge cut an end
square<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.120> then<00:01:12.720> test<00:01:13.050> it<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.980> I<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
square and then test it what I want to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.010 
square and then test it what I want to
do<00:01:14.550> is<00:01:14.730> take<00:01:14.940> advantage<00:01:15.510> of<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> would

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
do is take advantage of what I would

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
do is take advantage of what I would
call<00:01:16.140> cumulative<00:01:16.860> errors<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.670> way<00:01:17.790> I'm

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
call cumulative errors so the way I'm

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.540 
call cumulative errors so the way I'm
going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.180> set<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> miter<00:01:18.810> gauge<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.550> I'm

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
going to set up the miter gauge is I'm

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.300 
going to set up the miter gauge is I'm
going<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:20.850> angle<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.480> 30<00:01:21.780> degrees<00:01:22.280> create<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
going to angle it to 30 degrees create a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
going to angle it to 30 degrees create a
six-sided<00:01:24.210> object<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:24.930> has<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.200> effect

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
six-sided object and that has the effect

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.160 
six-sided object and that has the effect
of<00:01:25.740> magnifying<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.700> error<00:01:26.910> that<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.630> so

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
of magnifying the error that I have so

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.870 
of magnifying the error that I have so
that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.920> fine-tune<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> miter

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that I can really fine-tune the miter

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.790 
that I can really fine-tune the miter
gauge<00:01:30.120> and<00:01:30.330> get<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.660> right<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.500> first

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
gauge and get it just right so first

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.070 
gauge and get it just right so first
step<00:01:32.040> let's<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> miter<00:01:33.300> gauge<00:01:33.390> pivoted

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
step let's get the miter gauge pivoted

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.830 
step let's get the miter gauge pivoted
out<00:01:34.260> to<00:01:34.800> 30<00:01:35.070> degrees<00:01:38.390> I'm<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> lock<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
out to 30 degrees I'm going to lock that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.730 
out to 30 degrees I'm going to lock that
in<00:01:41.180> now<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.420> need<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.020> plug<00:01:43.260> my<00:01:43.470> saw

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
in now what I need to do is plug my saw

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.490 
in now what I need to do is plug my saw
in<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.280> I'll<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.330> end<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:46.170> six

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
in and I'll get one end of all six

00:01:46.500 --> 00:02:06.630 
in and I'll get one end of all six
pieces<00:01:46.770> cut<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.850> 30<00:01:48.150> degree<00:01:48.450> angle

with<00:02:12.209> one<00:02:12.510> end<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.840> every<00:02:13.050> board<00:02:13.260> cut<00:02:13.650> what's

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
with one end of every board cut what's

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.430 
with one end of every board cut what's
key<00:02:14.340> now<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:15.810> every<00:02:16.170> board

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
key now is that we get every board

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.620 
key now is that we get every board
exactly<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.100> same<00:02:17.340> length<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
exactly the same length so this is the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.690 
exactly the same length so this is the
benefit<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.230> stop<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> miter<00:02:20.069> gauge<00:02:20.370> like

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
benefit of a stop on a miter gauge like

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.400 
benefit of a stop on a miter gauge like
this<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.060> I'm<00:02:21.150> going<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.360> slide<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:21.900> over<00:02:24.410> so

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
this one I'm going to slide this over so

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.340 
this one I'm going to slide this over so
that<00:02:25.860> when<00:02:26.760> my<00:02:26.790> material<00:02:27.480> goes<00:02:27.690> against<00:02:28.200> it

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
that when my material goes against it

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.020 
that when my material goes against it
it's<00:02:28.800> going<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.069> lock<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.640> place

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
it's going to lock it in place

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.750 
it's going to lock it in place
and<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.380> get<00:02:31.530> all<00:02:31.560> these<00:02:31.800> parts<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.310> exactly

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and I can get all these parts to exactly

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:42.590 
and I can get all these parts to exactly
the<00:02:32.880> same<00:02:33.120> length<00:02:33.390> now<00:02:40.940> when<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.360> one

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
the same length now when you do this one

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.570 
the same length now when you do this one
of<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.750> things<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.140> be<00:02:43.260> aware<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:43.890> we

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
of the things to be aware of is that we

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.940 
of the things to be aware of is that we
have<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> sharp<00:02:45.209> knife<00:02:45.300> edge<00:02:45.840> here<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.590> cut

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
have a sharp knife edge here on this cut

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.610 
have a sharp knife edge here on this cut
so<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:47.670> want<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.970> make<00:02:48.120> sure<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.260> knife

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
so we want to make sure that that knife

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.100 
so we want to make sure that that knife
edge<00:02:49.920> can't<00:02:50.340> creep<00:02:50.790> under<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.239> stop<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.019> you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
edge can't creep under the stop so you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.449 
edge can't creep under the stop so you
want<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.350> make<00:02:52.470> sure<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.800> like<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.220> one

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
want to make sure that like this one

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.850 
want to make sure that like this one
once<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.420> stop<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.140> closed<00:02:55.590> position

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
once that stop is in a closed position

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.420 
once that stop is in a closed position
that's<00:02:56.640> going<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.970> stay<00:02:57.300> there<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.900> not<00:02:58.739> slide

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
that's going to stay there and not slide

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.520 
that's going to stay there and not slide
up<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.850> angle<00:03:00.120> now<00:03:00.690> I'm<00:03:01.019> going<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.260> come<00:03:01.410> back

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
up that angle now I'm going to come back

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.020 
up that angle now I'm going to come back
and<00:03:01.709> I'm<00:03:01.800> going<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> cut<00:03:02.190> all<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.519> other<00:03:02.670> ends

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
and I'm going to cut all the other ends

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.340 
and I'm going to cut all the other ends
off<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.420> then<00:03:03.750> I'll<00:03:03.870> show<00:03:04.049> you<00:03:04.079> how<00:03:04.290> we

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
off and then I'll show you how we

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.080 
off and then I'll show you how we
actually<00:03:04.470> check<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.070> setup<00:03:05.519> on<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.910> miter

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
actually check the setup on the miter

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:36.370 
actually check the setup on the miter
gauge

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.400 

what<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.530> gives<00:03:37.830> us<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.540> six<00:03:39.540> pieces<00:03:39.840> I'll

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
what that gives us is six pieces I'll

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.590 
what that gives us is six pieces I'll
cut<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.800> exactly<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.310> same<00:03:41.520> angle<00:03:41.730> I'll<00:03:42.270> cut

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
cut it exactly the same angle I'll cut

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.900 
cut it exactly the same angle I'll cut
to<00:03:42.630> exactly<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.380> same<00:03:43.620> length<00:03:43.920> we<00:03:44.220> can<00:03:44.490> use

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
to exactly the same length we can use

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.000 
to exactly the same length we can use
these<00:03:45.210> to<00:03:45.540> use<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.900> cumulative<00:03:46.290> error<00:03:46.560> idea

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
these to use that cumulative error idea

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.730 
these to use that cumulative error idea
and<00:03:47.250> find<00:03:47.880> out<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.090> how<00:03:48.510> accurate<00:03:48.870> our<00:03:49.290> 30

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
and find out just how accurate our 30

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.280 
and find out just how accurate our 30
degree<00:03:50.040> cut<00:03:50.280> was<00:03:50.570> I've<00:03:51.570> got<00:03:51.720> all<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.990> boards

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
degree cut was I've got all the boards

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.530 
degree cut was I've got all the boards
cut<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.740> I<00:03:52.980> wrap<00:03:53.250> them<00:03:53.490> in<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.640> band<00:03:53.910> clamp<00:03:54.150> here

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
cut and I wrap them in a band clamp here

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.630 
cut and I wrap them in a band clamp here
so<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.870> can<00:03:55.050> put<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.410> whole<00:03:55.680> circle

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
so that I can put that whole circle

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.980 
so that I can put that whole circle
together<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.180> see<00:03:57.330> what<00:03:57.420> I've<00:03:57.570> got<00:03:57.750> now

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
together and see what I've got now

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.290 
together and see what I've got now
here's<00:03:58.440> what's<00:03:58.650> happening<00:03:59.010> I've<00:03:59.610> got<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.850> bunch

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
here's what's happening I've got a bunch

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.750 
here's what's happening I've got a bunch
of<00:04:00.540> seams<00:04:01.170> on<00:04:01.470> here<00:04:01.770> that<00:04:01.950> are<00:04:02.070> absolutely

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
of seams on here that are absolutely

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.150 
of seams on here that are absolutely
perfect<00:04:03.060> five<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.960> six<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.860> way<00:04:04.980> that

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
perfect five of the six and the way that

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.740 
perfect five of the six and the way that
happened<00:04:05.580> is<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.730> kind<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.000> manipulated<00:04:06.660> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
happened is I kind of manipulated the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.380 
happened is I kind of manipulated the
board<00:04:07.020> as<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.440> went<00:04:07.770> into<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.040> clamps<00:04:08.460> on<00:04:08.610> seam

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.170 
board as it went into the clamps on seam
number<00:04:09.690> six<00:04:09.960> over<00:04:10.290> here<00:04:10.560> it's<00:04:11.100> touching<00:04:11.580> at

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
number six over here it's touching at

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.720 
number six over here it's touching at
the<00:04:12.330> bottom<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.810> seam<00:04:13.080> but<00:04:13.740> it's<00:04:13.890> open<00:04:14.460> out

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
the bottom of the seam but it's open out

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.940 
the bottom of the seam but it's open out
here<00:04:15.180> at<00:04:15.300> this<00:04:15.480> end<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.930> scene<00:04:16.170> now<00:04:16.769> this

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
here at this end of the scene now this

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.590 
here at this end of the scene now this
is<00:04:17.100> what's<00:04:17.310> cool<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.850> is<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.090> cumulative

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
is what's cool this is the cumulative

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.170 
is what's cool this is the cumulative
error<00:04:18.750> business<00:04:19.230> this<00:04:19.980> gap<00:04:20.370> right<00:04:20.400> here<00:04:20.760> is

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
error business this gap right here is

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.970 
error business this gap right here is
the<00:04:21.870> net<00:04:22.140> effect<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.770> six<00:04:23.780> seams<00:04:24.780> being<00:04:25.740> off

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
the net effect of six seams being off

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.180 
the net effect of six seams being off
just<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.640> tiny<00:04:26.970> bit<00:04:27.420> so<00:04:27.750> this<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.950> tiny

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
just a tiny bit so this is just a tiny

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.060 
just a tiny bit so this is just a tiny
tiny<00:04:29.550> error<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.180> error<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.780> actually

tiny error the error is actually

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.350 
tiny error the error is actually
one-sixth<00:04:32.070> of<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.250> amount<00:04:32.640> of<00:04:32.880> daylight<00:04:33.210> you

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
one-sixth of the amount of daylight you

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.080 
one-sixth of the amount of daylight you
can<00:04:33.510> see<00:04:33.720> right<00:04:33.900> there<00:04:34.070> so<00:04:35.070> if<00:04:35.760> we<00:04:35.940> had<00:04:36.060> only

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
can see right there so if we had only

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.600 
can see right there so if we had only
cut<00:04:36.510> one<00:04:36.540> board<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.320> put<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.830> square<00:04:38.250> on<00:04:38.430> that

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
cut one board and put a square on that

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.430 
cut one board and put a square on that
one<00:04:38.820> board<00:04:39.120> that'd<00:04:39.690> be<00:04:39.810> such<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.020> tiny<00:04:40.320> amount

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
one board that'd be such a tiny amount

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.840 
one board that'd be such a tiny amount
you<00:04:40.800> might<00:04:40.950> never<00:04:41.160> see<00:04:41.310> it<00:04:41.580> but<00:04:41.760> this

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
you might never see it but this

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.659 
you might never see it but this
magnifies<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:43.169> at<00:04:43.890> this<00:04:44.100> point<00:04:44.340> what<00:04:44.550> you

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
magnifies it so at this point what you

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.950 
magnifies it so at this point what you
do<00:04:44.790> is<00:04:44.910> follow<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.270> manufacturer's

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
do is follow the manufacturer's

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.320 
do is follow the manufacturer's
instructions<00:04:45.990> tweak<00:04:46.919> your<00:04:47.070> miter<00:04:47.280> gauge<00:04:47.580> you

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
instructions tweak your miter gauge you

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.390 
instructions tweak your miter gauge you
cut<00:04:48.570> all<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:48.990> boards<00:04:49.320> again<00:04:49.560> both<00:04:49.830> ends<00:04:50.220> of

cut all the boards again both ends of
every<00:04:50.880> board<00:04:51.270> use<00:04:51.900> your<00:04:52.080> stop<00:04:52.350> again<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.860> make

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
every board use your stop again to make

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.830 
every board use your stop again to make
sure<00:04:53.160> they're<00:04:53.340> all<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.460> right<00:04:53.730> length<00:04:54.030> put

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
them back in the band clamp and get

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.159 
them back in the band clamp and get
everything<00:04:56.370> set<00:04:56.520> up<00:04:56.790> until<00:04:57.419> that<00:04:57.570> error<00:04:57.840> goes

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
everything set up until that error goes

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.320 
everything set up until that error goes
away<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.250> this<00:04:59.400> one's<00:04:59.640> going<00:04:59.790> to<00:04:59.850> need<00:05:00.030> just<00:05:00.240> a

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
away so this one's going to need just a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.030 
away so this one's going to need just a
small<00:05:00.600> adjustment<00:05:00.750> now<00:05:01.290> what's<00:05:01.500> cool<00:05:01.740> is<00:05:01.770> that

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
small adjustment now what's cool is that

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.970 
small adjustment now what's cool is that
with<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.910> good<00:05:03.150> miter<00:05:03.419> gauge<00:05:03.750> once<00:05:04.530> we've<00:05:04.740> got

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
with a good miter gauge once we've got

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.820 
with a good miter gauge once we've got
that<00:05:05.010> set<00:05:05.640> at<00:05:05.790> 30<00:05:06.090> degrees<00:05:06.480> I<00:05:06.780> can<00:05:07.290> toggle<00:05:07.530> this

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
that set at 30 degrees I can toggle this

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.780 
that set at 30 degrees I can toggle this
back<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.280> 90<00:05:08.730> 22<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.810> half<00:05:09.950> 45<00:05:10.950> whatever

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
back to 90 22 and a half 45 whatever

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.480 
back to 90 22 and a half 45 whatever
angle<00:05:12.150> I<00:05:12.300> need<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:13.050> have<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.710> same<00:05:14.040> accuracy

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
angle I need and have that same accuracy

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.790 
angle I need and have that same accuracy
that<00:05:14.940> I<00:05:14.970> had<00:05:15.210> at<00:05:15.360> 30<00:05:15.660> had<00:05:16.320> all<00:05:16.440> those<00:05:16.590> other

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
that I had at 30 had all those other

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.010 
that I had at 30 had all those other
angles<00:05:17.310> so<00:05:17.700> it's<00:05:17.880> definitely<00:05:18.360> worth<00:05:18.540> taking

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
angles so it's definitely worth taking

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.380 
angles so it's definitely worth taking
the<00:05:19.050> time<00:05:19.140> and<00:05:19.590> once<00:05:20.490> you<00:05:20.640> have<00:05:20.820> this<00:05:21.000> set<00:05:21.240> up

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
the time and once you have this set up

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.670 
the time and once you have this set up
it<00:05:21.600> really<00:05:21.870> should<00:05:22.050> be<00:05:22.080> a<00:05:22.200> once<00:05:22.440> in<00:05:22.560> your

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
it really should be a once in your

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.950 
it really should be a once in your
lifetime<00:05:22.950> thing<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:23.730> take<00:05:24.330> your<00:05:24.450> time<00:05:24.690> do<00:05:24.930> it

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
lifetime thing so take your time do it

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.480 
lifetime thing so take your time do it
right<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.560> make<00:05:25.590> sure<00:05:25.919> that<00:05:26.070> your<00:05:26.220> miter

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
right and make sure that your miter

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.520 
right and make sure that your miter
gauge<00:05:26.820> is<00:05:27.090> accurately<00:05:27.960> cutting<00:05:28.410> and

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
gauge is accurately cutting and

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.380 
gauge is accurately cutting and
providing<00:05:28.950> all<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.190> accuracy<00:05:29.760> it<00:05:29.850> can<00:05:30.090> for

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
providing all the accuracy it can for
