it<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.810> really<00:01:49.470> really

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
it but it's really really really

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.889 
it but it's really really really
difficult<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.240> one<00:01:51.570> analog

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
difficult to do good with one analog

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.840 
difficult to do good with one analog
stick<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.380> honest<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.770> god<00:01:52.950> guys<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.430> did<00:01:53.700> not

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
stick like honest to god guys I did not

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.910 
stick like honest to god guys I did not
think<00:01:54.060> it'd<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.270> something<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:54.960> difficult<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
think it'd be something so difficult to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.149 
think it'd be something so difficult to
do<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.340> uh<00:01:56.990> playing<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.530> analog<00:01:58.920> stick

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
do but uh playing with one analog stick

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.700 
do but uh playing with one analog stick
is<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.509> annoying<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.259> aim<00:02:01.409> is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
is really annoying because your aim is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.800 
is really annoying because your aim is
like<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.130> off<00:02:02.369> there's<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.850> no<00:02:03.060> stick<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
like really off there's like no stick to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.380 
like really off there's like no stick to
aim<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.649> then<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.369> also<00:02:05.820> there's<00:02:06.090> like

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
aim with and then like also there's like

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.150 
aim with and then like also there's like
I<00:02:06.659> don't<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.530> pretty<00:02:07.649> much<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.860> like

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
I don't know it's pretty much just like

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.309 
I don't know it's pretty much just like
it's<00:02:08.970> hard<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.300> explain<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.050> analog

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
it's hard to explain but the analog

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.570 
it's hard to explain but the analog
sticks<00:02:10.590> not<00:02:10.739> there<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
sticks not there so like you know like a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.220 
sticks not there so like you know like a
little<00:02:11.849> round<00:02:12.060> things<00:02:12.510> it's

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
little round things it's

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.570 
little round things it's
all<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.470> analog<00:02:13.739> stick<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.340> stick

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
all the analog stick to the stick

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.040 
all the analog stick to the stick
actually<00:02:14.730> goes<00:02:15.030> into<00:02:15.239> that's<00:02:15.599> what<00:02:15.780> I'm<00:02:15.840> using

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
actually goes into that's what I'm using

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.039 
actually goes into that's what I'm using
so<00:02:16.290> I'm<00:02:16.379> just<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.680> using<00:02:17.040> like<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.190> ball<00:02:18.049> to

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
so I'm just like using like the ball to

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.930 
so I'm just like using like the ball to
aim<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:20.040> kind<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.250> hard<00:02:20.489> game<00:02:20.700> with

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
aim with so it's kind of hard game with

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.920 
aim with so it's kind of hard game with
well<00:02:21.239> it's<00:02:21.510> extremely<00:02:21.720> hard<00:02:22.110> aim<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
well it's extremely hard aim with and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.539 
well it's extremely hard aim with and
yeah<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.709> I'm<00:02:25.950> gonna<00:02:26.069> order<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.519> a

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
yeah so I'm gonna order like a

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.460 
yeah so I'm gonna order like a
controller<00:02:27.030> offline<00:02:27.720> probably<00:02:28.319> like<00:02:28.409> a

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
controller offline probably like a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.809 
controller offline probably like a
scuffs<00:02:28.799> or<00:02:28.920> something<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.580> just

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
scuffs or something like that just

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.140 
scuffs or something like that just
because<00:02:30.360> uh<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:32.190> don't<00:02:32.549> know<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.730> don't<00:02:33.000> really

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
because uh I don't know I don't really

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.089 
because uh I don't know I don't really
see<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> point<00:02:33.690> buying<00:02:34.019> another<00:02:34.200> Xbox<00:02:34.620> earlier

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
see a point buying another Xbox earlier

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.309 
see a point buying another Xbox earlier
I<00:02:35.390> might<00:02:36.390> as<00:02:36.450> well<00:02:36.540> get<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:37.080> actually

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
I might as well get one that's actually

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.410 
I might as well get one that's actually
worthwhile<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.010> customize<00:02:38.610> what<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:38.940> like<00:02:39.150> too

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
worthwhile and customize what I like too

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.960 
worthwhile and customize what I like too
because<00:02:40.260> I've<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.769> can't<00:02:41.129> play<00:02:41.310> xbox<00:02:41.579> for<00:02:41.849> this

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
because I've I can't play xbox for this

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.580 
because I've I can't play xbox for this
control<00:02:42.299> anymore<00:02:42.540> hurts<00:02:42.870> my<00:02:42.989> thumb<00:02:43.230> too<00:02:43.409> much

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
control anymore hurts my thumb too much

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.410 
control anymore hurts my thumb too much
just<00:02:43.980> because<00:02:44.129> there's<00:02:44.430> like<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.579> jagged<00:02:45.329> edge

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
just because there's like a jagged edge

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.140 
just because there's like a jagged edge
where<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.810> analog<00:02:46.140> stick<00:02:46.379> broke<00:02:46.590> off<00:02:46.829> so<00:02:47.760> and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
where the analog stick broke off so and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.910 
where the analog stick broke off so and
like<00:02:48.569> there's<00:02:48.810> just<00:02:48.930> no<00:02:49.079> analog<00:02:49.500> stick<00:02:49.709> at<00:02:49.829> all

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
like there's just no analog stick at all

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.520 
like there's just no analog stick at all
it's<00:02:50.069> almost<00:02:50.250> near<00:02:50.489> impossible<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:51.090> aim

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
it's almost near impossible to aim

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.660 
it's almost near impossible to aim
finally<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.829> don't<00:02:53.190> know<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.489> just

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
finally I don't know it's just

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.390 
finally I don't know it's just
definitely<00:02:53.819> uh<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:55.470> can't<00:02:55.680> win<00:02:55.829> competitive

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
definitely uh you can't win competitive

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.920 
definitely uh you can't win competitive
games<00:02:56.609> because<00:02:56.970> your<00:02:57.090> aim<00:02:57.239> is<00:02:57.420> off<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:57.780> stuff

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
games because your aim is off and stuff

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.330 
games because your aim is off and stuff
like<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.410> guys<00:02:58.530> can<00:02:58.650> see<00:02:58.769> my<00:02:58.890> aim<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.190> off

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
like that you guys can see my aim is off

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.039 
like that you guys can see my aim is off
right<00:02:59.579> there<00:02:59.790> and<00:02:59.819> stuff<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.510> it's

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
right there and stuff like that it's

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.170 
right there and stuff like that it's
just<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.500> know<00:03:01.620> any<00:03:02.099> competitive<00:03:02.700> games<00:03:02.970> it's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
just you know any competitive games it's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.729 
just you know any competitive games it's
almost<00:03:03.359> impossible<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:04.049> win<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.470> even

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
almost impossible to win like even

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.050 
almost impossible to win like even
though<00:03:04.859> we're<00:03:05.010> winning<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:06.000> do

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
though we're winning this and like I do

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.520 
though we're winning this and like I do
manage<00:03:06.359> to<00:03:06.480> go<00:03:06.569> positive<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.200> stuff<00:03:07.379> like

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
manage to go positive and stuff like

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.039 
manage to go positive and stuff like
that<00:03:07.769> like<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:08.489> deaths<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.750> I

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
that like see deaths like that that I

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.839 
that like see deaths like that that I
could<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.560> definitely<00:03:10.709> lived<00:03:11.370> stuff<00:03:11.670> like

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
could have definitely lived stuff like

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.009 
could have definitely lived stuff like
that<00:03:12.030> if<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.239> actually<00:03:12.329> had<00:03:12.629> a<00:03:12.660> proper

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
that if I actually had a proper

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.309 
that if I actually had a proper
controller<00:03:13.379> but<00:03:13.829> um<00:03:14.450> yeah<00:03:15.450> I've<00:03:15.750> spent<00:03:15.930> like

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
controller but um yeah I've spent like

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.330 
controller but um yeah I've spent like
two<00:03:16.500> minutes<00:03:16.650> talking<00:03:16.950> about<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.160> broken

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
two minutes talking about a broken

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.490 
two minutes talking about a broken
controller<00:03:17.819> so<00:03:18.150> any<00:03:18.419> anti<00:03:18.780> game<00:03:19.049> place<00:03:19.290> you

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
controller so any anti game place you

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
down to the States just so I can go into

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.980

into the fight myself because he didn't
back<00:05:27.830> out<00:05:28.070> he<00:05:28.370> would<00:05:28.490> have<00:05:28.580> just<00:05:28.760> gone<00:05:28.880> to<00:05:29.030> the

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.550 
back out he would have just gone to the
weigh-in<00:05:29.420> cuz<00:05:29.600> he<00:05:29.720> only<00:05:29.900> lives<00:05:30.050> 20<00:05:30.230> minutes
