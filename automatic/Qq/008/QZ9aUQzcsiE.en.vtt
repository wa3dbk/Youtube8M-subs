in<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.319> sense<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.769> these<00:03:05.040> students<00:03:05.459> are

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
in the sense that these students are

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.240 
in the sense that these students are
holding<00:03:06.000> up<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.630> building<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.319> are<00:03:07.980> like

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
holding up the building and are like

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.280 
holding up the building and are like
caryatids<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.750> whole<00:03:09.959> building

caryatids and the whole building

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.339 
caryatids and the whole building
actually<00:03:10.769> at<00:03:11.280> night<00:03:11.580> looks<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.080> different

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
actually at night looks so different

actually at night looks so different
because<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.130> piece<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.730> see<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.030> from

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
because of this piece you see it from

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.089 
because of this piece you see it from
the<00:03:15.360> inside<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.019> way<00:03:16.140> you<00:03:16.200> see<00:03:16.500> stained<00:03:16.799> glass

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
the inside the way you see stained glass

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.650 
the inside the way you see stained glass
and<00:03:17.130> then<00:03:17.519> from<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.850> outside<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.480> whole

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
and then from the outside the whole

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.870 
and then from the outside the whole
front<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.680> building<00:03:20.040> becomes<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.549> kind<00:03:20.760> of

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
front of the building becomes a kind of

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.270 
front of the building becomes a kind of
a<00:03:20.970> lantern<00:03:21.450> especially<00:03:22.109> with<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.920> moving
