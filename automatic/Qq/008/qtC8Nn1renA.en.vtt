00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.180
 the samsung galaxy s3 as well as on the 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.559
 telephones of 2012 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.809
 without, for example, the prestigious 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.889
 best products are yes what do you do then 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.050
 as a manufacturer 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.759
 every success that you go out with letters 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.890
 and that combination of well 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.439
 samsung does that see the samsung here 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.360
 galaxy s3 mini 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.950
 if you have the s3 and the s3 mini side by side 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.899
 Then you see that they are almost right 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.220
 are the minor details 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.079
 for example the places of the front 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.030
 camera and the flash on the back 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.219
 true in terms of looks and shape, they are real 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.710
 identical or funny is that 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.910
 menu button on the s3 mini is larger than that 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.230
 of the f3 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.820
 in terms of design, there are two 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.559
 so almost identical devices 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.879
 if you look at the specifications then 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.170
 You see that we are really about another 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.300
 speak the device 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.699
 just a short comparison and 1.4 and 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.010
 gigahertz quad-core processor in against 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.429
 his dual-core processor with 1280 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.839
 at 720 hd screen is now a 480 at 800 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.789
 pixel screen 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.409
 8 megapixel camera is a 5 megapixel 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.780
 camera and also the battery one of the 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.610
 showpieces of the s3 is in this s3 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.690
 mini less 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.060
 and we could have it further 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.220
 about the function that the expensive s3 has 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.570
 and not the mini but you would 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.390
 let's go see 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.590
 things this mini can do then 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.420
 for example, that it is already standard 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.160
 android squeaking has an inboard and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.950
 partly thanks to all tweets for example 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.720
 potty putter very smoothly it runs great 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.680
 The screen looks great as well 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.360
 doll play 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.520
 just the gems of the s3 is still 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.110
 surprisingly smooth the last two 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.940
 pluses go to the battery that good 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.710
 performs to the camera that especially 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.480
 just good under light conditions 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.970
 taking pictures it gets a little dim there 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.370
 or less light, sometimes less 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.830
 on the video or feature by the way is not 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.540
 really into the path of the counter then 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.890
 on the very first ton of screen 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.050
 keyboard well we have close 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.150
 must frolic that what are those letters 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.640
 small install my tip below 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.140
 keyboard all the video function and that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.060
 unfortunately a bit disappointing 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:04.329
 as you choose now 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.710
 pass threesome the galaxy iii mini 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.119
 then actually the most critical point 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.979
 and tap it to start off little 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.250
 on I have compared the device with the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.020
 s3 to all s3 mini is with your name 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.090
 why says the pure looks are sneaky 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.890
 it really just a galaxy s 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.690
 at least in a s3 shell like you the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.340
 specifications with the advantage that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.750
 he standard android squeaking one 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.340
 included 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.750
 and that left as I said one 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.269
 bit the milking 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.080
 certainly with a suggested retail price of over 400 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.730
 euros 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.260
 fortunately the price of 400 euros already 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.670
 dropped considerably and you will find it on our site 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.830
 now find for such 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.810
 twice 80 euros for comparison 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.690
 galaxy s most striking cost at the moment 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.519
 about 240 euros and that device like that 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.140
 by the way, an update well and by four 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.769
 pins a must get provided everything 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.110
 goes well 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.790
 you need the s3 mini in March of this year 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.069
 it now a s3 new with less respect 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.230
 or a s at least in the special case 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.330
 anyway device performs partly 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.160
 thanks to android 4 point an excellent 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.360
 are you in doubt between this mini and 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.980
 the there was stuck then hold it 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.079
 price difference of a few tens 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.489
 your back in terms of looks I would for the 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.049
 go s3 mini and with a bit of luck 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.329
 it also gets a little more updates 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.790
 android is just simply a 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.810
 Newer device is this mini gets in 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.810
 you get 4 stars
