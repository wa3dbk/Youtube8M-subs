00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.760
 cuchi cuchi of the cards that are going 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.380
 to make it look good and after 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.330
 look good because cuchi cuchi no 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.930
 so we're going to see the list in 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.930
 materials 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.869
 for Christmas cards we need 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.500
 eat with diamond kong and with adhesive 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.890
 decorative paper Christmas ribbons and 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.890
 adhesive pen 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.210
 because here he lives there he is destroying me 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.090
 the forum already throw several things bring more 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.250
 little things the ribbon is and we had lacked 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.160
 we only had this blue but like not 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.140
 combines and here we are already we bring the range 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 of colors on the head if so is that 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.320
 good we take with basically is to cook 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.590
 what is going 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.090
 what is going to be the card the part of 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.820
 outside of our card and we're going to 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.000
 fold as if it were a small notebook 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.160
 Now that we have this drill that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.460
 will help us to make it 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.909
 we can take out the holes for 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.990
 go to the bar 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.490
 we are going to teach you not to miss 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.649
 to despise and write to write 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.289
 the truth is that already taking with this 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:27.090
 technological wave and that he chatted and that you 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:30.299
 He sent an email to be careful and then 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.599
 they say to me hey I also give classes 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.599
 Over there 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.880
 I send them by mail or send me a month 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.520
 in which we have access of the media everything is 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:51.829
 twitter and I now is not that the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.829
 clear task turns out now it turns out that he 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.250
 to the same images of having this woman 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.960
 of pure master 10 would take pure 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.400
 divide if you saw how they behave 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.680
 those hooligan are already making me see my 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.990
 luck but I greet you all 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.550
 I think as it was said 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.900
 Good thing that has not kept 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.770
 then we made the holes for 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.770
 there we are going to pass the bar 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.840
 it also occurs to me that since before 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.519
 put clear clear 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.130
 I'm just going to put it on this side 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.620
 which is where the label is 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.170
 and let me go so all the links 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.560
 and not 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.420
 with this I can dial to share tea 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.160
 and leave you then I'm going to do it with 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.140
 be very careful because remember that 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.300
 also between better we mark what 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.360
 let's use and see how to 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.310
 and that paper is not wasted 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.720
 then maybe we'll go I say also 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.720
 this can be done as a business 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.650
 very pretty with combinations 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.780
 that you do not start doing what 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.580
 want it to be the cover of the design 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.440
 sometimes if they want to do a little bit of 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.600
 trap because there are already those who sell them 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.390
 facts but we have some nice designs 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.390
 for example us 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.850
 this little snowman and there's like 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.790
 different things that look looks like 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.100
 raise from a simple pony logic 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.620
 it is already a card in the form done and 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.270
 right but of course you have to fill it and what 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.120
 nice is going to be the content the 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.880
 dedicating that presumed intention that 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.860
 we give of course nothing to buy 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.510
 one is better to be given with love and 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.580
 that they write to you with affection and what 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.440
 I 'm going to do for this one to take off the 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.769
 decorative paper that we had with the 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.769
 adhesive pen 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.780
 to treat the label 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.910
 and be able to write about this paper 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.770
 because it is also a little complicated 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.900
 write on the background 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.050
 then already almost exactly we can have 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.560
 paper and we can only there yes yes yes already 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.360
 like and want to combine this part and what 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.819
 they have in computer then of a crime 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.290
 they stick it if they do not want it so they do not 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.299
 like its letter etcetera street the missive 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.060
 of that part of the truth amount 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.540
 that I am a technique that has been 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.980
 lost and that is very cute I am 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.130
 returning to be the bollitos because 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.419
 I had forgotten 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.520
 so he's also going to hit the other 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.309
 in case I'm going to be me that check 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.529
 the decoration of our name that does not 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:42.110
 have bought more than no more what 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:46.809
 beauty our guns game 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:51.030
 silicon are very creative design space 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:53.400
 my spirit those of silicone 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.400
 and we can paste some stars or 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.830
 something so cute 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.710
 and we can leave the other one with this one 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.040
 for example it could be like that with him 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.370
 family will be up to 2 nothing more like 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.220
 a design to keep giving ideas this 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.870
 guy should go with the snowflakes 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.530
 here 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.210
 of it is what I loved 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.020

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.770

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:38.009
 He let me take him to give and choose but 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.840
 neither are the views of the 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.600
 little mouse 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.130

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.259
 cheap book that we spend the same 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.659

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:32.520
 which will be the basis of your card in the 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:35.069

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.869
 curves have a sheet of paper on 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:38.939
 this foami and the other side decorates with 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:41.939
