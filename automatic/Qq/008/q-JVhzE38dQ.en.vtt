the planets and even transformers when

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.880 
the planets and even transformers when
they<00:00:40.829> first<00:00:41.160> came<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.649> those<00:00:43.649> are<00:00:43.860> my

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
they first came out so those are my

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.930

mechanical warrior if you like
destroying<00:00:51.120> itself<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:51.960> took<00:00:52.410> me<00:00:52.969> 18

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
destroying itself actually took me 18

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.569 
destroying itself actually took me 18
minutes<00:00:54.780> which<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.230> obviously<00:00:55.980> longer<00:00:56.430> than

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
minutes which is obviously longer than

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.900 
minutes which is obviously longer than
the<00:00:56.730> 15<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.570> idea<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.020> myself<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the 15 that idea for myself out of a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
the 15 that idea for myself out of a
reasonable<00:01:00.329> because<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:01.199> was<00:01:02.160> struggling<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
reasonable because I was struggling to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.530 
reasonable because I was struggling to
find<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:04.760> interesting<00:01:05.760> pose<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
find a interesting pose for the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.690 
find a interesting pose for the
character<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> wanted<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:08.040> create<00:01:08.670> something

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
character I wanted to create something

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.050 
character I wanted to create something
more<00:01:09.330> dynamic<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.320> was<00:01:10.909> thinking<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
more dynamic and I was thinking of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.719 
more dynamic and I was thinking of
superheroes<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.830> poses<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
superheroes and the kind of poses and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.359 
superheroes and the kind of poses and
see<00:01:14.909> them<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> comic<00:01:15.840> books<00:01:16.280> sort<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
see them in the comic books sort of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.240 
see them in the comic books sort of
taking<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.470> all<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> managed<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.920> come<00:01:20.220> up

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
taking on and all I managed to come up

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.080 
taking on and all I managed to come up
with<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.970> sort<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.420> weird<00:01:21.960> looking

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
with is this sort of weird looking

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.469 
with is this sort of weird looking
spider-man<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.479> crouched<00:01:25.049> pose<00:01:26.119> you<00:01:27.119> can

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
spider-man like crouched pose you can

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.140 
spider-man like crouched pose you can
see<00:01:27.750> here

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
see here

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.700 
see here
and<00:01:30.650> also<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.010> other<00:01:32.160> reason<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.730> took<00:01:32.910> longer

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
and also the other reason it took longer

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.430 
and also the other reason it took longer
obviously<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:36.440> very

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
obviously is because this is a very

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.270 
obviously is because this is a very
detailed<00:01:38.300> quick<00:01:39.300> sketch<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.410> comparison<00:01:41.160> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
detailed quick sketch in comparison to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.390 
detailed quick sketch in comparison to
some<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.730> other<00:01:41.910> ones<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:43.160> lot<00:01:44.160> of<00:01:44.190> that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
some of the other ones and a lot of that

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.530 
some of the other ones and a lot of that
is<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.550> of<00:01:44.910> my<00:01:45.210> thinking<00:01:45.720> time<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.320> stuff

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
is because of my thinking time and stuff

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.280 
is because of my thinking time and stuff
come<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.750> decide<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.380> would<00:01:49.710> such<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.460> that

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
come to decide what would such as that

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.340 
come to decide what would such as that
sort<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.350> quarter<00:01:52.800> circle<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.400> in<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.730> top

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
sort of quarter circle up in the top

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.930 
sort of quarter circle up in the top
right<00:01:55.350> honor<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.340> thinking<00:01:56.730> maybe

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
right honor there I was thinking maybe

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.510 
right honor there I was thinking maybe
that<00:01:57.870> could<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> moon<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.830> planet<00:01:59.070> or

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that could be a moon or planet or

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.210 
that could be a moon or planet or
something<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.150> background<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.920> in

off<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.780> market<00:02:49.790> actually<00:02:50.790> using<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.600> back

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
off the market actually using the back

off the market actually using the back
of<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.260> canvas<00:02:52.530> paper<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.400> much

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
of the canvas paper that is much

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.050 
of the canvas paper that is much
