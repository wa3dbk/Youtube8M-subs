00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.640
 it gets open here it breaks and then already 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.409
 everything is dismantled and then we go 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.530
 taking off the flaps to make it more 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.250
 comfortable to use and look 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.750
