 It's going to be a month in September, that's right. 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.579
 many expected it to be in November 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.230
 or December and because a while ago 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.930
 I posted a video here of a 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.330
 interview from bandai is the talking guy 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.340
 that they intended to launch 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.340
 the game only at the end of the year so 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.930
 that I and many of you are sure 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.360
 we thought that the game would only come to the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.330
 sale in November or December but 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.800
 we can see it will be well before 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.140
 in case that made me very happy 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.450
 because well sooner than expected i will 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.400
 to be able to play the new game of naruto and 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.990
 I'm sure you've written here 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.750
 channel was very happy with this news 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.880
 we also do not have the exact day that goes 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.070
 to launch on the exact day of September 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.770
 we know that any day of September he 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.440
 yes it will be released and now I want to talk 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.750
 about the pc version of the game guys it was 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.330
 announced as I already told you 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.790
 along with this news of the date of the month 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.770
 nec will be released the storm revolution 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.980
 they have also confirmed that the game 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.810
 yes it will have a version there by the extinct 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.550
 only there for the steel if you want 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.540
 buy the original light game will be 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.510
 for her and many were concerned not 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.810
 those who bought storm 3 on the pc were 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.110
 There you are wondering if the naruto game 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.850
 revolution would have for sale on the pc platform 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.340
 then you can be carefree because 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.769
 yes you will play naruto revolution no 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.360
 your pc because it is confirmed 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.850
 The only thing I 'm not sure is 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.120
 if the pc version would be released on the same 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.550
 day that the versions of xbox 360 and 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.970
 playstation 3 but in my opinion i 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.630
 I think so because TA and following 93 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.780
 furs has not been released it's the same day as 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.850
 storm 3 né of xbox 360 and 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.700
 playstation 3 because it was still nothing 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.709
 Confirmed, so the game is off for you. 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.140
 a petition was required that was 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.360
 approved and this game was released but 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.800
 now as they are already advertising well 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.850
 before the launch that will have a 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.670
 pc version 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.250
 Of course, yes, it can all be released 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.110
 the three versions on the same day this is the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.900
 My opinion, then, is no more 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.340
 That's when we talked about the scandal. 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.470

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.229
 brought a few days ago only did not give 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.150
 We also talked about the month of 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.280

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.990

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.880
