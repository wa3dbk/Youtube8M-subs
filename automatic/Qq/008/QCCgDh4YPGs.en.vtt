enjoy it yeah it's like this thing at
the<00:01:49.670> we<00:01:50.150> worry<00:01:50.390> about<00:01:50.479> things<00:01:50.930> that<00:01:51.020> are<00:01:51.170> just

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
the we worry about things that are just

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.260 
the we worry about things that are just
unnecessary<00:01:52.100> yeah<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:52.550> think<00:01:52.850> that's<00:01:53.119> what

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
unnecessary yeah I think that's what

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.670 
unnecessary yeah I think that's what
everybody<00:01:53.479> says<00:01:53.690> everybody<00:01:54.110> says<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.470> look
