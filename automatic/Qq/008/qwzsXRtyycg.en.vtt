now<00:02:17.349> it's<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.620> little<00:02:17.650> bit<00:02:17.950> unclear<00:02:18.250> what<00:02:18.610> they

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
now it's a little bit unclear what they

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.059 
now it's a little bit unclear what they
actually<00:02:18.849> mean<00:02:19.060> by<00:02:19.450> Hardware<00:02:20.049> edition<00:02:20.500> but<00:02:20.799> it

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
actually mean by Hardware edition but it

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.339 
actually mean by Hardware edition but it
is<00:02:21.250> fairly<00:02:21.610> safe<00:02:21.939> assumption<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.629> make<00:02:22.659> that

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
is fairly safe assumption to make that

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.809 
is fairly safe assumption to make that
it's<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.560> same<00:02:23.769> as<00:02:23.799> two<00:02:24.010> collectors<00:02:24.430> edition

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
it's the same as two collectors edition

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.160 
it's the same as two collectors edition

information pointed to the collector's

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.830 
information pointed to the collector's
edition<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.400> we<00:02:36.519> have<00:02:36.670> two<00:02:36.939> statements<00:02:37.480> which

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
edition so we have two statements which

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.750 
edition so we have two statements which
seemed<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.200> kind<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.920> contradict<00:02:39.459> each<00:02:39.579> other

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
seemed to kind of contradict each other

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.610 
seemed to kind of contradict each other
one<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.209> saying<00:02:40.420> about<00:02:40.689> standard<00:02:41.260> edition

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
one this saying about standard edition

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.720 
one this saying about standard edition
and<00:02:41.829> there<00:02:42.129> are<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.280> saying<00:02:42.489> about<00:02:42.609> the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and there are the saying about the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.280 
and there are the saying about the
collector's<00:02:43.060> edition<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.599> it<00:02:43.780> could<00:02:43.930> be<00:02:43.959> both

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
collector's edition so it could be both

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.009 
collector's edition so it could be both
but<00:02:44.349> then<00:02:44.680> almost<00:02:45.310> exact<00:02:46.000> amount<00:02:46.510> of

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
but then almost exact amount of

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.309 
but then almost exact amount of
customers<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:48.190> reflected<00:02:48.819> in<00:02:48.909> both<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.810> it's<00:02:50.260> a

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
customers is reflected in both so it's a

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.839 
customers is reflected in both so it's a
little<00:02:50.500> strange<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.190> hopefully<00:02:51.489> gain<00:02:51.609> why

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
little strange and hopefully gain why

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.930 
little strange and hopefully gain why
should<00:02:52.030> clear<00:02:52.269> this<00:02:52.420> up<00:02:52.599> as<00:02:52.840> naturally<00:02:53.680> this

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
should clear this up as naturally this

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.640 
should clear this up as naturally this
confusing<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.120> already<00:02:55.480> annoying<00:02:55.959> issue<00:02:56.290> for
