00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.320
 Good day today, I'll help you and 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.029
 tell you how to choose the right tire 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.230
 and without the help of different tests of different 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.210
 sales manager different advertising 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.520
 All information is ours, let's not 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.460
 let's see we have three parameters 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.250
 which arte itchy splint 32 p is 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.410
 wear resistance traction grip on 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.840
 wet road and pace growling this addiction 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.439
 overheating well does not mean 32 p 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.360
 means 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.309
 wear resistance relative to some 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.449
 tire and coupon ie the larger the figure 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:44.559
 the bigger tire which is served 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.479
 the store will pass than the cars took the coupon 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.489
 tires then he must pass 48 thousand 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.530
 kilometers but it's all in general something nonsense 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.780
 because we drive on common roads 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.920
 use and about 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.430
 tires coupon no 48 in real time she has 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.460
 wear about there 11 12 thousand kilometers 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.400
 on this basis of resistance 200 costs 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.100
 expect the tire to run from 20 to 30 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.970
 thousand kilometers and it will be in general 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.180
 will serve you well 1 2 or 3 seasons then 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.790
 if there is wear resistance from 200 to 300 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.320
 oh this usually means yashina which 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.540
 It designed to drive from point A to 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.000
 points b on them and they are racing there 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.990
 of course exceptions but we are about them 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.150
 will tell later if the tire has three dvr 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.390
 less than one hundred thickness is intended first 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.940
 lineup for the racetrack and very 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.750
 rarely she as an exception 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.940
 permitted on public roads 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.310
 will collect pebbles make noise and 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.000
 wear out so fast that you don't even 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.909
 have time to refuel yes if the tire has 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.850
 3dr in the area 140 160 she is sports 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.560
 a tire that will wear in a season 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.900
 will have excellent grip properties 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.760
 but also wear out quickly and by the way will 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.900
 cost is also quite expensive that 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.500
 means tracks and traction means 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.150
 wet grip 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.700
 clings to 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.380
 trailer and short blocks and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.580
 see how slow the trailer is 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.590
 ahead of the pickup going benefits in general then 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.860
 from this test is not very much because 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.150
 when locking does not work grooves and in 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.240
 Generally checked only 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.340
 as far as the mixture clings to the wet 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.260
 asphalt but no lead here and so 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.210
 further on this indicator the carrier on 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 indicator template set temperature 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.470
 In general, in fact, now the thing is useless 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.209
 once needed to determine 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.060
 overheating tendency but now 90 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.360
 percent tire has an indicator 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.350
 I would note also froze over 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.760
 traction rate 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.320
 has flour options 2 and then the fighters I 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.330
 for three attention if the letter b 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.140
 Stand Tushino likely you started for 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.610
 some kind of commercial use and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.660
 will keep relatively bad on 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.930
 wet pavement 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.660
 This is the first thing we can learn about tires 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.110
 we have the European Union decided to keep up with us 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.260
 and 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.280
 also came up with his q diagrams which 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.070
 will help the buyer to choose the type of tire without 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.519
 advertisements without all and this is just a few 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.440
 indicators the first indicator is 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.019
 rolling resistance ie 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.540
 tire puts on running drums looks 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.930
 after what time does it stop and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:34.110
 will run the children there is an option it from a to g 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.900
 despite the fact that for example the letter d is left 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.570
 the start is empty that is, the principle is specially 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.750
 the buyer is given a choice of something abc and 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.060
 either i fg data is an average option 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.340
 No that he did not hesitate despite the fact that 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.769
 rolling resistance difference between a and 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.920
 g is almost twice the difference 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.170
 serious these numbers are still relatively 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.160
 benchmark yes as in the previous we have tires 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.630
 32 l traction rate of speech and given clear 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.440
 hard indicators that are fixed 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.480
 in the European Union 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.390
 The following is our wet grip 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.850
 the surface is also held on to 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.880
 closed conditions and what interests us 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.580
 still the last is noise 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.380
 decibels basically every 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.110
 can determine how noisy but here 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.930
 given a hint for especially stupid 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:25.180
 how noisy that is one 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:29.300
 volume 2 and 3 of our case is 2 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.020
 in general, this is the main thing that is interesting 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.900
 learn about 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.530
 tire about markers in terms of choice 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:40.660
 Now let's look at 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.190
 dimension but do not know who came up with 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.490
 dimension for tires for civilians 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.510
 cars but it is complete nonsense 195 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:54.260
 50 r 15 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.820
 195 shows tread width 50 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.790
 shows carrier on i height 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.510
 relative width and 15 shows 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.390
 the wheel diameter is essentially a figure 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.750
 one useless 50 why do we need to know us 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.270
 need to know for ordinary civil 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.560
 the buyer to know only the width and 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.380
 outer diameter for what we need to give 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.420
 outer diameter so when installing the tire 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.140
 speedometer and odometer readings 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.750
 we were the same and did not scare that is 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:28.780
 for example the racing tire is called 195 on 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.910
 580 r15 what does 580 mean diameter 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.560
 very important thing that we need to learn 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.090
 about the tire before purchase 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.419
 This is stamped 4 digit number in our 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.930
 the case is 08 13 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:46.660
 it means the first two numbers mean 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.900
 week or two pressure last where the figure 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.360
 means year of manufacture that is not 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.150
 advised to take a tire over three four 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.310
 years even if it is sold in a store and 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.020
 general tire life and is designed for 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.000
 5-6 years what to keep 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.210
 exploit and so are we today 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.919
 reviewed briefly we defend today 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.520
 looked through several bus parameters 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:11.010
 the first is wear resistance 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.890
 wet grip and 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:19.360
 temperature then we looked 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:22.510
 European option is resistance 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.050
 rolling or economical grip 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.479
 wet and noisy yes that is 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.479
 the smaller letter means that 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.040
 rolling resistance least strong 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:37.750
 that is, another is long and rolls 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.790
 letter in terms of grip on 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:43.660
 Wet road means the most tenacious tires 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:47.169
 Well, the noise is also equal to 70, but note that 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:50.260
 that all of these data in European 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:52.660
 manufacturer for example resistance 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:56.530
 rolling or wet grip 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:07:00.220
 given for standard tires in our case 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.810
 size 265 by 45 r21 and resistance 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.789
 rolling and grip roads will be 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.720
 completely different than the same 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:09.010
 manufacturer 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.050
 but with a dimension of 195 by 50 r 15 therefore 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.050
 the wider the tire you take the worse 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.760
 rolling resistance and most likely 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.669
 will come earlier aqua plan 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.050
 therefore, these indicators are relative to me 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.729
