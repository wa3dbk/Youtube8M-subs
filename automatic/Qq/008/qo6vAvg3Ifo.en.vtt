00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the stippling brush it's a lot harder to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.880 
the stippling brush it's a lot harder to
move<00:00:48.750> around<00:00:48.930> though<00:00:49.320> because<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.770> know

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
move around though because you know

move around though because you know
color<00:00:50.160> stays<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> lot<00:00:50.879> stiffer<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.600> then<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
color stays a lot stiffer and then the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.040
