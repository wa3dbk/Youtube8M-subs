this video was pretty much it's gonna be
a<00:00:31.560> length<00:00:32.130> check<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.690> from<00:00:33.900> up

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
a length check as you can see from up

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.950 
a length check as you can see from up
above<00:00:34.190> I<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.910> been<00:00:36.060> natural<00:00:36.390> foot<00:00:36.570> two<00:00:36.720> and<00:00:36.900> a

big chop video I made a video of
pictures<00:00:45.680> which<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:46.950> sure<00:00:47.130> is<00:00:47.310> still<00:00:47.609> up

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.900 
pictures which I'm not sure is still up
or<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:49.440> made<00:00:49.859> a<00:00:49.890> video<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.340> pictures<00:00:50.820> of

or not but I made a video of pictures of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
or not but I made a video of pictures of
my<00:00:51.030> hair<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.420> first<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.840> seen<00:00:52.109> and<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:52.920> hair

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
my hair when I first be seen and my hair

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
my hair when I first be seen and my hair
was<00:00:53.190> about<00:00:53.430> an<00:00:53.550> inch<00:00:53.699> long<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:57.260> between<00:00:58.260> my

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
was about an inch long so between my

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
was about an inch long so between my
feet<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.219> two<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.519> a<00:00:59.550> half<00:00:59.699> years<00:00:59.910> ago<00:01:00.149> today

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
feet see two and a half years ago today

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.470 
feet see two and a half years ago today
I<00:01:00.960> probably<00:01:01.679> trimmed<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> total<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> three

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I probably trimmed it a total of three

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.140 
I probably trimmed it a total of three
times<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:04.680> other<00:01:04.830> than<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.129> no<00:01:05.489> major<00:01:05.730> cuts

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
times but other than that no major cuts

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.530 
times but other than that no major cuts
or<00:01:06.660> trims<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.470> anything<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.540> yeah

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
or trims or anything like that so yeah

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.810 
or trims or anything like that so yeah
this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.020> 2<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> half<00:01:10.410> years<00:01:10.860> I've<00:01:11.370> never

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this is 2 and a half years I've never

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.780 
this is 2 and a half years I've never
actually<00:01:12.630> measured<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.890> length<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:14.430> hair

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
actually measured the length of my hair

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.320 
actually measured the length of my hair
so<00:01:15.300> this<00:01:15.480> will<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.720> my<00:01:15.870> very<00:01:15.900> first<00:01:16.440> time

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
so this will be my very first time

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.950 
so this will be my very first time
measuring<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> which<00:01:18.660> is<00:01:18.780> gonna<00:01:18.870> be

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
measuring it which is gonna be

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
measuring it which is gonna be
interesting<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:19.860> much<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.250> hair

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
interesting to see how much my hair

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.910 
interesting to see how much my hair
grows<00:01:20.759> which<00:01:21.479> our<00:01:21.659> tracks<00:01:22.079> are<00:01:22.259> probably<00:01:22.560> too

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
grows which our tracks are probably too

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.580 
grows which our tracks are probably too
lean<00:01:23.759> chicke<00:01:24.150> probably<00:01:24.630> every<00:01:24.780> 6<00:01:25.049> months<00:01:25.409> now

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
lean chicke probably every 6 months now

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.080 
lean chicke probably every 6 months now
just<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> see<00:01:26.990> if<00:01:27.990> there's<00:01:28.229> been<00:01:28.320> any<00:01:28.500> major

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
just to see if there's been any major

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.639 
just to see if there's been any major
growth<00:01:30.090> which<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.810> know<00:01:30.930> hopefully<00:01:31.320> there

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
growth which you know hopefully there

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.760 
growth which you know hopefully there
will<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:33.000> I'm<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.290> go<00:01:34.439> ahead<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
will be so I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.910 
will be so I'm just gonna go ahead and
start<00:01:35.869> first<00:01:36.869> I'm<00:01:37.079> gonna<00:01:37.229> start<00:01:37.350> off<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
start first I'm gonna start off on the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.920 
start first I'm gonna start off on the
sides<00:01:42.290> right<00:01:43.290> by<00:01:43.470> my<00:01:43.619> ear<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:45.750> just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
sides right by my ear and I'm just

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
sides right by my ear and I'm just
placing<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.469> as<00:01:47.310> close<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> scalp<00:01:48.299> as

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
placing this as close to the scalp as

00:01:48.509 --> 00:02:03.980 
placing this as close to the scalp as
possible<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:51.110> just<00:01:52.939> stretching<00:01:53.939> my<00:01:54.090> hair

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.370 

until<00:02:04.990> they<00:02:05.140> don't<00:02:05.350> go<00:02:05.560> anymore

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
until they don't go anymore

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.240 
until they don't go anymore
so<00:02:09.660> looks<00:02:10.660> about<00:02:10.960> right<00:02:11.200> there<00:02:11.560> which<00:02:11.980> means

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
so looks about right there which means

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.010 
so looks about right there which means
the<00:02:12.490> side<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:13.350> 15<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.840> other

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
the side is 15 and just to the other

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.810 
the side is 15 and just to the other
side<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.560> see<00:02:17.770> if<00:02:17.800> they<00:02:18.040> pretty<00:02:18.310> much<00:02:18.520> rule

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
side to see if they pretty much rule

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.980 
side to see if they pretty much rule
equally

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:35.650 

sis<00:02:27.560> well<00:02:28.690> 15<00:02:29.690> inches

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.270 

and<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.810> probably<00:02:37.050> would<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.260> smart<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.770> do<00:02:37.920> I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
and this probably would be smart to do I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.160 
and this probably would be smart to do I
got<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.640> blow<00:02:38.910> dried<00:02:39.210> your<00:02:39.390> hair<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.870> I

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
got the blow dried your hair but I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:49.980 
got the blow dried your hair but I
rarely<00:02:40.590> goes<00:02:41.040> around<00:02:41.310> my<00:02:41.400> hair<00:02:41.640> so

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.140 

there<00:02:52.050> my<00:02:53.050> front<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.740> a<00:02:53.770> little<00:02:54.310> past<00:02:54.490> 14

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
there my front is a little past 14

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:04.900 
there my front is a little past 14
inches

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.820 

you

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
you

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.880 
you
do<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.520> same<00:03:07.700> thing<00:03:07.760> for<00:03:08.420> the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890
