00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
the first try I'm still stuck on the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.789 
the first try I'm still stuck on the
second<00:03:30.950> stage<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:32.079> yeah<00:03:33.079> it<00:03:33.230> became<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.560> lot

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
second stage but yeah it became a lot

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.580 
second stage but yeah it became a lot

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
easier after that and I'm wondering is

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.580 
easier after that and I'm wondering is
that<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.970> problem<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.780> lot<00:03:38.989> of<00:03:39.139> these<00:03:39.290> game

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
into the game naturally thinking that

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.979

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
left on a level level field you don't

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.759 
left on a level level field you don't
really<00:03:52.609> get<00:03:52.879> aim<00:03:53.150> your<00:03:53.840> shots<00:03:54.139> up<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.590> down

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769

really get aim your shots up and down
diagonally<00:03:55.099> and<00:03:56.349> if<00:03:57.349> you<00:03:57.500> didn't<00:03:57.709> read<00:03:57.889> the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
diagonally and if you didn't read the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.640 
diagonally and if you didn't read the
instruction<00:03:58.579> manual<00:03:58.609> or<00:03:59.480> have<00:04:00.230> somebody<00:04:00.470> else

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
instruction manual or have somebody else

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.199 
instruction manual or have somebody else
tell<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.069> that<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.609> would<00:04:01.760> never<00:04:01.879> learned

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
that so I can understand why game

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.449 
that so I can understand why game
reviewers<00:04:05.810> might<00:04:06.109> have<00:04:06.440> found<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.280> game

frustrating<00:04:08.209> like<00:04:08.389> that<00:04:08.569> because<00:04:08.720> nobody

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
frustrating like that because nobody

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.869 
frustrating like that because nobody
really<00:04:09.500> reads<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.310> instruction<00:04:10.849> manual

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
really reads the instruction manual

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.360

nowadays<00:04:12.099> so<00:04:14.109> being<00:04:15.109> that<00:04:15.199> as<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.709> may<00:04:15.739> I<00:04:15.949> think

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
nowadays so being that as it may I think

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.719 
nowadays so being that as it may I think

aspect of aiming arrows pretty much

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.900 
aspect of aiming arrows pretty much
changes<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.820> entire<00:04:29.000> game<00:04:29.210> play<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.910> you

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
changes the entire game play and you

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.879

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
don't know you can do that then you

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.740 
don't know you can do that then you
really<00:04:34.099> would<00:04:34.550> see<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.880> games<00:04:35.090> being<00:04:35.449> really

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
really would see the games being really

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.650
