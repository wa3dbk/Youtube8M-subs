00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.579 

now<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> key<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.910> making<00:01:00.239> soups<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.289> very

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
now the key to making soups is very

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:02.869 
now the key to making soups is very
important<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.429> very<00:01:02.489> important

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
important I think it's very important

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.460 
important I think it's very important
that<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.030> sweat<00:01:03.269> off<00:01:03.390> all<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> onions<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that you sweat off all the onions and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.780 
that you sweat off all the onions and
you<00:01:04.530> sweat<00:01:04.680> off<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> actually<00:01:05.309> ingredient

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you sweat off the actually ingredient

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.700 
you sweat off the actually ingredient
you're<00:01:05.850> making<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.150> soup<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:07.290> well<00:01:07.500> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you're making a soup with very well so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.960 
you're making a soup with very well so
it's<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:08.040> soft<00:01:08.310> otherwise<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.850> doesn't

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it's very soft otherwise it doesn't

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.090 
it's very soft otherwise it doesn't
release<00:01:09.240> its<00:01:09.509> natural<00:01:09.840> flavors<00:01:10.200> sometimes

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
release its natural flavors sometimes

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.039 
release its natural flavors sometimes
people<00:01:11.490> add<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> liquid<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.720> soups

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
people add the liquid to the soups

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.510 
people add the liquid to the soups
without<00:01:13.470> cooking<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.040> actual<00:01:14.340> vegetable

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
without cooking the actual vegetable

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.950 
without cooking the actual vegetable
first<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.119> therefore<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:15.780> much

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
first so therefore you don't get much

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.139 
first so therefore you don't get much
flavor<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.950> important<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.580> sweat

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
flavor so it's important to really sweat

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.450 
flavor so it's important to really sweat
everything<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:18.690> down<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.200> release<00:01:19.470> maximum

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
everything right down to release maximum

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.180 
everything right down to release maximum
flavor<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:22.140> they've<00:01:22.259> never<00:01:22.530> met<00:01:22.740> sort<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.039> two

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
flavor so they've never met sort of two

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.499 
flavor so they've never met sort of two
to<00:01:23.310> three<00:01:23.490> minutes<00:01:23.729> now<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.479> to
