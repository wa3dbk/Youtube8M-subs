clutter from the channel let's be honest

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.859 
clutter from the channel let's be honest
how<00:01:50.009> many<00:01:50.039> of<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.520> actually<00:01:50.700> track<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.629> back

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
through videos not too many I'm assuming

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.809 
through videos not too many I'm assuming
because<00:01:55.440> we<00:01:55.739> get<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.890> ask<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.310> same<00:01:56.429> questions

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
because we get to ask the same questions

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.150 
because we get to ask the same questions
time<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.119> time<00:01:57.239> again<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.789> in<00:01:59.789> the<00:02:00.239> ultimate

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
time and time again so in the ultimate

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.559 
time and time again so in the ultimate
ending<00:02:02.160> of<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.580> what<00:02:03.000> does<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.149> mean<00:02:03.360> it

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
ending of all this what does it mean it

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.449 
ending of all this what does it mean it
means<00:02:03.629> that<00:02:03.929> we<00:02:03.959> can<00:02:04.140> rejuvenate<00:02:04.500> old<00:02:05.009> videos

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459
