00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
kick stand back here and then while I'm

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.110 
kick stand back here and then while I'm
thinking<00:05:27.920> about<00:05:28.280> let's<00:05:28.460> text<00:05:28.700> battery<00:05:29.000> and

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
thinking about let's text battery and

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.030 
thinking about let's text battery and
see<00:05:29.830> how<00:05:30.830> big<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.280> battery<00:05:31.580> is<00:05:31.790> we've<00:05:32.210> got<00:05:32.240> a

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
see how big the battery is we've got a

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.250 
see how big the battery is we've got a
just<00:05:34.040> to<00:05:34.160> make<00:05:34.310> sure<00:05:34.340> here<00:05:35.180> is<00:05:35.300> not<00:05:35.720> telling

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
just to make sure here is not telling

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.460 
just to make sure here is not telling
whether<00:05:36.590> it<00:05:36.770> is<00:05:37.090> 1230<00:05:38.090> milliamp<00:05:39.080> hour<00:05:39.320> battery

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
whether it is 1230 milliamp hour battery

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.130 
whether it is 1230 milliamp hour battery
so<00:05:39.920> it's<00:05:40.040> only<00:05:40.240> 1230<00:05:41.240> milliamps<00:05:41.870> that's<00:05:42.020> right

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
so it's only 1230 milliamps that's right

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.110 
so it's only 1230 milliamps that's right
up<00:05:42.230> there<00:05:42.260> with<00:05:42.410> the<00:05:42.470> inspire<00:05:42.800> 4G<00:05:43.370> and<00:05:43.520> the

that battery life's not going to be the

than light to moderate use you've

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.110 
than light to moderate use you've
probably<00:05:51.890> got<00:05:52.100> to<00:05:52.220> charge<00:05:52.490> at<00:05:52.640> least<00:05:52.820> once

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120

probably got to charge at least once
throughout<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:54.050> day<00:05:54.230> now<00:05:54.440> another<00:05:54.620> thing

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
throughout the day now another thing

that I had an issue with on the hd7 and
I'm<00:05:56.810> already<00:05:57.020> seeing<00:05:57.380> it<00:05:57.590> on<00:05:57.740> this<00:05:58.370> when<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.550> had

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
I'm already seeing it on this when I had

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.640 
I'm already seeing it on this when I had
it<00:05:58.820> on<00:05:58.880> the<00:05:58.970> inspire<00:05:59.330> as<00:05:59.540> well<00:05:59.720> as<00:05:59.810> HTC<00:06:00.200> started

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
barely sticking out and over time I

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.810 
barely sticking out and over time I
noticed<00:06:09.950> that<00:06:10.160> you<00:06:10.310> know<00:06:10.400> while<00:06:10.520> using<00:06:10.700> the

hd7 the button felt it felt like it was

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.820 
hd7 the button felt it felt like it was
kind<00:06:14.210> of<00:06:14.300> resetting<00:06:14.630> itself<00:06:14.900> back<00:06:15.260> down<00:06:15.560> into

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
kind of resetting itself back down into

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.440 
kind of resetting itself back down into

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
to push his energy already tell it's

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.140 
to push his energy already tell it's
gonna<00:06:24.110> take<00:06:24.290> me<00:06:24.380> one<00:06:24.530> or<00:06:24.620> two<00:06:24.770> times<00:06:25.120> when<00:06:26.120> I

just pull it up off the desk to turn off

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.180 
just pull it up off the desk to turn off
seems<00:06:28.700> okay<00:06:28.940> at<00:06:29.030> the<00:06:29.120> moment<00:06:29.830> but<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:30.890> know<00:06:30.980> with

seems okay at the moment but I know with

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.650 
seems okay at the moment but I know with
the<00:06:31.250> hd7<00:06:31.520> I'd<00:06:31.850> have<00:06:31.970> to<00:06:32.060> press<00:06:32.210> it<00:06:32.360> once<00:06:32.510> or
