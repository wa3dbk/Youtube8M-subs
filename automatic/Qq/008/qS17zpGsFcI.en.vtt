of<00:00:40.860> course<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.520> thought<00:00:41.760> who<00:00:42.300> better<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.540> ask

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
of course I thought who better to ask

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.670 
of course I thought who better to ask
than<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.800> folks<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.550> Kickstarter<00:00:45.500> you<00:00:46.500> may<00:00:46.620> be

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
saying drift car Rolls Royce well how's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.529 
saying drift car Rolls Royce well how's
that<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.980> work<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> recipe<00:00:53.070> is

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
that going to work and the recipe is

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
that going to work and the recipe is
comparatively<00:00:54.539> simple<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.110> guess<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.410> could

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
comparatively simple I guess you could

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.939 
comparatively simple I guess you could
say<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:56.010> mean<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:57.510> add<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:58.379> turbos<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
say I mean just add two turbos to the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.819 
say I mean just add two turbos to the
front<00:00:59.449> put<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> manual<00:01:00.719> behind<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> engine<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
front put a manual behind the engine and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.570 
front put a manual behind the engine and
this<00:01:02.309> engine<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:03.300> well<00:01:03.539> suited<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:03.899> boost

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
this engine is well suited for boost

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.600 
this engine is well suited for boost
then<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> suitable<00:01:06.720> rear<00:01:07.290> end<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:08.369> some

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
then get a suitable rear end do some

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.870 
then get a suitable rear end do some
serious<00:01:09.000> suspension<00:01:09.630> work<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.490> take<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
serious suspension work and take it to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.359 
serious suspension work and take it to
the<00:01:11.970> track<00:01:12.150> well<00:01:12.960> okay<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.189> easy

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the track well okay it's not that easy

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.390 
the track well okay it's not that easy
but<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:16.200> car<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.189> decent

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
but this car is actually a decent

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.700 
but this car is actually a decent
