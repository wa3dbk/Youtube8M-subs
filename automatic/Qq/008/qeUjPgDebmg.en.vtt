00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.480
 good afternoon today we will talk about 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.170
 especially that in different planting 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.230
 seasons 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.720
 we have already published our channel video about 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.950
 how to plant your talk today about 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 nuances of planting in spring in summer and autumn 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.170
 early spring before sap flow 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.720
 the best apparatus for landing a tour to this 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.970
 time does not begin to grow as shoots so 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.180
 as root system so it is better 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.490
 just transfer transplant except this 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.020
 root ball is likely to be 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.540
 so frozen will not 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.210
 fall apart when landing while doing 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.790
 plants will remain a whole season in order 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.790
 to grow a strong root system 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.050
 minimum young root hairs 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.280
 dries out the maximum will grow in a season because 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.260
 these smelt 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.100
 are the main soak or 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.760
 soil minerals 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.220
 landing that summer the most laborious then 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.470
 and like all wars and very sensitive 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 to dry up the root system therefore 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.240
 you will need to land 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.840
 as quickly as possible and before her carefully 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 prepare 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.310
 landing temperature should not 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.160
 exceed 20 degrees perfect time 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.960
 the morning when the humidity will also be high 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.780
 remember that cam that and in the process of landing 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.940
 you can keep open only 10-15 minutes 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.500
 during this time you will need to fill 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.900
 the whole pit by soil mixture 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.040
 because ramming will have to work 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.980
 quickly 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.330
 the main nuance when planting in the fall is what 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.150
 that and still do not have 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.650
 strong root system land around 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.590
 who will squander 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.690
 and thuyu can seriously tilt when 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.080
 snowfall especially strong wind 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.720
 so after landing it is imperative 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.750
 secure the plant with stretch marks and potassium 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.840
 world in evil coma landing at any 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.000
 time of year remember something i'm losing a lot 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.119
 moisture evaporation through the crown 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.950
 especially young so after landing 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.620
 for one or two months it is necessary 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.800
 to cover with an awning from camouflage net 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.630
 if landing is done in the autumn, then the awning 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.690
 for shading can be left until spring 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.950
 so that I avoid sunburn 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.840
 late xii 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.420
 Berezin 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.670
 remember that most needing 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.280
 development part of the plant when planting the 3rd 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:38.099
 root system must spill 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.739
 after planting your root root these simple 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.660
 landing tips will allow your tu and 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.260
 settle well and already the next year 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.560
 delight you abundantly empty beautiful 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.560
 needles 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.500
 and
