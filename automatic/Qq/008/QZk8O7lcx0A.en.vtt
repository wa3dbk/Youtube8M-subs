was<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.490> bridge<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> bottom

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
was in a bridge and it's just the bottom

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.300 
was in a bridge and it's just the bottom
half<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.190> was<00:00:14.309> really<00:00:14.969> badly<00:00:15.240> vandalized

so<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.039> match<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.240> stone<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.380> an

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
so we can match the stone to this for an

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.580 
so we can match the stone to this for an

available stone that will match this is

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.670 
available stone that will match this is
a<00:02:43.459> sample<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.600> we<00:02:44.720> took<00:02:44.930> earlier<00:02:45.080> from<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
a sample that we took earlier from the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.420 
a sample that we took earlier from the
site

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
site

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.000

it's a masonry block right directly out
of<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.280> wall<00:02:49.459> we<00:02:50.150> can<00:02:50.390> take<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.870> out<00:02:50.990> of<00:02:51.020> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
of the wall we can take it out of the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.280 
of the wall we can take it out of the
wall<00:02:51.410> turn<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.250> over<00:02:52.540> take<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.570> core<00:02:53.930> from<00:02:54.230> the

wall turn it over take a core from the
rear<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.010> sample<00:02:55.550> put<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.600> back<00:02:57.020> into<00:02:57.319> the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
rear of the sample put it back into the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.979 
rear of the sample put it back into the
wall<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.190> no<00:02:58.550> one<00:02:58.760> even<00:02:59.150> notices<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.900> we

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
wall so that no one even notices that we

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.590 
wall so that no one even notices that we
took<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.350> sample<00:03:00.770> we<00:03:01.760> then<00:03:01.910> take<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.209> back<00:03:02.390> to

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
took the sample we then take it back to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.110 
took the sample we then take it back to
the<00:03:02.690> lab<00:03:02.900> where<00:03:03.800> we<00:03:03.950> cut<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.310> sample<00:03:04.700> right<00:03:04.970> in

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
the lab where we cut the sample right in

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.310 
the lab where we cut the sample right in
half<00:03:06.280> we<00:03:07.280> get<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.790> thin<00:03:08.330> section<00:03:08.660> from<00:03:09.140> the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
half we get a thin section from the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.140 
half we get a thin section from the
sample<00:03:09.769> which<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.160> then<00:03:10.370> analyzed<00:03:10.880> with<00:03:11.090> a

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
sample which we then analyzed with a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.960 
sample which we then analyzed with a
microscope<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:11.989> tells<00:03:12.920> us<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.340> DNA<00:03:13.790> of

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
microscope and that tells us the DNA of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.690 
microscope and that tells us the DNA of
the<00:03:14.090> stone<00:03:14.330> type<00:03:14.630> for<00:03:15.260> future<00:03:15.860> matching<00:03:16.489> with

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
the stone type for future matching with

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.620 
the stone type for future matching with
existing<00:03:17.030> stone<00:03:17.959> types<00:03:18.200> today<00:03:19.630> historically

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
existing stone types today historically

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.380 
existing stone types today historically
our<00:03:20.930> stone<00:03:21.530> types<00:03:21.830> were<00:03:22.100> exported<00:03:22.790> around<00:03:23.000> the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
our stone types were exported around the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.750 
our stone types were exported around the
world<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.320> United<00:03:24.680> States<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.250> Australia

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
world to the United States to Australia

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.160 
world to the United States to Australia
New<00:03:25.910> Zealand<00:03:25.940> South<00:03:26.570> Africa<00:03:26.709> etc<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.170> recent

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
New Zealand South Africa etc so a recent

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.600 
New Zealand South Africa etc so a recent
surprise<00:03:30.350> would<00:03:30.860> be<00:03:30.980> we<00:03:31.160> were<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.459> looking

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
surprise would be we were just looking

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.850 
surprise would be we were just looking
at<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.940> statue<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.570> Robert<00:03:32.750> Burns<00:03:33.230> which<00:03:33.620> was

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
at a statue of Robert Burns which was

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.550 
at a statue of Robert Burns which was
carved<00:03:34.220> by<00:03:34.310> green<00:03:34.670> shields<00:03:35.299> sculptor<00:03:36.230> in<00:03:36.410> the

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
carved by green shields sculptor in the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.300 
carved by green shields sculptor in the
18th<00:03:37.459> century<00:03:37.549> in<00:03:38.090> Scotland<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:40.040> stat

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
18th century in Scotland and that stat

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.340 
18th century in Scotland and that stat
she<00:03:40.549> was<00:03:40.670> exported<00:03:41.390> with<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.570> family<00:03:42.079> when<00:03:42.230> they

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
she was exported with a family when they

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.440 
she was exported with a family when they
moved<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.680> Australia<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.880> we<00:03:44.030> were<00:03:44.120> able<00:03:44.269> to

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
moved to Australia and we were able to

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.199 
moved to Australia and we were able to
reopen<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.290> historic<00:03:45.860> quarry<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:46.519> was<00:03:46.910> used

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
reopen the historic quarry that was used

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.410 
reopen the historic quarry that was used
to<00:03:47.420> carve<00:03:47.750> that<00:03:48.110> stone<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:48.920> statue<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:50.299> it's

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
to carve that stone that statue and it's

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.509 
to carve that stone that statue and it's
now<00:03:50.570> being<00:03:50.840> shipped<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.320> Australia<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:52.040> fix<00:03:52.280> it

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
now being shipped to Australia to fix it

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.150 
now being shipped to Australia to fix it
I<00:03:53.019> think<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.110> most<00:03:54.260> rewarding<00:03:54.410> part<00:03:54.739> really

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
I think the most rewarding part really

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.220 
I think the most rewarding part really
is<00:03:55.340> just<00:03:55.640> talking<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:56.269> people<00:03:56.299> who<00:03:57.200> are

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
is just talking to people who are

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.250 
is just talking to people who are
completely<00:03:58.040> unaware<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.850> how<00:03:59.180> local<00:03:59.480> and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
completely unaware of how local and

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.690 
completely unaware of how local and
where<00:04:00.380> their<00:04:00.530> house<00:04:00.739> came<00:04:01.130> from<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.670> know

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
where their house came from you know

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.490 
where their house came from you know
where<00:04:01.970> their<00:04:02.150> school<00:04:02.540> came<00:04:02.840> from<00:04:03.110> where<00:04:03.320> their

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
where their school came from where their

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.550 
where their school came from where their
church<00:04:03.829> was<00:04:04.160> built<00:04:04.430> out<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.760> and<00:04:05.390> how<00:04:05.930> locally

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
church was built out of and how locally

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.770 
church was built out of and how locally
sourced<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.160> used<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.519> be<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:08.450> it's<00:04:08.570> really

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
sourced it used to be so it's really

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.819 
sourced it used to be so it's really
just<00:04:08.900> getting<00:04:09.079> involved<00:04:09.560> with<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.709> local

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
just getting involved with the local

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.590 
just getting involved with the local
community<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.549> teaching<00:04:10.970> them<00:04:11.120> about<00:04:11.390> their

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
community and teaching them about their

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.380 
community and teaching them about their
heritage<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.470> raising<00:04:13.160> awareness<00:04:13.400> as<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:13.940> how

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
heritage and raising awareness as to how

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.340 
heritage and raising awareness as to how
special<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:16.090> because<00:04:17.090> it's<00:04:17.539> so<00:04:17.780> close<00:04:18.079> to

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
special it is because it's so close to

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.090 
special it is because it's so close to
where<00:04:18.500> they<00:04:18.680> were<00:04:18.739> brought<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:21.019> scale<00:04:21.680> of

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
where they were brought the scale of

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.770 
where they were brought the scale of
quarrying<00:04:22.700> as<00:04:22.880> an<00:04:23.000> industry<00:04:23.570> in<00:04:23.690> the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
quarrying as an industry in the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.140 
quarrying as an industry in the
industrial<00:04:24.320> heritage<00:04:24.530> behind<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:25.460> no<00:04:25.970> one

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
industrial heritage behind that no one

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.880 
industrial heritage behind that no one
else<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.539> really<00:04:26.690> investigating<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.680> and

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
else is really investigating that and

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.230 
else is really investigating that and
looking<00:04:28.130> into<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.490> as<00:04:28.700> much<00:04:28.910> as<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
looking into that as much as the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.260 
looking into that as much as the
building<00:04:29.570> stone<00:04:29.780> team<00:04:30.080> at<00:04:30.500> bgs<00:04:31.010> is<00:04:31.220> doing<00:04:31.640> so

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
building stone team at bgs is doing so

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.120 
building stone team at bgs is doing so
it's<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.510> very<00:04:32.660> crucial<00:04:32.990> work<00:04:33.380> that's<00:04:33.680> going<00:04:33.860> on
