00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:14.179
 hello my name is lucas and in this video I 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:17.289
 I will explain everything about the axis 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.449
 ax months a modern supplement and 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.660
 perfect for gaining muscle mass and 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.689
 improve their health without risk of 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.010
 to develop problems with glucose in 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.039
 high 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.800
 see and learn how the oxy mese can be 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.350
 perfect for you to ensure more 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.739
 quality of life and muscles 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.319
 developed 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.839
 before we talk about oxy neise we need 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:47.989
 talk about their predecessors 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.870
 it might even be that you still do not use 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.449
 knowing that with the arrival of oxy months 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.649
 you no longer need to use 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:00.350
 base of next dose remote dextre na mas 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.979
 after all what are these two components 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.829
 important that some supplements 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.859
 death of the star guide of estrosi are 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:12.680
 carbohydrate and used in supplements to 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.659
 make you gain muscle mass and loss 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.170
 of weight 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.600
 but with those with prolonged and 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.729
 without a control in the feeding these 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.020
 components can do the inverse effect 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.619
 ie making you gain fat instead 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.859
 lean mass but why does it happen? 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.469
 well this is possible because both the next 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.409
 bronze with a hand dextre right 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:43.819
 are two types of glucose being 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.490
 Dextro Ozzy is a loving girl who wants 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:50.329
 say that Cozzi and maltodextrin 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.640
 it is the polis the charity what it means 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.270
 which turns into glucose in the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.470
 organism for later if it is absorbed by 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.540
 he 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.660
 whole carbohydrate becomes the glucose in 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.840
 our body and then into energy 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:11.340
 but if there is no total burning of this 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.900
 What if she can become sanity and then 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.520
 you can get fat 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.560
 in the case of dextron 11 the organism 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.740
 absorb faster 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.950
 but both she and maquintex trina 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.470
 can make a person fat on video and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.080
 lean muscle mass 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.740
 beyond the danger of developing diabetes 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.200
 in the future to avoid these problems 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.550
 that these supplements cause in long 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.180
 term 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.740
 product was developed much more 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.820
 efficient for the gain of muscle mass 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:54.450
 and weight loss that does not use dextrose 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.950
 and neither is maltodextrin and it is called the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.930
 Ax and months 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.680
 the axn and month and has as component 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.489
 Main starch and corn output of the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.470
 called the best known use mixer in 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.739
 united states 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.070
 this friend has carbohydrates 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.480
 sufficient 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:20.040
 in addition to providing greater energy 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:23.130
 because of its 70% pectin and 30% 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.750
 the eleven that are the components that 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.019
 provide faster and more efficient management 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:35.010
 besides not causing insulin rich 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:38.160
 many high avoiding that the time to 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.989
 person developing diabetes or other 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.550
 diseases 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:47.519
 Furthermore the ax month is perfect because 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:52.200
 can attract difficult nutrients 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:56.280
 absorbed by the body and maintains 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.970
 health and energy is on the rise. 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.000
 much faster and without much 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.120
 problems with insulin spikes 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.430
 besides ensuring 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.409
 a loss of weight and a muscular gain 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.060
 much faster 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:15.359
 she does not have sugar and she does not have water 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.389
 and also has no gluten 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:22.540
 I think the only contradiction is for 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.270
 diabetic people because even with 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.030
 low glucose levels and peaks 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.960
 when ingested in the long term 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:36.310
 oxy can compromise the meise levels 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.620
 to diabetics to use 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.639
 supplement is very important that you 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.010
 before 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.220
 talk to your doctor if you are 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.220
 diabetic 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:51.610
 usually it can be used in 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:56.320
 together with other supplements such as 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.190
 xi and ei protein or in the diet in the 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.919
 Brazil 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.190
 axn and masiello is still marketed 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:07.570
 with some restrictions and in some cases 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:10.450
 It's important, but it's definitely a 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.820
 incredible product that will make a great 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.669
 difference in your workouts giving 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.960
 perfect and faster results with 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.789
 the act if months between the staff is this if 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.340
