you around the train and show you what
it<00:01:53.759> looks<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> front<00:01:55.140> here

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
it looks like so that's the front here

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.420 
it looks like so that's the front here
you<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:58.020> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.219> tell

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
you know it's it's kind of you can tell

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.889 
you know it's it's kind of you can tell
immediately<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.270> you've<00:02:00.420> got<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> hyper

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
immediately that you've got the hyper

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.319 
immediately that you've got the hyper
fuse<00:02:01.229> kind<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.530> effect<00:02:01.950> over<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.430> at<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
fuse kind of effect over here at the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.090 
fuse kind of effect over here at the
front<00:02:03.570> mesh<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.020> basically<00:02:04.380> see-through<00:02:04.890> so

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
front mesh is basically see-through so

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.740 
front mesh is basically see-through so
that's<00:02:05.250> something<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.790> aware<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.090> it's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that's something to be aware of it's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.740 
that's something to be aware of it's
great<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.970> warmer<00:02:08.970> climates<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.539> obviously

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
great for warmer climates and obviously

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.080 
great for warmer climates and obviously
example<00:02:10.200> from<00:02:10.770> Abu<00:02:11.099> Dhabi<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.459> Dubai<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.760> means

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
example from Abu Dhabi in Dubai it means

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.520 
example from Abu Dhabi in Dubai it means
that<00:02:12.270> these

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
that these

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.670 
that these
to<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.709> ideal<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.340> wear<00:02:13.540> without<00:02:14.540> sort<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.020> you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
to be ideal to wear without sort of you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.050 
to be ideal to wear without sort of you
know<00:02:15.800> getting<00:02:16.069> my<00:02:16.250> feet<00:02:16.490> all<00:02:16.610> sweaty<00:02:16.910> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
know getting my feet all sweaty and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.790 
know getting my feet all sweaty and
things<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:18.110> that's<00:02:18.290> something<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.590> be

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
things so so that's something to be

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.980 
things so so that's something to be
aware<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:19.069> but<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.400> you're<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.360> UK<00:02:20.750> or<00:02:20.930> the

basically<00:02:34.130> you've<00:02:34.910> got<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.060> red<00:02:35.360> bubble<00:02:36.230> I

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
basically you've got a red bubble I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.750 
basically you've got a red bubble I
don't<00:02:36.590> think<00:02:36.739> there's<00:02:36.890> an<00:02:37.040> option<00:02:37.489> to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
don't think there's an option to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.940 
don't think there's an option to
customize<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.390> air<00:02:38.510> bubble<00:02:38.780> inside<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.920> that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
customize the air bubble inside so that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.300 
customize the air bubble inside so that
appears<00:02:40.520> red<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.530> tongue<00:02:42.800> as<00:02:43.069> well

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
but this swoosh on the side in certain

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.860 
but this swoosh on the side in certain
lighting<00:03:43.190> appears<00:03:43.730> actually<00:03:44.030> burgundy<00:03:44.600> so

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
lighting appears actually burgundy so

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.300 
lighting appears actually burgundy so
it's<00:03:45.019> kind<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.320> darker<00:03:45.709> version<00:03:45.799> of<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.130> red

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
it's kind of a darker version of the red

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.039 
it's kind of a darker version of the red
but<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.150> really<00:03:47.390> really<00:03:47.600> nice<00:03:47.720> pair<00:03:48.019> of

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
but it's a really really nice pair of

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.560 
but it's a really really nice pair of
trainer<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.680> in<00:03:49.519> all<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:49.910> all<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.060> think<00:03:50.239> it's

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
trainer and in all in all I think it's

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.509 
trainer and in all in all I think it's
about<00:03:50.810> 140<00:03:51.350> pounds<00:03:51.829> when<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.040> order<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.430> we

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
about 140 pounds when you order it we

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.400 
about 140 pounds when you order it we
got<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.700> for<00:03:52.910> a<00:03:52.940> little<00:03:53.090> cheaper<00:03:53.480> because<00:03:53.600> the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
got it for a little cheaper because the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.530 
got it for a little cheaper because the
finish<00:03:54.799> on<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.190> wasn't<00:03:55.670> great<00:03:55.910> there<00:03:56.180> were<00:03:56.269> a

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
finish on this wasn't great there were a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.990 
finish on this wasn't great there were a
lot<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.810> kind<00:03:57.049> of<00:03:57.170> blue<00:03:57.320> marks<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.280> and

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
lot of kind of blue marks and and and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.640 
lot of kind of blue marks and and and
things<00:03:59.299> there<00:03:59.540> we<00:03:59.630> go<00:03:59.780> look<00:04:00.019> check<00:04:00.320> that<00:04:00.470> out

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
things there we go look check that out

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.130 
things there we go look check that out
not<00:04:01.070> great<00:04:01.310> for<00:04:01.459> 140<00:04:02.090> pound<00:04:02.269> product<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.049> we

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
kind of defect I suppose considering the

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.279 
kind of defect I suppose considering the
amount<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.400> money<00:04:19.640> that<00:04:19.700> we<00:04:19.940> paid<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.510> the
