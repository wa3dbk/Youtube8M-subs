of<00:02:27.860> those<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:29.270> Flex<00:02:29.540> decks<00:02:29.840> what<00:02:30.140> it's

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
of those in the Flex decks what it's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.860 
of those in the Flex decks what it's
called<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:30.770> what<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.730> did<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.180> first<00:02:32.360> times<00:02:32.660> I

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
called so what I did the first times I

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.290 
called so what I did the first times I
did<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.170> test<00:02:33.380> 600<00:02:34.040> for<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.310> month<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.730> then<00:02:35.270> I

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
did the test 600 for a month and then I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.020 
did the test 600 for a month and then I
did<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.290> Z<00:02:36.680> test<00:02:36.950> for<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.370> next<00:02:37.610> month<00:02:37.819> you

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
did the Z test for the next month you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.150 
did the Z test for the next month you
could<00:02:38.690> either<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.380> way<00:02:39.560> split<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.069> up

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
could either do it that way split it up

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.280 
could either do it that way split it up
in<00:02:40.370> two<00:02:40.550> months<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:41.180> kind<00:02:41.569> of<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.900> little<00:02:42.200> bit

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
in two months I kind of a little bit

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.720 
in two months I kind of a little bit
more<00:02:42.440> expensive<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:43.130> that's<00:02:43.250> kind<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.610> way

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
more expensive so that's kind of the way

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.790 
more expensive so that's kind of the way
I<00:02:43.760> did<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.690> give<00:02:45.230> me<00:02:45.320> a<00:02:45.350> little<00:02:45.470> bit<00:02:45.590> better

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
I did it to give me a little bit better

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.650 
I did it to give me a little bit better
results<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.489> actually<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.790> gained<00:02:46.970> about<00:02:47.090> it

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
results and actually I gained about it

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.750 
results and actually I gained about it
was<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.900> first<00:02:48.140> test<00:02:48.350> booster<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.739> ever<00:02:48.860> did<00:02:49.130> so

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
was the first test booster I ever did so

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.370 
was the first test booster I ever did so
it<00:02:49.970> makes<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.269> little<00:02:50.390> bit<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.630> difference<00:02:51.110> if

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
it makes a little bit of difference if

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.500 
it makes a little bit of difference if
it's<00:02:51.620> your<00:02:51.769> first<00:02:51.950> time<00:02:52.190> doing<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.970> gained

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
it's your first time doing it I gained

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.020 
it's your first time doing it I gained
about<00:02:53.630> 10<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.110> 15<00:02:54.500> pounds<00:02:54.739> from<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.220> kept<00:02:55.730> about

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
about 10 to 15 pounds from it kept about

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.940 
about 10 to 15 pounds from it kept about
eight<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.450> ten<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.500> keep<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.830> good

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
eight to ten of it so you keep a good

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.340 
eight to ten of it so you keep a good
amount<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.489> all<00:02:58.640> natural<00:02:58.880> or<00:02:59.690> you<00:03:00.050> could<00:03:00.230> do

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
amount it's all natural or you could do

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.130 
amount it's all natural or you could do
both<00:03:00.380> bottles<00:03:01.069> at<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.310> same<00:03:01.519> time<00:03:01.880> test<00:03:02.600> 600

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
both bottles at the same time test 600

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.309 
both bottles at the same time test 600
in<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.260> day<00:03:03.620> Z<00:03:04.580> test<00:03:04.850> at<00:03:05.090> nighttime<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:06.019> also

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
in the day Z test at nighttime and also

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.880 
in the day Z test at nighttime and also
when<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.470> take<00:03:06.709> Z<00:03:06.950> test<00:03:07.250> or<00:03:07.489> any<00:03:07.730> Z<00:03:08.030> ma<00:03:08.680> do<00:03:09.680> not

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
when you take Z test or any Z ma do not

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.130 
when you take Z test or any Z ma do not
do<00:03:10.130> any<00:03:10.310> dairy<00:03:10.760> with<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.390> reason<00:03:11.569> is<00:03:11.900> is

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
do any dairy with it the reason is is

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.820 
do any dairy with it the reason is is
that<00:03:12.290> dairy<00:03:12.650> actually<00:03:13.489> once<00:03:14.330> off<00:03:14.600> these<00:03:15.470> zinc

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
that dairy actually once off these zinc

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.259 
that dairy actually once off these zinc
from<00:03:16.040> actually<00:03:16.370> absorbing<00:03:16.790> in<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.209> you

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
from actually absorbing in you and you

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.819 
from actually absorbing in you and you
won't<00:03:17.420> get<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.630> testosterone<00:03:18.110> release<00:03:18.620> as

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
won't get the testosterone release as

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.620 
won't get the testosterone release as
you<00:03:18.860> would<00:03:19.160> if<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.430> didn't<00:03:19.670> do<00:03:19.730> any<00:03:19.850> dairy<00:03:20.150> so

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
you would if you didn't do any dairy so

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.180 
you would if you didn't do any dairy so
if<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.780> can<00:03:20.870> do<00:03:20.959> like<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.110> casing<00:03:21.680> shake<00:03:21.980> or

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
if you can do like a casing shake or

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.970 
if you can do like a casing shake or
milk<00:03:22.370> before<00:03:22.549> bed<00:03:23.030> take<00:03:23.810> these<00:03:24.079> about<00:03:24.410> half<00:03:24.829> an

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
milk before bed take these about half an

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.699 
milk before bed take these about half an
hour<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.280> 45<00:03:25.549> minutes<00:03:25.700> before<00:03:26.269> you<00:03:26.840> do<00:03:27.170> your
