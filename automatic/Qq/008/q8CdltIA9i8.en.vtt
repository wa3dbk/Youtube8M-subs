00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
lightens this okay that doesn't work

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
lightens this okay that doesn't work
because<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.410> comes<00:00:58.710> right<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.129> your<00:00:59.460> toes

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

because if it comes right on your toes
it<00:01:00.030> hurts<00:01:00.829> no<00:01:01.879> is<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.539> this

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
it hurts no is to do it like this

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
it hurts no is to do it like this
alright<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.549> works<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> best

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
alright that works that's this the best

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.130
