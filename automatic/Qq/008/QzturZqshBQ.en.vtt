00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.790
 the passage of the baton from infinite words to between the hate when the fields of 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.300
 battle of color beauty harmony online dive into the past to the second 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.890
 world War 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.880
 de rita left by the modern warfer predecessor rome no doubt created much more 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.680
 of a difficulty the developers who had to deal with the following 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.510
 of one of the fps best managed of last season especially for how much 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.880
 concerns the multiplayer sector 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.510
 purposely avoiding becoming more famous during the Second World War 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.580
 the you order to campaign now presents two macro scenarios a little less 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.300
 known 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.880
 which are the first phases of life how to obtain Japan 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.170
 It is incredible liberation of stalingrad from the Red Army 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.500
 that went as far as the streets of Berlin 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.770
 we therefore have seven of solar in the peaceful fascinating Cuban winemaker 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.480
 post bombardments by Stalinist Berliners who will instead be the bridge of several 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.560
 decades 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.250
 the stars and the two soldiers will impersonate a similar fashion 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.770
 seeing us unarmed surrounded in forced to make their way with effort between 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.090
 the enemy lines 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.660
 the formula proposed by the Californian developers and the same view of the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.230
 previous editions order to now is a first person shooter 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.000
 absolutely voted the section that I used in art the scripts proposes 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.750
 sequences with a high rate of spectacularity 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.040
 to add some news I think about it especially in the islands of 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.960
 peaceful where we will be dealing with kamikaze soldiers deadly traps and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 vast underground bunkers clean it with a flamethrower 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.850
 the latter is a truth that comes to the arsenal, but a spectacular yield 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.799
 graphics adds fun tactics to the dark ones 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.499
 of infinite fuel and the only thing to keep an eye on also the use will be 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.329
 overheating 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.339
 interesting also the bayonet will save our lives when i 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.779
 extremely dangerous on trust juice they will fiercely believe jumping out 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.829
 from vegetation 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.209
 in general, xd in the pacific manages to convey a sensation fully 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.560
 of threat mail 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.919
 hotel mirasole continued cim boscate of which we will be the target 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:36.109
 pirelli dedicated to the adventures of the red army presents instead a 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.249
 more classic display characterized by close encounters between the opal ruins 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.240
 how it houses growing up emotional 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.440
 that will take us to the end to fight alongside the tanks between 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.159
 the streets of berlin 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.929
 i think she always remains rather linear 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:53.239
 in practice it will be a matter of keeping enemies in check this time 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.670
 enough to get into 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.609
 point where it will be activated - written 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.899
 pc for access to the next area and so on 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:03.189
 if on the developers' side they worried a lot 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.120
 action on screen 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.549
 It's a tough number of units 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.069
 mimesis is not always functional and at times the gait is a bit 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.489
 artificial even including the invisible walls that will be there strictly 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.359
 still at the only binary walkability 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.189
 click and play fortunately studded with great typical moments and seriousness 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.599
 activate playful mustard differentiating itself from simple ramenghi 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.599
 years 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.090
 for example, we will be driving a tank and equipped with a flamethrower 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 in pursuit the German general in a suggestive sniping sequence 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.410
 and from the controls of the gunboats of an allied plane during the spectacular 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.669
 Battleship 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.019
 overall the single player campaign if I return very long is 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:39.899
 funny 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.859
 pliers even in its linearity 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.049
 wanting to make things more interesting and it will be possible 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.949
 take advantage of my introduced cooperative mode 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.539
 which allows 4 players to connect online and face the campaign 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.949
 the number of enemies will be increased 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.639
 number of players participate 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.989
 in order to make the challenge sufficiently individual 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.159
 in case a player is injured it will be possible to cure it in a short time 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.779
 time frame with the pressure of a 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:08.209
 during the text we did not find the saw only file that confirms the 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.559
 cooperative as a great addition to the cast see mode 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.609
 the evenings of those who have always stood out for their exceptional modality 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.430
 competitive multiplayer that with the fourth chapter modern warfer rap have 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.699
 reached the same street 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.979
 among the art he decides not to risk and re-propose the same experience 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.779
 transporting it to the fields of the Second World War 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.369
 sin and experience points system that will see us go up a level skype 

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:34.520
 after killa as well as the weapons of my silencers via unlockables and of 

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:38.169
 perhaps special abilities down with a strong tactical component 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.139
 modeling of one's alter ego 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.129
 in the game if it can ever be made to carry only 4 and must choose with 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.580
 care based on our style of play 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.639
 I added vehicles to some of the riders in the clashes and overflows 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.949
 fun the introduction of berzo specific for the use of the carts is welcome 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.349
 armed 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.900
 have been updated to sustainable food by trusting 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.610
 a5 we will get mortar fire and 7 the themes of German shepherds 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.569
 that scoured the blaze by making a real massacre 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.740
 single player and ultra generous size fishing or campania maps 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.740
 they offer fascinating septic and excellent life 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:17.020
 the nazi zombie mode is hilarious 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.009
 unlockable end of campaign 3-4 players cooperative call by jumped from 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.749
 very dangerous armies of undead 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:27.210
 the technical department is weighted by its predecessor 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.260
 that today to do a little dated especially from the poor interactivity 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.409
 with the scenarios or the total absence of dynamic shadows 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.409
 the level of detail is high bologna polygonal modeling has taken care of 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.899
 the text section reads as much as definition but we are on di 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:42.020
 of the discrete 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.020
 great animations especially those of cultured enemy soldiers 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.130
 despite the amount of screen editing units, there is a lot 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.920
 iframe height true strength of this angels 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.310
 the @time campaign is always kept at very high levels 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.400
 the audio sector is characterized by an excellent soundtrack 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.249
 edom fluctuating effects 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:04.669
 explosives and environmental noises are of great quality but sampling 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.689
 gunfire bursts are not always as convincing as we would like 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.930
 in the complex world tuor turns out to be an interesting open predecessor 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.810
 tonight augmented screen on multiplayer took cooler from the dangers ed 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.000
 equal lost the amusing cooperative works well penati zombies was an idea 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.909
 crazy but very welcome 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.020
 what is missing this fifth chapter is the same innovative charge of the 

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:46.909
 predecessor a technical sector to keep up with the times and 'hard to stay in 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:48.669
 defensive texas 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.869
 lot i miss it almost completely m20 app you have enough if related to each other 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:56.550
 in spite of these defects you are at random another great job for an athlete 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.620
 of content 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.300
 military fps fans will have fun for many months at 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.659
 to come
