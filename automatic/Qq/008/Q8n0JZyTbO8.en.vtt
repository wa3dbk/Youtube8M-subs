they were amazing pets and I'm kind of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.350 
they were amazing pets and I'm kind of
torn<00:01:22.830> between<00:01:22.950> getting<00:01:23.400> rats<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:24.000> rabbits

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
torn between getting rats or rabbits

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.929 
torn between getting rats or rabbits
it's<00:01:24.570> such<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> hard<00:01:25.080> decision<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.710> make<00:01:25.950> well<00:01:26.909> I

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
it's such a hard decision to make well I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.640 
it's such a hard decision to make well I
think<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.600> probably<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> go<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.439> rats

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
think I'm probably going to go for rats

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.340 
think I'm probably going to go for rats
and<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> love<00:01:29.759> rats<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
supplies so just make sense for me to go

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.069 
supplies so just make sense for me to go
for<00:01:33.869> rats<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> yeah<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.299> worry<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:36.810> think
