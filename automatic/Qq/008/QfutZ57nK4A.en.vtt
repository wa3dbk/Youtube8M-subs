00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.070
 of course everyone's glitch to 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.449
 the one that a new slide video 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.930
 sogeta knew we would learn a f after 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.019
 maintenance 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.070
 so how do you avoid the trick when 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.349
 you're going to finally be able to you 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.990
 notice that you can not sell the 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.609
 vehicle balloon value of more than 50 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.009
 thousand dollars late 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.170
 you will see when I clicked 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.460
 sell that's it noticed sorry 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.010
 you can not sell a vehicle 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.150
 flying at over $ 50000 then a 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.980
 just that I just went out of the 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.650
 garage 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.140
 here you go out of the lottery draw this 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.440
 custom 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:52.040
 once upon a time on losc istom 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.740
 you go dark on a wall or anywhere 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.220
 what is it here on a thing on 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.810
 something to fix it here once 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.420
 conceding a wall you will enter 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.760
 the santos custom by lodges am a 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.140
 not very sick at the moment 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.240
 apparently they're wondering about the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.680
 repair then you repair it and a 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.460
 times that you 're going out of the garage late 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.460
 early sandwich wolf 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.440
 once this type of the eu are those who 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.840
 as you will love your car 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.610
 here in the aisle of the los ninos custom 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.470
 like me in the video a phobia 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.840
 had put it here you're going to take a 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.240
 vehicles that are the road or on the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.750
 parking the sound system you take it 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.220
 you want it here up and you go 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.270
 background it's again in a wall 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.710
 or something like that here it is necessary 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.030
 to go into a wall you will go 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.930
 in the custom sundgau and you go 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.930
 repair the vehicle 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.830
 so here you go to repair the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.000
 vehicle 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.870
 so once you repair the vehicle you 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.400
 go make them start in the back the 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.020
 look for the sell option of the customers 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.130
 great once his vehicle theft and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.390
 whose voice you want to mark 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.520
 really rooms vehicle you have art 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.000
 star gold here you do everything schuss 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.640
 pie 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.770
 you go to the ps store once on 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.540
 place film store we will wait for the 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.890
 loading the puy sony store and 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.300
 only you will have to tell you that 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.300
 disconnected from the psn 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.310
 once you start seeing 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.560
 the gray background if i did the ps key 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.660
 and a psn and account management 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.120
 connections and you're going to clump 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.190
 ps and you to validate them the error that 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.380
 you and the pc side in the crazy idea 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.319
 ok we will wait for the kinematics 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.480
 also savored solo led so I 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.959
 specifies that if you reappear with 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.410
 michael trevor or franklin we do not care 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.030
 completely 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.440
 and by the time you're pretty much 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.660
 still in the sky are you going 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.680
 reconnect to the psn at the ps key 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:07.250
 connection to the psn so wait here 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.030
 now finally a little bit so you have to 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.470
 that I know you are you are going 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:17.870
 redo the ps key for and ben wacking 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.880
 the kinematics of throwing a bag so we 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.400
 see michael is that without restraint like 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.790
 in hens then you have to be here 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.840
 you will press the start key again 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.760
 here we see that it represents for 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.019
 you support this all late you go 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.880
 go to the online option 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.290
 anjou and waved online and you click 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.799
 on six sugar authorizations is 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.810
 important if it will not work voila voila 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.760
 you initiate these initiations with spirit 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.250
 and we will wait again for the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.790
 small kinematic dance game access 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.790
 restless to young people 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.470
 here 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.600
 and normally you are going to appear 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.060
 in our vehicle with your car 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.980
 you want to sell and you go 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.200
 to enter the sind custom and that you 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.240
 will normally mark sell directly 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.040
 so sometimes the game lowers the price or 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.109
 sometimes but the real prices to the crap 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.489
