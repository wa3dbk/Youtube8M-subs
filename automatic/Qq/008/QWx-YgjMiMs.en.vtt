I'm at the capital preheating now for

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.740 
I'm at the capital preheating now for
about<00:00:06.290> five<00:00:07.010> to<00:00:07.189> ten<00:00:07.370> minutes<00:00:07.790> I'm<00:00:08.570> going<00:00:08.690> to

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
like we normally do and scatter the

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.320 
like we normally do and scatter the
burgers<00:00:16.279> out<00:00:16.400> a<00:00:16.430> little<00:00:16.670> bit<00:00:16.759> to<00:00:16.880> see<00:00:17.029> how<00:00:17.060> well

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
burgers out a little bit to see how well

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.150 
burgers out a little bit to see how well
the<00:00:17.480> grill<00:00:17.720> cooks<00:00:18.020> about<00:00:18.529> one<00:00:18.860> over<00:00:19.070> the

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
the grill cooks about one over the

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.769 
the grill cooks about one over the
infrared<00:00:19.900> and<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.020> other<00:00:21.140> three<00:00:21.529> will<00:00:21.740> go<00:00:21.980> in

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
infrared and the other three will go in

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.609 
infrared and the other three will go in
various<00:00:23.779> spots<00:00:24.109> across<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.650> grill<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:26.619> then

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
various spots across the grill and then

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.279 
various spots across the grill and then
I'll<00:00:27.800> do<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.070> same<00:00:28.310> with<00:00:28.789> the<00:00:29.750> two<00:00:29.960> steaks

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
I'll do the same with the two steaks

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.960 
I'll do the same with the two steaks
we'll<00:00:30.470> put<00:00:30.619> one<00:00:30.740> over<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:30.980> infrared<00:00:31.519> and<00:00:33.970> then

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
we'll put one over the infrared and then

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.060 
we'll put one over the infrared and then
one<00:00:35.180> in<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.330> center<00:00:35.630> of<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:35.780> grill<00:00:36.070> we'll

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
one in the center of the grill we'll

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.200 
one in the center of the grill we'll
come<00:00:37.219> back<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:37.520> check<00:00:37.700> on<00:00:37.850> them<00:00:37.940> in<00:00:37.969> just<00:00:38.090> a

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
come back and check on them in just a

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.630 
come back and check on them in just a
few<00:00:38.329> minutes<00:00:39.100> it's<00:00:40.100> been<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.309> couple<00:00:40.489> of

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
few minutes it's been a couple of

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.470 
few minutes it's been a couple of
minutes<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.239> I've<00:00:42.050> already<00:00:42.700> flipped<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:44.059> the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
minutes and I've already flipped the the

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.880 
minutes and I've already flipped the the
burger<00:00:44.750> that's<00:00:44.870> over<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.200> infrared<00:00:45.590> just

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
burger that's over the infrared just

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.490 
burger that's over the infrared just
because<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.610> infrared<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.090> much<00:00:47.270> hotter<00:00:47.570> but

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
because the infrared so much hotter but

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.520 
because the infrared so much hotter but
I've<00:00:48.620> also<00:00:48.800> I've<00:00:49.280> turned<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.789> steak<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.530> I'm

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
I've also I've turned the steak and I'm

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.950 
I've also I've turned the steak and I'm
gonna<00:00:51.680> go<00:00:51.800> ahead<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:51.980> flip<00:00:52.219> it<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:53.629> see<00:00:53.840> what

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
gonna go ahead and flip it to see what

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.810 
gonna go ahead and flip it to see what
that<00:00:54.079> looks<00:00:54.350> like

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
that looks like

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.540 
that looks like
looking<00:00:55.820> good<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:57.350> what<00:00:57.500> I'm<00:00:57.590> gonna<00:00:57.739> do<00:00:57.980> is<00:00:58.190> of

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
looking good and what I'm gonna do is of

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.520 
looking good and what I'm gonna do is of
course<00:00:58.610> I'm<00:00:58.969> gonna<00:00:59.090> sear<00:00:59.420> over<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.079> infrared

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
course I'm gonna sear over the infrared

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.740 
course I'm gonna sear over the infrared
and<00:01:00.770> then<00:01:00.949> I'm<00:01:01.520> gonna<00:01:01.820> probably<00:01:02.120> move<00:01:02.390> it<00:01:02.539> over

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
and then I'm gonna probably move it over

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.779 
and then I'm gonna probably move it over
to<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.109> less<00:01:03.859> direct<00:01:04.250> heat<00:01:04.460> on<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.670> other

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
to the less direct heat on the other

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:06.969 
to the less direct heat on the other
side<00:01:05.119> because<00:01:05.899> it's<00:01:06.020> such<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.140> thick<00:01:06.440> steak<00:01:06.740> to

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
side because it's such a thick steak to

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.200 
side because it's such a thick steak to
go<00:01:07.100> ahead<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.340> kind<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.549> cook<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.850> center<00:01:08.090> up

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
go ahead and kind of cook the center up

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.190 
go ahead and kind of cook the center up
a<00:01:08.299> little<00:01:08.450> bit<00:01:10.119> all<00:01:11.119> right<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:11.360> been<00:01:11.479> right

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
a little bit all right it's been right

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.469 
a little bit all right it's been right
under<00:01:12.229> five<00:01:12.680> minutes<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.760> can<00:01:13.820> see<00:01:14.150> how<00:01:14.299> well

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
under five minutes you can see how well

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.320 
under five minutes you can see how well
the<00:01:14.659> infrared<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.439> it's<00:01:15.619> it's<00:01:15.950> really

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
the infrared that it's it's really

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.240 
the infrared that it's it's really
cooking<00:01:17.330> that<00:01:17.479> steak<00:01:17.750> up<00:01:17.960> well<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.100> other

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
cooking that steak up well but the other

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.399 
cooking that steak up well but the other
one<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.520> cooked<00:01:19.939> just<00:01:20.509> about<00:01:20.720> as<00:01:20.869> even<00:01:21.200> and

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
one is cooked just about as even and

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.800 
one is cooked just about as even and
whatnot<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:22.159> about<00:01:22.340> an<00:01:22.460> extra<00:01:22.729> minute<00:01:22.970> over

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
whatnot for about an extra minute over

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.660 
whatnot for about an extra minute over
there<00:01:23.960> on<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.110> other<00:01:24.170> side<00:01:24.369> I'm<00:01:25.369> gonna<00:01:25.549> go

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
there on the other side I'm gonna go

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.330 
there on the other side I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:25.880> move<00:01:26.090> this<00:01:26.330> guy

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.289 

I'll<00:01:31.909> let<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:32.210> see<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.479> first<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.970> see<00:01:35.180> it's

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
I'll let you see it first you see it's

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.399 
I'll let you see it first you see it's
really<00:01:35.510> nice<00:01:37.180> now<00:01:38.180> at<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:38.479> point<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.140> I

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
really nice now at this point and I

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.840 
really nice now at this point and I
guess<00:01:39.590> just<00:01:39.619> because<00:01:40.040> I'm<00:01:40.190> used<00:01:40.400> in<00:01:40.670> the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
guess just because I'm used in the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.280 
guess just because I'm used in the
restaurant<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:41.390> try<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.630> have<00:01:41.840> all<00:01:41.960> your<00:01:42.080> food

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
come out at the same time so what I went

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.340 
come out at the same time so what I went
ahead<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.049> did<00:01:45.170> was<00:01:45.440> you<00:01:45.860> could<00:01:46.040> have<00:01:46.130> either

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
ahead and did was you could have either

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.149 
ahead and did was you could have either
continued<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.409> cook<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.680> burgers<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:48.979> little

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
continued to cook the burgers a little

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.389 
continued to cook the burgers a little
bit<00:01:49.250> longer<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:50.300> yanked<00:01:50.630> him<00:01:50.720> off<00:01:50.869> or<00:01:51.229> I<00:01:52.100> went

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
bit longer and yanked him off or I went

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.800 
bit longer and yanked him off or I went
ahead<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:52.640> pulled<00:01:52.970> them<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.360> little<00:01:53.720> bit

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
ahead and pulled them a little bit

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.420 
ahead and pulled them a little bit
before<00:01:54.140> they<00:01:54.259> were<00:01:54.320> completely<00:01:54.770> done<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.130> put

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
before they were completely done and put

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.550 
before they were completely done and put
them<00:01:55.549> up<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.850> top<00:01:56.060> warming<00:01:56.570> rack<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.409> see

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
them up on the top warming rack you see

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.600 
them up on the top warming rack you see
they're<00:01:57.680> still<00:01:57.860> dripping<00:01:58.190> they're<00:01:58.430> still

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
they're still dripping they're still

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.430 
they're still dripping they're still
getting<00:01:58.700> some<00:01:58.940> indirect<00:01:59.390> Heat<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.320> way

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
getting some indirect Heat and that way

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.050 
getting some indirect Heat and that way
they're<00:02:00.560> gonna<00:02:00.649> finish<00:02:01.009> off<00:02:01.310> right<00:02:01.700> about<00:02:01.909> the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
they're gonna finish off right about the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.419 
they're gonna finish off right about the
same<00:02:02.270> time<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.440> two<00:02:03.590> steaks<00:02:03.890> finish<00:02:04.250> off

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
same time that the two steaks finish off

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.450 
same time that the two steaks finish off
which<00:02:04.640> would<00:02:04.729> be<00:02:04.820> about<00:02:04.880> another<00:02:05.270> minute<00:02:06.460> okay

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
which would be about another minute okay

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.889 
which would be about another minute okay
I<00:02:07.490> went<00:02:07.700> ahead<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:07.970> elevated<00:02:08.420> everything<00:02:08.750> up

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
I went ahead and elevated everything up

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.990 
I went ahead and elevated everything up
to<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.140> top<00:02:09.649> warming<00:02:10.100> rack<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.850> to

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
to the top warming rack and not to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.880 
to the top warming rack and not to
continue<00:02:11.390> cooking<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.780> because<00:02:12.110> I've<00:02:12.440> cut<00:02:12.769> off

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
continue cooking it because I've cut off

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.009 
continue cooking it because I've cut off
the<00:02:12.920> grill<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.550> just<00:02:13.700> wanted<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.019> showcase

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
the grill but I just wanted to showcase

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.750 
the grill but I just wanted to showcase
it<00:02:15.170> up<00:02:15.260> there<00:02:15.410> for<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.890> get<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> better<00:02:16.459> look

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
it up there for you to get a better look

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.180 
it up there for you to get a better look
and<00:02:17.000> as<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.720> see<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.560> one<00:02:18.739> burger

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
and as you can see the the one burger

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.430 
and as you can see the the one burger
and<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.550> mean<00:02:19.700> doing<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.239> burger<00:02:20.569> over<00:02:20.720> infrared

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
and I mean doing a burger over infrared

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.710 
and I mean doing a burger over infrared
is<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.370> little<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.819> little<00:02:23.300> questionable

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
is a it's a little a little questionable

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.559 
is a it's a little a little questionable
it's<00:02:23.959> very<00:02:24.140> high<00:02:24.350> heat<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:25.370> do<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.910> burger<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.480> I

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
it's very high heat to do a burger and I

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.180 
it's very high heat to do a burger and I
guess<00:02:26.720> depending<00:02:26.900> on<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.230> size<00:02:27.470> you're

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
guess depending on the size you're

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.610 
guess depending on the size you're
working<00:02:28.519> with<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.180> be<00:02:29.300> done<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.900> as

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
working with you it can be done and as

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.170 
working with you it can be done and as
you<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.040> see<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.280> can<00:02:31.370> be<00:02:31.430> done<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:31.819> just<00:02:31.880> not

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
you can see it can be done it's just not

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.570 
you can see it can be done it's just not
as<00:02:32.450> pretty<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.380> uniform<00:02:33.830> as<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.220> three<00:02:34.430> that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
as pretty in uniform as the three that

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.670 
as pretty in uniform as the three that
we're<00:02:34.700> done<00:02:34.850> on<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.900> regular<00:02:36.380> part<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.590> the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
we're done on the regular part of the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.060 
we're done on the regular part of the
grill<00:02:36.860> but<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.880> steaks<00:02:38.150> came<00:02:38.360> out<00:02:38.480> very<00:02:38.630> nice

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
grill but the steaks came out very nice

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.340 
grill but the steaks came out very nice
they<00:02:40.070> look<00:02:40.100> fairly<00:02:40.910> even<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.780> one<00:02:41.959> from<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
they look fairly even the one from the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.500 
they look fairly even the one from the
infrared<00:02:42.650> again<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.430> little<00:02:43.670> darker<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
infrared again is a little darker the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.150 
infrared again is a little darker the
only<00:02:44.780> reason<00:02:45.170> for<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.410> though<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.829> because<00:02:46.130> I

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
only reason for that though is because I

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.670 
only reason for that though is because I
actually<00:02:46.459> did<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.910> all<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.209> same<00:02:47.420> time<00:02:47.930> you

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
actually did it all the same time you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.289 
actually did it all the same time you
know<00:02:48.769> you<00:02:48.860> could<00:02:49.070> yank<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.760> little<00:02:50.120> quicker

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
know you could yank it a little quicker

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.640 
know you could yank it a little quicker
from<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.660> infrared<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.110> was<00:02:51.320> just<00:02:51.440> trying<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
from the infrared I was just trying to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.440 
from the infrared I was just trying to
do<00:02:51.739> everything<00:02:52.040> on<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.250> same<00:02:52.400> timetable<00:02:52.760> so

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
do everything on the same timetable so

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.300 
do everything on the same timetable so
that<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.200> could<00:02:54.530> show<00:02:54.680> an<00:02:54.769> accurate<00:02:55.160> depiction

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
that I could show an accurate depiction

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.910 
that I could show an accurate depiction
of<00:02:55.790> how<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.239> meat<00:02:56.540> came<00:02:56.780> out<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.530> all<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.799> all

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
of how the meat came out but all in all

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.590 
of how the meat came out but all in all
I'd<00:02:58.100> say<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.459> very<00:02:58.730> fine<00:02:59.030> grill<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.480> is

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
I'd say it's a very fine grill this is

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.440 
I'd say it's a very fine grill this is
the<00:02:59.690> closest<00:03:00.109> thing<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.320> I've<00:03:00.590> cooked<00:03:00.890> on

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the closest thing that I've cooked on

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.620 
the closest thing that I've cooked on
that<00:03:02.450> resembles<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.640> commercial<00:03:04.640> restaurant

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
that resembles a commercial restaurant

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.509 
that resembles a commercial restaurant
char-broil<00:03:06.350> unit<00:03:06.890> like<00:03:07.010> we<00:03:07.130> use<00:03:07.250> in<00:03:07.400> most

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
char-broil unit like we use in most

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.880 
char-broil unit like we use in most
restaurants
