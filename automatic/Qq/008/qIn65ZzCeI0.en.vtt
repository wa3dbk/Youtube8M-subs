close everything in the background and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:51.940 
close everything in the background and

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
speed on the and on the Nexus 5 so both

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.180 
speed on the and on the Nexus 5 so both
are<00:01:07.190> equal<00:01:08.060> there<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.870> let's<00:01:09.140> quickly<00:01:09.320> test

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
are equal there so let's quickly test

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.370 
are equal there so let's quickly test
you<00:01:10.340> out<00:01:10.370> so<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:11.360> are<00:01:11.479> going<00:01:11.660> to<00:01:11.780> do<00:01:11.870> a<00:01:11.900> full

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
you out so we are going to do a full

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.840 
you out so we are going to do a full
bench<00:01:12.950> mark<00:01:13.360> 23<00:01:14.360> go<00:01:18.040> let's<00:01:19.040> turn<00:01:19.340> on<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.550> life

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
bench mark 23 go let's turn on the life

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.750 
bench mark 23 go let's turn on the life
the<00:01:20.330> note<00:01:20.510> 3<00:01:20.780> because<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:21.470> wouldn't<00:01:22.400> show<00:01:22.610> the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
the note 3 because I wouldn't show the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.600 
the note 3 because I wouldn't show the
scores<00:01:23.120> if<00:01:23.619> we<00:01:24.619> do<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:24.979> without<00:01:25.130> Wi-Fi

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
scores if we do it without Wi-Fi

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:51.780 
scores if we do it without Wi-Fi
connection<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.360> I<00:01:26.660> face<00:01:27.259> that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.290 

65<00:01:52.780> 74<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:54.550> both<00:01:54.730> are<00:01:56.040> at<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.460> same<00:01:57.700> speed<00:01:58.030> but

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
65 74 so both are at the same speed but

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.880 
65 74 so both are at the same speed but
I<00:01:58.720> think<00:01:58.960> Nexus<00:01:59.530> 5<00:01:59.710> is<00:01:59.980> going<00:02:00.430> ahead<00:02:01.830> okay<00:02:02.830> so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
I think Nexus 5 is going ahead okay so

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
I think Nexus 5 is going ahead okay so
we've<00:02:03.070> got<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.250> score<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:04.170> 2084<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.910> multi-core

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
we've got a score of 2084 a multi-core

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.820 
we've got a score of 2084 a multi-core
score<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.440> 949<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.190> single<00:02:09.550> core<00:02:09.700> score<00:02:10.090> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
score a 949 of a single core score and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.190 
score a 949 of a single core score and
on<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.100> note<00:02:12.250> 3<00:02:12.490> we<00:02:12.670> have<00:02:12.760> 87<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.660> single<00:02:14.020> core

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
on the note 3 we have 87 of single core

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.000 
on the note 3 we have 87 of single core
score<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.740> do<00:02:15.330> 2795<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:17.500> multi-core

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
score and do 2795 of the multi-core

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.310 
score and do 2795 of the multi-core
score<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.080> pretty<00:02:20.230> interesting

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
score so this is pretty interesting

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.890 
score so this is pretty interesting
because<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.760> thing<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.420> nexus<00:02:22.690> 5

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
because the thing is that the nexus 5

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.050 
because the thing is that the nexus 5
always<00:02:23.380> loses<00:02:24.070> battles<00:02:24.490> in<00:02:24.730> terms<00:02:24.940> of

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
always loses battles in terms of

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.760 
always loses battles in terms of
benchmarks<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.690> everything<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.260> don't<00:02:26.709> know

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
benchmarks and everything I don't know

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.290 
benchmarks and everything I don't know
why<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.280> this<00:02:28.240> time<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:29.200> one<00:02:29.970> that's<00:02:30.970> as<00:02:31.150> far

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
why but this time this one that's as far

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.560 
why but this time this one that's as far
as<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.570> winner<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.110> can<00:02:32.830> see<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> score<00:02:33.430> here

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
as the winner you can see the score here

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.410 
as the winner you can see the score here
nexus<00:02:34.570> 5<00:02:34.720> beach<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.740> note<00:02:35.920> 3<00:02:36.220> in<00:02:36.459> both<00:02:37.390> of

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
nexus 5 beach the note 3 in both of

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.610 
nexus 5 beach the note 3 in both of
these<00:02:37.600> two<00:02:37.900> scores<00:02:38.320> here<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:39.990> maybe<00:02:40.990> a<00:02:41.170> update

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
these two scores here so maybe a update

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.699 
these two scores here so maybe a update
will<00:02:41.860> increase<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.459> score<00:02:42.730> there<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.209> still

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
will increase the score there but still

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.470 
will increase the score there but still
snowing<00:02:44.709> 800<00:02:45.160> on<00:02:45.310> both<00:02:45.489> devices<00:02:45.640> both<00:02:46.300> are
