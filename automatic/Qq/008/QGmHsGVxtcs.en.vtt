00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
and stuff from the star just like

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.760 
and stuff from the star just like
floating<00:01:01.809> out<00:01:02.050> in<00:01:02.170> space<00:01:02.200> they're<00:01:02.620> almost

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
floating out in space they're almost

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.889 
floating out in space they're almost
like<00:01:03.129> space<00:01:03.399> fireflies<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.299> it's

like space fireflies and it's

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.929 
like space fireflies and it's
outstandingly<00:01:05.740> beautiful<00:01:06.369> like<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:06.670> kind<00:01:06.850> of

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
outstandingly beautiful like it kind of

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.120 
outstandingly beautiful like it kind of
just<00:01:07.149> is<00:01:07.329> a<00:01:07.469> you<00:01:08.469> sit<00:01:08.680> here<00:01:08.829> and<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:08.979> just

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
just is a you sit here and you just

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.530 
just is a you sit here and you just
listen<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.520> music<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.149> all<00:01:10.270> sort<00:01:10.510> of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
listen to the music and it all sort of

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.090 
listen to the music and it all sort of
just<00:01:10.600> comes<00:01:10.900> into<00:01:11.140> place<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.650> I<00:01:11.710> think<00:01:11.920> that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
just comes into place and I think that

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.789 
just comes into place and I think that
this<00:01:13.000> is<00:01:13.210> something<00:01:13.450> really<00:01:14.049> exceptionally

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
this is something really exceptionally

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.310 
this is something really exceptionally
well<00:01:14.950> crafted<00:01:15.250> I<00:01:15.610> think<00:01:15.820> we<00:01:15.970> it's<00:01:16.780> easy<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
well crafted I think we it's easy to

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.660 
well crafted I think we it's easy to
take<00:01:17.470> for<00:01:17.530> granted<00:01:17.710> these<00:01:18.280> two<00:01:18.490> locations

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
take for granted these two locations

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.090 
take for granted these two locations
that<00:01:19.180> SC<00:01:19.600> has<00:01:19.780> for<00:01:20.080> arena<00:01:20.260> commander<00:01:20.500> but<00:01:20.950> when

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
that SC has for arena commander but when

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.469 
that SC has for arena commander but when
you<00:01:21.190> really<00:01:21.580> start<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.850> look<00:01:21.939> at<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.119> detail

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
you really start to look at the detail

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.480 
you really start to look at the detail
of<00:01:22.630> them<00:01:22.780> even<00:01:23.080> on<00:01:23.260> like<00:01:23.439> medium<00:01:23.680> setting<00:01:24.220> it

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
of them even on like medium setting it

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.340 
of them even on like medium setting it
starts<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.240> become<00:01:25.360> really<00:01:25.510> impressive<00:01:26.140> it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
starts to become really impressive it

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.050 
starts to become really impressive it
makes<00:01:26.560> me<00:01:26.740> frustrated<00:01:27.189> that<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.369> find<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:27.880> HUD

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
makes me frustrated that I find the HUD

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.490 
makes me frustrated that I find the HUD
in<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.330> game<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.689> be<00:01:28.810> really<00:01:29.020> cluttered<00:01:29.409> and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
in this game to be really cluttered and

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.109 
in this game to be really cluttered and
I<00:01:29.560> really<00:01:29.830> want<00:01:30.010> them<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.189> refine<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.729> more

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
I really want them to refine it more

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.640 
I really want them to refine it more
because<00:01:31.689> I<00:01:31.840> feel<00:01:31.960> like<00:01:31.990> there's<00:01:32.200> too<00:01:32.260> much<00:01:32.590> of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
because I feel like there's too much of

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.460 
because I feel like there's too much of
it<00:01:32.890> in<00:01:33.159> my<00:01:33.430> face<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.909> I<00:01:34.000> don't<00:01:34.060> like<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
it in my face and I don't like that it

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.780 
it in my face and I don't like that it
to<00:01:35.590> me<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.799> takes<00:01:35.950> away<00:01:36.250> from<00:01:36.280> what<00:01:36.610> is<00:01:36.700> it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
to me it takes away from what is it

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.490 
to me it takes away from what is it
otherwise<00:01:37.090> like<00:01:37.360> exceptionally<00:01:38.110> beautiful

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
a fine taste of space and it's in its

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.110 
a fine taste of space and it's in its
most<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.890> know<00:02:32.010> powerful<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:32.970> deadly

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
most you know powerful and deadly

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.970 
most you know powerful and deadly
moments<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.110> dying<00:02:34.500> star<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.830> think

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
moments then a dying star I think

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.860 
moments then a dying star I think
captures<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.700> better<00:02:35.909> than<00:02:36.120> anything<00:02:36.540> else

captures that better than anything else

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.170 
captures that better than anything else
and<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.920> could<00:02:38.099> probably<00:02:38.310> sell<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.730> place<00:02:38.879> for

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and I could probably sell this place for

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.819 
and I could probably sell this place for
a<00:02:39.209> pretty<00:02:39.450> penny<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:40.500> know<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.620> could

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
a pretty penny you know I could

a pretty penny you know I could
definitely<00:02:41.010> make<00:02:41.220> some<00:02:41.459> decent<00:02:41.640> cash<00:02:41.970> off<00:02:42.299> of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
definitely make some decent cash off of

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
this is still gonna be a pretty sick

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.220 
this is still gonna be a pretty sick
area<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.060> think<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.329> could<00:03:45.480> turn<00:03:45.569> a<00:03:45.629> huge<00:03:45.870> profit

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
area I think I could turn a huge profit

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.680 
area I think I could turn a huge profit
on<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.590> know<00:03:46.709> why<00:03:46.829> not<00:03:46.980> let<00:03:47.129> it<00:03:47.220> go<00:03:47.690> they

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
on this you know why not let it go they

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.150 
on this you know why not let it go they
seem<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.989> be<00:03:49.049> pretty<00:03:49.199> well-equipped<00:03:49.560> anyways

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
seem to be pretty well-equipped anyways

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.069 
seem to be pretty well-equipped anyways
I<00:03:50.310> mean<00:03:50.430> these<00:03:50.549> look<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:50.970> be<00:03:51.150> some<00:03:51.389> some<00:03:51.810> fine

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
I mean these look to be some some fine

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.830 
I mean these look to be some some fine
pieces<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.650> equipment<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.489> know<00:03:53.690> some<00:03:54.690> sort

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
pieces of equipment you know some sort

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.599 
pieces of equipment you know some sort
of<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:55.019> data<00:03:55.260> center<00:03:55.530> here<00:03:55.889> for<00:03:56.190> laying

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
of a data center here for laying

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.270 
of a data center here for laying
information<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.480> another<00:03:57.690> base<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.410> they've

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
information to another base and they've

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.369 
information to another base and they've
got<00:03:59.519> eight<00:03:59.760> landing<00:04:00.150> pads<00:04:00.389> in<00:04:00.599> total<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.290> they

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
got eight landing pads in total so they

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.259 
got eight landing pads in total so they
could<00:04:01.500> probably<00:04:01.650> refuel<00:04:02.549> and<00:04:02.669> repair<00:04:02.760> on<00:04:03.150> the

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
could probably refuel and repair on the

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.869 
could probably refuel and repair on the
fly<00:04:03.480> right<00:04:03.720> out<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:03.930> these<00:04:04.019> paths<00:04:04.730> they<00:04:05.730> don't

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
fly right out in these paths they don't

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.129 
fly right out in these paths they don't
look<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.000> they're<00:04:06.269> long-term<00:04:06.510> though<00:04:07.079> you

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
look like they're long-term though you

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.240 
look like they're long-term though you
know<00:04:07.290> not<00:04:07.410> attached<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.799> any<00:04:07.889> sort<00:04:08.129> of<00:04:08.160> a

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
know not attached to any sort of a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.589 
know not attached to any sort of a
station<00:04:08.669> so<00:04:08.790> maybe<00:04:08.970> there's<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> larger<00:04:09.419> ship

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
station so maybe there's a larger ship

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.589 
station so maybe there's a larger ship
that<00:04:09.720> comes<00:04:09.840> out<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.139> reveals<00:04:10.260> these<00:04:11.599> again

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
that comes out and reveals these again

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.229 
that comes out and reveals these again
it's<00:04:12.750> definitely<00:04:13.139> an<00:04:13.230> active<00:04:13.400> operation<00:04:14.400> we

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
it's definitely an active operation we

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.759 
it's definitely an active operation we
seem<00:04:15.419> to<00:04:15.510> have<00:04:15.690> stumbled<00:04:15.840> upon<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.440> during<00:04:16.650> one

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
seem to have stumbled upon it during one

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.560 
seem to have stumbled upon it during one
of<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.919> quiet<00:04:17.190> days<00:04:17.459> which<00:04:17.789> is<00:04:17.970> awesome<00:04:18.479> you

charge other people for that experience
but<00:04:56.910> I'm<00:04:57.000> thinking<00:04:57.449> two-seaters<00:04:58.110> maybe<00:04:58.560> even

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
but I'm thinking two-seaters maybe even

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.260 
but I'm thinking two-seaters maybe even
get<00:04:58.919> some<00:04:58.949> m<00:04:59.160> 50s<00:04:59.580> down<00:04:59.699> here<00:04:59.910> to<00:05:00.000> give<00:05:00.120> people

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
rides through the asteroid belt get some

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.580 
rides through the asteroid belt get some
of<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:01.979> best<00:05:02.130> pilots<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.729> we<00:05:02.850> can<00:05:02.970> find<00:05:03.590> you

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
of the best pilots that we can find you

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.900 
of the best pilots that we can find you
know<00:05:04.710> insurance<00:05:05.220> will<00:05:05.400> be<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.520> little<00:05:05.760> bit<00:05:05.850> of

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
know insurance will be a little bit of

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.940 
know insurance will be a little bit of
an<00:05:05.970> issue<00:05:06.180> there<00:05:06.479> but<00:05:07.350> you<00:05:07.590> know<00:05:07.680> people

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
an issue there but you know people

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.560 
an issue there but you know people
pretty<00:05:08.190> much<00:05:08.280> sign<00:05:08.639> anything<00:05:08.940> if<00:05:09.330> it<00:05:09.450> means

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
pretty much sign anything if it means

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.719 
pretty much sign anything if it means
they're<00:05:09.750> gonna<00:05:09.870> have<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.080> good<00:05:10.290> time<00:05:10.610> keep<00:05:11.610> the

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
they're gonna have a good time keep the

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.670 
they're gonna have a good time keep the
prices<00:05:11.940> reasonable<00:05:12.630> on<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.900> you<00:05:12.990> know<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.139> fuel

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
prices reasonable on it you know a fuel

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.310 
prices reasonable on it you know a fuel
cost<00:05:13.919> out<00:05:14.100> here<00:05:14.280> shouldn't<00:05:14.880> be<00:05:15.000> too<00:05:15.210> bad<00:05:15.510> maybe

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
cost out here shouldn't be too bad maybe

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.930 
cost out here shouldn't be too bad maybe
we<00:05:16.500> could<00:05:16.620> even<00:05:16.830> make<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.100> deal<00:05:17.400> with<00:05:17.820> these

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
we could even make a deal with these

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.490 
we could even make a deal with these
mining<00:05:18.419> guys<00:05:18.570> out<00:05:18.780> here<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.050> use<00:05:19.290> some<00:05:19.470> of

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
mining guys out here to use some of

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.930 
mining guys out here to use some of
their<00:05:19.650> fuel<00:05:19.889> we'll<00:05:20.100> pay<00:05:20.280> for<00:05:20.460> them<00:05:20.580> pay<00:05:20.760> them

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
their fuel we'll pay for them pay them

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.400 
their fuel we'll pay for them pay them
for<00:05:21.090> fuel<00:05:21.300> double<00:05:21.540> whatever<00:05:21.840> they're<00:05:22.110> paying

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
for fuel double whatever they're paying

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.870 
for fuel double whatever they're paying
so<00:05:23.040> they<00:05:23.130> can<00:05:23.280> turn<00:05:23.430> a<00:05:23.460> little<00:05:23.580> bit<00:05:23.729> of<00:05:23.820> a

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
so they can turn a little bit of a

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.010 
so they can turn a little bit of a
profit<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:24.539> know<00:05:24.630> we<00:05:24.750> could<00:05:24.870> probably

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
profit and you know we could probably

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.810 
profit and you know we could probably
break<00:05:25.440> even<00:05:25.770> on<00:05:25.889> that<00:05:26.039> in<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.310> end<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.789> just

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
break even on that in the end and just

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.640 
break even on that in the end and just
worry<00:05:27.240> about<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.660> cost<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:28.080> admission<00:05:28.350> to

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
worry about the cost of admission to

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.710 
worry about the cost of admission to
make<00:05:29.370> all<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.700> money<00:05:29.820> that<00:05:30.060> we<00:05:30.210> need<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.570> keep

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
make all the money that we need to keep

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.260 
make all the money that we need to keep
the<00:05:30.930> site<00:05:31.110> operational<00:05:31.770> until<00:05:32.130> until<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.060> find

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
the site operational until until I find

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.400 
the site operational until until I find
something<00:05:33.510> new<00:05:33.660> you<00:05:33.900> know<00:05:34.020> it's<00:05:34.110> kind<00:05:34.289> of<00:05:34.320> the

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
something new you know it's kind of the

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.480 
something new you know it's kind of the
thing<00:05:34.440> bounce<00:05:34.860> from<00:05:34.979> one<00:05:35.130> thing<00:05:35.250> into<00:05:35.310> another

thing bounce from one thing into another

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.610 
thing bounce from one thing into another
it's<00:05:35.820> like<00:05:35.910> roller<00:05:36.270> coasters<00:05:37.430> down<00:05:38.430> on<00:05:38.580> earth
