00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.279 
side of it let me just remove the pin
itself<00:01:50.930> due<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.200> being<00:01:52.259> an<00:01:52.590> open-ended

hook<00:01:55.289> I<00:01:55.590> prefer<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.580> use<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.789> shackle<00:01:57.390> with<00:01:58.289> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.199 

let's<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.600> through<00:02:07.729> but<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> loop

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
let's get that through but I have a loop

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.580 
let's get that through but I have a loop
right<00:02:09.539> through<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:11.160> into<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:15.590> put

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
right through it and then into here put

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:32.880 
right through it and then into here put
that<00:02:16.620> through

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.160 

this<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.090> pull<00:02:34.420> strap<00:02:34.750> but<00:02:34.960> quite<00:02:35.140> a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
this is just a pull strap but quite a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.100 
this is just a pull strap but quite a
short<00:02:35.440> pull<00:02:35.800> strap<00:02:36.100> we<00:02:37.090> use<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.690> dampen

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
short pull strap we use it to dampen

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.600 
short pull strap we use it to dampen
there<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.760> cable<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:41.470> dampen<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.980> cables<00:02:42.340> in

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
there the cable we dampen the cables in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.540 
there the cable we dampen the cables in
case<00:02:42.970> these<00:02:43.150> are<00:02:43.209> breakage<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.550> this

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
case these are breakage and this

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.990 
case these are breakage and this
hopefully<00:02:46.480> will<00:02:46.720> catch<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.470> slow<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.830> up

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.750 

lock<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.180> drum<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.570> winch<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:57.370> last

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
lock the drum of the winch and the last

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.630 
lock the drum of the winch and the last
thing<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.060> do<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.690> put<00:02:59.620> your<00:02:59.680> winch<00:03:00.070> control

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
thing you do is put your winch control

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.770 
pull it has the stress on the winch but
the<00:03:41.890> penalty<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.180> speed<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.540> the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
the penalty is that the speed of the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.069 
the penalty is that the speed of the
retrieve<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.620> halved<00:03:45.360> it's<00:03:46.360> good<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.720> use<00:03:46.900> the

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
retrieve is halved it's good to use the

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.620 
retrieve is halved it's good to use the
system<00:03:47.440> when<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.160> vehicle<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.730> really<00:03:49.269> badly

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
system when the vehicle is really badly

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.319 
system when the vehicle is really badly
bobbed<00:03:50.489> here's<00:03:51.489> an<00:03:51.610> interesting<00:03:51.820> fact<00:03:52.000> about

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
bobbed here's an interesting fact about

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.840 
bobbed here's an interesting fact about
using<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.170> hook<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:54.130> end<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.670> winch

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
using the hook on the end of a winch

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.970 
using the hook on the end of a winch
cable<00:03:55.269> now<00:03:56.370> when<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.549> can<00:03:57.760> use<00:03:58.420> that<00:03:58.829> but<00:03:59.829> it's

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
cable now when you can use that but it's

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.770 
cable now when you can use that but it's
not<00:04:00.130> an<00:04:00.220> absolute<00:04:00.519> hard<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.269> fast<00:04:01.420> rule<00:04:01.750> that

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
not an absolute hard and fast rule that

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.960 
not an absolute hard and fast rule that
you<00:04:02.019> use<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.410> if<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:03.070> want<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.519> use<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.790> hook

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
you use that if you want to use the hook

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.780 
you use that if you want to use the hook
this<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.870> what<00:04:04.989> studies<00:04:05.320> have<00:04:05.350> shown<00:04:05.680> if<00:04:06.670> you

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
this is what studies have shown if you

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.979 
this is what studies have shown if you
hook<00:04:06.910> it<00:04:07.060> on<00:04:07.209> like<00:04:07.660> that

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
hook it on like that

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.640 
hook it on like that
and<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.950> fails<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:10.150> tends<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.480> happen<00:04:10.600> is<00:04:10.840> flies

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
and it fails it tends to happen is flies

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.490 
and it fails it tends to happen is flies
up<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:11.890> becomes<00:04:12.250> very<00:04:12.970> dangerous<00:04:13.410> if<00:04:14.410> you

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
up and becomes very dangerous if you

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.770 
up and becomes very dangerous if you
hook<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.799> like<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:16.000> an<00:04:16.209> energy

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
hook it like that in an energy

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.860 
hook it like that in an energy
apparently<00:04:17.739> forces<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.310> down<00:04:18.820> should<00:04:19.780> it
