00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
eyebrows for quite a while so this just

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.789 
eyebrows for quite a while so this just
thickens<00:03:36.980> them<00:03:37.190> up<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.430> bit<00:03:37.580> more<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:39.530> won't

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
thickens them up a bit more it won't

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.650 
thickens them up a bit more it won't
quite<00:03:39.950> do<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.280> trick<00:03:40.549> if<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.849> have<00:03:41.090> sparse

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
quite do the trick if you have sparse

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.509 
quite do the trick if you have sparse
gaps<00:03:41.959> you'll<00:03:42.260> need<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.500> pencil<00:03:42.860> those<00:03:42.980> bits<00:03:43.280> in

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519
