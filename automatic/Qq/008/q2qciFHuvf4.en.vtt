ten pound extra now i'm going to check
this<00:01:18.570> camera<00:01:19.280> let's<00:01:20.280> start<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.930> camera<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.970> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this camera let's start this camera is a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.249 
this camera let's start this camera is a
5x<00:01:27.750> optical<00:01:28.170> zoom<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> let's<00:01:33.240> set<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.840> optical

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
5x optical zoom so let's set the optical

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.170 
5x optical zoom so let's set the optical
zoom

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.210 

this<00:01:41.180> is<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.770> maximum<00:01:43.280> zoom<00:01:45.040> available<00:01:46.040> with

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
this is the maximum zoom available with

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:54.760 
this is the maximum zoom available with
this<00:01:46.400> camera<00:01:52.120> this<00:01:53.120> is<00:01:53.180> pretty<00:01:53.510> good<00:01:53.840> Plus

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
this camera this is pretty good Plus

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.980 
this camera this is pretty good Plus
this<00:01:55.400> camera<00:01:55.970> has<00:01:56.350> different<00:01:57.350> shooting<00:01:57.890> modes

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
this camera has different shooting modes

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:10.620 
this camera has different shooting modes
manual<00:01:59.990> picture<00:02:00.770> modes<00:02:01.040> in<00:02:02.920> automatic<00:02:03.920> mode

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
so for now I'm going to test the face

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.160 
so for now I'm going to test the face
detection<00:02:16.210> picture<00:02:17.220> with<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.370> camera<00:02:19.170> so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
detection picture with this camera so

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.480 
detection picture with this camera so
plus<00:02:20.410> i<00:02:20.650> need<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:23.010> go<00:02:24.010> white<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.890> take<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.310> lens

plus i need to go white to take the lens

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.810 
plus i need to go white to take the lens
and<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:27.940> liberal<00:02:28.300> position<00:02:30.090> here<00:02:31.090> we<00:02:31.180> go<00:02:32.820> no

and it's liberal position here we go no

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.640 
and it's liberal position here we go no
face<00:02:34.360> detection<00:02:34.660> i<00:02:36.630> am<00:02:37.630> using<00:02:37.990> an<00:02:38.290> online

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
face detection i am using an online

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.320 
face detection i am using an online
image<00:02:39.490> available<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.390> 28<00:02:41.290> projects<00:02:41.920> calm<00:02:42.430> as

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
image available I 28 projects calm as

you<00:02:44.200> can<00:02:44.380> see<00:02:45.300> there<00:02:46.300> are<00:02:46.830> 5<00:02:47.830> photos<00:02:48.400> or<00:02:48.700> five

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
you can see there are 5 photos or five

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.280 
you can see there are 5 photos or five
phases<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.630> row<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:51.180> for<00:02:52.180> our<00:02:52.600> four<00:02:53.020> rows

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
phases in a row and for our four rows

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.910 
phases in a row and for our four rows
means<00:02:53.560> there<00:02:53.920> are<00:02:54.300> 20<00:02:55.300> phrases<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:55.960> total<00:02:56.440> but

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
means there are 20 phrases in total but

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.740 
means there are 20 phrases in total but
as<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.400> see<00:02:57.730> such<00:02:58.630> spaces<00:03:00.180> are<00:03:01.180> hard<00:03:01.540> to

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
as you can see such spaces are hard to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.300 
as you can see such spaces are hard to
detect<00:03:02.790> because<00:03:03.790> eyes<00:03:04.270> are<00:03:04.660> not<00:03:04.810> included<00:03:05.320> you

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
detect because eyes are not included you

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.980 
detect because eyes are not included you
can't<00:03:06.580> see<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.940> eyes<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.330> this<00:03:07.510> piece<00:03:07.780> of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
can't see the eyes in this piece of

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.060 
can't see the eyes in this piece of

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
many faces my camera that is Olympus x43

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:23.790 
many faces my camera that is Olympus x43
can<00:03:16.210> detect

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.550 

four<00:03:24.800> five<00:03:25.190> six<00:03:25.700> seven<00:03:26.150> eight<00:03:26.630> nine<00:03:27.230> ten

eleven<00:03:28.459> twelve<00:03:29.440> yeah<00:03:35.860> yeah<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:37.100> can<00:03:37.340> detect

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
eleven twelve yeah yeah it can detect

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.320 
eleven twelve yeah yeah it can detect
around<00:03:38.030> 12<00:03:38.300> places<00:03:39.430> first<00:03:40.430> pretty<00:03:40.850> accurate

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
around 12 places first pretty accurate

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.309 
around 12 places first pretty accurate
and<00:03:42.489> in<00:03:43.489> manual<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.330> says<00:03:44.360> our<00:03:44.810> which<00:03:45.140> can

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
and in manual it says our which can

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.070 
and in manual it says our which can
detect<00:03:45.440> Iran<00:03:45.770> pour<00:03:46.010> into<00:03:46.190> 15<00:03:46.670> faces<00:03:47.090> but<00:03:47.870> maybe

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
detect Iran pour into 15 faces but maybe

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.800 
detect Iran pour into 15 faces but maybe
I<00:03:48.230> think<00:03:48.500> due<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.950> benchmark<00:03:51.950> chrome<00:03:52.310> all

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
I think due to the benchmark chrome all

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.710 
I think due to the benchmark chrome all
the<00:03:53.810> colored<00:03:54.709> eyes<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.940> is<00:03:55.970> unable<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.330> detect

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
the colored eyes it is unable to detect

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.940 
the colored eyes it is unable to detect
some<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.140> photos<00:03:57.380> stills<00:03:58.370> ridiculous<00:03:59.300> i
