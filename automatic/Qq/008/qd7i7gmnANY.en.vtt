00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 laughing kidding guys we are 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.600
 arrived at 5,000 registered a goal 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.069
 fantastic for what is mine 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.929
 person my channel say they are 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.370
 really happy and happy and 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.259
 thrilled to have come to this 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.240
 goal counting that in September 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.390
 when I returned from summer vacation 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.400
 we were about 800 900 then in these 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.439
 months there have been so many many 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 people who interacted with me 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.560
 lots of new members and lots of new videos 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.539
 many new ones 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.400
 in short, the channel is evolving a 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.740
 month after month, week after weeks 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.160
 is slowly becoming what I am 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.989
 I had dreamed and imagined it was mine 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.360
 youtube channel and all that derives 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.760
 from the youtube channel 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.829
 when I started I started this project 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.200
 for that reason this 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.120
 week the programming let's say 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.890
 canonica will undergo small variations 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.180
 today was supposed to be the bounty day 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.050
 hunters but it won't be tomorrow 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.660
 I will publish another video that has to 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.520
 do with my 5 thousand subscribers then vi 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.280
 in short, I will say later in this brief 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.809
 log because I want to dedicate these in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.070
 these two days this week 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.630
 we say to you 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.880
 for this the first video of the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.560
 week that today, Monday and she will be more 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.900
 therefore a question lancer then 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.150
 questions and answers that you will do to me 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 then below in the bombed comments 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.200
 there are the only constraints that you have 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.810
 I put is to comment with the ashtag 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.490
 ascani then later the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.799
 question that you will make me had I made a 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.590
 clooney long ago to which I could not 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.380
 reply I could not complete 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.210
 in short, let's say the video with the answers 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.280
 because in the while I was taken the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.229
 so many things work university 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.490
 and also the youtube channel that anyway 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.659
 I had videos to make 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.729
 they must therefore have me 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.979
 taken away some time I am not 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.110
 managed to find time to do a 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.700
 decently mounted video for 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.710
 more answers and her but I'm going to 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.710
 refer back with this then bombarded with 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.119
 questions of any personal nature me 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.180
 does not enter destiny inherent in video games 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.189
 cinema-related inherent in the series 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.649
 tv in short, anything because you know 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.869
 that is now the panic studios yes 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.399
 they deal with destinies and will take care of 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.890
 always by destiny 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.770
 but it is not said that in parallel yes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.330
 others may develop 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.930
 talk about other video games maybe 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.900
 something 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.560
 maybe even drain things sporadically 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.170
 in short, then ask me questions about it 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.519
 that hell where it seems I also invite you to 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.719
 don't miss the video tomorrow 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.329
 afternoon I mentioned a few 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.909
 second ago because it will be the contest for i 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.829
 5000 subscribers therefore tomorrow 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.719
 I will propose another blog where there is 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.599
 Now, after the contest explain what 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.489
 what having what i give you how 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.409
 I'll give this to you, you have to do 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.879
 and so on and so on and I wanted 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.250
 also take the opportunity of this 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.319
 team and you to ask me a question 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.669
 so when are you going to do one 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.549
 asks the question with below i 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:52.500
 comments I would like you to answer to 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.540
 this is my question I am asking you 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.620
 since destinies we say that it is now 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.870
 in a stalled phase 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.329
 but apart from this I consider mine 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.150
 wider speech then from here to 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:07.200
 I continue my channel forever 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.230
 do you want or would you like me to start a 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.430
 bring you some more video games maybe 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.609
 in depth then I tell you 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.859
 already for sure I will deal with the 5 star 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.049
 battlefront wars is probably star 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.519
 wars excuse me halo with a simple one 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.169
 let's play so we'll play it 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.849
 campaign to all together and with some 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.129
 multiplayer video instead beats the front 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.590
 star wars I wanted to develop a speech 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.599
 similar to that of destiny then guides 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.609
 so let's say imprint the channel on 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.260
 also star wars battlefront but in 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.090
 while there are lots of eau games 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.790
 and lots of other youtubers and channels 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.829
 youtube make the former simple play 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.099
 gameplay sporadic games of a game 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:47.970
 in other words, you want it to begin 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.680
 I too do these things here with guides 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.409
 simple simple video games maybe 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.790
 let me also know the game below 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.799
 you want me to do some things for example 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.259
 reviews and video games that come out 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.269
 so when it is a new game I will 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.340
 I do a video review but well mounted 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.629
 written you know that I work with 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.449
 real boys so I'm learning 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.919
 let's say the job of the reviewer 15 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.109
 I'm also able to get reviews 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.759
 you want something like this then 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.239
 you want a little bit more variety on 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:17.459
 contents we are 5 thousand so I am 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.919
 it seems more than fair to ask you if you are 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.120
 it may affect a little thing like that 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.150
 let me know below in the comments 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.940
 I remind you more and she to schifani that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.690

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.620
 with the one written here how to put it up 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.120
 followed by the answer to this question 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.070
 that I did so you want to see 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.080
 other games on the poles studios you want 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.790
 see others maybe reviews or 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.980
 Simple gameplay will be played fucking for 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.420
 make us laugh that you play like things 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.340
 in short, let me know what you would like 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.410

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.810

 next then we say that maybe the 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.920
