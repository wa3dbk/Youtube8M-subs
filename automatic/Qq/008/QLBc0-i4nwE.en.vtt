it's<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:15.120> like<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.320> master

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
it's going to be just like the master

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.830 
it's going to be just like the master
chief<00:00:17.039> collection<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.449> have

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
chief collection and it's going to have

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.109 
chief collection and it's going to have
all<00:00:19.260> these<00:00:19.470> issues<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.640> think<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.939> lot<00:00:21.090> of

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
all these issues and I think a lot of

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.630 
all these issues and I think a lot of
that<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.510> haters<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.109> guess<00:00:22.350> there<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
that is haters but I guess there is a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.060 
that is haters but I guess there is a
validity<00:00:24.180> there<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> reason<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.439> people<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
validity there is a reason for people to

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.880 
validity there is a reason for people to
be<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> bit<00:00:26.789> concerned<00:00:27.300> when<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.109> comes<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.619> halo

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
be a bit concerned when it comes to halo

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.370 
be a bit concerned when it comes to halo
5<00:00:29.160> Guardians<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.689> master<00:00:31.140> chief

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
5 Guardians because the master chief

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.520 
5 Guardians because the master chief
collection<00:00:31.410> was<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.550> broken<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.480> even<00:00:34.140> remember

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
collection was so broken I even remember

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
collection was so broken I even remember
reading<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.920> there<00:00:35.219> was<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> tournament<00:00:35.940> on

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
reading that there was a tournament on

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.750 
reading that there was a tournament on
not<00:00:36.420> too<00:00:36.630> long<00:00:36.840> ago<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> week<00:00:37.710> ago<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.730> I

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
not too long ago like a week ago that I

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
not too long ago like a week ago that I
had<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.570> cancelled<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
had to be cancelled because of

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.069 
had to be cancelled because of
connectivity<00:00:41.430> issues<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> game<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
connectivity issues in the game so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.810 
connectivity issues in the game so
obviously<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.129> master<00:00:44.550> chief<00:00:44.789> collection

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
obviously the master chief collection

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.750 
obviously the master chief collection
was<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> huge<00:00:45.989> failure<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.370> know<00:00:47.430> people

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
I don't understand is the fact that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.270 
I don't understand is the fact that
there's<00:01:21.840> already<00:01:22.049> been<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.380> beta<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> beta

it putting it all together the footprint
and<00:02:06.799> complexity<00:02:07.799> was<00:02:08.009> outrageous<00:02:08.819> now<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> be

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690

very challenging but they're radically

very challenging but they're radically
different<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.140> think<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> beta<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.280> already<00:02:56.820> at

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
different I think the beta is already at

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.090 
different I think the beta is already at
a<00:02:57.090> decent<00:02:57.390> first<00:02:57.840> step<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.680> retail

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
a decent first step in a retail

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.009 
a decent first step in a retail
environment<00:02:59.390> showing<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.660> don't<00:03:00.870> have

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
environment showing that we don't have

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.620 
environment showing that we don't have
the<00:03:01.440> same<00:03:01.680> problems<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:03.060> everything<00:03:03.510> he's

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the same problems so everything he's

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.170 
the same problems so everything he's
saying<00:03:03.870> here<00:03:04.140> guys<00:03:04.319> make<00:03:04.739> sense<00:03:05.100> like<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.910> said

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
saying here guys make sense like I said

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.140 
saying here guys make sense like I said
earlier<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.110> beta<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.739> out<00:03:08.100> there<00:03:08.400> people

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
earlier to the beta is out there people

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.660 
earlier to the beta is out there people
played<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.959> ran<00:03:10.470> perfectly<00:03:11.040> smooth<00:03:11.459> there

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
played it it ran perfectly smooth there

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.940 
played it it ran perfectly smooth there
were<00:03:11.760> no<00:03:12.000> connectivity<00:03:12.540> issues<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.200> do<00:03:13.470> think

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
were no connectivity issues I do think

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.550 
were no connectivity issues I do think
that<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.850> connecting<00:03:15.510> times<00:03:15.840> were<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> bit

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
that the the connecting times were a bit

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.640 
that the the connecting times were a bit
long<00:03:16.950> but<00:03:17.370> I'm<00:03:18.090> sure<00:03:18.870> they<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.200> get<00:03:19.470> that

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
long but I'm sure they can get that

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.920 
long but I'm sure they can get that

think<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.260> very<00:03:22.380> important<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.790> a

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
think is very important that a
