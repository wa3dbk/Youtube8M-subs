point<00:02:38.670> every<00:02:39.360> time<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.569> get<00:02:39.720> pushed<00:02:39.900> out<00:02:40.080> of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
point every time we get pushed out of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.690 
point every time we get pushed out of
the<00:02:40.319> pocket<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.800> starts<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.160> cause<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.550> issue

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
the pocket it starts to cause this issue

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.430 
the pocket it starts to cause this issue
if<00:02:42.390> we<00:02:42.510> fall<00:02:42.690> out<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> back<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.260> pocket

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
if we fall out the back of the pocket

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.559 
if we fall out the back of the pocket
we're<00:02:44.100> gonna<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> problem<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.120> if<00:02:45.330> we<00:02:45.420> get

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
we're gonna have a problem and if we get

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.479 
we're gonna have a problem and if we get
more<00:02:45.989> lightly<00:02:46.260> pushed<00:02:46.739> forward<00:02:47.190> out<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
more lightly pushed forward out of the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.940 
more lightly pushed forward out of the
pocket<00:02:47.850> that's<00:02:48.209> gonna<00:02:48.450> cause<00:02:48.690> issues<00:02:49.050> too<00:02:49.260> so

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
pocket that's gonna cause issues too so

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.140 
pocket that's gonna cause issues too so
let's<00:02:50.130> look<00:02:50.310> at<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.489> pocket<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:50.940> why<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.090> we

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
let's look at the pocket and why do we

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.820 
let's look at the pocket and why do we
call<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.540> pocket<00:02:51.720> where's<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.380> safe<00:02:52.590> place

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
call it a pocket where's the safe place

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.530 
call it a pocket where's the safe place
to<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.819> don't<00:02:53.970> want<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.150> lose<00:02:54.270> something

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
to be you don't want to lose something

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.040 
to be you don't want to lose something
get<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.530> put<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.709> your<00:02:55.920> pocket<00:02:56.660> Here<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.690> am<00:02:57.810> on

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
get it put in your pocket Here I am on

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.509 
get it put in your pocket Here I am on
my<00:02:58.110> downhill<00:02:58.590> bike<00:02:58.800> coming<00:02:59.160> through<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
my downhill bike coming through the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.400 
my downhill bike coming through the
trail<00:02:59.760> if<00:03:00.360> we<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.630> head<00:03:00.810> back<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.380> a

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
trail if we just head back and have a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.990 
trail if we just head back and have a
look<00:03:01.650> at<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.890> position<00:03:02.040> I'm<00:03:02.400> holding<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
look at the position I'm holding on the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.390 
look at the position I'm holding on the
bike<00:03:03.209> we<00:03:03.810> can<00:03:03.989> see<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:04.680> add<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.040> centre

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
bike we can see if we add the centre

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.520 
bike we can see if we add the centre
lines<00:03:05.610> through<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.209> middle<00:03:06.510> front<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.350> back

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
lines through the middle front to back

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.130 
lines through the middle front to back
and<00:03:07.910> through<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.030> straight<00:03:09.300> top<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.019> bottom

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
and through the straight top to bottom

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.890 
and through the straight top to bottom
you<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:11.010> see<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.220> where<00:03:11.640> I'm<00:03:11.790> sat<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.390> with

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
you can see that where I'm sat is with

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.110 
you can see that where I'm sat is with
my<00:03:13.050> weight<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.590> behind<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.550> center<00:03:14.940> line

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
my weight just behind that center line

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.210 
my weight just behind that center line
and<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.540> below<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.810> centre<00:03:16.350> line<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.769> what

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
and just below that centre line and what

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.949 
and just below that centre line and what
it's<00:03:17.370> doing<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.910> its<00:03:18.360> pushing<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.810> weight

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
it's doing is its pushing the weight

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.199 
it's doing is its pushing the weight
through<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.650> enabling<00:03:20.340> me<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.489> drop<00:03:20.790> my<00:03:20.850> heels

through and enabling me to drop my heels
and<00:03:21.540> drop<00:03:21.870> my<00:03:22.019> wrist<00:03:22.340> accelerate<00:03:23.340> my<00:03:23.489> weight

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
and drop my wrist accelerate my weight

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.610 
and drop my wrist accelerate my weight
underneath<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.330> bike<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.780> make<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.440> bike

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
underneath the bike and make the bike

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.979 
underneath the bike and make the bike
the<00:03:25.800> accelerating<00:03:26.400> mass<00:03:26.610> again<00:03:27.390> my<00:03:27.569> head's<00:03:27.810> up

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
the accelerating mass again my head's up

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.870 
the accelerating mass again my head's up
looking<00:03:28.350> through<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.680> trail<00:03:28.920> I'm<00:03:29.400> breathing

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
looking through the trail I'm breathing

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.910 
looking through the trail I'm breathing
out<00:03:30.000> staying<00:03:30.390> nice<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.600> relaxed<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.350> even<00:03:31.829> on

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
out staying nice and relaxed and even on

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.500 
out staying nice and relaxed and even on
a<00:03:31.950> level<00:03:32.220> trail<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.730> can<00:03:32.910> see<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.299> with<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
a level trail you can see that with the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.600 
a level trail you can see that with the
downhill<00:03:33.900> bike<00:03:34.079> I'm<00:03:34.500> sitting<00:03:34.980> back<00:03:35.130> into<00:03:35.519> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
downhill bike I'm sitting back into the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.910 
downhill bike I'm sitting back into the
pocket<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.090> looking<00:03:36.660> through<00:03:36.870> if<00:03:37.470> we<00:03:37.650> look<00:03:37.799> at

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
pocket and looking through if we look at

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.860 
pocket and looking through if we look at
Richard<00:03:38.160> here<00:03:38.340> on<00:03:38.459> his<00:03:38.579> trail<00:03:38.850> bike<00:03:39.060> we<00:03:39.660> can

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
Richard here on his trail bike we can

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.569 
Richard here on his trail bike we can
see<00:03:40.019> again<00:03:40.320> as<00:03:40.350> we<00:03:40.620> draw<00:03:40.799> in<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.040> center<00:03:41.370> lines

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
see again as we draw in the center lines

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.060 
see again as we draw in the center lines
so<00:03:42.030> we<00:03:42.150> draw<00:03:42.329> in<00:03:42.510> top<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.930> bottom<00:03:43.049> front<00:03:43.950> to

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
so we draw in top to bottom front to

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.580 
so we draw in top to bottom front to
back<00:03:44.280> we<00:03:44.820> can<00:03:45.060> see<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.450> his<00:03:45.600> way<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:46.079> sat<00:03:46.380> back

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
back we can see that his way is sat back

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.860 
back we can see that his way is sat back
into<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.100> pocket<00:03:47.459> very<00:03:48.299> much<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.690> same

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
into the pocket very much the same

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.680 
into the pocket very much the same
position<00:03:49.400> slightly<00:03:50.400> changing<00:03:50.910> dynamic<00:03:51.540> on

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
position slightly changing dynamic on

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.509 
position slightly changing dynamic on
the<00:03:51.810> bike<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.470> again<00:03:52.799> what<00:03:53.010> Richards<00:03:53.340> doing

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
the bike but again what Richards doing

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.160 
the bike but again what Richards doing
is<00:03:53.730> making<00:03:53.910> sure<00:03:54.060> his<00:03:54.299> heels<00:03:54.510> are<00:03:54.690> dropped<00:03:54.900> his

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
is making sure his heels are dropped his

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.780 
is making sure his heels are dropped his
wrists<00:03:55.410> are<00:03:55.560> dropped<00:03:55.769> his<00:03:56.040> heads<00:03:56.250> up<00:03:56.459> looking

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
wrists are dropped his heads up looking

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.610 
wrists are dropped his heads up looking
through<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.150> section<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.750> again<00:03:58.140> exactly

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
through the section and again exactly

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.349 
through the section and again exactly
the<00:03:58.829> same<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.190> get<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.459> under<00:03:59.760> rotation

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
the same we get that under rotation

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.240 
the same we get that under rotation
which<00:04:00.840> drives<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.410> mass<00:04:01.590> through<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:01.980> trail

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
which drives the mass through the trail

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.069 
which drives the mass through the trail
and<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.970> we've<00:04:03.120> got<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.359> body<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.840> under

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
and so we've got the body in the under

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.810 
and so we've got the body in the under
rotating<00:04:04.590> mass<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.370> bike<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.579> the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
rotating mass and the bike is the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.970 
rotating mass and the bike is the
accelerating<00:04:06.420> mass<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.380> can<00:04:07.530> see<00:04:07.739> that

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
accelerating mass and you can see that

00:05:14.609 --> 00:05:14.619 
challenge you've got is you might line

challenge you've got is you might line
flat<00:05:14.979> there<00:05:15.249> and<00:05:15.399> just<00:05:15.550> lose<00:05:15.819> all<00:05:16.029> of<00:05:16.209> that

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
flat there and just lose all of that

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.089 
flat there and just lose all of that
momentum<00:05:16.419> whereas<00:05:17.349> using<00:05:17.529> the<00:05:17.769> technique

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
momentum whereas using the technique

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.559 
momentum whereas using the technique
which<00:05:18.279> is<00:05:18.429> described<00:05:18.879> you<00:05:19.089> can<00:05:19.240> carry<00:05:19.509> that

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 
which is described you can carry that

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.449 
which is described you can carry that
momentum<00:05:19.749> over<00:05:20.349> the<00:05:20.439> hump<00:05:20.589> and<00:05:20.800> as<00:05:21.129> he<00:05:21.249> said

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:21.459 
momentum over the hump and as he said

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.219 
momentum over the hump and as he said
work<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.849> backside<00:05:22.269> and<00:05:22.539> really<00:05:22.839> carry<00:05:23.080> that

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
work the backside and really carry that

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.199 
work the backside and really carry that
speed<00:05:23.529> out<00:05:23.740> actually<00:05:24.159> accelerating<00:05:24.969> you<00:05:25.029> down

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:25.209 
speed out actually accelerating you down

speed out actually accelerating you down
the<00:05:25.330> trail

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.689 

so<00:05:52.050> we<00:05:52.139> can<00:05:52.259> see<00:05:52.409> they're<00:05:52.590> just<00:05:52.800> a<00:05:52.919> very<00:05:53.069> simple

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
so we can see they're just a very simple

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.369 
so we can see they're just a very simple
