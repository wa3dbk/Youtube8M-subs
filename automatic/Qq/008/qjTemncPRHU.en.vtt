00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.399 
this guy this is a fully composite
outsole<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:38.780> it's<00:01:38.960> going<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.140> be<00:01:39.229> really

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
outsole so it's going to be really

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.889 
outsole so it's going to be really
lightweight<00:01:39.770> as<00:01:40.310> well<00:01:40.909> as<00:01:41.030> offering<00:01:41.420> great

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
lightweight as well as offering great

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.289 
lightweight as well as offering great
energy<00:01:42.140> transfer<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.340> any<00:01:43.579> foot<00:01:43.909> movements

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
energy transfer so any foot movements

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.420 
energy transfer so any foot movements
going<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.509> go<00:01:44.600> directly<00:01:44.990> in<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.040> bottom<00:01:46.369> of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
going to go directly in to the bottom of

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.700 
going to go directly in to the bottom of
the<00:01:46.520> skate<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.090> into<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.450> core<00:01:47.719> so<00:01:48.469> that's<00:01:48.619> a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
the skate and into the core so that's a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.319 
the skate and into the core so that's a
nice<00:01:48.860> feature<00:01:49.040> as<00:01:49.250> well<00:01:49.310> as<00:01:49.579> you'd<00:01:49.729> expect<00:01:49.850> on

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
nice feature as well as you'd expect on

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.749 
nice feature as well as you'd expect on
an<00:01:50.479> upper<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:50.960> skate<00:01:51.320> like<00:01:51.500> this<00:01:51.740> I'm<00:01:52.490> going

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
an upper and skate like this I'm going

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.670 
an upper and skate like this I'm going
on<00:01:52.939> from<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.990> can<00:01:54.020> see<00:01:54.259> this<00:01:54.350> kind<00:01:54.530> of

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
on from there you can see this kind of

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.039 
on from there you can see this kind of
has<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.040> exact<00:01:55.700> opposite<00:01:56.390> color<00:01:56.719> scheme

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
has the exact opposite color scheme

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.200 
has the exact opposite color scheme
going<00:01:57.200> on<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.710> AK<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:58.850> you're<00:01:58.969> getting<00:01:59.149> the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
going on is the AK so you're getting the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.450 
going on is the AK so you're getting the
black<00:01:59.450> on<00:01:59.689> black<00:01:59.930> look<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.590> think<00:02:01.100> they've<00:02:01.340> done

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
black on black look I think they've done

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.190 
black on black look I think they've done
a<00:02:01.520> nice<00:02:01.729> job<00:02:01.789> kind<00:02:02.299> of<00:02:02.360> with<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.869> white

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
a nice job kind of with that and white

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.719 
a nice job kind of with that and white
underneath<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.130> gives<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:04.340> kind<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.610> a

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
underneath it so it gives it kind of a

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.170 
underneath it so it gives it kind of a
multi-dimensional<00:02:05.210> look<00:02:05.780> as<00:02:05.960> well<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:07.180> back

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
multi-dimensional look as well is back

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.700 
multi-dimensional look as well is back
to<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.450> wheels<00:02:08.630> real<00:02:08.869> quick<00:02:09.080> these<00:02:09.500> are<00:02:09.680> a

to the wheels real quick these are a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.130 
to the wheels real quick these are a
black<00:02:10.160> custom<00:02:10.880> wheel<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.780> that's<00:02:11.900> kind<00:02:12.080> of

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
black custom wheel so that's kind of

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.380 
black custom wheel so that's kind of
cool<00:02:12.290> as<00:02:12.410> well<00:02:12.710> I'm<00:02:13.370> going<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.060> quarter

place so that's not going to allow it to
loosen<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.820> then<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.419> go<00:04:21.509> ahead<00:04:21.539> and

tighten the upper portion like I said

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.980

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
shot or something also going ahead and

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.129 
shot or something also going ahead and
looking<00:04:53.970> at<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.300> do<00:04:54.419> see<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:54.690> has<00:04:54.870> this

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
looking at it you do see it has this

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.779 
looking at it you do see it has this
kind<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.740> trim<00:04:55.979> around<00:04:56.100> it<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.490> it's<00:04:56.639> not<00:04:56.729> a

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
kind of trim around it so it's not a

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.480 
kind of trim around it so it's not a
standard<00:04:57.479> nylon<00:04:57.870> or<00:04:57.990> felt<00:04:58.650> tongue<00:04:58.889> but<00:04:59.400> it

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
standard nylon or felt tongue but it

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.010 
standard nylon or felt tongue but it
does<00:04:59.639> have<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.880> felt<00:05:00.150> material<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.660> back<00:05:00.810> so

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
does have a felt material on the back so

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.840 
does have a felt material on the back so
it's<00:05:01.110> going<00:05:01.199> to<00:05:01.289> offer<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.470> nice<00:05:01.850> traditional

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
it's going to offer a nice traditional

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.460 
it's going to offer a nice traditional
feel<00:05:03.090> as<00:05:03.180> well<00:05:03.360> so<00:05:03.479> having<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:03.750> nice<00:05:03.900> thick<00:05:04.229> feel

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
feel as well so having a nice thick feel

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.260 
feel as well so having a nice thick feel
on<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:05.340> I<00:05:05.370> guess<00:05:05.669> it<00:05:05.820> is<00:05:05.910> going<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.090> give<00:05:06.210> you

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
on it so I guess it is going to give you

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.820 
on it so I guess it is going to give you
a<00:05:06.330> little<00:05:06.389> more<00:05:06.599> increased<00:05:07.050> protection<00:05:07.259> and

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
a little more increased protection and

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.390 
a little more increased protection and
it<00:05:08.220> does<00:05:08.400> have<00:05:08.639> a<00:05:08.669> little<00:05:08.970> bit<00:05:09.210> of<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:10.400> specific

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
it does have a little bit of a specific

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.879 
it does have a little bit of a specific
cut<00:05:11.910> to<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.840> that's<00:05:12.960> gone<00:05:13.110> for<00:05:13.289> a<00:05:13.320> great<00:05:13.560> fit

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
cut to it so that's gone for a great fit

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.400 
cut to it so that's gone for a great fit
