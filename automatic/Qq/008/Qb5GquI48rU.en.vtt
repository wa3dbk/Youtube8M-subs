00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
make one more loop around and that's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.599 
make one more loop around and that's
what<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.229> surgeon's<00:01:55.740> knot<00:01:55.920> looks<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.460> and

and<00:02:19.560> now<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:22.140> tie<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.200> knot<00:02:23.500> we're<00:02:23.770> going<00:02:23.890> to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
and now to tie the knot we're going to

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.370 
and now to tie the knot we're going to
make<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.280> first<00:02:25.050> half<00:02:26.050> knot<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.890> pull<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.870> so

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
make that first half knot and pull it so

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.300 
make that first half knot and pull it so
that<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.770> beads<00:02:29.950> are<00:02:30.190> up<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.970> knot<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
that the beads are up to the knot and

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.720 
that the beads are up to the knot and
then<00:02:33.760> we're<00:02:33.910> going<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.090> make<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:36.040> first<00:02:36.370> loop

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
then we're going to make the first loop

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.570 
then we're going to make the first loop
and<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.430> second<00:02:39.910> loop<00:02:40.620> for<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.830> square

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
and the second loop for the square

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.730 
and the second loop for the square
surgeon's<00:02:43.180> knot<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:44.050> if<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.200> can<00:02:44.380> see<00:02:44.590> I've

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
surgeon's knot so if you can see I've

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.890 
surgeon's knot so if you can see I've
got<00:02:44.920> both<00:02:45.100> loops<00:02:45.550> there<00:02:45.850> I'm<00:02:46.360> going<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.630> hold<00:02:46.810> a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
got both loops there I'm going to hold a

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.110 
got both loops there I'm going to hold a
little<00:02:47.080> tension<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:48.100> first<00:02:48.460> half<00:02:48.730> loop

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
little tension on this first half loop

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.360 
little tension on this first half loop
down<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.170> keep<00:02:50.320> those<00:02:50.470> beads<00:02:50.710> together<00:02:50.920> and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
down to keep those beads together and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.690 
down to keep those beads together and
then<00:02:51.760> I'm<00:02:51.850> going<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.030> pull<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:53.290> cord<00:02:53.770> nice<00:02:54.340> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
then I'm going to pull the cord nice and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.030 
then I'm going to pull the cord nice and
tight<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.800> then<00:02:56.860> I'm<00:02:57.490> going<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.820> pull<00:02:58.440> all<00:02:59.440> the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
tight and then I'm going to pull all the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.800 
tight and then I'm going to pull all the
cords<00:03:00.840> tight<00:03:01.840> together<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:04.360> I'm<00:03:04.540> going<00:03:04.720> to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
cords tight together and I'm going to

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.410 
cords tight together and I'm going to
check<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.440> make<00:03:05.500> sure<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.580> my<00:03:06.790> knot<00:03:07.120> is

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
check it and make sure that my knot is

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.470 
check it and make sure that my knot is
good<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:07.960> sturdy<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.490> is<00:03:11.130> then<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
good and sturdy and it is then the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.540 
good and sturdy and it is then the
elasticity<00:03:13.900> cuts<00:03:14.320> really<00:03:14.680> easily<00:03:15.190> with<00:03:15.520> just

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
elasticity cuts really easily with just

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.120 
elasticity cuts really easily with just
a<00:03:15.880> regular<00:03:16.210> pair<00:03:16.420> of<00:03:16.450> how<00:03:17.170> scissors<00:03:17.740> you<00:03:17.980> can

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.690 
a regular pair of how scissors you can
also<00:03:18.250> use<00:03:18.580> nippers<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.300> then<00:03:20.290> if<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.740> want<00:03:21.010> to

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
also use nippers and then if you want to

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.990 
also use nippers and then if you want to
add<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.600> little<00:03:22.900> bit<00:03:22.989> of<00:03:23.110> security<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:24.430> can<00:03:24.670> use

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000

get the adhesive on there and I would

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.630 
get the adhesive on there and I would
let<00:03:44.470> that<00:03:44.739> sit<00:03:45.580> for<00:03:45.820> Oh<00:03:47.310> probably<00:03:48.310> four<00:03:48.580> or

let that sit for Oh probably four or
five<00:03:48.880> hours<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.450> dry<00:03:50.110> before<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.920> attempt<00:03:51.520> to

five hours to dry before you attempt to

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.340 
five hours to dry before you attempt to
stretch<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.450> or<00:03:52.570> wear<00:03:52.810> it
