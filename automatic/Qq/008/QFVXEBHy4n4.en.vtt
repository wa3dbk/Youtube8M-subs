even with a flat iron straight it
doesn't<00:01:12.119> look<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.450> sleek<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.380> polished<00:01:13.860> like

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
doesn't look like sleek or polished like

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.130 
doesn't look like sleek or polished like
that<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.549> doesn't<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.360> mean<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.689> could<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:15.990> got

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
that it doesn't I mean I could have got

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.929 
that it doesn't I mean I could have got
the<00:01:16.259> roots<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.650> straighter<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:17.700> it

Sun<00:02:26.070> outside<00:02:26.430> because<00:02:28.220> shooting<00:02:29.220> inside

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
Sun outside because shooting inside

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.130 
Sun outside because shooting inside
sometimes<00:02:29.790> with<00:02:30.210> no<00:02:30.330> light<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.990> doesn't

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
sometimes with no light it doesn't

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.990 
sometimes with no light it doesn't
really<00:02:31.350> look<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.950> can't<00:02:32.520> really<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
really look you can't really see the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.980 
really look you can't really see the
true<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:34.880> true<00:02:35.880> essence<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.720> what<00:02:36.900> it

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
true the true essence of what it

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.450 
true the true essence of what it
actually<00:02:37.230> looks<00:02:37.800> like<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.190> know<00:02:38.370> you

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
actually looks like so you know you

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.850 
actually looks like so you know you
can't<00:02:38.730> really<00:02:38.850> front<00:02:39.209> when<00:02:39.330> you're<00:02:39.420> outside

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
can't really front when you're outside

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.740 
can't really front when you're outside
definitely<00:02:40.860> have<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.790> still<00:02:42.030> be<00:02:42.240> concerned

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
definitely have to still be concerned

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.410 
definitely have to still be concerned
with<00:02:43.400> covering<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.640> track

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
with covering the track

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.330 
with covering the track
well<00:02:45.900> not<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.530> track<00:02:46.860> because<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:47.250> a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
well not like the track because it's a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.920 
well not like the track because it's a
cap<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.150> know<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.300> initial

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
cap on it but you know that initial

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.270 
cap on it but you know that initial
track<00:02:49.170> where<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.470> cap<00:02:49.620> starts<00:02:49.950> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
track where the cap starts and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.370 
track where the cap starts and
personally<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> weave<00:02:52.170> in

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
personally if you have a weave in

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.960 
personally if you have a weave in
they're<00:02:52.590> still<00:02:52.860> gonna<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> potential<00:02:53.790> for

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
they're still gonna be a potential for

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.880 
they're still gonna be a potential for
your<00:02:54.060> track<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.570> show<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.050> my<00:02:55.560> hair<00:02:55.770> is

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
your track to show so my hair is

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.190 
your track to show so my hair is
actually<00:02:56.100> not<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.850> thick<00:02:57.540> it's<00:02:57.780> pretty<00:02:57.990> fine

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
actually not that thick it's pretty fine

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.020 
actually not that thick it's pretty fine
so<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.800> know<00:02:58.980> I'm<00:02:59.100> definitely<00:02:59.310> aware<00:02:59.790> if<00:02:59.910> the
