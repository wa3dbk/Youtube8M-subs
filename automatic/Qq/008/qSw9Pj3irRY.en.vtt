00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
throw and some simple puzzles that we'll

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.770 
throw and some simple puzzles that we'll
get<00:00:25.110> to<00:00:25.290> later<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:26.300> you<00:00:27.300> can't<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
get to later on you can't have a

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.660 
get to later on you can't have a
Halloween<00:00:28.200> castle<00:00:28.650> without<00:00:28.770> Dracula<00:00:29.490> and

Halloween castle without Dracula and
there<00:00:30.270> he<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.930> guess<00:00:31.710> he<00:00:31.860> just<00:00:31.890> hides<00:00:32.189> behind

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
there he is I guess he just hides behind

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the stairs all day this was one of the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.799 
the stairs all day this was one of the
most<00:00:35.340> hilarious<00:00:35.579> moments<00:00:36.420> during<00:00:36.570> my

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
most hilarious moments during my

most hilarious moments during my
playthrough<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.859> sad<00:00:38.100> part<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.699> basically

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
playthrough the sad part is I basically

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.209 
playthrough the sad part is I basically
did<00:00:39.539> the<00:00:39.629> exact<00:00:39.960> same<00:00:39.989> thing<00:00:40.499> both<00:00:40.739> times<00:00:41.070> I

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
did the exact same thing both times I

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.729 
did the exact same thing both times I
ran<00:00:41.370> through<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.609> level<00:00:41.999> after<00:00:42.499> falling<00:00:43.499> to

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
ran through the level after falling to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.059 
ran through the level after falling to
my<00:00:43.769> death<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.339> made<00:00:44.909> it<00:00:45.089> a<00:00:45.179> second<00:00:45.510> time<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:46.069 
my death I made it a second time and

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:50.329 
my death I made it a second time and
just<00:00:47.069> watch<00:00:47.390> it's<00:00:48.390> embarrassing<00:00:49.219> even<00:00:50.219> after

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
just watch it's embarrassing even after

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.099 
just watch it's embarrassing even after
I<00:00:50.519> managed<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.179> switch<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.629> work<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
I managed to get the switch to work the

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.110 
I managed to get the switch to work the
jumping<00:00:52.499> mechanics<00:00:52.949> make<00:00:53.219> me<00:00:53.370> fly<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.819> onto

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
jumping mechanics make me fly out onto

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.790 
jumping mechanics make me fly out onto
the<00:00:54.210> candies<00:00:54.569> layer

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.900 

there<00:00:59.800> we<00:01:00.040> go<00:01:00.190> finally

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.000

skeletons<00:01:07.370> they<00:01:08.370> can<00:01:08.520> barely<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:08.940> into<00:01:09.150> their

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
skeletons they can barely get into their

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
of slimer juice then it looks like

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.360 
of slimer juice then it looks like
they're<00:01:15.630> trying<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> grab<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.800> drag<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
platforming segments that go by too

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.190 
platforming segments that go by too
quickly<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:57.330> would<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.570> been<00:01:57.630> nice<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:57.899> they

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
but they're fairly straightforward it

first<00:03:32.370> section<00:03:32.640> we're<00:03:32.970> pretty<00:03:33.150> disorienting

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
first section we're pretty disorienting

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.870 
first section we're pretty disorienting
but<00:03:34.560> then<00:03:34.710> this<00:03:34.830> platforming<00:03:35.400> section<00:03:35.760> is

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
but then this platforming section is

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.650 
but then this platforming section is
basically<00:03:36.330> harmless<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:38.060> like<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.210> use<00:03:39.360> of<00:03:39.420> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
basically harmless I like the use of the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.570 
basically harmless I like the use of the
sideways<00:03:40.110> camera<00:03:40.470> angle<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:41.190> works<00:03:41.400> really

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
sideways camera angle it works really

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.090 
sideways camera angle it works really
well<00:03:41.700> for<00:03:42.030> this<00:03:42.150> section<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:43.560> course<00:03:43.890> it

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
well for this section and of course it

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.860 
well for this section and of course it
turns<00:03:44.310> out<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.580> be<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.700> giant<00:03:45.060> skeleton<00:03:45.750> that

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
turns out to be a giant skeleton that

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.440 
turns out to be a giant skeleton that
pukes<00:03:46.230> out<00:03:46.440> flaming<00:03:46.890> pumpkins<00:03:47.430> what<00:03:48.270> else

pukes out flaming pumpkins what else

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.200 
pukes out flaming pumpkins what else
would<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.750> be<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:50.220> interior<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:50.970> house

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
would it be the interior of this house

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.320 
would it be the interior of this house
feels<00:03:51.540> like<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.840> saturday<00:03:52.080> morning<00:03:52.680> cartoon

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
feels like a saturday morning cartoon

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.610 
feels like a saturday morning cartoon
then<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.480> hit<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.780> switch<00:03:54.990> over<00:03:55.410> on<00:03:55.530> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
then you hit this switch over on the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.220 
then you hit this switch over on the
wall<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.430> books<00:03:56.640> go<00:03:56.880> crazy<00:03:57.300> for<00:03:58.050> some

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
wall and the books go crazy for some

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.660 
wall and the books go crazy for some
reason<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.650> jumping<00:03:59.040> puzzle<00:03:59.340> was<00:03:59.460> really

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
reason this jumping puzzle was really

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.790 
reason this jumping puzzle was really
difficult<00:03:59.850> for<00:04:00.120> me<00:04:00.420> maybe<00:04:01.050> if<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.350> camera<00:04:01.710> was

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
difficult for me maybe if the camera was

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.730 
difficult for me maybe if the camera was
flattened<00:04:02.220> out<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.490> would<00:04:02.610> have<00:04:02.700> been<00:04:02.760> easier

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
flattened out it would have been easier

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
flattened out it would have been easier
then<00:04:05.740> you<00:04:05.860> jump<00:04:06.130> down<00:04:06.220> this<00:04:06.370> hole<00:04:06.610> in<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
then you jump down this hole in the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.940 
then you jump down this hole in the
floor<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.210> enter<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.570> sewers<00:04:07.840> can<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:08.770> guess

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
floor and enter the sewers can you guess

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.390 
floor and enter the sewers can you guess
what's<00:04:09.160> coming<00:04:09.370> up<00:04:09.520> next<00:04:10.380> ghostbusters<00:04:11.400> they
