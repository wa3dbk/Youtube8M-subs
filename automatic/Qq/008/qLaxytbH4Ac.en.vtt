00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
together just all slides together the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.910 
together just all slides together the
most<00:00:35.239> important<00:00:35.660> thing<00:00:35.690> though<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:36.110> this

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
most important thing though is that this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.620 
most important thing though is that this
bottom<00:00:37.310> plate<00:00:37.490> is<00:00:37.610> marked<00:00:37.880> front<00:00:38.150> you<00:00:38.450> can<00:00:38.480> see

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
bottom plate is marked front you can see

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.590 
bottom plate is marked front you can see
right<00:00:38.840> here<00:00:39.200> in<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:40.190> back<00:00:40.340> that's<00:00:41.240> marked

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
right here in the back that's marked

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.190 
right here in the back that's marked
front<00:00:41.900> and<00:00:42.080> that<00:00:42.950> side<00:00:43.490> is<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.690> last<00:00:44.900> piece

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
front and that side is the last piece

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.110 
front and that side is the last piece
that<00:00:45.440> you<00:00:45.560> put<00:00:45.740> in<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:46.790> way<00:00:46.910> the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
that you put in and in the way the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.870 
that you put in and in the way the
reason<00:00:47.360> why<00:00:47.480> is<00:00:47.540> because<00:00:47.690> this<00:00:48.230> little<00:00:48.560> tab<00:00:48.880> of

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
reason why is because this little tab of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.880 
reason why is because this little tab of
the<00:00:49.940> inside<00:00:50.810> piece<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:51.200> sticks<00:00:51.440> out<00:00:51.590> is

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
the inside piece that sticks out is

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.450 
the inside piece that sticks out is
smaller<00:00:52.400> on<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.900> back<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:54.410> that<00:00:54.980> allows<00:00:55.280> you

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
smaller on the back and that allows you

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.160 
smaller on the back and that allows you
to<00:00:55.490> bend<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.910> metal<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.570> get<00:00:56.900> it<00:00:57.020> to

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
to bend the metal and and get it to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.620 
to bend the metal and and get it to
slide<00:00:57.980> together<00:00:58.240> once<00:00:59.240> you<00:00:59.329> have<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.540> all

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
slide together once you have it all

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.660 
slide together once you have it all
together<00:00:59.810> it's<00:01:00.680> not<00:01:00.800> going<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.190> come<00:01:01.310> apart

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
together it's not going to come apart

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.160 
together it's not going to come apart
which<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.120> pretty<00:01:02.329> cool<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.870> other<00:01:02.989> thing

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
which is pretty cool the other thing

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.810 
which is pretty cool the other thing
that's<00:01:03.290> really<00:01:03.380> cool<00:01:03.560> about<00:01:03.739> this<00:01:04.100> is<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:04.460> they

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.809 
it to you could slide these in here and
move<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.689> stove<00:01:44.990> when<00:01:45.289> it's<00:01:45.439> a<00:01:45.530> hot<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.789> you

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
move the stove when it's a hot so you

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.359 
move the stove when it's a hot so you
could<00:01:47.209> pick<00:01:47.749> it<00:01:47.899> up<00:01:48.049> obviously<00:01:49.009> if<00:01:49.100> these<00:01:49.219> are

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
could pick it up obviously if these are

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.469 
could pick it up obviously if these are
in<00:01:49.520> there<00:01:49.670> while<00:01:49.880> you're<00:01:50.029> using<00:01:50.119> it<00:01:50.329> they're

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
in there while you're using it they're

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.929 
in there while you're using it they're
going<00:01:50.569> to<00:01:50.659> be<00:01:50.749> extremely<00:01:51.109> hot<00:01:51.350> too<00:01:51.590> but<00:01:52.459> if<00:01:52.700> you

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
going to be extremely hot too but if you

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.239 
going to be extremely hot too but if you
don't<00:01:53.270> have<00:01:53.420> them<00:01:53.539> in<00:01:53.630> there<00:01:53.840> then<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:55.009> can<00:01:55.159> do

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
don't have them in there then you can do

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:59.410 
don't have them in there then you can do
that<00:01:55.369> now<00:01:55.609> if<00:01:55.759> you're<00:01:55.909> using<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.299> smaller<00:01:58.420> pot

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
that now if you're using a smaller pot

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.589 
that now if you're using a smaller pot
on<00:02:00.349> the<00:02:00.619> top<00:02:00.829> then<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.880> would<00:02:01.999> that's<00:02:02.389> what

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
on the top then you would that's what

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.169 
on the top then you would that's what
these<00:02:02.689> would<00:02:02.869> be<00:02:02.990> used<00:02:03.200> for<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:03.709> you<00:02:04.399> can<00:02:04.549> see

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
these would be used for and you can see

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.839 
these would be used for and you can see
that<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.599> gives<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.049> kind<00:02:06.499> of<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.740> grill<00:02:07.009> top

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
that it gives you a kind of a grill top

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.490 
that it gives you a kind of a grill top
there<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.450> don't<00:02:08.569> know<00:02:08.750> if<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.959> actually<00:02:09.170> want
