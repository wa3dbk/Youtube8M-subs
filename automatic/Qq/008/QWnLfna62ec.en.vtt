00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
not eat enough protein that was my

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.430 
not eat enough protein that was my

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
mistake I just I didn't know i mean it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.700 
mistake I just I didn't know i mean it
is<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.219> had<00:00:56.309> told<00:00:56.520> me<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.090> stuff<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
is if they had told me the right stuff I

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.279 
is if they had told me the right stuff I
would<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.770> done<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> right<00:00:59.840> so<00:01:00.840> what

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
would have done it right so what

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.990 
would have done it right so what
happened<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> didn't<00:01:02.609> know<00:01:02.760> until

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
happened was what I didn't know until

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.240 
happened was what I didn't know until
like<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> ninth<00:01:06.299> month<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.750> guess<00:01:06.979> maybe<00:01:07.979> was

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
like the ninth month I guess maybe was

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.940 
like the ninth month I guess maybe was
the<00:01:08.490> eighth<00:01:08.790> month<00:01:09.290> was<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.799> don't

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the eighth month was that if you don't

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.130 
the eighth month was that if you don't
get<00:01:11.040> enough<00:01:11.159> protein<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> work<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.479> like

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
get enough protein and you work out like

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.580 
get enough protein and you work out like
idea<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> body<00:01:15.150> can't<00:01:15.750> find<00:01:15.810> protein

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
idea that if the body can't find protein

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.130 
idea that if the body can't find protein
actually<00:01:16.920> liquifies<00:01:17.729> your<00:01:17.970> muscle<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.630> eats

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
actually liquifies your muscle and eats

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.270 
actually liquifies your muscle and eats
it<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:20.130> actually<00:01:20.460> eat<00:01:20.580> yourself<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:23.070> should

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it you actually eat yourself that should

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.219 
it you actually eat yourself that should
freak<00:01:23.490> me<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:26.450> definitely<00:01:27.450> notice<00:01:28.049> it

telephone now the rest of me looks and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.899 
telephone now the rest of me looks and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
feels okay but my butt probably because

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.550 
feels okay but my butt probably because
you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.150> i<00:01:39.180> did<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.840> logging<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.350> or

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you know i did that logging in or

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
you know i did that logging in or
walking<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.280> jogging<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.939> place<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.420> all

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
walking and jogging in place and all

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.160 
walking and jogging in place and all
that<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.939> i<00:01:45.270> guess<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.750> bus<00:01:45.960> right

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that and i guess it's a bus right

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.539 
that and i guess it's a bus right
connected<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.770> that's<00:01:47.009> why<00:01:47.130> i've<00:01:47.250> learned<00:01:47.460> it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
connected to that's why i've learned it

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.370 
connected to that's why i've learned it
from<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:47.909> don't<00:01:48.090> know<00:01:48.329> anyway<00:01:49.200> I've

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
