00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
going to twist again and holding it that

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:10.220 
going to twist again and holding it that
way<00:03:59.410> I'm<00:03:59.530> going<00:03:59.710> to<00:03:59.770> cut<00:03:59.920> a<00:03:59.950> little<00:04:00.010> bit<00:04:00.310> more

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.860 

kind<00:04:10.800> of<00:04:10.950> get<00:04:11.100> into<00:04:11.250> how<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.640> want<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.210> and<00:04:12.360> I'm

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
kind of get into how I want it and I'm

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.290 
kind of get into how I want it and I'm
actually<00:04:13.140> going<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.680> leave<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.459> way<00:04:14.610> we

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
actually going to leave it that way we

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.470 
actually going to leave it that way we
that's<00:04:15.720> because<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.290> made<00:04:16.769> those<00:04:17.060> twists<00:04:18.060> twice

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
that's because I made those twists twice

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.710 
that's because I made those twists twice
it<00:04:18.870> actually<00:04:19.380> kind<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.799> frames<00:04:20.340> my<00:04:20.670> face<00:04:20.720> so

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
it actually kind of frames my face so

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.530 
it actually kind of frames my face so
these<00:04:21.870> outer<00:04:22.109> bangs<00:04:22.500> are<00:04:22.860> little<00:04:23.310> longer<00:04:23.760> than

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
these outer bangs are little longer than

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.140 
these outer bangs are little longer than
the<00:04:25.170> ones<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.830> middle<00:04:25.980> so<00:04:26.730> that's<00:04:26.910> why<00:04:27.090> I

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
the ones in the middle so that's why I

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.210 
the ones in the middle so that's why I
really<00:04:27.660> like<00:04:28.020> this<00:04:28.080> method<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.710> it's<00:04:28.860> super
