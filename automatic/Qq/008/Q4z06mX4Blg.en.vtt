thing you do is you pull this lever and
up<00:00:39.090> comes<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:40.500> bridge<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> works

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
up comes your bridge now this works

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.440 
up comes your bridge now this works
really<00:00:41.879> nicely<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.329> castle<00:00:45.329> with

fall<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.640> right<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.780> water

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
fall in right here I have a water

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.200 
fall in right here I have a water
version<00:01:04.890> where<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.430> can't<00:01:05.640> even<00:01:05.700> tell<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
there's any kind of secret bridge here

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.539 
there's any kind of secret bridge here
then<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.150> pull<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.450> lever<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.830> comes<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
third bridge blends in nicely nobody can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.160 
third bridge blends in nicely nobody can
tell<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.630> hide<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> lever

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
tell it's there you can hide the lever

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.899 
tell it's there you can hide the lever
and<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:17.009> your<00:01:17.159> own<00:01:17.189> secret<00:01:17.520> bridge

across the water alright now to make
this<00:01:21.570> bridge<00:01:21.810> you're<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.080> need<00:01:22.290> sticky

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this bridge you're gonna need sticky

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.050 
this bridge you're gonna need sticky
pistons<00:01:23.369> redstone<00:01:24.470> repeaters<00:01:25.850> redstone<00:01:26.850> for

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
pistons redstone repeaters redstone for

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.289 
pistons redstone repeaters redstone for
the<00:01:27.150> wiring<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:28.100> lever<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.460> block<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.210> your

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
exact same thing with the repeaters and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:37.300 
exact same thing with the repeaters and
the<00:02:24.049> restaurant<00:02:24.560> place<00:02:24.799> directly<00:02:25.340> behind<00:02:36.310> and

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
going to put a redstone repeater right

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.640 
going to put a redstone repeater right
here<00:02:50.329> just<00:02:50.569> in<00:02:50.690> case<00:02:50.720> it's<00:02:50.989> not<00:02:51.230> long<00:02:51.440> enough

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
here just in case it's not long enough

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.069 
here just in case it's not long enough
it'll<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.430> able<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.670> get<00:02:52.790> all<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:54.049> other

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
it'll be able to get all of the other

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.800 
it'll be able to get all of the other
repeaters<00:02:54.739> on<00:02:54.889> the<00:02:55.010> other<00:02:55.129> side<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.810> then

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
repeaters on the other side and then

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.190 
repeaters on the other side and then
you're<00:02:56.930> gonna<00:02:57.019> want<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.260> come<00:02:57.440> over<00:02:57.590> here<00:02:58.060> and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
you're gonna want to come over here and

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.660 
you're gonna want to come over here and
move<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.970> up<00:03:01.970> through<00:03:02.480> here<00:03:02.750> go<00:03:03.560> out<00:03:03.829> to<00:03:04.340> away

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.149 
move this up through here go out to away
and<00:03:05.480> just<00:03:06.019> place<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.230> like<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.650> I'm<00:03:06.980> gonna

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
and just place it like that I'm gonna

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.680 
and just place it like that I'm gonna
break<00:03:07.519> it<00:03:07.549> right<00:03:07.760> here<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.269> know<00:03:08.359> where<00:03:08.599> to

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
break it right here so I know where to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.809 
break it right here so I know where to
put<00:03:08.810> my<00:03:08.959> library<00:03:09.349> on<00:03:09.829> the<00:03:10.129> outside<00:03:12.669> so<00:03:13.669> we're

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
put my library on the outside so we're

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.460 
put my library on the outside so we're
basically<00:03:13.940> almost<00:03:14.599> done<00:03:14.810> all<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.109> have<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.319> do

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
basically almost done all you have to do

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.920 
basically almost done all you have to do
just<00:03:15.709> place<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.639> block<00:03:16.879> of<00:03:17.060> your<00:03:17.150> choice<00:03:17.209> over

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
just place the block of your choice over

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.869 
just place the block of your choice over
the<00:03:18.049> sticky<00:03:18.349> pistons<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.919> cover<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.459> up<00:03:19.609> and

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
the sticky pistons to cover it up and

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.119 
the sticky pistons to cover it up and
this<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.120> what<00:03:20.389> your<00:03:20.510> bridge<00:03:20.720> will<00:03:20.900> be<00:03:21.129> coming

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
this is what your bridge will be coming

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.220 
this is what your bridge will be coming
up<00:03:22.250> out<00:03:22.459> of<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:23.180> water<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:24.699> place<00:03:25.699> a<00:03:26.230> lever

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
up out of the water and place a lever

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.250 
up out of the water and place a lever
directly<00:03:28.160> on<00:03:28.310> top<00:03:28.519> of<00:03:28.699> your<00:03:28.849> redstone<00:03:29.260> pull

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
directly on top of your redstone pull

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.860 
directly on top of your redstone pull
the<00:03:30.440> library<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:31.099> you<00:03:31.190> have<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.430> bridge<00:03:31.879> that

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
the library and you have a bridge that

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.760 
the library and you have a bridge that
works<00:03:33.079> perfect

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
works perfect

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.000 
works perfect

we got creative Mon now you can have an
unlimited<00:03:38.310> block<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:39.060> unlimited<00:03:39.960> bucket<00:03:40.380> of

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
unlimited block of unlimited bucket of

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.770 
unlimited block of unlimited bucket of
water<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.100> is<00:03:41.880> really<00:03:42.060> easy<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.450> fill<00:03:42.630> in
