it<00:04:34.479> so<00:04:34.509> I<00:04:34.659> have<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> little<00:04:35.259> bit<00:04:35.440> more<00:04:35.590> options

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
it so I have a little bit more options

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.070 
it so I have a little bit more options

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
Cola machine as I said before I don't

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.050 
Cola machine as I said before I don't
have<00:04:53.289> enough<00:04:53.500> points<00:04:54.250> for<00:04:54.639> it<00:04:54.759> so<00:04:54.909> I'm<00:04:54.970> gonna

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
have enough points for it so I'm gonna

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.969 
have enough points for it so I'm gonna
have<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.360> kill<00:04:55.539> some<00:04:55.750> zombies<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.289> come<00:04:56.470> back

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
I've cut that out so you don't have to

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.870 
I've cut that out so you don't have to
spend<00:04:59.349> any<00:04:59.620> more<00:04:59.800> time<00:04:59.860> watching<00:05:00.340> me<00:05:00.669> kill

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
spend any more time watching me kill

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
spend any more time watching me kill
some<00:05:01.090> bees<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.539> I'm<00:05:01.930> running<00:05:02.259> that<00:05:02.409> same<00:05:02.740> path

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
some bees and I'm running that same path

the<00:05:04.900> speed<00:05:05.199> Cola<00:05:05.500> perk<00:05:05.830> works<00:05:06.070> just<00:05:06.400> like<00:05:06.490> the

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
the speed Cola perk works just like the

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.370 
the speed Cola perk works just like the
sleight-of-hand<00:05:07.030> perk<00:05:07.599> does<00:05:07.870> in<00:05:08.020> multiplayer

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
sleight-of-hand perk does in multiplayer

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.680 
sleight-of-hand perk does in multiplayer
mode<00:05:08.620> it<00:05:09.490> makes<00:05:09.759> it<00:05:09.940> so<00:05:10.060> that<00:05:10.090> your<00:05:10.270> reload

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
mode it makes it so that your reload

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.060 
mode it makes it so that your reload
takes<00:05:10.990> less<00:05:11.229> than<00:05:11.440> half<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.650> time

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
takes less than half the time

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.540 
takes less than half the time
one<00:05:13.000> perk<00:05:13.300> I<00:05:13.480> like<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:13.900> use<00:05:14.110> alongside<00:05:14.550> speed

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
one perk I like to use alongside speed

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.390 
one perk I like to use alongside speed
Cola<00:05:15.940> is<00:05:16.270> double<00:05:16.750> tap<00:05:16.930> which<00:05:17.590> otherwise<00:05:18.160> I

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
Cola is double tap which otherwise I

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.310 
Cola is double tap which otherwise I
would<00:05:18.550> never<00:05:18.730> use<00:05:19.150> double<00:05:19.540> tap<00:05:19.750> because<00:05:20.110> it

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
would never use double tap because it

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.230 
would never use double tap because it
goes<00:05:20.470> through<00:05:20.500> your<00:05:20.800> ammo<00:05:21.190> so<00:05:21.400> fast<00:05:21.730> but<00:05:22.120> at

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
goes through your ammo so fast but at

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.450 
goes through your ammo so fast but at
least<00:05:22.390> with<00:05:22.660> speed<00:05:22.960> Cola<00:05:23.290> you<00:05:23.830> can<00:05:24.040> reload

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
least with speed Cola you can reload

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.650 
least with speed Cola you can reload
twice<00:05:24.790> as<00:05:24.970> fast
