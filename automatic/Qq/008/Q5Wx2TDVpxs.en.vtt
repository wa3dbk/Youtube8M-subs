hey<00:00:00.659> guys<00:00:00.900> reading<00:00:01.290> here<00:00:01.560> with<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:02.040> tutorial

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hey guys reading here with a tutorial

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.990 
hey guys reading here with a tutorial
I've<00:00:03.179> been<00:00:03.720> passing<00:00:04.680> basically<00:00:05.339> like<00:00:05.549> I've

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
I've been passing basically like I've

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.909 
I've been passing basically like I've
just<00:00:06.299> never<00:00:06.509> done<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.500> should<00:00:07.830> have

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
just never done it and I should have

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.320 
just never done it and I should have
done<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.220> earlier<00:00:08.309> but<00:00:08.700> now<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.210> I've

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
done it earlier but now that I've

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.600 
done it earlier but now that I've
started<00:00:09.599> using<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.230> more<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.950> figured<00:00:11.490> out

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
started using this more I figured out

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.200 
started using this more I figured out
teach<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.030> guys<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.530> 5<00:00:14.040> clock<00:00:14.549> or<00:00:14.820> I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
teach you guys it is a 5 clock or I

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.430 
teach you guys it is a 5 clock or I
think<00:00:15.509> that's<00:00:15.660> what<00:00:15.809> they<00:00:15.900> call<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.230> five

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
think that's what they call it a five

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
think that's what they call it a five
o'clock<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.150> basically<00:00:18.150> what<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.420> does<00:00:18.539> this

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
o'clock and basically what it does this

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.630 
o'clock and basically what it does this
is<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.170> loop<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.560> power<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:19.980> keeps<00:00:20.310> going

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
is the loop of power that keeps going

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640 
is the loop of power that keeps going
around<00:00:20.760> like<00:00:21.150> taking<00:00:21.570> turns<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.170> basically

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
around like taking turns so basically

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.630 
around like taking turns so basically
this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.310> how<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.609> make<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:25.019> make<00:00:25.050> it

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
this is how you make it you can make it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.509 
this is how you make it you can make it
more<00:00:26.640> than<00:00:26.849> five<00:00:27.180> but<00:00:27.660> everyone<00:00:28.320> does<00:00:28.470> five<00:00:28.769> so

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
more than five but everyone does five so

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.880 
more than five but everyone does five so
firstly<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.480> three<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.289> how<00:00:31.439> i<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.650> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
firstly you do three this is how i do it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.670 
firstly you do three this is how i do it
like<00:00:31.920> because<00:00:32.430> i<00:00:32.460> think<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.910> easier<00:00:33.530> you<00:00:34.530> do

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
like because i think it's easier you do

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.880 
like because i think it's easier you do
your<00:00:34.890> three<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.020> coming<00:00:37.290> off<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.649> one

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
your three and then coming off this one

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.389 
your three and then coming off this one
you<00:00:38.100> put<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.700> way<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> have

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
you put one that way and that you have

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.889 
you put one that way and that you have
to<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.270> we'll<00:00:42.570> put<00:00:43.640> em<00:00:44.640> yeah<00:00:45.300> we'll<00:00:45.570> put<00:00:45.690> one

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
to so we'll put em yeah we'll put one

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.340 
to so we'll put em yeah we'll put one
here<00:00:46.250> that<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.489> totally<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> wrong<00:00:48.360> thing<00:00:48.629> one

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
here that is totally the wrong thing one

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.110 
here that is totally the wrong thing one
there<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.000> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
there and one there because you have to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.799 
there and one there because you have to
leave<00:00:51.270> two<00:00:51.449> gaps<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:53.449> you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
leave two gaps so that you can put a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.790 
leave two gaps so that you can put a
redstone<00:00:54.989> torch<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.739> redstone<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> way

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
redstone torch and redstone in the way

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
redstone torch and redstone in the way
but<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.820> your<00:00:59.850> redstone<00:01:00.480> going

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
but now you have your redstone going

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.640 
but now you have your redstone going
into<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:02.120> whoa<00:01:03.120> totally<00:01:03.930> did<00:01:04.290> something

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
into that whoa totally did something

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.350 
into that whoa totally did something
wrong<00:01:05.060> but<00:01:06.060> um<00:01:06.240> every<00:01:07.080> redstone<00:01:07.470> here

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
wrong but um every redstone here

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.750 
wrong but um every redstone here
tortilla<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.010> need<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.280> actually<00:01:11.430> make

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
tortilla and we need to actually make

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
tortilla and we need to actually make
that<00:01:11.909> hit<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.330> there's<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.380> ton<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> ways<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that hit that there's a ton of ways to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.760 
that hit that there's a ton of ways to
do<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.400> yeah<00:01:15.049> that's<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.560> you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
do this but yeah that's all of this you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.270 
do this but yeah that's all of this you
see<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.100> power<00:01:17.400> goes<00:01:17.610> around<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> circle

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
see how the power goes around the circle

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.999 
see how the power goes around the circle
so<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.450> reason<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.020> need<00:01:22.200> five<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so the the reason you need five is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
so the the reason you need five is
because<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.580> an<00:01:23.700> odd<00:01:23.820> number<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.210> can't<00:01:24.420> do

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
because it's an odd number you can't do

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.080 
because it's an odd number you can't do
with<00:01:24.750> fall<00:01:25.049> because<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:26.340> won't<00:01:26.610> work<00:01:26.820> because

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
with fall because it won't work because

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.569 
with fall because it won't work because
it's<00:01:27.360> an<00:01:27.479> even<00:01:27.780> number<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.890> could<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.310> do

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
it's an even number so you could also do

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.210 
it's an even number so you could also do
this<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.030> seven<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.020> nine<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.799> other

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
this as like seven and nine and other

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.780 
this as like seven and nine and other
random<00:01:32.670> numbers<00:01:33.060> at<00:01:33.360> random<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.640> but<00:01:35.640> anyway

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
random numbers at random so but anyway

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.819 
random numbers at random so but anyway
um<00:01:36.180> I'll<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:37.049> show<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.350> how<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
um I'll just show you how to make it a

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980 
um I'll just show you how to make it a
bit<00:01:37.950> bigger<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.600> chuck

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
bit bigger like you can just chuck

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.330 
bit bigger like you can just chuck
things<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.500> wherever<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.979> want<00:01:41.130> really

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
things like wherever you want really

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.200 
things like wherever you want really
it's<00:01:41.610> not<00:01:41.820> necessary<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.320> circle<00:01:44.210> you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it's not necessary to be in a circle you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
it's not necessary to be in a circle you
could<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:46.439> right<00:01:48.229> like<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
could have like all right like that and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.609 
could have like all right like that and
it<00:01:50.250> would<00:01:50.369> still<00:01:50.610> work<00:01:50.909> good<00:01:51.659> hopefully<00:01:52.200> wait

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it would still work good hopefully wait

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.940 
it would still work good hopefully wait
how<00:01:52.770> many<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:53.159> got<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:54.079> see<00:01:55.079> now<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.530> six

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
how many we got here see now we have six

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.889 
how many we got here see now we have six
which<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.159> an<00:01:56.520> even<00:01:56.790> number<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.420> won't

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
which is an even number so that won't

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.859 
which is an even number so that won't
really<00:01:58.079> work<00:01:58.490> but<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.880> chuck<00:02:00.180> another<00:02:00.630> one

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
really work but if we chuck another one

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.990 
really work but if we chuck another one
here<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:03.649> then<00:02:04.649> another<00:02:05.390> one<00:02:06.390> here<00:02:07.819> BAM<00:02:08.819> it

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
here and then another one here BAM it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.520 
here and then another one here BAM it
works<00:02:09.209> again<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:09.959> seven<00:02:10.349> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
works again because it's seven and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.030 
works again because it's seven and
that's<00:02:10.649> an<00:02:10.860> odd<00:02:10.979> number<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that's an odd number so the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.600 
that's an odd number so the
one<00:02:13.129> of<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.640> really<00:02:13.939> to<00:02:15.129> create<00:02:16.129> delays

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
one of this is really to create delays

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.780 
one of this is really to create delays
between<00:02:17.359> your<00:02:17.780> pulses<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.439> um<00:02:18.829> all<00:02:19.430> right<00:02:19.459> you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
between your pulses and um all right you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.520 
between your pulses and um all right you
can<00:02:19.819> have<00:02:19.939> your<00:02:20.209> pulse<00:02:20.480> coming<00:02:20.840> off<00:02:21.049> here<00:02:21.290> if

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
can have your pulse coming off here if

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.220 
can have your pulse coming off here if
it's<00:02:21.799> too<00:02:22.040> long<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.659> you<00:02:23.659> can't<00:02:23.870> have<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.049> here

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
it's too long I you can't have it here

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.709 
it's too long I you can't have it here
because<00:02:24.409> see<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.769> stops<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.340> circuit<00:02:25.760> but

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:26.719 
because see it stops the circuit but

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.649 
because see it stops the circuit but
what<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:26.959> do<00:02:27.260> say<00:02:27.709> if<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.519> want<00:02:28.969> to<00:02:29.120> have<00:02:29.480> it

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
what you do say if you want to have it

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.179 
what you do say if you want to have it
connected<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.170> redstone<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.709> find<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.040> bit

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
connected to redstone you find a bit

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.770 
connected to redstone you find a bit
that's<00:02:31.370> too<00:02:31.579> long<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.030> could<00:02:32.269> have<00:02:32.359> it<00:02:32.420> there

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
that's too long so I could have it there

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.690 
that's too long so I could have it there
or<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.560> couldn't<00:02:33.859> really<00:02:33.980> have<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.340> off<00:02:34.459> there

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
or I couldn't really have it off there

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.849 
or I couldn't really have it off there
but<00:02:34.909> i<00:02:35.120> want<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.049> show<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.379> i<00:02:36.590> can't

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
but i want to show you that i can't

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.640 
but i want to show you that i can't
there's<00:02:37.069> like<00:02:37.220> no<00:02:37.370> good<00:02:37.640> bits<00:02:37.879> I<00:02:38.659> here<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:39.560> go

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
there's like no good bits I here we go

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.750 
there's like no good bits I here we go
i'll<00:02:39.769> show<00:02:39.889> you<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.129> this<00:02:42.159> see<00:02:43.159> this<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.549> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
i'll show you like this see this is the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.520 
i'll show you like this see this is the
circuit<00:02:44.030> still<00:02:44.540> guy<00:02:44.689> you<00:02:45.049> could<00:02:45.170> have<00:02:45.319> your

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
circuit still guy you could have your

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.500 
circuit still guy you could have your
redstone<00:02:45.859> off<00:02:46.129> here<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.549> have<00:02:46.700> like<00:02:46.939> a<00:02:47.209> torch

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
redstone off here and have like a torch

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.039 
redstone off here and have like a torch
or<00:02:47.750> something<00:02:48.519> torch<00:02:49.519> on<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.700> block<00:02:51.129> now<00:02:52.129> flash

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
or something torch on a block now flash

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.349 
or something torch on a block now flash
but<00:02:54.049> that's<00:02:54.439> really<00:02:54.769> unnecessary<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:56.060> do<00:02:56.209> all

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
but that's really unnecessary to do all

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.960 
but that's really unnecessary to do all
that<00:02:56.389> just<00:02:56.629> to<00:02:56.959> get<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.409> flash<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.819> can

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
that just to get it to flash so you can

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.129 
that just to get it to flash so you can
also<00:02:59.209> take<00:02:59.840> input<00:03:00.319> from<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.620> blocks<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.329> there

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
also take input from the blocks so there

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.170 
also take input from the blocks so there
is<00:03:03.260> two<00:03:03.500> sides<00:03:03.769> bear<00:03:04.189> on<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.549> so<00:03:04.700> i<00:03:04.790> can<00:03:04.819> put

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
is two sides bear on this so i can put

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.869 
is two sides bear on this so i can put
another<00:03:05.419> torch<00:03:05.750> on<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.079> side<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.639> have<00:03:07.639> my

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
another torch on this side and have my

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.589 
another torch on this side and have my
power<00:03:08.239> coming<00:03:08.510> off<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.870> here<00:03:10.120> now<00:03:11.120> say<00:03:11.569> that

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
power coming off it here now say that

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.619 
power coming off it here now say that
isn't<00:03:12.200> enough<00:03:12.349> delay<00:03:12.950> for<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:14.269> say<00:03:14.569> you

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
isn't enough delay for you you say you

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:23.259 
isn't enough delay for you you say you
want<00:03:14.989> one<00:03:15.290> off<00:03:15.439> each<00:03:15.680> one<00:03:15.889> of<00:03:15.919> these<00:03:20.109> and<00:03:22.269> that

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
want one off each one of these and that

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.180 
want one off each one of these and that
isn't<00:03:23.599> enough<00:03:23.840> delay<00:03:24.319> between<00:03:24.530> those<00:03:24.889> two

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
isn't enough delay between those two

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.180 
isn't enough delay between those two
switching<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:27.290> can<00:03:27.530> add<00:03:28.900> invert<00:03:30.190> inverters

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
switching you can add invert inverters

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.210 
switching you can add invert inverters
and<00:03:31.220> repeaters<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.799> depends<00:03:33.799> how<00:03:33.859> long<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.159> is

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
and repeaters I depends how long it is

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.129 
and repeaters I depends how long it is
if<00:03:34.459> you're<00:03:34.639> gonna<00:03:34.729> if<00:03:35.030> it's<00:03:35.299> too<00:03:35.569> long<00:03:35.780> you

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
if you're gonna if it's too long you

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:43.030 
if you're gonna if it's too long you
would<00:03:36.290> add<00:03:37.359> two<00:03:38.359> inverters<00:03:39.489> ah<00:03:41.829> yeah<00:03:42.829> two

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
would add two inverters ah yeah two

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.069 
would add two inverters ah yeah two
inverters<00:03:43.400> that's<00:03:43.790> what<00:03:43.909> the<00:03:44.000> code<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:44.449> i<00:03:44.479> went

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
inverters that's what the code so i went

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.990 
inverters that's what the code so i went
back<00:03:45.169> for<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.560> second<00:03:45.889> there<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:46.280> these<00:03:46.790> two

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
back for a second there and these two

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.689 
back for a second there and these two
inverters<00:03:47.329> would<00:03:47.599> make<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:48.430> bigger<00:03:49.430> gap

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
inverters would make a bigger gap

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.659 
inverters would make a bigger gap
between<00:03:50.120> these<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:50.870> mess<00:03:51.260> with<00:03:51.470> it<00:03:51.530> but<00:03:52.340> say

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
between these and mess with it but say

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.270 
between these and mess with it but say
you<00:03:52.729> only<00:03:53.030> wanted<00:03:53.479> a<00:03:53.650> smaller<00:03:54.650> gap<00:03:54.949> you<00:03:55.159> would

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
you only wanted a smaller gap you would

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.210 
you only wanted a smaller gap you would
put<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.489> repeater<00:03:55.879> which<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:57.650> guys<00:03:57.859> know<00:03:58.129> how

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
put a repeater which you guys know how

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.429 
put a repeater which you guys know how
to<00:03:58.250> make<00:03:58.519> by<00:03:58.699> now<00:03:58.879> for<00:03:59.090> my<00:03:59.209> tutorials<00:03:59.750> if<00:04:00.079> not

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
to make by now for my tutorials if not

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.270 
to make by now for my tutorials if not
here<00:04:01.189> it<00:04:01.220> is<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.879> is<00:04:02.449> basically<00:04:03.049> this<00:04:03.379> and<00:04:03.799> this

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
here it is it is basically this and this

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.460 
here it is it is basically this and this
is<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:04.430> repeater<00:04:04.819> and<00:04:06.010> see<00:04:07.010> if<00:04:07.819> we<00:04:08.290> break<00:04:09.290> this

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
is a repeater and see if we break this

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:18.069 
is a repeater and see if we break this
one<00:04:09.709> off<00:04:10.549> again<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:14.030> repeater<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:17.079> can't

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
one off again the repeater I can't

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.360 
one off again the repeater I can't
really<00:04:18.289> explain<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.739> ah<00:04:19.930> if<00:04:20.930> you<00:04:21.049> put<00:04:21.260> one<00:04:21.370> here

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
really explain it ah if you put one here

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.830 
really explain it ah if you put one here
we'll<00:04:22.550> do<00:04:22.669> it<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:22.880> way<00:04:23.060> if<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:23.570> put<00:04:23.779> an

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
we'll do it this way if you put an

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.800 
we'll do it this way if you put an
inverter<00:04:24.169> here

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
inverter here

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.110 
inverter here
you<00:04:26.770> can't<00:04:27.010> put<00:04:27.220> an<00:04:27.310> invert<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.610> because

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
you can't put an invert that because

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.990 
you can't put an invert that because
like<00:04:28.450> see<00:04:28.750> now<00:04:28.900> they're<00:04:29.110> flashing<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.590> same

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
like see now they're flashing the same

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.670 
like see now they're flashing the same
but<00:04:31.000> they're<00:04:31.150> on<00:04:31.300> different<00:04:31.510> streams<00:04:32.380> of

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
but they're on different streams of

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.780 
but they're on different streams of
power<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.860> it's<00:04:35.860> all<00:04:36.100> just<00:04:36.340> like<00:04:36.550> if<00:04:36.760> you

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
power it's it's all just like if you

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.090 
power it's it's all just like if you
need<00:04:37.090> pulses<00:04:37.660> basically<00:04:38.230> it's<00:04:38.380> not<00:04:38.950> a

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
need pulses basically it's not a

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.310 
need pulses basically it's not a
fastball<00:04:39.700> so<00:04:40.000> so<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.300> have<00:04:40.450> your<00:04:40.480> slow<00:04:40.810> pulses

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
fastball so so you have your slow pulses

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.280 
fastball so so you have your slow pulses
this<00:04:42.010> is<00:04:42.220> how<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.460> make<00:04:42.669> songs<00:04:43.290> rapid-fire

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
this is how you make songs rapid-fire

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.520 
this is how you make songs rapid-fire
shooters<00:04:45.270> this<00:04:46.270> just<00:04:46.630> can<00:04:46.840> be<00:04:46.960> used<00:04:47.139> with<00:04:47.230> so

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
shooters this just can be used with so

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.190 
shooters this just can be used with so
much<00:04:47.740> just<00:04:48.270> use<00:04:49.270> your<00:04:49.450> imagination<00:04:49.480> would

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
much just use your imagination would

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.140 
much just use your imagination would
like<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.560> red<00:04:50.680> star<00:04:50.889> like<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.820> could<00:04:52.000> have

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
like the red star like I could have

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.400 
like the red star like I could have
freaking<00:04:52.690> a<00:04:52.960> note<00:04:53.260> box<00:04:53.530> here<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.960> it's<00:04:55.960> all

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
freaking a note box here and it's all

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.909 
freaking a note box here and it's all
really<00:04:56.680> just<00:04:56.830> repeaters<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:58.650> inverters<00:04:59.650> but

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
really just repeaters and inverters but

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.760 
really just repeaters and inverters but
yeah<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:01.330> now<00:05:01.479> you<00:05:01.540> got<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.810> note<00:05:02.080> plane<00:05:02.380> but<00:05:02.650> you

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
yeah so now you got a note plane but you

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.080 
yeah so now you got a note plane but you
can't<00:05:02.979> hear<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.220> because<00:05:03.430> I'm<00:05:03.820> not<00:05:03.910> recording

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
can't hear it because I'm not recording

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.950 
can't hear it because I'm not recording
sound<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.229> yeah<00:05:05.820> or<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:07.060> can<00:05:07.210> also<00:05:07.360> turn<00:05:07.900> it

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
sound and yeah or you can also turn it

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.460 
sound and yeah or you can also turn it
off<00:05:08.200> by<00:05:08.710> adding<00:05:10.020> getting<00:05:11.020> one<00:05:11.200> of<00:05:11.229> the

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
off by adding getting one of the

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.260 
off by adding getting one of the
circuits<00:05:11.919> I<00:05:12.160> think<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.490> actually<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:12.850> don't

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
circuits I think you actually I don't

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.520 
circuits I think you actually I don't
know<00:05:13.330> if<00:05:13.389> you<00:05:13.479> have<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.810> do<00:05:13.960> it<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.229> circle

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
know if you have to do it to the circle

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.340 
know if you have to do it to the circle
will<00:05:14.620> see<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:16.270> put<00:05:16.540> in<00:05:16.660> a<00:05:16.750> switch<00:05:16.960> here<00:05:17.139> and

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
will see and put in a switch here and

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.230 
will see and put in a switch here and
then<00:05:17.740> turning<00:05:18.010> it<00:05:18.220> on<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:18.520> they'll<00:05:18.820> stop<00:05:19.120> the

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
then turning it on and they'll stop the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.990 
then turning it on and they'll stop the
circuit<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:19.950> then<00:05:20.950> when<00:05:21.100> you<00:05:21.190> turn<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.400> off<00:05:21.639> it

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
circuit and then when you turn it off it

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.530 
circuit and then when you turn it off it
will<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.690> circle<00:05:22.900> will<00:05:23.110> still<00:05:23.350> work<00:05:23.470> fine<00:05:24.540> so

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
will the circle will still work fine so

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.740 
will the circle will still work fine so
yeah<00:05:25.720> um<00:05:25.960> in<00:05:26.350> my<00:05:26.410> other<00:05:26.680> video<00:05:26.919> i<00:05:27.100> put<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.700> RS<00:05:28.540> nor

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
yeah um in my other video i put a RS nor

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.120 
yeah um in my other video i put a RS nor
latch<00:05:28.810> there<00:05:29.290> because<00:05:29.560> i<00:05:29.710> thought<00:05:29.860> it<00:05:30.039> would

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
latch there because i thought it would

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.180 
latch there because i thought it would
be<00:05:30.310> needed<00:05:30.669> but<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.300> isn't<00:05:31.780> really<00:05:32.140> so<00:05:33.039> yeah

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
be needed but it isn't really so yeah

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.340 
be needed but it isn't really so yeah
this<00:05:33.550> is<00:05:33.760> really<00:05:33.910> it<00:05:34.120> it's<00:05:34.360> not<00:05:34.960> much<00:05:35.169> of<00:05:35.200> a

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
this is really it it's not much of a

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.469 
this is really it it's not much of a
tutorial<00:05:35.770> it's<00:05:36.100> more<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.550> just<00:05:37.120> play<00:05:37.330> around

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
tutorial it's more of a just play around

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.960 
tutorial it's more of a just play around
with<00:05:37.840> this<00:05:37.930> kind<00:05:38.260> of<00:05:38.350> thing<00:05:38.530> but<00:05:38.740> yeah<00:05:38.970> thanks

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
with this kind of thing but yeah thanks

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.450 
with this kind of thing but yeah thanks
for<00:05:40.060> watching<00:05:40.270> bye
