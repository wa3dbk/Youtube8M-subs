00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
part of the gadget probably four million

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.840 
part of the gadget probably four million
and<00:01:01.969> I<00:01:02.969> loosen<00:01:03.449> these<00:01:03.660> screws<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and I loosen these screws here and I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.690 
and I loosen these screws here and I
slide<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.600> slide<00:01:07.140> them<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> pattern

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
slide it up slide them up to the pattern

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300 
slide it up slide them up to the pattern
that<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.090> thing<00:01:09.360> makes<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.710> creates<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that this thing makes and it creates the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
that this thing makes and it creates the
person's<00:01:11.729> head<00:01:11.939> around<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> can

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
person's head around here so that I can

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.640 
person's head around here so that I can
put<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.100> exact<00:01:14.549> head<00:01:14.850> safe<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.420> head

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
put your exact head safe in your head

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.460 
put your exact head safe in your head
with<00:01:16.650> these<00:01:16.950> two<00:01:17.250> implements<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.229> I<00:01:19.229> will

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
with these two implements and I will

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:30.380 
with these two implements and I will
show<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.740> how<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> works<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:27.020> I<00:01:29.240> had<00:01:30.240> I'm

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
show you how it works here I had I'm

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.870 
show you how it works here I had I'm
about<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.869> make<00:01:31.020> turn<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.409> seat<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:32.729> see

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.319 
about to make turn your seat you see
those<00:01:33.060> needle<00:01:33.450> marks<00:01:33.829> yeah<00:01:34.829> okay<00:01:35.759> when<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.060> cut

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
those needle marks yeah okay when I cut

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.929 
those needle marks yeah okay when I cut
this<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.750> along<00:01:37.200> those<00:01:37.470> marks<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.070> use<00:01:38.759> this

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
this out along those marks and use this

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.859 
this out along those marks and use this
pattern<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:40.290> take<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.920> pattern<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.869> put

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
pattern I can take this pattern and put

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.039 
pattern I can take this pattern and put
it<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.890> four<00:01:44.100> million<00:01:44.869> slide<00:01:45.869> these

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it in the four million slide these

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.319 
it in the four million slide these
notches<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.700> will<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
notches up to it and I will have the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.929 
notches up to it and I will have the
man's<00:01:48.540> exact<00:01:49.140> head<00:01:49.439> shape<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.790> when<00:01:50.909> I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
man's exact head shape so that when I

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.460 
man's exact head shape so that when I
make<00:01:51.030> his<00:01:51.360> hat<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.750> should<00:01:51.960> fit<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.439> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
make his hat it should fit in like a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.190 
make his hat it should fit in like a
glove<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> that's<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:54.810> these<00:01:54.930> two<00:01:54.990> things

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
glove so that's what these two things

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620 
glove so that's what these two things
are<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.770> most<00:01:56.340> people<00:01:56.670> don't<00:01:56.850> even<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.450> they

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
are for most people don't even know they

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.469 
are for most people don't even know they
exist<00:01:57.890> as<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.950> matter<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> fact<00:01:59.670> most<00:01:59.850> hatch

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
exist as a matter of fact most hatch

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.230 
exist as a matter of fact most hatch
does<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:01.890> exist<00:02:02.369> they've<00:02:03.030> never

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
does not know they exist they've never

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.990 
does not know they exist they've never
even<00:02:03.329> seen<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:04.130> but<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.310> are<00:02:05.460> around<00:02:05.759> here

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
even seen one but they are around here

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.690 
even seen one but they are around here
there's<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:06.930> here<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.320> there<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:08.190> happen

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
there's one here and there I just happen

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.280 
there's one here and there I just happen
to<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.879> lucky<00:02:09.000> enough<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.479> have

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
to be lucky enough to have

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.890 
to be lucky enough to have
and<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.520> use<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.150> make<00:02:12.300> all<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.510> my<00:02:12.630> hats
