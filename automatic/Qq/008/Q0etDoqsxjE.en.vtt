00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
then to finish off the visuals is to
respray<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> car<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> best<00:01:42.689> series<00:01:43.020> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
respray the car and the best series of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.100 
respray the car and the best series of
colors<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.860> represent<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.640> amazing<00:01:45.450> gray<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
colors to represent that amazing gray is

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.889 
colors to represent that amazing gray is
a<00:01:46.140> dark<00:01:46.680> steel<00:01:47.070> metallic<00:01:47.640> primary<00:01:48.210> color<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
a dark steel metallic primary color and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600 
a dark steel metallic primary color and
a<00:01:48.990> metallic<00:01:49.259> black<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> secondary<00:01:50.369> color

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
a metallic black for the secondary color

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.370 
a metallic black for the secondary color
which<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.939> applied<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> racing<00:01:52.020> stripes

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
which is applied to the racing stripes

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.679 
which is applied to the racing stripes
then<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.460> really<00:01:53.670> enhance<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.210> metallic

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
then to really enhance that metallic

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.020 
then to really enhance that metallic
color<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.200> give<00:01:55.350> some<00:01:55.560> depth<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> gray<00:01:56.490> we

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
color and give some depth to the gray we

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.550 
color and give some depth to the gray we
can<00:01:57.180> also<00:01:57.299> add<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> pearlescent<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
can also add a pearlescent to the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.190 
can also add a pearlescent to the
primary<00:01:59.009> color<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.790> choose<00:02:00.090> ice<00:02:00.420> white<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.079> add

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
primary color so choose ice white to add

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.740 
primary color so choose ice white to add
some<00:02:01.409> really<00:02:01.619> crisp<00:02:01.950> highlights<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:03.450> dark

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
some really crisp highlights this dark

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.539 
some really crisp highlights this dark
steel<00:02:04.049> color<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> white<00:02:04.890> pearl<00:02:05.280> looks

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
steel color with the white pearl looks

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.580 
steel color with the white pearl looks
really<00:02:05.790> fantastic<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.570> sunlight<00:02:07.020> way<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.259> see

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
really fantastic in sunlight way to see

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.740 
really fantastic in sunlight way to see
all<00:02:07.649> those<00:02:07.799> little<00:02:08.069> metallic<00:02:08.340> flakes<00:02:08.849> all

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
all those little metallic flakes all

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.540 
all those little metallic flakes all
this<00:02:09.959> left<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.500> boost<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> performance

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
this left is to boost up the performance

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.460 
this left is to boost up the performance
of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> vapid<00:02:12.150> dominated<00:02:12.780> by<00:02:12.900> increase

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
of the vapid dominated by increase

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350 
of the vapid dominated by increase
the<00:02:13.650> engine<00:02:14.070> breaks<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.580> transmissions<00:02:15.180> the

the engine breaks and transmissions the
maximum<00:02:15.810> options<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.950> I've<00:02:17.100> mentioned<00:02:17.460> in

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
maximum options like I've mentioned in

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.220 
maximum options like I've mentioned in
previous<00:02:17.730> episodes<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.750> want<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.990> stay

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
previous episodes if you want to stay

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.930 
previous episodes if you want to stay
true<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.650> authentic<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.610> I'd<00:02:20.760> probably

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
true and authentic then I'd probably

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.270 
true and authentic then I'd probably
leave<00:02:21.420> out<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.840> suspension<00:02:22.260> upgrade<00:02:22.740> as<00:02:23.220> well

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
leave out the suspension upgrade as well

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.640 
leave out the suspension upgrade as well
as<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> turbo<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.330> guess<00:02:25.050> these<00:02:25.230> two<00:02:25.290> are

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
as the turbo I guess these two are

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.230 
as the turbo I guess these two are
optional<00:02:26.100> with<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.460> Ellen<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.850> build<00:02:27.000> though

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
optional with the Ellen and build though

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.210 
optional with the Ellen and build though
after<00:02:27.930> all<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.200> Mustang<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.770> movie<00:02:29.070> just

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
after all the Mustang in the movie just

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.830 
after all the Mustang in the movie just
seemed<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.490> have<00:02:29.610> modified<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.450> likely

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
seemed to have modified so it's likely

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.480 
seemed to have modified so it's likely
that<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.140> got<00:02:31.290> some<00:02:31.530> suspension<00:02:31.980> upgrades

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
that it's got some suspension upgrades

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.640 
that it's got some suspension upgrades
but<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.090> prefer<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.630> loose<00:02:33.840> handling<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.530> get

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
but I prefer that loose handling to get

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.800 
but I prefer that loose handling to get
the<00:02:34.770> back<00:02:34.950> end<00:02:35.130> out<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:36.030> likewise<00:02:36.420> while<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
the back end out and likewise while the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.950 
the back end out and likewise while the
gt500<00:02:37.470> isn't<00:02:38.070> turbocharged<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.570> Nicholas

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
gt500 isn't turbocharged in the Nicholas

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.380 
gt500 isn't turbocharged in the Nicholas
Cage<00:02:40.200> movie<00:02:40.710> we'll<00:02:40.830> see<00:02:41.010> him<00:02:41.220> use<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.850> nitrous

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
Cage movie we'll see him use the nitrous

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.510 
Cage movie we'll see him use the nitrous
boost<00:02:42.660> well<00:02:42.960> cruising<00:02:43.440> down<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.620> LA<00:02:44.130> storm

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
boost well cruising down the LA storm

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.950 
boost well cruising down the LA storm
drains<00:02:44.850> while<00:02:45.060> being<00:02:45.240> chased<00:02:45.540> by<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.840> police

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
drains while being chased by the police

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.320 
drains while being chased by the police
so<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:46.980> guess<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.280> best<00:02:47.460> option<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.880> relate<00:02:48.210> to

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
so I guess the best option to relate to

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.060 
so I guess the best option to relate to
this<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.810> turbo<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:49.530> not<00:02:49.680> keen<00:02:49.890> on

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
this is the turbo but I'm not keen on

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.650 
this is the turbo but I'm not keen on

that dump valve sound effects in a
