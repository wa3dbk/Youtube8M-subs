is<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.270> scanned<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.050> sister<00:01:13.410> car<00:01:13.700> digitally

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
is we scanned the sister car digitally

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.090 
is we scanned the sister car digitally
created<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.480> wooden<00:01:15.750> buck<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.980> were

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
created a wooden buck and then we were
