00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.879
 good we are again in the kitchen of 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.919
 new with a new recipe and we're going to 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.450
 make strawberry ice cream today 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.910
 diego of yogurt why are we going to do with 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.860
 yogurts worth I know that my favorite is the 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.690
 danone vitalinea yogurt is not that 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.760
 have paid nor to make him tanned is 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.200
 which is my favorite is death 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.270
 so I invented a little bit 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.340
 look at some strawberries a little bit 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.660
 dark chocolate and a little honey 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.670
 look how it works out let's go there is very 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.530
 easy we just have to cast the 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.850
 yogurts in the thermomix if you want to go out 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.480
 because it is frozen 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.480
 for one 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.810
 two 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.560
 you have a few minutes 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.600
 does not exist 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.500
 ah 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:09.979
 let's be the ace fresitas a little bit of 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.979
 dark chocolate to give it the flavor 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.740
 You can do this side, I've done it 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.140
 quickly but you can do it stone 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.610
 of peach and you know it was a fruit 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.729
 that is spectacular of watermelon in short 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.320
 the mixture in this chocolate that you can 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.090
 to put almonds in order what you 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.090
 we want to invent 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.000
 it makes a little noise the machine but 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.000
 good 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.600
 the one moved by the turbo blows 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.770
 we are advancing the page fruit and yogurt 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.770
 is hooked to look which side richer 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.640
 come on I'll also throw white chocolate 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.500
 if so many exquisite ingredients 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.460
 but let's pass the dark chocolate 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.670
 because it has less fat 80 per 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.670
 hundred 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.070
 we have our side ready 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.580
 do not tell me it's not a pass and 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.330
 natural 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.270
 done by us and a pint we are going to 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.140
 to be able to look at the balance we had 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.510
 strawberries 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.740
 now you will see the texture and everything that is 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.280
 we look good on the side with the pieces 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.280
 of strawberry 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.640
 so spring arrives that makes us 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.959
 a lot of ice cream because you know that 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.569
 get a little fat because they carry sugar 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.000
 Well, here you have a natural one that you can 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.950
 eat everything you want but it's going to 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.950
 get fat then look a lot less 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.150
 and now I have mine that now comes from 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.150
 training and you catch 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:02.340
 force energy and vitality so that 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.340
 let's go to the new chao recipe 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.100

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.870
