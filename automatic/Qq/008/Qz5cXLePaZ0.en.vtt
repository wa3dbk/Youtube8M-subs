 well maybe after a few days the channel was not getting rid of but Hans 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.480

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.549
 German but also election determined as having retained van Son 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.229
 then it emigrated and came back again and now it will be again 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.880
 then it would be clear and why here 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.280
