00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
you do get this the idea of a tube

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.990 
you do get this the idea of a tube
spanner<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.890> say<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.400> long<00:02:22.610> thread

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
spanner you say that that long thread

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000 
spanner you say that that long thread
will<00:02:23.180> move<00:02:23.330> all<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.630> way<00:02:23.660> down<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.110> tube<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
will move all the way down the tube the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.650 
will move all the way down the tube the
socket<00:02:25.370> said<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.550> showed<00:02:25.850> you<00:02:26.000> have<00:02:26.180> really

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
socket said I showed you have really

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.660 
socket said I showed you have really
really<00:02:26.900> really<00:02:26.930> long<00:02:27.200> sockets<00:02:27.800> not<00:02:28.370> like<00:02:28.640> a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
really really long sockets not like a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.880 
really really long sockets not like a
normal<00:02:28.940> socket<00:02:29.330> set<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.870> also<00:02:30.560> comes<00:02:30.800> with

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
normal socket set and also comes with

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.800 
normal socket set and also comes with
extended<00:02:31.550> seen<00:02:31.760> get<00:02:31.970> up<00:02:32.120> into<00:02:32.330> where<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.660> need

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
extended seen get up into where you need

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.720 
extended seen get up into where you need
to<00:02:32.960> be<00:02:32.990> but<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.980> one<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.280> hardware<00:02:34.670> that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
to be but the one of the hardware that

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.100 
to be but the one of the hardware that
actually<00:02:35.210> where<00:02:35.360> they<00:02:35.450> put<00:02:35.630> these<00:02:35.750> holes<00:02:35.990> so

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
actually where they put these holes so

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.840 
actually where they put these holes so
it<00:02:36.170> actually<00:02:36.290> crushed<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:37.040> which<00:02:37.460> means<00:02:37.700> you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
it actually crushed it which means you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.190 
it actually crushed it which means you
have<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.209> much<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.750> could<00:02:38.900> stick<00:02:39.110> it

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
have that much you could stick it

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.420 
have that much you could stick it
through<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:39.590> make<00:02:39.770> sure<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:39.980> don't<00:02:40.100> get<00:02:40.250> one

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
through so make sure you don't get one

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.250 
through so make sure you don't get one
of<00:02:40.459> those<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:41.120> see<00:02:41.300> this<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.600> perfectly<00:02:42.020> round

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
of those you see this is perfectly round

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.350 
of those you see this is perfectly round
it's<00:02:42.560> not<00:02:42.709> crushed<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.190> any<00:02:43.340> way<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.240> this

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
it's not crushed in any way so that this

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.180 
it's not crushed in any way so that this
rod<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:45.020> threaded<00:02:45.470> rod<00:02:45.680> will<00:02:45.830> be<00:02:45.860> able<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.070> move

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
rod is threaded rod will be able to move

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.860 
rod is threaded rod will be able to move
down<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.400> tube<00:02:46.760> when<00:02:47.030> get<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.300> I'm<00:02:47.420> not<00:02:47.630> and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
down the tube when get to I'm not and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.170 
down the tube when get to I'm not and
undo<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.370> alright<00:02:51.340> okay<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.610> pulled<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.060> out

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
undo it alright okay so I pulled it out

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.330 
undo it alright okay so I pulled it out
and<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.050> basically<00:02:54.290> what<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.860> got<00:02:55.040> under

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
and this is basically what you got under

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.020 
and this is basically what you got under
there<00:02:55.489> I've<00:02:56.270> got<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.540> rod<00:02:57.790> you've<00:02:58.790> got<00:02:59.000> a

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
there I've got the rod you've got a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.240 
there I've got the rod you've got a
piece<00:02:59.270> of<00:02:59.420> rubber<00:02:59.750> and<00:02:59.959> all<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.739> rubber<00:03:00.950> does

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
piece of rubber and all that rubber does

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.310 
piece of rubber and all that rubber does
doesn't<00:03:01.670> want<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.030> prove<00:03:02.209> anything<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:03.110> it

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
doesn't want to prove anything is it

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.340 
doesn't want to prove anything is it
just<00:03:03.560> stops<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.250> UM<00:03:04.580> with<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.690> metal<00:03:06.080> from

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
just stops the UM with the metal from

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.620 
just stops the UM with the metal from
spinning<00:03:06.980> on<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.190> porcelain<00:03:07.580> if<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.150> basin

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
spinning on the porcelain if the basin

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.750 
spinning on the porcelain if the basin
or<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.080> stainless<00:03:09.470> steel<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.890> seen<00:03:10.100> then<00:03:10.670> you

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
or the stainless steel is seen then you

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.150 
or the stainless steel is seen then you
got<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.320> metal<00:03:12.610> flange<00:03:13.610> thing<00:03:14.030> okay<00:03:14.780> that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
got this metal flange thing okay that

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.440 
got this metal flange thing okay that
pushes<00:03:16.160> up<00:03:16.310> against<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.820> sink<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.299> that's

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
pushes up against the sink and that's

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.870 
pushes up against the sink and that's
what<00:03:17.660> pulls<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.709> down<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.459> using<00:03:19.790> that

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
what pulls this down and using that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.400 
what pulls this down and using that
compression<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.540> hold<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.810> in<00:03:20.930> place

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
compression to hold it in place

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.979 
compression to hold it in place
and<00:03:21.709> then<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.070> got<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.489> nut<00:03:22.810> now<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:25.660> mine<00:03:26.660> art

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
and then you got the nut now I mine art

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.320 
and then you got the nut now I mine art
was<00:03:27.440> actually<00:03:27.620> seized<00:03:28.250> on<00:03:28.549> there<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:28.910> couldn't

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
was actually seized on there I couldn't

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.720 
was actually seized on there I couldn't
undo<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.200> I<00:03:30.260> couldn't<00:03:30.560> tighten<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.130> so

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
undo it and I couldn't tighten it so

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.070 
undo it and I couldn't tighten it so
what<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:31.970> did<00:03:32.390> is<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:33.170> could<00:03:33.709> get<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.130> entire<00:03:34.220> rod

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080

needs to be tightened up so if it's all

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.200 
needs to be tightened up so if it's all
seized<00:04:21.620> up<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:22.340> have<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.610> pull<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.849> whole<00:04:22.940> rod

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
seized up you have to pull the whole rod

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.090 
seized up you have to pull the whole rod
out<00:04:23.390> of<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.630> unit

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
out of the unit

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.030 
out of the unit
I<00:04:24.130> have<00:04:24.640> just<00:04:24.970> unscrews<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:26.710> would<00:04:26.860> come

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
I have just unscrews and that would come

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.640 
I have just unscrews and that would come
out<00:04:27.070> really<00:04:27.430> well<00:04:27.670> because<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:28.840> actually

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
out really well because that is actually

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.430 
out really well because that is actually
brass<00:04:30.040> in<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.790> tap<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.810> won't<00:04:32.020> won't<00:04:32.260> be

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
brass in the tap so it won't won't be

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.560 
brass in the tap so it won't won't be
seized<00:04:32.680> up<00:04:32.890> get<00:04:33.550> your<00:04:33.640> night<00:04:33.820> off<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.240> then

by the way these two spans come with a

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.769 
by the way these two spans come with a
little<00:06:15.179> lever<00:06:15.990> you<00:06:16.409> put<00:06:16.619> in<00:06:16.709> the<00:06:16.770> hole<00:06:17.779> it's

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
little lever you put in the hole it's

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.119

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:20.129 
not meeting the telogen but basically

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.820 
not meeting the telogen but basically
