00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.950 
anything don't tell Apple but anyways um
I<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:26.680> really<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.130> like<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.910> tablet<00:02:28.720> um

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
I really really do like this tablet um

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.040 
I really really do like this tablet um

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
it does full HD recording which is

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.880 
it does full HD recording which is
pretty<00:02:32.620> awesome<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:33.960> maybe<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.260> should<00:02:35.530> try

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
pretty awesome so maybe I should try

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.630 
pretty awesome so maybe I should try
recording<00:02:36.190> with<00:02:36.940> my<00:02:37.240> um<00:02:38.250> tablet<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.400> see<00:02:39.550> how

recording with my um tablet and see how
it<00:02:39.730> works<00:02:39.940> but<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.690> probably<00:02:40.900> won't<00:02:41.080> because

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
it works but I probably won't because

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.770 
it works but I probably won't because
that's<00:02:41.830> kind<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.160> stupid<00:02:42.570> another<00:02:43.570> like

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
that's kind of stupid another like

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.230 
that's kind of stupid another like
essential<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.470> like<00:02:44.740> for<00:02:45.100> college<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.820> I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
essential that I like for college is I

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.430 
essential that I like for college is I
love<00:02:47.020> these<00:02:47.590> binders<00:02:48.190> by<00:02:48.580> five<00:02:49.570> starr<00:02:49.930> they're

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
love these binders by five starr they're

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.130 
love these binders by five starr they're
actually<00:02:50.770> called<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.310> hybrid<00:02:52.120> note<00:02:52.660> binder

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
actually called the hybrid note binder

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.840 
actually called the hybrid note binder
and<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.620> reason<00:02:53.860> why<00:02:53.950> it's<00:02:54.070> called<00:02:54.220> no<00:02:54.459> binder

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
and the reason why it's called no binder

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.510 
and the reason why it's called no binder
is<00:02:55.000> because<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.660> acts<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.290> notebook<00:02:56.530> who

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
is because it acts like a notebook who

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.230 
is because it acts like a notebook who
works<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.030> binder<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.810> um<00:02:59.740> I<00:03:00.190> love<00:03:00.310> these
