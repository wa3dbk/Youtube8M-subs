00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.530 

there<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:07.980> goes

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.560 

I'll<00:00:12.200> explain<00:00:12.560> how<00:00:12.830> this<00:00:12.980> works<00:00:13.450> when<00:00:14.450> the

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
I'll explain how this works when the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.440 
I'll explain how this works when the
button<00:00:14.930> is<00:00:15.020> lit<00:00:15.290> press<00:00:16.100> it<00:00:16.400> to<00:00:16.640> release<00:00:16.970> a

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
button is lit press it to release a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.680 
button is lit press it to release a
metal<00:00:18.020> ball

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
metal ball

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.760 
metal ball
and<00:00:19.780> my

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.210 

Kepler's<00:00:25.490> law<00:00:26.090> of<00:00:26.450> manager

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
Kepler's law of manager

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.690 
Kepler's law of manager
could<00:00:28.820> you<00:00:28.910> elaborate<00:00:29.360> please<00:00:30.700> Kepler's

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
could you elaborate please Kepler's

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.510 
could you elaborate please Kepler's
first<00:00:32.029> law<00:00:32.150> states<00:00:33.080> that<00:00:33.260> when<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:34.040> press<00:00:34.310> the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
first law states that when you press the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.210 
first law states that when you press the
button<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.480> ball<00:00:35.690> is<00:00:35.900> released<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:36.560> the<00:00:36.590> skier

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
button the ball is released to the skier

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.810 
button the ball is released to the skier
and<00:00:37.790> it<00:00:38.060> spins<00:00:38.390> around<00:00:38.630> yeah<00:00:39.440> yes<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.400> then

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
and it spins around yeah yes and then

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.630 
and it spins around yeah yes and then
the<00:00:41.090> ball<00:00:41.270> eventually<00:00:42.170> disappeared<00:00:43.130> you

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
the ball eventually disappeared you

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.670 
the ball eventually disappeared you
sound<00:00:43.910> like<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:44.420> have<00:00:44.450> limited<00:00:45.020> knowledge<00:00:45.200> on

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
sound like you have limited knowledge on

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.100 
sound like you have limited knowledge on
Kepler's<00:00:46.190> first<00:00:46.460> law<00:00:46.580> I<00:00:47.000> am<00:00:47.090> this<00:00:47.540> hardest

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
Kepler's first law I am this hardest

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.530 
Kepler's first law I am this hardest
person<00:00:48.320> ever<00:00:48.770> they<00:00:49.460> completely<00:00:49.940> know<00:00:50.239> about

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
person ever they completely know about

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.670 
person ever they completely know about
Kepler's<00:00:50.960> first<00:00:51.320> law<00:00:51.440> yeah<00:00:51.890> yeah<00:00:52.160> I<00:00:52.370> invented

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
Kepler's first law yeah yeah I invented

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.700 
Kepler's first law yeah yeah I invented
do<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:55.370> know<00:00:55.550> my<00:00:55.790> name<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:56.210> why<00:00:56.420> is<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:56.720> yeah<00:00:57.110> my

David Lamm P yeah Paul Heyman Kepler
yeah<00:01:05.800> you<00:01:06.800> don't<00:01:06.890> know<00:01:07.010> anything<00:01:07.310> about<00:01:07.430> this

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
yeah you don't know anything about this

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.420 
yeah you don't know anything about this
about<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:09.440> don't<00:01:09.710> that's<00:01:09.890> why<00:01:10.040> I'm<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.310> one

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
about I don't that's why I'm the one

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.200 
about I don't that's why I'm the one
asking<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.880> questions<00:01:10.970> I<00:01:13.030> don't<00:01:14.030> know

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
asking the questions I don't know

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.720 
asking the questions I don't know
because<00:01:14.480> you're<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.780> expert<00:01:14.810> mr.<00:01:15.440> Adler<00:01:15.730> how

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
because you're the expert mr. Adler how

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.620 
because you're the expert mr. Adler how
do<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.880> pronounce<00:01:17.000> your<00:01:17.240> last<00:01:17.300> name

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
do you pronounce your last name

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.990 
do you pronounce your last name
Kepler<00:01:18.080> Kepler<00:01:18.710> how's<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.160> spelled<00:01:19.430> thank

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
Kepler Kepler how's that spelled thank

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.660 
Kepler Kepler how's that spelled thank
you<00:01:20.210> are<00:01:21.080> are<00:01:21.350> you<00:01:21.470> doing<00:01:21.800> I<00:01:22.720> don't<00:01:23.720> know<00:01:23.810> you

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
you are are you doing I don't know you

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.630 
you are are you doing I don't know you
if<00:01:25.670> Kepler<00:01:26.030> Jewish<00:01:26.360> Landsman<00:01:26.780> I<00:01:27.020> don't<00:01:27.320> know

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.459 

how<00:01:31.640> would<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:31.939> know<00:01:32.420> Nina's<00:01:33.049> crush<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:33.409> thing

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
how would I know Nina's crush this thing

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:45.020 
how would I know Nina's crush this thing
takes<00:01:33.829> a<00:01:33.920> while<00:01:34.100> doesn't<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.600> there's<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.719> dude

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.310 

this<00:01:45.510> is<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> most<00:01:46.110> boring

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
this is going to be the most boring

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.780 
this is going to be the most boring
video<00:01:46.650> I've<00:01:46.979> ever<00:01:47.640> made<00:01:49.549> it's<00:01:50.549> really

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
video I've ever made it's really

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.540 
video I've ever made it's really
exciting<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.360> person<00:01:51.750> guys

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.860 

yeah<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.580> want<00:01:58.730> to<00:01:58.790> do<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:59.000> want<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.390> like<00:01:59.660> have

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
yeah I want to do I want to like have

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.770 
yeah I want to do I want to like have
these<00:02:00.110> freaks<00:02:00.440> like<00:02:01.130> I'm<00:02:01.310> gonna<00:02:01.520> happen<00:02:01.850> crash

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
these freaks like I'm gonna happen crash

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.740 
these freaks like I'm gonna happen crash
each<00:02:03.140> other<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:03.620> do<00:02:03.770> too<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.100> think<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.750> think

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
each other I do too I think I think

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.810 
each other I do too I think I think
that's<00:02:05.930> Kepler's<00:02:06.230> second<00:02:06.830> law<00:02:06.860> though<00:02:07.550> this

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
that's Kepler's second law though this

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.779 
that's Kepler's second law though this
is<00:02:08.000> only<00:02:08.119> Kepler's<00:02:08.570> first<00:02:08.840> law

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
is only Kepler's first law

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.390 
is only Kepler's first law
so

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
so

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.390 
so
almost<00:02:14.300> done<00:02:16.209> cheese<00:02:17.830> zoom<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.069> little<00:02:19.280> bit

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
almost done cheese zoom in a little bit

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:40.880 
almost done cheese zoom in a little bit
what

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.950 

you
