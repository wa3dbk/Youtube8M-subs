you<00:06:51.050> couldn't<00:06:51.380> use<00:06:51.470> exe<00:06:52.010> s<00:06:52.070> on<00:06:52.340> the<00:06:52.700> computers

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
you couldn't use exe s on the computers

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.510 
you couldn't use exe s on the computers
and<00:06:53.450> so<00:06:54.020> me<00:06:54.260> being<00:06:54.470> a<00:06:54.740> little<00:06:54.950> fucking<00:06:55.220> dick

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
and so me being a little fucking dick

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.970 
and so me being a little fucking dick
you<00:06:55.640> know<00:06:55.730> what<00:06:55.850> I<00:06:55.880> did<00:06:56.210> I<00:06:56.480> figured<00:06:57.260> out<00:06:57.440> that

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:57.980 
you know what I did I figured out that

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.400 
you know what I did I figured out that
if<00:06:58.130> you<00:06:58.340> opened<00:06:58.820> up<00:06:58.940> an<00:06:59.060> exe<00:06:59.570> through<00:06:59.900> winzip

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
if you opened up an exe through winzip

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.860 
if you opened up an exe through winzip
it<00:07:00.620> didn't<00:07:01.430> count<00:07:01.580> as<00:07:01.820> an<00:07:01.940> exe<00:07:02.330> file<00:07:02.570> because

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
it didn't count as an exe file because

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.650 
it didn't count as an exe file because
winzip<00:07:03.320> ran<00:07:03.560> it<00:07:03.710> through<00:07:03.890> its<00:07:04.010> own<00:07:04.390> program<00:07:05.390> if

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
winzip ran it through its own program if

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.240 
winzip ran it through its own program if
you're<00:07:06.290> right<00:07:06.440> clicked<00:07:06.680> on<00:07:06.800> it<00:07:06.830> and<00:07:06.920> tried<00:07:07.160> to

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
you're right clicked on it and tried to

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.400 
you're right clicked on it and tried to
open<00:07:07.370> the<00:07:07.610> exe<00:07:08.030> as<00:07:08.240> a<00:07:08.270> winzip<00:07:08.810> you<00:07:09.170> weren't

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
open the exe as a winzip you weren't

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.070 
open the exe as a winzip you weren't
actually<00:07:09.560> executing<00:07:10.310> anything<00:07:10.660> so<00:07:11.660> when<00:07:11.840> zips
