00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 some times you have been talking 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.960
 about a cosmic mystery that occur 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.309
 every certain period of years and that has 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.220
 left more than a surprised person 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.050
 and expectant 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.750
 it's about the so-called eclipses 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.270
 moles or better known as moons 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.820
 blood that occurs when the earth is 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.520
 interpose between the moon and the sun and in 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.630
 where we are fer has reflected a light 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.689
 given the circumference of the earth 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.140
 towards the moon reflecting a reddish color 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.570
 sugar and cell phone giving that color 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.220
 characteristic of blood moon and in 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.650
 where lately they have let themselves show 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.870
 in the world and that to all the new 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.600
 left surprised by this 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.960
 spectacular phenomenon perhaps for 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.850
 some as an apocalyptic signal or the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.780
 prelude that something creepy has to 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.090
 come the world 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.309
 it happens that this phenomenon is not so 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.829
 normal as many believe or do to us 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.239
 thinking as the former behind 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.670
 eclipses were given by the 1949s and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.220
 1950 coincidentally occurred term 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.619
 the independence of israel the people 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.950
 God's chosen and this was also given 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:15.439
 event in 1967 in 68 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.689
 but the most surprising thing is that after 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.860
 this last tetrad that has occurred in 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.479
 these last two years 2014 and 2015 not 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.869
 will run a similar event again in 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.320
 the next 500 years or two thousand 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.060
 614 and two thousand 615 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.610
 the fact that in this century is not going to 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.400
 occur a phenomenon like this is something 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.930
 intriguing and puzzling what it does 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.090
 think that this astronomical phenomenon is 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.659
 something special and not just a simple 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.640
 physical encounter 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.530
 there are some who believe that these 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.249
 phenomena like it's just a show 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.479
 nightly and that there is nothing to worry about 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:54.299
 but there are others who believe that this is the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.770
 hand of god involved in all this 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.749
 where the bible narrates and prophesies very 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.530
 well these concepts thing that 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.960
 I personally share 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.850
 the sun will turn into darkness and the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.619
 moon in blood before the day comes 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.300
 of the great Lord manifest them 220 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.280
 this is just a fragment of a 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.470
 verse of what the bible speaks for 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.930
 aspects of the blood moon in the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.500
 last times before god comes 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.500
 to look for his chosen people 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.450
 although the most disconcerting question is 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.220
 the fact of why this tetrad of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.620
 moons that give just located in day 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.630
 of easter parties of angles 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.520
 Oh, God 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.950
 for some this is just one 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.620
 coincidence but for others it is a 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.270
 divine sign of the end of time and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.360
 where the world probably does not fit 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.860
 many years of existence it seems that 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.470
 prophecies described in the bible are 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.840
 they are complying and with detail although 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.150
 there are many skeptics who do not believe in 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.250
 these signs the truth is that the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.500
 coincidences of these facts so for 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.960
 think and to look at less these 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.220
 astronomical phenomena is to say that only 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.220
 it's a cosmological luck 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.240
 the last moon of blood that is expected 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.240
 will happen this September 28 of this 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.100
 year 2015 then we will be attentive to 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.530
 see that it will separate us from the world to 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.060
 in recent years and if this is one of 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.350
 the prophecies announced in the bible 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.350
 for the final times 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.380
