00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.240
 hi many other guys we are a box 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.790
 trade and ex presented all the news 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.000
 of android wear 5.1 so let's go with the 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.000
 video 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.170
 i 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.369
 well finally we release version of 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.960
 Android android wear 5.1.1 and let's see 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.329
 its main novelties finally 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.860
 we have a drawer of applications to use 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.980
 it's something we 've always asked 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.140
 along with the favorite contacts and the 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.060
 crazy google ok control and these are the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.529
 adjustments another novelty that we have is that 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.660
 now notifications will appear 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.489
 anywhere we are seeing 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.980
 on the screen we are in the settings and we 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.290
 appear the notifications that we can 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.720
 Discard 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.580
 now we can also discard just one 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.750
 notification when they are grouped together 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.750
 that could not be done before 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.579
 and in a new thing that has come is the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.920
 lime shaft 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.690
 the contacts to the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.120
 I have called but then the favorites 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.519
 the recent ones even a marker the 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.589
 which obviously we can not talk from 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.309
 the clock but the call will be sent to 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.309
 mobile phone 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.000
 also with the latest update of 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.830
 android wear 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
 spotify takes on a greater meaning since 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.390
 we can access our library 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.390
 music directly from the clock 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.750
 a new one has also been redesigned 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.970
 map application which is much more 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.460
 intuitive and fast looking every time 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.799
 more to the android native in this 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.450
 we can see our location where 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.979
 we are exactly able to do 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.380
 pinch-to-zoom though on a screen 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.190
 small is a bit cumbersome so 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.420
 we will also have the zoom buttons 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.409
 we can also see nearby sites 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.170
 pressing the button on the right 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.969
 and be able to guide us through the clock or if 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.869
 there will not always be commands for 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.869
 to guide us somewhere 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.640
 we give to any one we press 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.090
 that takes us and will start 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.090
 navigation 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.400
 as we see here we have what we should 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.400
 of doing until the place arrives the hour 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.140
 expected arrival and travel mode 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.510
 of agreement here we can select in 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.070
 car for example and we recalculated the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.070
 route takes a second 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.240
 and here we have it 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.820
 well the form has also been redesigned 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.980
 to shut down okay now stays 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.260
 everything as it was but blank and 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.270
 black remember a high contrast and the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.670
 truth is pretty good then also 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.200
 it has added gestures that is pretty 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.180
 simple even if it seems a bit 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.709
 cumbersome once you have it in the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.150
 hand is very useful because sometimes 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.150
 you always have your hands free 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.150
 well and last and not least 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:00.069
 important to be redesigned some 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.810
 native applications of the clock as per 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.430
 example the alarms that we see now 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.829
 that we are shown the numbers in 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.780
 carousel something that has also adopted the 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.030
 timer agreement we can put 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.400
 the timer exactly as in 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.400
 the carousel-shaped alarms 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.110
 has a confirmation screen 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.390
 and now I would start whistling and finally 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.190
 The chronometer has also been redesigned 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.400
 so well I do not usually use the following 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.400
 video
