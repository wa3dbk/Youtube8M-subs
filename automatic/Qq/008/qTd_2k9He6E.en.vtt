00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:11.389
 Well, now for another request from 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:15.929
 Gay does not start after the winter Orion 110 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.730
 because he did not tell mean autumn 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.990
 before you park it 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.420
 for a long time he started it warmed up let 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.300
 he stalled again well as if stalled and horseradish 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.599
 take off he put it now to start 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 can't say a spark eat gas have 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.880
 wiring is okay battery 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.270
 would charge everything well but it is not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.910
 the start does not start 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:47.219
 here's your just pulled away from the wall 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:54.930
 also parking about three or four 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:01:01.100
 months on a pencil case a little look at 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.870
 what is it like now starter as we see 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 no ale 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:26.270
 In principle, the first where we look even 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.270
 no spark come on 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:36.700
 Suetonius, and here we see 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.700
 filter close the valve it is closed or 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.390
 close the filter close the tap remove 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.630
 fuel filter 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.240
 look what we've got going on me a hundred 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.560
 pudovo dirt moderately after the past 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:59.800
 season and it does not give us a normal pass 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.800
 fuel carburetor 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.160
 water is like that 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.290
 clean the filter also show on it 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.290
 moped because how would he grasp 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.450
 The first thing I see is this filter if 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.620
 moped basically doesnâ€™t grasp it there 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.430
 daddy's faces don't know about 10 ohms at all 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.800
 never even snorted once then yes 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.590
 then we climb look we unscrew the spark 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.200
 a candle is still something but everything seems to be here 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:56.620
 fine 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:58.690
 holy not 7 months of me you are what we are 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.720
 we do further there is a spark there is gasoline 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.170
 have all eliminated everything looked after 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.480
 than doing this we kick it anyway 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.480
 start up but the battery can be charged 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.310
 you can not charge you any role not 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.500
 playing from the starter you will still 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.980
 start longer than with legs what we do 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.560
 further we have as here by the description of the eagle he 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:29.520
 not running everything is normal but not 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.520
 we start to unscrew the candle 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.650
 I twist the candle I will not 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.300
 twist because u know everything 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.870
 exactly the problems of this appetit unknown 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.390
 unscrew the candle 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.940
 under the candle straight into the cylinder pour somewhere on 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.090
 we take the syringe we collect one and a half two cubes 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.610
 here we pour gasoline under the candle of the sacred 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.340
 place we do not forget the nickname on the candle and 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.040
 we start the moped should start here 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.459
 here if it is after gas filling 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.320
 it is in the cylinder did not start then worth 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.820
 think about removing the head because 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.700
 possibly over the winter valve depended 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.320
 the queen of the valve thing on one side 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.919
 rare in the other side 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.609
 China technology unpredictable happened 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.650
 for example, what have you put here 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.719
 left on the gear say or 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.090
 engine stalled and left alone 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:30.520
 valve open ie valve seat 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.520
 it hangs somewhere in the middle 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:37.729
 he means winter with this open valve 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.650
 stood oil there all the glass do not let 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.759
 god there somewhere oil was sitting down 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.030
 air leaks 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.340
 something else got wet 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.960
 the street is after this still its water 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.169
 a little bit under the heat 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.330
 cold condensate waterfall gathered in 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.229
 bushing 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.639
 guide and it's just plain 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:00.889
 froze here spring it back into place 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.300
 can not compression in the cylinder no 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:07.840
 moped to not start the situation is rare but 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.849
 the situation is taking place therefore 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.490
 think see first pour 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.819
 we try to have something 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.289
 ok with valves look for fuel 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:21.439
 the carburetor is still something but not on 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.259
 wound up then look already in the mechanical 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:28.839
 part that yuskova panel for sim all in 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.839
 Basically search and nowhere yet
