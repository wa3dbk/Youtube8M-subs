00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
everyone at Cyrus from jump eggs how are

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.889 
everyone at Cyrus from jump eggs how are
you<00:00:02.429> today<00:00:03.240> I'm<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.510> be<00:00:03.570> doing<00:00:03.689> another

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
you today I'm going to be doing another

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.330 
you today I'm going to be doing another
wire<00:00:04.589> wrap<00:00:04.799> tutorial<00:00:04.830> for<00:00:05.819> drop<00:00:06.690> beads<00:00:07.340> like

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
wire wrap tutorial for drop beads like

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.430 
wire wrap tutorial for drop beads like
these<00:00:08.610> these<00:00:09.540> are<00:00:09.719> different<00:00:10.050> than<00:00:10.110> round

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
these these are different than round

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.930 
these these are different than round
beads<00:00:10.679> because<00:00:10.920> they're<00:00:11.280> drilled<00:00:11.550> on<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.730> top

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
beads because they're drilled on the top

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.970 
beads because they're drilled on the top
obviously<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:13.019> there's<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.320> couple<00:00:13.500> extra

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
obviously so there's a couple extra

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.709 
obviously so there's a couple extra
steps<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.509> make<00:00:15.690> sure

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
steps that you have to do to make sure

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.810 
steps that you have to do to make sure
that<00:00:16.049> your<00:00:16.199> beads<00:00:16.440> don't<00:00:16.680> get<00:00:16.859> broken<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.670> make

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
that your beads don't get broken to make

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.939 
that your beads don't get broken to make
sure<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.240> hangs<00:00:18.420> right<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.710> little

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
sure that it hangs right it's a little

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.900 
sure that it hangs right it's a little
bit<00:00:20.039> harder<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.279> get<00:00:20.430> your<00:00:20.580> head<00:00:20.730> wrapped

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
bit harder to get your head wrapped

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.070 
bit harder to get your head wrapped
around<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.920> get<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
around it get it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.509 
around it get it
but<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> promise<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.130> much

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
but I promise you it's not that much

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.460 
but I promise you it's not that much
different<00:00:27.090> I'm<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> show<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.230> few

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
different I'm going to show you a few

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.140 
different I'm going to show you a few
simple<00:00:28.650> steps<00:00:28.830> how<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> easily<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
simple steps how to do it easily and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.880 
simple steps how to do it easily and
safely<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.289> don't<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> worry<00:00:31.769> about

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
safely so you don't have to worry about

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.660 
safely so you don't have to worry about
breaking<00:00:32.369> your<00:00:32.399> beads<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.750> let's<00:00:34.020> get<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
breaking your beads so let's get to it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.000 
breaking your beads so let's get to it
these<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.820> all<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> things<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.480> need

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
these are all the things that you need

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.350 
these are all the things that you need
first<00:00:38.010> off<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.820> pendant<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.239> we

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
first off we have the pendant that we

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.810 
first off we have the pendant that we
want<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.590> working<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.070> some<00:00:41.190> citrine

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
want and I'm working with some citrine

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.139 
want and I'm working with some citrine
some<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.270> nice<00:00:42.770> citrine<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.010> then<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.700> have

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
some really nice citrine and then I have

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.010 
some really nice citrine and then I have
a<00:00:45.480> few<00:00:45.719> different<00:00:45.809> wires<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:47.690> bail<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
a few different wires and a bail and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.880 
a few different wires and a bail and
some<00:00:49.410> chain<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.539> then<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.530> these<00:00:52.649> wire

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
some chain and then I have these wire

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.990 
some chain and then I have these wire
cutters<00:00:53.510> one<00:00:54.510> round<00:00:54.780> nose<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:56.520> flat<00:00:56.789> nose

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
cutters one round nose and one flat nose

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.720 
cutters one round nose and one flat nose
now<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> difference<00:00:58.379> between<00:00:58.590> wire<00:00:59.430> wrapping

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
now the difference between wire wrapping

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.399 
now the difference between wire wrapping
a<00:01:00.090> pendant<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.940> versus<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> round<00:01:03.409> bead

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
a pendant like this versus a round bead

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.870 
a pendant like this versus a round bead
is<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.960> these<00:01:06.960> ones<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.350> drilled<00:01:07.700> from<00:01:08.700> side

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
is that these ones are drilled from side

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.500 
is that these ones are drilled from side
to<00:01:08.909> side<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.689> top<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:11.700> lot<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> times

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
to side on the top and a lot of times

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.190 
to side on the top and a lot of times
they're<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:12.960> fragile<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
they're really fragile so you have to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.690 
they're really fragile so you have to
use<00:01:16.320> special<00:01:16.470> wire<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> take<00:01:17.520> extra

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
use special wire you have to take extra

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.749 
use special wire you have to take extra
care<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:19.380> four<00:01:19.860> different<00:01:20.009> sizes<00:01:20.400> right

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
care I have four different sizes right

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.340 
care I have four different sizes right
here<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:24.930> which<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.229> works

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
here and I have to see which one works

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.609 
here and I have to see which one works
best<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.100> bead<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.439> usually<00:01:28.439> these

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
best with this bead so usually these

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.719 
best with this bead so usually these
holes<00:01:28.920> are<00:01:29.220> kind<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.729> small

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
holes are kind of small

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.960 
holes are kind of small
try<00:01:32.729> 26<00:01:33.240> first

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.170 

and<00:01:39.870> it<00:01:39.990> goes<00:01:40.080> just<00:01:40.350> fine<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.400> 24<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.910> little

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and it goes just fine the 24 is a little

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.700 
and it goes just fine the 24 is a little
bit<00:01:42.300> too<00:01:42.450> big<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.720> will<00:01:45.900> go<00:01:46.080> but<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.560> don't

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
bit too big so it will go but you don't

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
bit too big so it will go but you don't
want<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:46.890> force<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.250> depending<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.420> chain

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
want to force it depending on the chain

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.540 
want to force it depending on the chain
you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:48.900> go<00:01:49.050> smaller<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:50.220> don't<00:01:50.340> want<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
you can go smaller you don't want the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.070 
you can go smaller you don't want the
wire<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:50.910> too<00:01:51.120> thin<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.540> else<00:01:51.690> it<00:01:51.870> won't<00:01:51.960> be

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
wire to be too thin or else it won't be

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.910 
wire to be too thin or else it won't be
very<00:01:52.260> strong

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
very strong

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.350 
very strong
lastly<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:54.450> use<00:01:54.660> soft<00:01:55.590> wire<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.940> kind<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
lastly we use soft wire for this kind of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.360 
lastly we use soft wire for this kind of
pendant<00:01:58.050> wire<00:01:58.200> wrapping<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.980> reason<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.340> use

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
pendant wire wrapping the reason we use

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.240 
pendant wire wrapping the reason we use
soft<00:01:59.760> instead<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.180> half<00:02:00.330> hard<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.870> because<00:02:01.260> if

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
soft instead of half hard is because if

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.720 
soft instead of half hard is because if
we<00:02:02.430> use<00:02:02.670> how<00:02:02.850> hard<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:03.510> hard<00:02:04.380> wire<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:05.550> going

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
we use how hard or hard wire it's going

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.790 
we use how hard or hard wire it's going
to<00:02:05.790> put<00:02:05.970> extra<00:02:06.240> stress<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.870> this<00:02:07.080> top<00:02:07.350> part<00:02:07.650> and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
to put extra stress on this top part and

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.010 
to put extra stress on this top part and
a<00:02:07.920> lot<00:02:08.040> of<00:02:08.070> times<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.520> breaks<00:02:08.760> and<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
a lot of times it breaks and that's you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.150 
a lot of times it breaks and that's you
know<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.170> don't<00:02:10.410> want<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.920> that's

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
know you don't want to do that that's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.520 
know you don't want to do that that's
just<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.580> worst<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.120> want<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.140> let<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.290> guys

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
just the worst I want to let you guys

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.110 
just the worst I want to let you guys
know<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.310> don't<00:02:14.490> have<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.670> learn<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.940> hard

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
know so you don't have to learn the hard

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.400 
know so you don't have to learn the hard
way<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.450> me<00:02:16.190> okay<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.510> go<00:02:18.630> take<00:02:19.290> your

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
way like me okay so here we go take your

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.190 
way like me okay so here we go take your
bead<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.810> wire<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:23.120> just<00:02:24.120> thread<00:02:25.050> it

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
bead and the wire and just thread it

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.350 
bead and the wire and just thread it
through<00:02:25.350> nice<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.070> easy<00:02:26.220> again<00:02:26.850> don't<00:02:27.120> force

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
through nice and easy again don't force

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.970 
through nice and easy again don't force
it<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.780> feel<00:02:27.930> resistance<00:02:28.260> don't<00:02:28.770> just

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
it if you feel resistance don't just

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.340 
it if you feel resistance don't just
force<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.940> through<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.360> you'll<00:02:30.510> you'll<00:02:31.170> regret

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
force it through it you'll you'll regret

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.570 
force it through it you'll you'll regret
it<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.800> sure<00:02:31.940> with<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> flat<00:02:33.240> nose<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:34.580> one

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
it for sure with the flat nose on one

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.140 
it for sure with the flat nose on one
end<00:02:35.820> going<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.390> curve<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.840> an<00:02:36.930> angle<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:38.150> hard

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
end going to curve it to an angle a hard

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.270 
end going to curve it to an angle a hard
angle<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.200> slides<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.710> just<00:02:41.100> like

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
angle so that it slides in just like

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.240 
angle so that it slides in just like
that<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:45.540> more<00:02:45.570> time<00:02:45.840> right<00:02:46.830> at<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.070> very

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that and one more time right at the very

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.070 
that and one more time right at the very
top<00:02:47.459> curve<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.360> back

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.440 

okay<00:02:56.110> now<00:02:57.110> on<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.319> other<00:02:57.500> side<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.970> where

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
okay now on the other side this is where

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.199 
okay now on the other side this is where
it<00:03:00.410> gets<00:03:00.590> tricky<00:03:00.800> this<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.760> where<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.120> to

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
it gets tricky this is where you have to

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.260 
it gets tricky this is where you have to
be<00:03:02.330> very<00:03:02.510> careful<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.640> can<00:03:04.640> use<00:03:04.910> your<00:03:05.030> tool

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
be very careful you can use your tool

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.900 
be very careful you can use your tool
here<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.569> bend<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.080> or<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.400> use<00:03:07.520> your<00:03:07.550> hand

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
here to bend it or you can use your hand

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.559 
here to bend it or you can use your hand
whichever<00:03:08.390> way<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.750> feel<00:03:09.080> safe<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:11.209> if<00:03:11.540> you

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
whichever way you feel safe and if you

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.300 
whichever way you feel safe and if you
do<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:11.870> with<00:03:12.050> half<00:03:12.200> hardwired<00:03:12.620> for<00:03:12.830> sure<00:03:13.010> you

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
do this with half hardwired for sure you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.600 
do this with half hardwired for sure you
will<00:03:13.489> break<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.730> pendant<00:03:14.270> so<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:16.370> always

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
will break the pendant so it's always

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.240 
will break the pendant so it's always
better<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.850> use<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.239> tool<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:17.660> then<00:03:18.500> bend<00:03:19.130> it

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
better to use the tool and then bend it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.620 
better to use the tool and then bend it
a<00:03:19.310> little<00:03:19.340> bit<00:03:19.640> later<00:03:19.819> by<00:03:20.030> hand<00:03:20.269> if<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.480> have

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
a little bit later by hand if you have

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.580 
a little bit later by hand if you have
to<00:03:21.340> okay<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:25.370> there<00:03:25.489> we<00:03:25.519> go<00:03:25.730> just<00:03:26.530> going<00:03:27.530> to

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
to okay so there we go just going to

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.790 
to okay so there we go just going to
bend<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.920> with<00:03:28.100> my<00:03:28.250> tool<00:03:30.100> okay

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.410 

now<00:03:35.800> I'm<00:03:36.220> going<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:38.880> bend<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.030> kind<00:03:40.240> of<00:03:40.330> the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
now I'm going to bend it kind of the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.190 
now I'm going to bend it kind of the
same<00:03:40.600> way<00:03:40.780> end<00:03:41.230> it<00:03:42.130> back<00:03:43.470> now<00:03:44.470> have<00:03:44.680> these<00:03:44.830> two

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
same way end it back now have these two

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:56.900 
same way end it back now have these two
wires<00:03:47.200> facing<00:03:53.940> okay<00:03:54.940> so

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
wires facing okay so

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.990 
wires facing okay so
now<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:57.600> on<00:03:57.750> there<00:03:58.370> all<00:03:59.370> we<00:03:59.490> have<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.760> do<00:03:59.850> is

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
now it's on there all we have to do is

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.700 
now it's on there all we have to do is
the<00:04:00.120> wire<00:04:00.300> up<00:04:00.540> I'm<00:04:01.140> going<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.350> take<00:04:01.440> my<00:04:01.560> round

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
the wire up I'm going to take my round

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.420 
the wire up I'm going to take my round
nose<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.220> just<00:04:03.290> wrap<00:04:04.290> one<00:04:04.800> of<00:04:04.920> these<00:04:05.130> I'm

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
nose and just wrap one of these I'm

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.220 
nose and just wrap one of these I'm
going<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.610> go<00:04:05.730> for<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:05.970> longer<00:04:06.150> one<00:04:06.450> it's<00:04:07.020> just

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
going to go for the longer one it's just

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.950 
going to go for the longer one it's just
going<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.410> be<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.650> normal<00:04:08.010> wire<00:04:08.190> up<00:04:08.960> bend

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
going to be like a normal wire up bend

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.610 
going to be like a normal wire up bend
it<00:04:10.080> backward<00:04:10.640> towards<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:13.380> kind<00:04:13.560> of

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
it backward towards you and it kind of

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.070 
it backward towards you and it kind of
depends<00:04:13.920> on<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.190> size<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.670> bail<00:04:14.910> how<00:04:15.870> big

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
depends on the size of the bail how big

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.540 
depends on the size of the bail how big
you<00:04:16.200> want<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.440> loop<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.770> be<00:04:16.800> so<00:04:17.340> I'm<00:04:17.430> just

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
you want the loop to be so I'm just

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.040 
you want the loop to be so I'm just
going<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.790> make<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.270> loop<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.690> then<00:04:18.780> I'm<00:04:18.930> going

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
going to make a loop and then I'm going

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.400 
going to make a loop and then I'm going
to<00:04:19.110> adjust<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.590> little<00:04:19.739> bit<00:04:19.860> later<00:04:20.000> and

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
to adjust it a little bit later and

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.050 
to adjust it a little bit later and
here's<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.590> bill<00:04:25.370> at<00:04:26.370> this<00:04:26.520> point<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:26.910> can

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
here's the bill at this point you can

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.370 
here's the bill at this point you can
still<00:04:27.270> change<00:04:27.510> things<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:30.140> can<00:04:31.140> make<00:04:31.230> the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
still change things you can make the

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.080 
still change things you can make the
loop<00:04:31.500> smaller<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.070> can<00:04:32.190> push<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.520> down<00:04:32.670> like<00:04:32.910> I

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
loop smaller you can push it down like I

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.580 
loop smaller you can push it down like I
kind<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:33.510> made<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.810> little<00:04:33.960> bit<00:04:34.170> too<00:04:34.260> high<00:04:34.440> up

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
kind of made it a little bit too high up

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.500 
kind of made it a little bit too high up
and<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:35.520> will<00:04:35.700> just<00:04:35.820> change<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.240> really

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
and I will just change that really

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.090 
and I will just change that really
quickly<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:37.220> quick<00:04:38.220> tip<00:04:38.430> here<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:38.880> now<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.860> wire

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
quickly a quick tip here is now the wire

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.310 
quickly a quick tip here is now the wire
the<00:04:41.730> stress<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:42.270> being<00:04:42.480> completely<00:04:42.930> put<00:04:43.140> on

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
the stress is being completely put on

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.560 
the stress is being completely put on
the<00:04:43.950> tool<00:04:44.550> while<00:04:44.850> I'm<00:04:44.940> holding<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.390> like<00:04:45.540> this

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
the tool while I'm holding it like this

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.480 
the tool while I'm holding it like this
the<00:04:46.230> stress<00:04:46.470> is<00:04:46.590> not<00:04:46.620> being<00:04:46.920> put<00:04:47.070> on<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.310> stone

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
the stress is not being put on the stone

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.060 
the stress is not being put on the stone
it<00:04:47.640> falls<00:04:47.850> if<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.210> want<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.540> pull<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:49.080> want<00:04:50.040> to

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
it falls if I want to pull it I want to

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.060 
it falls if I want to pull it I want to
pull<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.340> hard<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:51.600> do<00:04:51.750> that<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.710> see<00:04:52.920> right

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
pull it hard I can do that and see right

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.740 
pull it hard I can do that and see right
there<00:04:53.130> there's<00:04:53.490> no<00:04:53.610> stress<00:04:53.970> being<00:04:54.240> put<00:04:54.450> on<00:04:54.630> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
there there's no stress being put on the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.810 
there there's no stress being put on the
stone<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.230> now<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.220> will<00:04:56.430> put<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.670> bail<00:04:56.820> on

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
stone and now I will put the bail on

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.990 
stone and now I will put the bail on
okay

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
okay

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.760 
okay
so<00:05:00.810> now<00:05:00.900> all<00:05:00.960> there<00:05:01.230> is<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.440> do<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.650> the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
so now all there is to do is the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.130 
so now all there is to do is the
wrapping<00:05:03.140> take<00:05:04.140> your<00:05:04.260> flat<00:05:04.380> nose<00:05:05.780> put<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:06.900> on

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
wrapping take your flat nose put it on

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:13.910 
wrapping take your flat nose put it on
the<00:05:07.380> loop<00:05:09.200> above<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.410> stone<00:05:12.740> okay

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
the loop above the stone okay

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.590 
the loop above the stone okay
again<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:14.820> plier<00:05:15.090> is<00:05:17.060> shielding<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.300> the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
again the plier is shielding the the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.660 
again the plier is shielding the the
stone<00:05:18.900> from<00:05:19.080> any<00:05:19.290> stress<00:05:20.010> that's<00:05:20.250> being<00:05:20.520> put

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
stone from any stress that's being put

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.920 
stone from any stress that's being put
on<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.880> wire<00:05:21.060> so<00:05:21.320> I<00:05:22.320> can<00:05:22.850> pull<00:05:23.850> tight<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.420> I

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
on the wire so I can pull tight and I

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.990 
on the wire so I can pull tight and I
have<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.200> worry<00:05:25.380> about<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:26.250> stone<00:05:26.520> breaking

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
have to worry about the stone breaking

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.730 
have to worry about the stone breaking
or<00:05:27.240> anything<00:05:27.480> like<00:05:27.720> that<00:05:30.470> show<00:05:31.470> you<00:05:31.530> from<00:05:31.680> that

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
or anything like that show you from that

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.870 
or anything like that show you from that
angle<00:05:32.270> yep<00:05:33.270> there<00:05:33.690> we<00:05:33.870> go

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.010 

okay<00:05:38.880> well<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:39.300> is<00:05:39.419> going<00:05:39.510> to<00:05:39.600> be<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.840> front

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
okay well this is going to be the front

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.710 
okay well this is going to be the front
so<00:05:40.260> actually<00:05:40.530> I'm<00:05:40.620> going<00:05:40.710> to<00:05:40.770> go<00:05:40.860> another<00:05:41.010> half

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
so actually I'm going to go another half

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:49.100 
so actually I'm going to go another half
have<00:05:42.720> turning<00:05:46.220> there<00:05:47.220> we<00:05:47.490> go<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:48.720> hard<00:05:48.900> part

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
have turning there we go the hard part

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.500 
have turning there we go the hard part
is<00:05:49.169> done<00:05:49.410> and<00:05:49.669> all<00:05:50.669> we<00:05:50.820> have<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.030> do<00:05:51.120> is<00:05:51.300> just

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
is done and all we have to do is just

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.900 
is done and all we have to do is just
cut<00:05:51.720> these<00:05:51.840> loose<00:05:52.080> ends<00:05:52.380> so<00:05:53.160> notice<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:53.729> only

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
cut these loose ends so notice I only

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.689 
cut these loose ends so notice I only
wrapped<00:05:54.300> one<00:05:55.260> of<00:05:55.500> the<00:05:55.830> ends<00:05:56.220> and<00:05:56.340> then<00:05:56.430> the

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
wrapped one of the ends and then the

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.939 
wrapped one of the ends and then the
other<00:05:56.880> one<00:05:57.090> is<00:05:57.240> just<00:05:57.270> kind<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.780> sitting<00:05:58.500> inside

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
other one is just kind of sitting inside

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:03.140 
other one is just kind of sitting inside
being<00:05:59.220> held<00:05:59.460> in<00:05:59.610> place<00:05:59.820> by<00:06:00.389> the<00:06:00.449> other<00:06:01.639> so<00:06:02.639> now

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
being held in place by the other so now

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.610 
being held in place by the other so now
all<00:06:03.300> there<00:06:03.479> is<00:06:03.570> left<00:06:03.600> to<00:06:03.900> do<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:04.050> just<00:06:04.169> to<00:06:04.470> cut

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
all there is left to do is just to cut

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.400 
all there is left to do is just to cut
the<00:06:04.650> loose<00:06:04.860> ends<00:06:05.840> I'm<00:06:06.840> going<00:06:07.020> to<00:06:07.080> cut<00:06:07.229> it<00:06:07.320> at

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
the loose ends I'm going to cut it at

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.170 
the loose ends I'm going to cut it at
the<00:06:07.440> side<00:06:07.770> because<00:06:07.979> it's<00:06:08.190> less<00:06:08.400> noticeable<00:06:08.850> I

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
the side because it's less noticeable I

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.659 
the side because it's less noticeable I
showed<00:06:09.990> you<00:06:10.139> this<00:06:10.320> trick<00:06:10.620> where<00:06:11.400> you<00:06:11.520> don't

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
showed you this trick where you don't

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.230 
showed you this trick where you don't
actually<00:06:11.789> have<00:06:12.030> to<00:06:12.150> cut<00:06:12.389> it<00:06:12.539> just<00:06:12.720> kind<00:06:13.289> of

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
actually have to cut it just kind of

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.570 
actually have to cut it just kind of
leave<00:06:15.240> a<00:06:15.270> mark<00:06:15.600> in<00:06:15.750> it<00:06:16.070> weaken<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.160> wire<00:06:17.310> and

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
leave a mark in it weaken the wire and

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.930 
leave a mark in it weaken the wire and
then<00:06:17.669> it<00:06:17.789> just<00:06:17.940> kind<00:06:18.270> of<00:06:18.300> comes<00:06:18.479> off<00:06:18.660> like<00:06:18.840> that

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
then it just kind of comes off like that

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.270 
then it just kind of comes off like that
it's<00:06:20.940> really<00:06:21.210> good<00:06:21.870> to<00:06:22.020> get<00:06:22.169> like<00:06:22.500> right<00:06:23.130> in

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
it's really good to get like right in

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.670 
it's really good to get like right in
there<00:06:23.460> like<00:06:23.490> see<00:06:23.910> how<00:06:24.000> clean<00:06:24.270> of<00:06:24.389> a<00:06:24.510> cut<00:06:25.470> it<00:06:25.590> is

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
there like see how clean of a cut it is

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.010 
there like see how clean of a cut it is
you<00:06:26.130> can<00:06:26.340> I<00:06:26.520> don't<00:06:26.639> even<00:06:26.880> have<00:06:27.000> to<00:06:27.120> polish<00:06:27.840> it

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
you can I don't even have to polish it

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.230 
you can I don't even have to polish it
or<00:06:28.289> file<00:06:28.440> it<00:06:28.590> or<00:06:28.710> anything<00:06:28.919> okay<00:06:29.820> so<00:06:29.880> now<00:06:30.120> we're

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
or file it or anything okay so now we're

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.180 
or file it or anything okay so now we're
just<00:06:30.300> going<00:06:30.449> to<00:06:30.539> do<00:06:30.630> this<00:06:30.800> last<00:06:31.800> one<00:06:32.100> that's

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
just going to do this last one that's

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.430 
just going to do this last one that's
sticking<00:06:32.580> up<00:06:32.669> right<00:06:32.699> here<00:06:33.090> I<00:06:33.300> don't<00:06:34.080> even<00:06:34.260> have

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
sticking up right here I don't even have

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
minutes but in real life it shouldn't

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.650 
minutes but in real life it shouldn't
take<00:07:23.430> you<00:07:23.669> more<00:07:23.699> than<00:07:23.849> one<00:07:24.150> or<00:07:24.270> two<00:07:24.300> if<00:07:24.570> you

have all the pieces in front of you
ready<00:07:26.099> to<00:07:26.280> go<00:07:26.430> as<00:07:26.669> with<00:07:27.570> anything<00:07:27.810> else

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
ready to go as with anything else

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.140

practice<00:07:28.830> makes<00:07:29.070> perfect<00:07:29.310> so<00:07:29.610> if<00:07:29.820> it<00:07:29.940> takes

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
practice makes perfect so if it takes

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.930 
practice makes perfect so if it takes
longer<00:07:30.449> just<00:07:30.840> keep<00:07:30.990> at<00:07:31.169> it<00:07:31.340> if<00:07:32.340> this<00:07:32.490> video<00:07:32.820> was
