00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 the g-3 club farm is i am 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.210
 Samuel could only be well arrived in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.259
 a flight in 1.6 power 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.260
 in 2003 that goal I bought at the auction 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.970
 Werley the last year but will only 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.680
 appear in big this year even goes 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.850
 I can fix it 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.199
 not that this could have a badge 16 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 but I think a lot of people 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.250
 many people in this group decide 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:38.239
 they do this to be able finally jes is 1.0 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.579
 here in the year that they are is 8 valves of p 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.289
 I'm with the problems with this car 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.969
 relation to everything that I sent was 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:56.190
 foot 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:59.420
 one of the problems is the beacon for this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.829
 car he infiltrates 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.100
 he infiltrated has some problems with 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.100
 he 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.520
 without power and it's true I think 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.340
 precisely understood that I can not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.720
 pass through a water that this car 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.479
 fills the headlight with a lighthouse 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.290
 also in the mile lighthouse there is no more 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.360
 try not get any more water like that 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.170
 another problem I have in relation to 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.690
 to the idle actuator 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.270
 I connect this one that tells you to 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.340
 acceleration I've already looked at everything here 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.630
 Can I find the problem with this car? 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.140
 buying this car was my car . 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.090
 I dreamed I decided to buy at the auction for 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.600
 To see if it was cheaper already has ten thousand 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.229
 up to 10 thousand reais of missing one 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.460
 bit of something yet 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.959
 I set up tax on the foot everything you have on 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.399
 that was placed in the state he arrived 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:10.039
 practically with the chassis to the bodywork 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.110
 and a motor 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.400
 these other pieces of the 11th had to 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.800
 put me a lot calls me crazy but 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:25.500
 only the crazy ones know what it is to have a g3 goal 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:30.890
 my car a little something missing time 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.720

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.069
 I wanted to know about you guys what you 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.930

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.930
 the concert made clear that in relation to 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.870
