 this video will help you install the 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.460
 net moment thermostat 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.460
 here are the items you will need to 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.320
 thermostat installation 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.300
 in this installation the net relay 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.790
 tmo is connected to your boiler e 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.560
 controls the heating 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.360
 the relay communicates via radio with the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.330
 net thermostat on which you 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.430
 set the temperature 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.260
 the relay ensures the connection without 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.480
 internet wires and control a 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.170
 distance through the net application

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.600
 present you can be useful 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.700
 identified the terminals of 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.059
 power supply and 220 once identified i 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.009
 thermostat input terminals 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.110
 if necessary remove the jumper 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.470
 sometimes present on the terminals of 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.470
 thermostat 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.549
 for more information 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.859
 on the identification of the terminals 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.689
 visit the following formulas 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.890
 address 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.610
 equip yourself from the relay and the adapter 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 boiler 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.910
 connected 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.590
 the blues and browns of the boiler adapter 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.340
 and power terminals 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.259
 previously identified 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.810
 connected black and gray wires 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.700
 of the boiler adapter to the terminals of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.670
 thermostat input previously 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.860
 identified 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.250
 use the sticker provided for 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.590
 paste the boiler adapter 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.080
 connect the blue net relay 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.460
 Activation rally 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.380
 put the power back on 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.960

 thermostat installation 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.750
 join the net thermostat tmo 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.800
 insert the batteries 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.420
 the thermostat searches for the relay 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.040
 once you find the relay the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.950
 temperature thermostat signal 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.770
 environment and the desired temperature 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.930
 also called delivery temperature 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.000
 you can customize the thermostat with 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.000
 one of the colored stickers provided 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.930
 install the thermostat on the wall on the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.930
 plate 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.620
 or on its mobile support 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.860
 your thermostat is installed 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.260
 to program the thermostat e 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.330
 check the boiler distance 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.150
 install the net application tmo 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.950
