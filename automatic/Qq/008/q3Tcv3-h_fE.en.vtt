this I've done a few levels right here
I'll<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:37.829> demonstrate<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.730> then

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
I'll just demonstrate with this one then

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.190 
I'll just demonstrate with this one then
jump<00:00:39.059> into<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.360> I'm<00:00:39.540> played<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.050> yeah

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.470 
jump into that I'm played this one yeah
but<00:00:40.260> I'll<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.040> demonstrate<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.730> level<00:00:42.149> 6

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
but I'll just demonstrate with level 6

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.630 
but I'll just demonstrate with level 6
here<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> three

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
here you get you can get up to three

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.100 
here you get you can get up to three
stars<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.090> each<00:00:45.210> level<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.440> stars<00:00:46.739> by

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
stars on each level so you get stars by

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.470 
stars on each level so you get stars by
being<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> target<00:00:49.410> time<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.250> collecting<00:00:51.180> all

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
being the target time and collecting all

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
being the target time and collecting all
the<00:00:51.600> crown<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.840> oils<00:00:52.170> etc<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:53.870> just<00:00:54.870> skip

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the crown of oils etc so just skip

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.099 
the crown of oils etc so just skip
through<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.120> quickly<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
through this quickly because the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.740 
through this quickly because the
tutorials<00:00:58.649> basically<00:00:59.480> explained<00:01:00.480> how<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
tutorials basically explained how to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.039 
tutorials basically explained how to
play<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.109> game<00:01:01.730> at<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> start<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.809> can

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
play the game at the start so you can

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.500 
play the game at the start so you can
collect<00:01:04.320> those<00:01:04.559> khurana<00:01:04.949> volts<00:01:05.309> lucky<00:01:06.299> saw

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
collect those khurana volts lucky saw

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.660 
collect those khurana volts lucky saw
there<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> fall<00:01:07.860> off<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
there and if you fall off like this you

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
there and if you fall off like this you

can just hold the touchscreen and rewind
like<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.000> only<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.450> if

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
tube things to collect the energy let me

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700 
tube things to collect the energy let me
go<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.390> believe<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.960> need<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> key<00:01:22.439> to
