00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.030
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.760
 a slightly different video of me there 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.470
 many people have asked me what for 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.990
 hardware I use like ever 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.360
 my pc esbeck looks like what I mean 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.070
 here virtually every day player workers 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.360
 Whatever I thought I would take 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.820
 Just have a look with her 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.949
 you can look at this first 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.690
 we have here in 46 inch philips 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.270
 tv the just incidentally one 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.730
 little bit goes in the data to the top 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.290
 24 inch philips monitor just 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.199
 for controlling is the stream and 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.269
 below the 2k asus monitor with one 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:57.670
 resolution of 2560 to 1440 pixels of 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.629
 also used as the main monitor with me 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.260
 will come next to that 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:09.250
 microphone that sounds like that to me 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.100
 that rohde nt 1a big diaphragm microphone 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.900
 and is on a manfrotto tripod with 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.460
 ball head fastens a microphone what 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.050
 many let's play and youtube 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.260
 it is easy to assume 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.630
 proven it is super quality it has 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.780
 a low self-smoke and thus it is 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.610
 great for our purposes suitable yes 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.520
 It goes on one of the two 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.140
 large radiators Morath three of the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.940
 Total space for 940 fans has 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.540
 gets the whole system nice and cool 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.620
 especially super quiet 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.270
 next it goes directly to the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.150
 machine room and then we'll see 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.260
 we catch what we find there directly 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.140
 with the base 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.900
 as mainboard is the asus maximus 7 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:03.310
 ranger installed and as cpu I use the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.840
 747 90k overclocked to 4 6 gigahertz was 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.810
 with the water cooling course no 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.040
 problem is the two graphics cards the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.760
 underneath are two evga 670 with 4 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.959
 gb and are both water 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.730
 cooled at the bottom or in the PCI slots 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.150
 pci express slots you see the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.000
 sound card 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.879
 there is a 1a and 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.739
 blaster x-fi titanium hd with cinch 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.250
 output so I synonymous directly ans 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.290
 Mixing console can connect 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.329
 if we go down from the audio card 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.129
 and the water cooling continued 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.680
 following want to see flow sensor 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.459
 from aqua computer 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.170
 however, I will give you the whole 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.430
 Share below in the description again 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.780
 their link so you that there 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.030
 if so what for you 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.069
 interesting is the flow 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.950
 sensor goes up into the reservoir 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.040
 This is just a tube 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.090
 balancing container by von kulanz was 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.670
 I think that's about half 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.180
 liter sums up and then goes down in 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.319
 a pump pure home that is the aqua 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.200
 computer aqua stream xt usb ultra usb 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.260
 because the stop with a panel in front 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.180
 which is controlled in the computer and 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.010
 what can he be monitored right now? 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.909
 a little ahead in one of the five 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.769
 quarter inch shafts is for the 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.569
 rare moments where I do not have the 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.040
 headphones on and just over 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.359
 want to hear speakers because I 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.220
 just watching a movie or somehow 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.299
 something or just relaxed 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.239
 want to listen to music and not 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.299
 directly from the pc seats I have mine here 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.849
 two actually 310 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.349
 bookshelf only worth one 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.440
 relatively well known manufacturer in 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.379
 germany for hifi speaker 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.569
 and are also of quality for that 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.440
 you know in the upper segment 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.840
 play along 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.060
 it is not a high end but for now 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.900
 just for a pc it is already 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.220
 something very very decent 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.030
 it will progress to my keyboard 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:09.620
 is a mechanical a box or tube 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.090
 mkm catalog with black switches the 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.290
 I just think of black ones for me 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.599
 my own finger feeling on 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.180
 most pleasant and beside it looks mine 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.829
 mouse or logitech g700 I think so 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.989
 one of the best ever, the not 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.330
 Great in the hand makes no 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.070
 problems is reliable i like it 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.180
 easy 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.889
 Here we have the behringer 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.169
 mixer the xenix q 12 04 usb which 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.639
 I use to first with the microphone 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:41.179
 phantom power from 48 volts to 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.860
 and also about the sound 

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:44.749
 to mix in advance as he is in the computer 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.679
 goes and I also give the sound 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:50.319
 I can get out there beyond that 

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:54.649
 of course fast and easy between 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.869
 headphones and monitor boxes back and forth 

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:58.279
 switch 

00:04:55.869 --> 00:05:01.519
 It continues to hear my head 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:04.219
 use the dynamics are bayer dt per 990 

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:05.949
 these are studio headphones so 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:09.079
 not really from the pc area 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.089
 I also have a big jack 

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:14.209
 I prefer it because of me 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:16.489
 Do some music and you really do it there 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:18.769
 a very neutral sound picture with and has 

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:22.300
 which has a super wide frequency response 

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:25.759
 have from 5 hertz to high to i believe 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.619
 35,000 heart those headphones have the 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.719
 an ingenious price performance ratio 

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:32.719
 they are not that expensive 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:34.819
 sound really great super awesome and are 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:38.089
 also mega comfortable that means also after 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.800
 long wear after several hours to 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.329
 one just does not head to each one 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.979
 very press they just sit great 

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:44.349
 pleasant you can really long long 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.329
 work with them for a long time 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:49.639
 and last but not least, our little ones 

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:50.059

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.329
 such animals and as you can see 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.959
 just sensitive if you are so early on 

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:58.959
 disturbs tomorrow 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.250
 I hope you have the little insight 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:15.430
 here with me in my empire fallen 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.319
 and maybe it will help you too 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.569
 he just in one anyway 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:21.370
 purchase decision or in an in 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.139
 a consideration that you something 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.550
 The things I wanted to buy

 I can use them all without exception 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.660
 really a clear recommendation 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.900
 pronounce 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.580
 in every single device works in 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.759
 I am very good at his area super good 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.349
 with satisfaction and without exception if 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.940
 we have any other questions 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.009
 to the hardware or at all 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.139
 Any questions around the channel 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.430
