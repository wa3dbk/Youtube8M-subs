00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
models i think i've ever made a very

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.610 
models i think i've ever made a very
demanding<00:01:17.000> very<00:01:18.910> very<00:01:19.910> skill<00:01:20.620> orientated

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
demanding very very skill orientated

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.390 
demanding very very skill orientated
which<00:01:22.270> i'm<00:01:23.270> usually<00:01:24.200> not<00:01:24.440> real<00:01:24.800> wild<00:01:25.160> about

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
which i'm usually not real wild about

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.210 
which i'm usually not real wild about
but<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:27.170> can't<00:01:27.500> argue<00:01:27.650> with<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.040> results

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
but you can't argue with the results

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.720 
but you can't argue with the results
it's<00:01:29.530> really<00:01:30.530> really<00:01:30.980> really<00:01:31.220> pretty<00:01:31.700> um<00:01:32.350> in

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
it's really really really pretty um in

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.030 
it's really really really pretty um in
this<00:01:34.730> one<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.870> is<00:01:36.050> very<00:01:36.260> strange<00:01:36.650> job

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
this one this is very strange job

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.520 
this one this is very strange job
because<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.460> almost<00:01:37.700> never<00:01:38.500> produce<00:01:39.500> a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
because I almost never produce a

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.170 
because I almost never produce a
pre-designed<00:01:42.530> models<00:01:43.160> because<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:43.760> goes

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
pre-designed models because it just goes

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.460 
pre-designed models because it just goes
against<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:45.080> grain<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.410> who<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:45.770> am<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:47.050> was<00:01:48.050> the

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
against the grain of who I am I was the

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.400 
against the grain of who I am I was the
Lego<00:01:48.740> kid<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.400> would<00:01:49.550> get<00:01:49.730> the<00:01:49.880> Legos<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.540> I

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
Lego kid that would get the Legos and I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.350 
Lego kid that would get the Legos and I
would<00:01:51.830> never<00:01:52.010> build<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.550> model<00:01:52.940> until<00:01:53.300> I

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
would never build the model until I

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.340 
would never build the model until I
built<00:01:53.660> like<00:01:53.870> 50<00:01:54.320> other<00:01:54.770> things<00:01:55.810> usually<00:01:56.810> never

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
built like 50 other things usually never

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.270 
built like 50 other things usually never
making<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.980> model<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:59.000> most<00:01:59.300> instances<00:02:00.280> these

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
making the model in most instances these

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.130 
making the model in most instances these
are<00:02:01.430> going<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.610> be<00:02:01.700> some<00:02:01.970> steps<00:02:02.840> they're<00:02:03.050> gonna

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
are going to be some steps they're gonna

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.470 
are going to be some steps they're gonna
be<00:02:03.260> going<00:02:03.530> up<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:03.920> might<00:02:04.190> be<00:02:05.060> doing<00:02:05.180> some

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
be going up I might be doing some

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.440 
be going up I might be doing some
further<00:02:06.110> modifications<00:02:06.890> on<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.160> hill<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
further modifications on the hill the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.570 
further modifications on the hill the
other<00:02:08.660> reason<00:02:08.960> i'm<00:02:09.200> doing<00:02:09.230> this<00:02:09.470> video<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:10.300> I'm

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
other reason i'm doing this video is I'm

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.970 
other reason i'm doing this video is I'm
trying<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.940> get<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.240> touch<00:02:14.420> with<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.050> client

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
trying to get in touch with the client

trying to get in touch with the client
which<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.370> believe<00:02:16.640> still<00:02:16.910> does<00:02:17.090> not<00:02:17.120> have

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
which I believe still does not have

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.070 
which I believe still does not have
power<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.970> idea<00:02:20.270> i'm<00:02:20.390> throwing<00:02:20.780> out<00:02:20.900> is

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
power and the idea i'm throwing out is

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.140 
power and the idea i'm throwing out is
i'm<00:02:21.200> thinking<00:02:21.560> about<00:02:21.709> doing<00:02:21.920> grass<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:23.090> the

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
and doing stonework along the edges so

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.520 
and doing stonework along the edges so
uh<00:02:33.130> that's<00:02:34.130> what<00:02:34.310> I'm<00:02:34.370> thinking<00:02:34.640> about<00:02:34.670> doing

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530
