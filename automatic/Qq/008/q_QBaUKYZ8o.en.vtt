here at last right now I'm working with

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.070 
here at last right now I'm working with

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
the IU vs team maven mission to Mars so

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.870 
the IU vs team maven mission to Mars so
the<00:00:34.320> philosophy<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:34.860> NASA's<00:00:35.310> Mars<00:00:35.550> program

the philosophy of NASA's Mars program

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.330 
the philosophy of NASA's Mars program
has<00:00:36.420> been<00:00:36.450> follow<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> water<00:00:37.560> but<00:00:38.100> where<00:00:38.310> did

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
has been follow the water but where did

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.520 
has been follow the water but where did
the<00:00:38.490> atmosphere<00:00:39.150> go<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.600> still<00:00:39.990> a<00:00:40.020> lingering

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the atmosphere go was still a lingering

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.620 
the atmosphere go was still a lingering
question<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.490> maven<00:00:41.880> is<00:00:42.000> designed<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
question and so maven is designed to

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.670 
question and so maven is designed to
figure<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.080> whether<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.500> that

figure out whether or not that

to look very closely at an emission from

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.559 
to look very closely at an emission from
hydrogen<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.829> look<00:01:23.039> so<00:01:23.310> closely<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.060> we

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
hydrogen and we look so closely that we

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.660 
hydrogen and we look so closely that we
can<00:01:24.780> tell<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.409> difference<00:01:25.649> between<00:01:25.920> hydrogen

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
can tell the difference between hydrogen

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.090 
can tell the difference between hydrogen
and<00:01:27.060> heavy<00:01:27.359> hydrogen<00:01:27.719> called<00:01:28.200> deuterium<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and heavy hydrogen called deuterium and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.919 
and heavy hydrogen called deuterium and
by<00:01:29.280> measuring<00:01:29.639> the<00:01:29.729> ratio<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> heavy<00:01:30.600> hydrogen

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929

by measuring the ratio of heavy hydrogen
to<00:01:31.289> light<00:01:31.469> hydrogen<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.819> a<00:01:32.880> good

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
to light hydrogen we can get a good

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.419 
to light hydrogen we can get a good
guess<00:01:33.389> just<00:01:34.049> how<00:01:34.259> much<00:01:34.439> water<00:01:34.770> has<00:01:35.009> escaped

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
guess just how much water has escaped

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.010 
guess just how much water has escaped
from<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> planet<00:01:36.060> now<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.600> has<00:01:36.749> been<00:01:36.869> done

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
from the planet now this has been done

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.139 
from the planet now this has been done
before<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.889> lower<00:01:38.189> atmosphere<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.030> it's

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
before in the lower atmosphere but it's

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.190 
before in the lower atmosphere but it's
never<00:01:39.329> been<00:01:39.479> done<00:01:39.539> in<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:39.960> upper<00:01:40.170> atmosphere

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
never been done in the upper atmosphere

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
never been done in the upper atmosphere
where<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> escape<00:01:41.429> is<00:01:41.609> actually<00:01:41.969> occurring

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
where the escape is actually occurring

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.289 
where the escape is actually occurring
so<00:01:42.630> that's<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.929> to<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.170> first<00:01:43.469> for<00:01:43.619> me

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
so that's going to be a first for me

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.639 
so that's going to be a first for me
I've<00:01:45.299> worked<00:01:45.539> on<00:01:45.689> many<00:01:45.780> planetary<00:01:46.350> missions

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
I've worked on many planetary missions

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.499 
I've worked on many planetary missions
all<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.039> way<00:01:47.130> back<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.609> nine<00:01:47.969> or<00:01:48.179> six<00:01:48.359> and

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
all the way back to nine or six and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.059 
all the way back to nine or six and
seven<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> beginning<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> my<00:01:49.740> scientific

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
seven at the beginning of my scientific

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.459 
seven at the beginning of my scientific
careers<00:01:50.609> that's<00:01:51.119> what<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> worked<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.719> Mars<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
careers that's what I worked on Mars and

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.370 
careers that's what I worked on Mars and
so<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:52.889> I'm<00:01:53.159> almost<00:01:53.459> at<00:01:53.639> the<00:01:53.729> end<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.259> it's<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
so here I'm almost at the end and it's a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.679 
so here I'm almost at the end and it's a
real<00:01:55.530> pleasure<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.009> go<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.279> to<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:57.299> Mars<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
real pleasure to go back to to Mars and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.989 
real pleasure to go back to to Mars and
study<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.679> more<00:01:59.009> detail<00:01:59.039> asking<00:01:59.850> better
