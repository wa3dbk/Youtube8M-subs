00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.610
OK, some of the most common concerns or worries
that I hear expressed about Ikito [sp?] is

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.290
in the role of Ukay [sp?].

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.670
So in our relationship, I'm Nagay [sp?] or
the person that's performing the technique

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.770
and throwing.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.270
Ukay is the person receiving the technique
or is going to be doing Ukenny [sp?] which

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.270
is the act of falling.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.630
So, in one of the most basic demonstrations
that we can see from Yakuhami Kata de tori

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.360
[sp?] is the basic opening of tino heiko [sp?]
so I curl the wrist in tenkan [sp?].

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.340
My partner stays closely attached and moves
close to me.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.990
He ends up being in a fairly disadvantageous
position.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.080
A lot of people ask 'why is he going to follow?'

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.030
Well first off, as the attacker you're grabbing
my hand because I'm a potential threat to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.120
you or maybe I'm a target that you want to
strike.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.220
If I just pull away and let that hand get
away then you've kind of failed your role

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.070
as the attacker.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.189
In this specific type of movement, as I tenkan
and move by, my Ukay is going to keep a good

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.799
solid connection with the hand.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.130
If he does not and decides to stand there
and let me slip away, that's when I become

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.150
dangerous.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.760
in the role of Ukenny, the closer you are
to me, I can't hit, no matter how hard I try

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.470
and thrust, he's connected.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.920
The throw happens in our body.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.480
If he gives me room and pulls away, that strike
becomes much more dangerous than it would

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.020
have if you'd stayed connected.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.280
Some of the other techniques, you might wonder
why our partners flip and fly all over the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.280
place.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.060
Well, we're going to do that to protect ourselves
from Ikito like I've mentioned before.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.550
So basic technique like Kodaguishi [sp?],
you wonder, you see people flip all the way

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.460
over.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.220
Why would somebody flip and fly?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.520
Well, if you don't, if you just stand there
and let that happen and try to stay stable,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.590
a large section of your arm is in quite a
bit of danger so you want to allow yourself

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.450
to move comfortably and flexibly and follow
your own body.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.730
So stay connected.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.970
Once you've created a connection, keep that
connection.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.540
Stay close so that I don't have room to strike
you and move comfortably.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.470
Stay connected and don't try to fight the
technique.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.580
Stay connected, stay loose, stay comfortable
and protect your body from Ikito.
