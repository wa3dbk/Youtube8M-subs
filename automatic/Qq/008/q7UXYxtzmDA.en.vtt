purpose<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.500> respect<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.820> don't

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
purpose in that respect that I don't

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.330 
purpose in that respect that I don't
really<00:01:51.299> want<00:01:51.479> junk<00:01:51.689> food<00:01:51.930> anymore<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.770> i'm

actually eating way smaller portions

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.800 
actually eating way smaller portions
then<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.299> used<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.840> eat<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.380> used<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> eat<00:01:58.740> Oh

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.480 
then I used to eat like I used to eat Oh
like<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.229> went<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> restaurant<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.280> get

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
like if I went to a restaurant I get

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.609 
like if I went to a restaurant I get
like<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.820> whole<00:02:03.390> serving<00:02:04.020> size<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> just

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
like the whole serving size and I just

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.870 
like the whole serving size and I just
eat<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> whole<00:02:04.950> thing<00:02:05.009> now<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> can't<00:02:05.820> even

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
eat the whole thing now I can't even

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.059 
eat the whole thing now I can't even
imagine<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.600> eating<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> entire<00:02:07.170> serving

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
imagine just eating the entire serving

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.190 
imagine just eating the entire serving
that<00:02:08.369> they<00:02:08.489> bring<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> me<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:09.989> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
that they bring to me like I have to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.140 
that they bring to me like I have to
take<00:02:10.379> some<00:02:10.560> home

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
take some home

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.059 
take some home
I<00:02:11.209> share<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.629> with<00:02:11.689> a<00:02:11.810> friend<00:02:11.900> or<00:02:12.170> something<00:02:12.230> so

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
I share it with a friend or something so

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.509 
I share it with a friend or something so
I<00:02:13.400> think<00:02:13.519> it's<00:02:13.819> really<00:02:13.909> good<00:02:14.360> um<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:16.159> mastic

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
I think it's really good um the mastic

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.630 
I think it's really good um the mastic
line<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.790> not<00:02:16.939> just<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:18.250> make<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.370> lose<00:02:19.610> weight

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
line is not just to make you lose weight

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.119

but it's actually you know reset your
body<00:02:22.189> in<00:02:22.879> terms<00:02:23.269> of<00:02:23.510> what<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.900> should<00:02:23.930> be

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
body in terms of what it should be

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.960

if its water weight or it's actually
pounds<00:03:13.189> gained<00:03:13.639> back<00:03:13.909> because<00:03:14.389> like<00:03:15.109> a<00:03:15.410> day<00:03:15.889> or

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
pounds gained back because like a day or

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.830 
pounds gained back because like a day or
two<00:03:16.250> after<00:03:16.549> i<00:03:16.790> stopped<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.269> master<00:03:17.629> cleanse

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
two after i stopped the master cleanse

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.890 
two after i stopped the master cleanse
it<00:03:18.470> became<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.459> time<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:19.910> month<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.870> i

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
it became that time of the month so i

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.080 
it became that time of the month so i
usually<00:03:21.169> gain<00:03:21.590> couple<00:03:22.099> pounds<00:03:22.280> during<00:03:22.849> that

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
usually gain couple pounds during that

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.270 
usually gain couple pounds during that
time<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:23.599> i'll<00:03:23.720> make<00:03:23.870> another<00:03:23.989> video<00:03:24.440> when

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
time so i'll make another video when

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.390 
time so i'll make another video when
that's<00:03:25.519> over<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.329> I<00:03:26.389> can<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:27.500> know<00:03:27.530> see<00:03:28.370> how

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
that's over so I can you know see how

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.089 
that's over so I can you know see how
much<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.970> actually<00:03:29.239> gain<00:03:29.810> back<00:03:30.139> I<00:03:30.409> don't<00:03:30.889> really

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
much I actually gain back I don't really

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.949 
much I actually gain back I don't really
think<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.579> gained<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.909> much<00:03:31.970> back<00:03:32.359> so<00:03:32.599> because

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
think I gained that much back so because

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.930 
think I gained that much back so because
my<00:03:33.500> clothes<00:03:33.829> are<00:03:34.040> still<00:03:34.220> kind<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:34.519> fitting<00:03:34.819> the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
my clothes are still kind of fitting the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.000 
my clothes are still kind of fitting the
same<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.449> just<00:03:35.930> feel<00:03:36.109> a<00:03:36.169> little<00:03:36.290> bit<00:03:36.560> puffy

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
same I just feel a little bit puffy

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.979 
same I just feel a little bit puffy
which<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.489> probably<00:03:38.019> because<00:03:39.129> it's<00:03:40.129> that<00:03:40.340> time
