00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.440 

and<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:14.400> where<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:14.760> connect<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and that's where it will connect to the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
and that's where it will connect to the
bond<00:01:17.360> we<00:01:18.360> clamp<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.229> heat<00:01:22.189> clamp

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
bond we clamp it in with this heat clamp

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.640 
bond we clamp it in with this heat clamp
it<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.430> burn<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:24.990> wit<00:01:25.530> our

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
motion just like robin press the bond in

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
motion just like robin press the bond in
we're<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> put<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.420> roughly<00:01:34.229> 200<00:01:35.100> to

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
too much of cutting of the extensions

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.290 
too much of cutting of the extensions
rather<00:04:41.860> doing<00:04:42.639> like<00:04:42.759> a<00:04:42.789> little<00:04:43.060> bit<00:04:43.180> of<00:04:43.210> a

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
rather doing like a little bit of a

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.040 
rather doing like a little bit of a
layer<00:04:43.509> sort<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:43.930> thing<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:46.330> can<00:04:46.509> kind<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.870> like

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
layer sort of thing you can kind of like

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.659 
layer sort of thing you can kind of like
by<00:04:47.500> feel<00:04:47.889> see<00:04:48.430> how<00:04:48.759> where<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:50.370> where<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:51.490> needs

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
by feel see how where the where it needs

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.170 
by feel see how where the where it needs
to<00:04:51.819> be<00:04:52.770> layered<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:54.430> can<00:04:54.520> see<00:04:54.699> like<00:04:54.849> her<00:04:55.000> hair

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
to be layered you can see like her hair

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.510 
to be layered you can see like her hair
is<00:04:55.270> quite<00:04:55.419> short<00:04:56.099> we're<00:04:57.099> going<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.340> have<00:04:57.430> to

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
is quite short we're going to have to

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.700 
is quite short we're going to have to
lay<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:57.789> all<00:04:57.909> down<00:04:57.969> in<00:04:58.389> there<00:04:58.599> mostly<00:04:59.500> through

the front a lot around the face just to

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.330 
the front a lot around the face just to
match<00:05:01.990> into<00:05:02.289> these<00:05:02.409> shorter<00:05:02.800> layers<00:05:02.979> for<00:05:03.310> the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
match into these shorter layers for the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.480 
match into these shorter layers for the
all<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:03.819> fringe<00:05:04.120> for<00:05:04.509> the<00:05:04.599> front<00:05:04.870> fringe<00:05:05.860> you

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
all the fringe for the front fringe you

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.719 
all the fringe for the front fringe you
what<00:05:06.969> it<00:05:07.090> legs<00:05:07.979> maybe<00:05:08.979> if<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.610> is<00:05:11.340> down<00:05:12.340> down

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
what it legs maybe if it is down down

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.189
