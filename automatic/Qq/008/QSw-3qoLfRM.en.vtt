 hello in this tutorial I will show you how 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:16.529
 make paper crepe tulips 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.510
 materials that you will need are paper 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.630
 crepe green and some other color that you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.690
 please silicon scissors and sticks 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.690
 wood 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.880
 first cut out four rectangles of 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.880
 crepe paper measuring 13 x 5 centimeters 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.250
 also cut out a strip of paper 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.010
 green about 2 cm thick 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.400
 and a long, thin sheet as well as 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.400
 is 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.520
 twist each one of the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.650
 rectangles and on top both sides like 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.670
 trying to give it a petal shape with 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.670
 fingers like that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.659
 then use a little bit the tips 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.579
 i 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.170
 to 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 now take the wooden stick and with a 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.950
 little silicon glued petals on the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.950
 tip 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.490
 immediately sticks the other two petals 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.900
 alternating the position trying to 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.900
 cover the spaces very well 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.290
 to cover this part that was half 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.180
 Ugly adds more silicon and sticks the band aid 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.140
 of green crepe paper in the part that 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.140
 you want to hide 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.910
 continue lining the entire stick to 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.490
 end cut the excess and paste the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:47.220
 tip with a little more silicone 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.220
 finally vega the leaf to stem 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.180
 Ready so you'll have this nice tulip 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.310
 try to make more tulips 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.440
 different colors you can even 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.150
 make bigger you just need 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.310
 cut rectangles of dimensions 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.620
 older so that the petals are more 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.019
 big 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.030
 and when you already have several tulips 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.069
 you can place them in some vase for 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.379
 decorating the best of these flowers is that 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.800
 They are very cheap, easy to make and do not 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.560
 wither 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.210
