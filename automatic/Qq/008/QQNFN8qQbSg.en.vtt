your ring stoppers first this stops the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.429 
your ring stoppers first this stops the
piece<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.390> forms<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.960> stops<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
piece it forms it and then it stops the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.499 
piece it forms it and then it stops the
piece<00:01:49.619> when<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> fire<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.030> choose

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
piece when you fire it so you choose

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.450 
piece when you fire it so you choose
this<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> size<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.890> want<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.310> ring

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this in the size that you want your ring

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.679 
this in the size that you want your ring
to<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.820> when<00:01:53.970> you're<00:01:54.119> finished<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.540> is

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
to be when you're finished this is

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.780 
to be when you're finished this is
actually<00:01:55.200> about<00:01:55.290> two<00:01:55.590> sizes<00:01:56.100> larger<00:01:56.130> because

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
actually about two sizes larger because

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.370 
actually about two sizes larger because
the<00:01:57.030> clay<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> shrink<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.140> we're

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the clay is going to shrink so we're

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.649 
the clay is going to shrink so we're
going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.590> form<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> around<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.450> are

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
going to form it around this and we are

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719 
going to form it around this and we are
going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.740> would<00:02:01.890> put<00:02:02.100> some<00:02:02.280> clay<00:02:02.520> on

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
going to what we would put some clay on

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.039 
going to what we would put some clay on
it<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.360> looks<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.020> your

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it and it looks like you have your

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.709 
it and it looks like you have your
teflon<00:02:04.890> service<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:05.820> nonstick<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
teflon service here so it's nonstick and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.889 
teflon service here so it's nonstick and
then<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.110> put<00:02:07.409> our<00:02:07.729> nonstick<00:02:08.729> spray<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.660> here

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
then we put our nonstick spray on here

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.660 
then we put our nonstick spray on here
as<00:02:10.020> well<00:02:10.200> because<00:02:10.770> otherwise<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.310> point<00:02:11.550> will

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
as well because otherwise the point will

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.200 
as well because otherwise the point will
stick<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
stick to

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.390 
stick to
mm-hmm<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.020> what<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.350> would<00:02:13.530> normally<00:02:13.740> do<00:02:14.250> is

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
mm-hmm so what we would normally do is

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.280 
mm-hmm so what we would normally do is
we<00:02:14.550> would<00:02:14.730> take<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.120> piece<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.660> cut<00:02:15.990> we

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
we would take this piece that's cut we

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.990 
we would take this piece that's cut we
would<00:02:16.470> wrap<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.890> around<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.850> would

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
would wrap it around here and we would

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.500 
would wrap it around here and we would
let<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.330> dry<00:02:18.570> ok<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:20.160> piece<00:02:20.460> is<00:02:20.670> dried<00:02:20.910> so

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
let it dry ok now this piece is dried so

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.100 
let it dry ok now this piece is dried so
once<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.870> has<00:02:22.080> dried<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.740> go<00:02:23.490> ahead<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.820> we

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
once it has dried we go ahead and we

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.110 
once it has dried we go ahead and we
finish<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.520> want<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> do<00:02:26.850> all<00:02:26.970> your

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
finish it and you want to do all your

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.180 
finish it and you want to do all your
finish<00:02:27.390> work<00:02:27.920> before<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:30.710> fire<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:31.740> because

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
finish work before you fire it because

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.530 
finish work before you fire it because
it's<00:02:32.370> much<00:02:32.580> easier<00:02:32.610> when<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.360> clay

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it's much easier when it's in the clay

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.590 
it's much easier when it's in the clay
form<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:35.030> when<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.180> say<00:02:36.390> that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
form then but it's when you say that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.030 
form then but it's when you say that
it's<00:02:36.750> dry<00:02:37.050> you're<00:02:37.350> just<00:02:37.560> saying<00:02:37.740> it's<00:02:37.860> air

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
it's dry you're just saying it's air

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.100 
it's dry you're just saying it's air
dried<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:38.580> life<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.210> air<00:02:39.420> dry<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.780> you

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
dried for life you can air dry it you

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.770 
dried for life you can air dry it you
can<00:02:40.320> put<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.710> on<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:41.100> coffee<00:02:41.520> cup<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.540> know<00:02:42.660> when

this we are gonna torch this bright

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.010 
this we are gonna torch this bright
orange<00:03:52.020> am<00:03:52.230> i<00:03:52.350> right<00:03:52.530> yes<00:03:53.130> okay<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.330> we're<00:03:54.870> not

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
orange am i right yes okay and we're not

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.010 
orange am i right yes okay and we're not
going<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.410> do<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:56.030> do<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.150> completely<00:03:57.690> here

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
going to do that do it completely here

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.050 
going to do that do it completely here
because<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.440> takes<00:03:58.950> three<00:03:59.310> minutes<00:03:59.490> but<00:03:59.910> the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
because it takes three minutes but the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.560 
because it takes three minutes but the
idea<00:04:00.570> is<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.930> just<00:04:01.530> keep<00:04:02.120> torching<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.210> you<00:04:03.390> can

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
idea is to just keep torching it you can

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.010 
idea is to just keep torching it you can
even<00:04:03.720> fire<00:04:04.110> on<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.240> when<00:04:06.240> you<00:04:06.270> get<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.990> that

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
even fire on it and when you get to that

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.380 
even fire on it and when you get to that
beautiful<00:04:07.700> glowing<00:04:08.700> orange<00:04:09.570> color<00:04:11.210> you<00:04:12.210> go

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
beautiful glowing orange color you go

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
beautiful glowing orange color you go
ahead<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.900> keep<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.350> hot<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.830> even<00:04:14.840> for<00:04:15.840> three

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
ahead and keep it hot and even for three

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.229 
ahead and keep it hot and even for three
minutes<00:04:16.710> okay

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239

okay and now can you fire any kind of
pmc<00:04:33.520> with<00:04:33.699> the<00:04:33.789> torch<00:04:34.030> like<00:04:34.270> this<00:04:34.509> no<00:04:35.080> you<00:04:35.139> want

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
pmc with the torch like this no you want

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.820 
pmc with the torch like this no you want
to<00:04:35.800> only<00:04:36.009> use<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:37.389> what<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.810> can<00:04:38.080> but<00:04:38.620> you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
to only use the what you can but you

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.399 
to only use the what you can but you
want<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.250> only<00:04:39.400> use<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.909> pmc<00:04:40.539> 3<00:04:40.840> formula

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
want to only use the pmc 3 formula

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.309 
want to only use the pmc 3 formula
because<00:04:41.830> what<00:04:42.580> happens<00:04:42.970> is<00:04:43.180> um<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:44.169> other

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
because what happens is um the other

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.770 
because what happens is um the other
formulas<00:04:44.940> need<00:04:45.940> a<00:04:45.970> higher<00:04:46.240> longer

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
formulas need a higher longer

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.469 
formulas need a higher longer
temperature<00:04:47.259> okay<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:47.740> this<00:04:48.009> is<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.220> video<00:04:48.669> this

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
temperature okay so this is a video this

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.969 
temperature okay so this is a video this
is<00:04:49.659> the<00:04:49.810> best<00:04:50.020> one<00:04:50.229> when<00:04:50.469> you're<00:04:50.560> using<00:04:50.800> the

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
is the best one when you're using the

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.320 
is the best one when you're using the
torch<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.580> then<00:04:51.849> it's<00:04:51.969> going<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.180> look<00:04:52.300> like

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
torch and then it's going to look like

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.959 
torch and then it's going to look like
this<00:04:52.449> dad<00:04:53.050> it's<00:04:53.199> gone<00:04:53.379> this<00:04:53.590> like<00:04:53.770> this<00:04:54.039> so

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
this dad it's gone this like this so
