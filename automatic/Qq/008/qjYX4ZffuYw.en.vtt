pretty good i decided to come down to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.490 
pretty good i decided to come down to
the<00:00:10.320> lake<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.269> walk<00:00:12.269> out<00:00:12.540> across<00:00:12.780> here<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> see

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
the lake and walk out across here to see

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.039 
the lake and walk out across here to see
if<00:00:13.650> any<00:00:13.950> water<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.610> actually<00:00:14.910> making<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
if any water is actually making it to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.830 
if any water is actually making it to
the<00:00:16.260> lake<00:00:16.970> but<00:00:17.970> i'm<00:00:18.119> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> walk<00:00:18.510> across

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
the lake but i'm going to walk across

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.859 
the lake but i'm going to walk across
that<00:00:18.960> flat<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.760> if<00:00:20.880> i<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.210> find<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.630> main

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that flat to see if i can find the main

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.400 
that flat to see if i can find the main
freaking<00:00:22.439> camel<00:00:22.859> i<00:00:23.779> decided<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.990> go<00:00:25.019> around

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
freaking camel i decided to go around

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.740 
freaking camel i decided to go around
the<00:00:25.590> point<00:00:25.890> instead<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.210> across<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
the point instead of out and across the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.950 
the point instead of out and across the
flat<00:00:28.550> it'd<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.730> easier<00:00:30.090> traveling<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
flat it'd be easier traveling and I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.330 
flat it'd be easier traveling and I
don't<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.410> it'd<00:00:31.560> be<00:00:31.679> quite<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.980> swampy<00:00:37.340> just

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
don't think it'd be quite a swampy just

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.869 
don't think it'd be quite a swampy just
a<00:00:38.489> little<00:00:38.730> ways<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.149> from<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> boat<00:00:39.719> ramp

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
a little ways up from the boat ramp

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.610 
a little ways up from the boat ramp
you'll<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> lower<00:00:42.390> parts<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.200> filling

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
you'll see the lower parts are filling

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.760 
you'll see the lower parts are filling
up<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:43.890> water<00:00:44.719> yes<00:00:45.719> that's<00:00:45.989> how<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> starts

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
up with water yes that's how it starts

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.619 
up with water yes that's how it starts
but<00:00:48.050> now<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> earth<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.620> pulled<00:00:49.980> away<00:00:50.129> here

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
but now the earth is pulled away here

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.290 
but now the earth is pulled away here
that<00:00:51.629> area<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.350> sinking<00:00:53.840> hey<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
that area there is sinking hey that

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.240 
that area there is sinking hey that
water's<00:00:57.300> down<00:00:57.510> there<00:00:57.949> just<00:00:58.949> under<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
water's down there just under the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.690 
water's down there just under the
surface<00:01:02.480> that's<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.070> high<00:01:05.070> ridge<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
surface that's the high ridge the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.789 
surface that's the high ridge the
original<00:01:06.180> cheek<00:01:06.420> creek<00:01:06.960> channel<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.530> just

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
original cheek creek channel was just

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.550 
original cheek creek channel was just
right<00:01:08.010> here<00:01:08.510> but<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.080> more<00:01:10.170> out

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
right here but I think it's more out

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.210 
right here but I think it's more out
toward<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> middle<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.720> lake<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.220> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
toward the middle of the lake now it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.980 
toward the middle of the lake now it
appears<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.850> though<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.180> might<00:01:15.479> actually<00:01:15.720> be

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
appears as though this might actually be

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.550 
appears as though this might actually be
the<00:01:16.470> creek<00:01:17.280> channel<00:01:17.840> that's<00:01:18.840> about<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> right

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the creek channel that's about the right

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.580 
the creek channel that's about the right
amount<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.189> water<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:21.170> can't<00:01:22.170> tell<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.500> it's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
amount of water I can't tell if it's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.620 
amount of water I can't tell if it's
flowing<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.939> flat<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.420> two

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
flowing or so flat out here the two

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.690 
flowing or so flat out here the two
creeks<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.229> come<00:01:28.500> together<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.159> up<00:01:29.400> their

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
creeks do come together right up their

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.499 
creeks do come together right up their
nails<00:01:30.570> creaking<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> wall<00:01:31.350> Creek<00:01:32.299> guess<00:01:33.299> they

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
nails creaking a wall Creek guess they

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.399 
nails creaking a wall Creek guess they
come<00:01:33.720> on

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
come on

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.990 
come on
so<00:01:36.409> that<00:01:36.619> could<00:01:36.860> be<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.659> main<00:01:38.659> channel<00:01:40.000> well

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
so that could be the main channel well

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.560 
so that could be the main channel well
the<00:01:41.210> creek<00:01:41.509> kind<00:01:41.750> of<00:01:41.840> plays<00:01:42.049> out<00:01:42.350> right<00:01:42.380> there

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
the creek kind of plays out right there

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.200 
the creek kind of plays out right there
you<00:01:44.570> see<00:01:44.810> where<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:44.990> comes<00:01:45.140> down<00:01:45.409> turns<00:01:45.770> back

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
you see where it comes down turns back

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.310 
you see where it comes down turns back
north<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.950> kind<00:01:49.159> of<00:01:49.220> disappears<00:01:50.320> that

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
north and just kind of disappears that

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.600 
north and just kind of disappears that
might<00:01:51.770> be<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:54.200> might<00:01:54.560> be<00:01:54.590> as<00:01:54.890> far<00:01:55.220> as<00:01:55.399> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
might be it that might be as far as the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.539 
might be it that might be as far as the
water<00:01:55.909> has<00:01:56.240> made<00:01:56.509> it<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.830> creeks<00:01:58.100> are<00:01:58.250> flowing

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
water has made it the creeks are flowing

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.230 
water has made it the creeks are flowing
but<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:58.970> not<00:01:59.119> you<00:01:59.390> know<00:01:59.479> not<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.869> flood<00:02:01.240> I'm

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
but it's not you know not a flood I'm

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.090 
but it's not you know not a flood I'm
going<00:02:02.539> to<00:02:02.659> continue<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.439> go<00:02:03.590> across<00:02:03.799> there

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
going to continue to go across there

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:18.790 
going to continue to go across there
just<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.399> make<00:02:04.580> sure<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:06.100> muddy<00:02:07.390> soft

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.170 

well<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:20.060> pretty<00:02:20.930> well<00:02:21.170> tells<00:02:21.590> me<00:02:22.150> what<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
well this pretty well tells me what I

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.570 
well this pretty well tells me what I
needed<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.780> know

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
needed to know

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.460 
needed to know
see<00:02:26.480> how<00:02:26.690> that

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
see how that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.960 
see how that
ariat<00:02:29.470> drops<00:02:29.800> off<00:02:30.040> just<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.460> little<00:02:30.490> bit<00:02:30.670> that's

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
ariat drops off just a little bit that's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.830 
ariat drops off just a little bit that's
the<00:02:31.210> original<00:02:31.480> creek<00:02:32.020> channel<00:02:33.360> see<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.390> just

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the original creek channel see I just

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.160 
the original creek channel see I just
barely<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:36.730> see<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:37.240> got<00:02:37.390> watering<00:02:37.930> but

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
barely can see it's got watering but

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.270 
barely can see it's got watering but
it's<00:02:38.350> definitely<00:02:38.590> not<00:02:38.860> going<00:02:41.070> follow<00:02:42.070> this

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
it's definitely not going follow this

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.960 
it's definitely not going follow this
down<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.860> see<00:02:45.070> it's<00:02:45.190> got<00:02:45.310> some<00:02:45.550> water<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:45.940> it

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
down you see it's got some water in it
