00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.540
 Well, we've already come from the field and 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.730
 we are in the hour of the mountains this is 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.420
 in the new polygon that have been made 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.400
 for ships for beekeepers in the area and 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.960
 we are going to explain to you on the one hand the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.980
 technological innovations that we have 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.560
 made a pitt on me that is a 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.779
 consultancy that was funded by a 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.180
 young initiative and on the other hand with a 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.280
 Innovative and young zone beekeeper 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.980
 let's see the jobs that are done 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.699
 now during wintering and in the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.230
 warehouse 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.469
 this is a computer software that 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.090
 we have developed since 2002 and 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.570
 what it allows is for beekeepers 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.540
 through a visit card or a 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.000
 voice recorder collect data for 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.550
 that the next visit has organized and 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.410
 know effectively what it is that you have to 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.809
 make in each hive not the software 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.879
 computer consists of a control of 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.520
 you reign a control of apiaries a control 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.820
 sanitary feeding a relationship 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.380
 of jobs produced in warehouse then 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.660
 a series of reports that are very useful 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.149
 because the beekeeper can know why 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.220
 there has been a series of mortality 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.760
 in a series of beehives or for each 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.560
 feeding 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.770
 because I buy the queens to another 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.080
 beekeeper etc the main thing is that since 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.280
 the year 2005 there is a compulsory nature 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.170
 producers and all the productions 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.360
 agrarias to a traceability control 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.850
 of the product that is from where they are from 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.280
 located the apiaries to apiaries up 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.140
 the entire process to the supermarket or 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.270
 the point of sale we have not also 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.770
 developed another technological innovation 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.240
 in the culture that is an alarm system 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.400
 of hives even if you do not believe in 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.990
 Spain steal many hives us 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.520
 they destroyed us a kennel of queens and 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.100
 then we started with other 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.820
 two companies to develop a system 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.560
 of anti-theft and to know when a 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.720
 hive swarm in a hive 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.270
 conventional a beehive the gent of 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.400
 transhumance the installation becomes the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.650
 follows what is the basis of 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.950
 communications that is a device that is 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.410
 the mouse from where it gives the signal to the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.140
 electronic seals is located or in the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.850
 bottom of the hive on the floors in a 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.520
 box in a feeder where we want 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.440
 hidden are put as many batteries as 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.650
 we want approximately 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.810
 a battery can last almost a month and 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.610
 that is hidden in the hive and then 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.620
 We put the electronic seal on the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.110
 cover at the moment the system 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.630
 alarm is located any thief or 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.510
 person opening the lid of the hive 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.950
 and is installed electronic seal 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.390
 what will happen is that it will give us a 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.140
 mobile phone call 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.890
 and it will tell us that the beehive number 10 of 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.750
 apiaries 3 have opened it 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.970
 Well, now I'm going to present 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.790
 javier who is a beekeeper with 10 years 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.530
 of experience and is a young beekeeper and 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.290
 innovative that does even breeding of 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.569
 very good queens javier and that is very 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.540
 well as winter looks from the field 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.180
 here and good well here dead ones here 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.170
 I'll see you can do it was a little bit and 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.170
 he prepared it for the cooperative 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.650
 really when we need more time 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.670
 be in the hives we from 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.140
 spring until it's over when 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.269
 swarm spring harvest 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.560
 of honey and then also summer with 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.870
 all transhumances that must be done 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.390
 the changes of beehives to the sites 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.310
 formations because then in winter a 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.010
 little more relaxed because 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.840
 There is not so much activity with good household 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.030
 can take us for a reason that 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.580
 eat more or more or less almonte 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.599
 some flowering because they are 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.640
 Interested are the hives not 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.640
 kicks off well in the next campaign
