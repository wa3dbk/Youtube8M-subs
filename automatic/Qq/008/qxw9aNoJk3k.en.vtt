00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 very good to all of us as we are here 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.440
 black with a video so that you have 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.840
 asked a lot of people the subject of the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.000
 servers of this oy how it works or 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.230
 how to enter not good you also know that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.420
 whenever you asked me good 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.190
 always to the person who asks 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.810
 context with a comment saying of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.310
 where there is such a good download 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.410
 as it is still a lot of people I 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.630
 they keep saying it, I thought 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.160
 just upload a quick video and you 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.590
 I explained a bit the functioning of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.130
 this server and how can we access 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.570
 he and little else as we see is in the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.980
 page that we have up here what 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.340
 you have also down here in what is 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.300
 in the description of the video 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.250
 and well, the official website 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.800
 I want to make an account as we see 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.620
 fill in the fields 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.480
 and we give him to play for free once we have 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.449
 there we will automatically create the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.340
 account is to say that many times as 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.890
 this server is very saturated with people 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.899
 and it does not have as much capacity as 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.909
 official because many times they collapse 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.140
 or with queues and many times then 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.759
 if we see that we give to create account and 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.040
 it does not create it, it's a matter of 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.640
 patience because as I say there are 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.770
 much saturation of users and others and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.509
 for once we have the account created 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.580
 here what you can download the game will 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.500
 we give and we can not download it 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.070
 a customer apart from the one we already have that 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.490
 you put the beta is public beta 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 After this we go to where 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.590
 we had downloaded and here we have 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.760
 launcher we look at the admin we will open 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.760
 always the launcher anding 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.430
 and here, well, I always come from 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.970
 change region should always be 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.980
 put then the test server that 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.560
 wait we can put it both in English 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:52.140
 as in Spanish or on the subject of 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.140
 we want to play once we are inside 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.740
 here inside as we enter we will be level 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.100
 1 and we will not have neither erp nor two 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.509
 points of influence this is very easy 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.880
 just once we enter we go back to 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.830
 leave and we go back in and this 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.350
 way we will be level 30 and we should 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.390
 have also what the srp and others are 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.820
 the theme of 'play and each drop 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.920
 they recharge and they give you more or less I do not know 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.250
 if they are about 10,000 points of influence 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.080
 more or less and 4000 rp good so this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.720
 master servers works exactly 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.090
 same as after the official server to 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.680
 difference that he has a lot and 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.750
 has many bugs to see that it does not go to the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.209
 queue or pulling the server and so on 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.230
 it's a bit to test and such and put it 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.440
 Well, here you have the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.210
 typical friends list 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.130
 and then especially so let's see 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.450
 we go to the store and here where is a 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.650
 little in quotes what is grace 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.750
 not here we can buy all kinds of 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.000
 runes we can buy all kinds of 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.070
 skins champions and that's fine 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.430
 Well, to prove it, it's not especially 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.860
 used for the subject of testing then 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.730
 different things that you introduce 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.740
 as it can be for example now in 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 our failure then we buy it in addition 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.020
 the good thing is that they usually put 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.030
 as a rule the last champions 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.880
 or the last champion as we see here you see 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.620
 you can to an erp a point 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.090
 influence so you do not get anything if 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.410
 we already want to buy with an aspect of 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.080
 gender because if it costs you not 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.450
 we can here 1820 between 1250 depending 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.070
 no but game is already moving for the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.800
 topic of that we did not unlock a champion 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.960
 we want to try to see how it is 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.690
 Well well maybe we save ourselves 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.010
 a 1 point that we really need in 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.780
 the official server better then the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.730
 champion or we like but I already say about 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.410
 everything is geared to that is not very 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.520
 well on the subject of which you account here and 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.290
 you are seeing what they are going to put in the 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.150
 next patch 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.799
 so nothing people with this over 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
 with what was the video is a bit 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.280
 fast and explanatory servers 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.290
 of this and as you already know any doubt 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.280
 that you have or something referring has been or 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.390
 whatever is 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.950
 leave me a comment that I 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.950
 I'll answer see you
