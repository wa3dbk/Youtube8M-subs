00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
time don't know if you can see yeah you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.640 
time don't know if you can see yeah you
can<00:02:51.239> see<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.480> two<00:02:51.629> little<00:02:51.900> balls<00:02:52.109> in<00:02:52.409> there<00:02:52.620> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
can see the two little balls in there I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.429 
can see the two little balls in there I
think<00:02:53.450> if<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.659> can<00:02:54.780> get<00:02:54.900> them<00:02:55.079> out<00:02:55.200> with<00:02:55.409> a

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
think if you can get them out with a

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.720 
think if you can get them out with a
magnet<00:02:56.040> or<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:57.269> tip<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.169> a<00:02:58.260> screwdriver<00:02:58.730> with

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
magnet or a tip of a screwdriver with

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.270 
magnet or a tip of a screwdriver with
some<00:02:59.969> grease<00:03:00.239> on<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.900> would<00:03:01.680> advise<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.189> go

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
some grease on it I would advise to go

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.580 
some grease on it I would advise to go
ahead<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.519> pull<00:03:02.700> them<00:03:02.909> now<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.079> can't<00:03:04.349> get

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
ahead and pull them now if you can't get

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.429 
ahead and pull them now if you can't get
them<00:03:04.769> out<00:03:05.750> let's<00:03:06.750> go<00:03:06.840> ahead<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.079> split<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
them out let's go ahead and split the

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.559 
them out let's go ahead and split the
cases<00:03:07.919> watch<00:03:08.430> those<00:03:08.730> balls<00:03:09.030> because<00:03:09.419> they

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
cases watch those balls because they

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.479 
cases watch those balls because they
could<00:03:09.780> go<00:03:09.959> rolling<00:03:10.469> and<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.040> don't<00:03:11.250> want<00:03:11.400> to

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
could go rolling and you don't want to

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.179 
could go rolling and you don't want to
lose<00:03:11.639> them<00:03:12.109> to<00:03:13.109> break<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.469> case<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.980> take<00:03:14.129> a

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
lose them to break the case we take a

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.159 
lose them to break the case we take a
putty<00:03:14.459> knife<00:03:16.370> find<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.549> spot<00:03:18.449> to<00:03:18.629> get<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.870> under
