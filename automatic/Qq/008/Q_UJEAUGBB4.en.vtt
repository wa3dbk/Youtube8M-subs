00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
but these should be set now normally

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.100 
but these should be set now normally
with<00:03:17.700> these<00:03:18.709> bingos<00:03:20.300> black<00:03:21.300> but<00:03:21.750> it's<00:03:21.989> not

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
with these bingos black but it's not

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.300 
with these bingos black but it's not
wear<00:03:22.260> black<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.739> think<00:03:23.010> they<00:03:23.100> should<00:03:23.250> be

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
wear black but I think they should be

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.280 
wear black but I think they should be
ready<00:03:23.459> because<00:03:23.760> it's<00:03:23.910> faded<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> lot<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:24.989> let's

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
ready because it's faded a lot so let's

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.920
