00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hi girls today I want to teach you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.220
 How do you make this earring embroidered with 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.440
 beads he has a fabric base 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.540
 in the bottom part at the top not 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 which is more an interlacing then 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.650
 start from the top, right? 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.590
 there is here we will have a mission is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 and you will pass a line and a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.670
 part of the line may be 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.380
 the smaller the part is bigger and you will 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.920
 take a turn on one side and the other 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.869
 So, I 'll give it all the time. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.270
 mission to create a bed in the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.829
 around the mission you must spend 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.260
 twice within the mission of greater 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.260
 For that and from this bed you go. 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 begin to address neo through 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.930
 entail the admission of minors in 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 around this mission is greater 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.890
 if you want to take a look how it does 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 this point which is called the pyott point 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.789
 round take a look at this link I 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.219
 let down to you look there shows 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.680
 How do you do exactly? 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.070
 but it's very interesting in the end you 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.129
 will have this result here as the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.080
 Easy way to do it, right? 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.760
 will give your name will create this piece 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.520
 and the parsley will be where you are going 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.619
 put the hook or part of the finish 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.140
 of the earring and now you will need 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.900
 separating a ground cable with the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.909
 low smooth nÃ© 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.400
 and this mattress you will paste a base 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.320
 of having been using number of laser laws 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.930
 esteves office I'm going to put it under 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.540
 whole description of the materials 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.060
 today and you can see that as that is the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.829
 Sewing, you'll have to go back and forth. 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.409
 all the time inside the beads 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.600
 to keep them tight around the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.310
 out the ground you see that my milk this 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.619
 type is not that this basis of having 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.740
 been a is usually white but you 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.619
 can reach it too if you prefer 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.259
 and it 's a ginger base and she's from the link 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.869
 It's great to work with so here you are. 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.259
 can see that I've been growing up with 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.180
 beads around the cable and the ground 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.729
 these beads they have to be always 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.000
 even number in odd numbers for 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.560
 always makes sure the round closure is not 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 and now you can see I put it 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.980
 even a chart below it has a bit 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.440
 a little bigger number say years 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.239
 but the graph shows exactly how the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.370
 What do I do to cover cabochon? 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.489
 good the back is very simple you 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.920
 will sew another fabric next to the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.720
 fabric you were approaching and you 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.629
 will do that embroidery that is on top 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.450
 see you there on the blog, I'll say more 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.190
 about this you want to visit and not 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.010
 stop watching our next videos 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.780
 for more education on the part of how that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.780
 Warning would have a kiss and until the next
