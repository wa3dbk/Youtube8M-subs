00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the same thing here now I kind of wish

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.620 
the same thing here now I kind of wish
like<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.070> was<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.430> around<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
like if there was a you around this it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
like if there was a you around this it
would<00:01:15.810> look<00:01:15.840> badass<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> same<00:01:17.369> time

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
would look badass but at the same time

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.039 
would look badass but at the same time
your<00:01:17.850> vision<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.270> definitely<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> lot<00:01:19.020> more

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
your vision is definitely a lot more

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.990 
your vision is definitely a lot more
limited<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:20.159> than<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.909> was

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
limited here than here so it was

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.190 
limited here than here so it was
definitely<00:01:21.119> smarter<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> keep<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> little

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
definitely smarter to keep it a little

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.969 
definitely smarter to keep it a little
more<00:01:22.350> open<00:01:23.270> uh<00:01:24.270> come<00:01:24.840> effect<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
more open uh come effect is this is a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.819 
more open uh come effect is this is a
little<00:01:26.909> bit<00:01:27.060> thicker<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.900> face<00:01:28.200> mask<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
little bit thicker of a face mask on the

little bit thicker of a face mask on the
your<00:01:29.820> right<00:01:30.060> which<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> big<00:01:30.659> grill<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
your right which is the big grill so it

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.300 
your right which is the big grill so it
was<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.619> tough<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.009> me<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> get<00:01:32.280> on

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
is almost the exact same vision as the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.940 
is almost the exact same vision as the
other<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.360> does<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> dual<00:01:49.380> bar<00:01:49.590> here

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
other one it does have the dual bar here

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.499 
other one it does have the dual bar here
the<00:01:50.340> only<00:01:50.549> difference<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.000> there<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.360> are

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the only difference is there you are

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
the only difference is there you are
here<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> there's<00:01:52.200> more<00:01:52.409> bars<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
here and there's more bars here and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.859 
here and there's more bars here and
really<00:01:53.909> when<00:01:54.030> you're<00:01:54.119> looking<00:01:54.149> through<00:01:54.420> all

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
really when you're looking through all

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.130 
really when you're looking through all
these<00:01:55.020> bars<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.920> doesn't<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.640> affect<00:01:57.509> you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
these bars it doesn't really affect you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.840 
these bars it doesn't really affect you
that<00:01:58.200> much<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.710> might<00:01:58.860> try<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.280> show<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.729> guys

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that much I might try and show you guys

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.609 
that much I might try and show you guys
in<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.240> bit<00:02:00.390> how<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.659> looks<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.409> on

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
in a bit how it looks like with this on

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.270 
in a bit how it looks like with this on
compared<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:04.590> other<00:02:04.710> alright

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
compared to this one but other alright

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.260 
compared to this one but other alright
so<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:07.099> it<00:02:08.099> isn't<00:02:08.310> affected<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
so as you can see it isn't affected that

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.140 
so as you can see it isn't affected that
much<00:02:10.190> by<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.250> amount<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.640> bars<00:02:11.849> that's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
much by the amount of bars that's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.640 
much by the amount of bars that's
usually<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:12.599> my<00:02:12.690> vision<00:02:12.870> looks<00:02:13.140> like<00:02:13.319> that's

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
usually what my vision looks like that's

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.059 
usually what my vision looks like that's
right<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.819> then<00:02:14.909> when<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.090> look<00:02:15.299> down

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
right there and then when I look down

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.460 
right there and then when I look down
that's<00:02:17.069> about<00:02:17.370> what<00:02:17.549> I<00:02:17.579> see<00:02:17.909> and<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.260> not

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
that's about what I see and so it's not

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.530 
that's about what I see and so it's not
crazy<00:02:20.310> how<00:02:20.610> much<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.879> affects<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.360> can

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
crazy how much it affects it you can

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.600 
crazy how much it affects it you can
definitely<00:02:21.689> tell<00:02:22.019> that<00:02:22.379> you're<00:02:23.159> affected<00:02:23.579> by

it
but<00:02:24.150> otherwise<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.290> good<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.700> was<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:26.970> one

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
but otherwise it's good this was the one

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.670 
but otherwise it's good this was the one
that<00:02:27.180> my<00:02:27.390> team<00:02:27.599> gave<00:02:27.840> me<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.019> decided<00:02:28.260> by<00:02:28.620> this

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
looks a lot nicer just because this has

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.800

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
wear advisor with this one this one's a

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.309 
wear advisor with this one this one's a
little<00:03:50.190> more<00:03:50.430> complicated<00:03:51.329> because<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:52.139> one

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
little more complicated because this one

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.710 
little more complicated because this one
has<00:03:52.349> more<00:03:52.799> of<00:03:52.859> an<00:03:52.949> angle<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.489> here<00:03:53.729> so<00:03:54.569> it's

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
has more of an angle to it here so it's

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.969 
has more of an angle to it here so it's
a<00:03:54.780> little<00:03:54.959> more<00:03:55.049> complicated<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.530> attach<00:03:55.829> a

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
a little more complicated to attach a

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.599 
a little more complicated to attach a
visor<00:03:56.780> but<00:03:57.949> alright<00:03:58.949> I'll<00:03:59.069> speed<00:03:59.280> helmet<00:03:59.519> you

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
visor but alright I'll speed helmet you

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.210 
visor but alright I'll speed helmet you
can<00:03:59.639> attach<00:04:00.000> your<00:04:00.120> visor<00:04:00.859> it<00:04:01.859> definitely

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
can attach your visor it definitely

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.259 
can attach your visor it definitely
would<00:04:02.310> be<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.430> little<00:04:02.669> easier<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.940> attach<00:04:03.150> your

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
would be a little easier to attach your

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.089 
would be a little easier to attach your
visors<00:04:03.599> into<00:04:03.810> space<00:04:04.049> mask<00:04:04.290> rid<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.799> this<00:04:04.889> one

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
visors into space mask rid of this one

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.860 
visors into space mask rid of this one
just<00:04:05.310> because<00:04:05.879> with<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.299> one<00:04:06.479> there's<00:04:06.659> no

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
just because with this one there's no

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.270 
just because with this one there's no
room<00:04:07.079> between<00:04:07.229> the<00:04:07.470> bars<00:04:07.680> for<00:04:07.859> clips<00:04:08.099> so<00:04:08.250> you

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
room between the bars for clips so you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.979 
room between the bars for clips so you
do<00:04:08.400> have<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.609> use<00:04:08.699> zip<00:04:08.879> ties<00:04:09.090> although<00:04:09.599> in<00:04:09.840> my

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
do have to use zip ties although in my

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.229 
do have to use zip ties although in my
opinion<00:04:10.319> I<00:04:10.500> do<00:04:10.889> things<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.639> ties<00:04:11.819> look<00:04:12.060> better

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
opinion I do things if ties look better

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.270 
opinion I do things if ties look better
anyways<00:04:12.659> so<00:04:12.930> that's<00:04:13.560> not<00:04:13.799> really<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.099> negative

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
anyways so that's not really a negative

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.219 
anyways so that's not really a negative
or<00:04:14.579> positive<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:15.120> anyway<00:04:15.479> so<00:04:15.870> if<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.019> want<00:04:16.139> to

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
or positive of anyway so if you want to

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.670 
or positive of anyway so if you want to
revise<00:04:16.470> ur

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
revise ur

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.870 
revise ur

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
recommend these especially because with

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.450 
recommend these especially because with
the<00:04:22.169> U<00:04:22.260> bar<00:04:22.409> it<00:04:22.620> does<00:04:23.419> block<00:04:24.419> them<00:04:24.659> more<00:04:25.020> than

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
the U bar it does block them more than

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.159 
the U bar it does block them more than
I<00:04:25.490> don't<00:04:25.880> really<00:04:26.090> think<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.449> Ubar<00:04:26.750> does<00:04:26.930> much

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
I don't really think the Ubar does much

for you it's really more of just a
statement<00:04:30.259> kind<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.500> thing
