okay<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.920> lecture<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.340> going<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.550> cover<00:00:03.270> a

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
okay this lecture is going to cover a

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.249 
okay this lecture is going to cover a
muscular<00:00:03.840> system<00:00:04.230> structure<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.799> function

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
muscular system structure and function

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.660 
muscular system structure and function
now<00:00:07.259> there<00:00:07.410> are<00:00:07.500> four<00:00:07.740> major<00:00:07.950> functions<00:00:08.550> with

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
now there are four major functions with

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.129 
now there are four major functions with
the<00:00:08.790> muscular<00:00:09.240> system<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.840> you're<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:09.960> to

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the muscular system that you're going to

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.169 
the muscular system that you're going to
need<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.440> know<00:00:10.590> for<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> purposes<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
need to know for the purposes of the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.230 
need to know for the purposes of the
tests<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.690> class<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.139> upcoming<00:00:13.380> quizzes

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
tests in this class and upcoming quizzes

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.880 
tests in this class and upcoming quizzes
the<00:00:15.240> first<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:15.960> muscle<00:00:16.500> tendons

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the first one is that muscle tendons

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.740 
the first one is that muscle tendons
stabilize<00:00:17.430> joints<00:00:18.470> if<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.650> didn't<00:00:20.369> have

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
stabilize joints if you didn't have

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.750 
stabilize joints if you didn't have
tendons<00:00:21.750> right<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.980> outer<00:00:23.100> covering<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
tendons right the outer covering of the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.310 
tendons right the outer covering of the
muscle<00:00:24.060> becomes<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.539> fasi<00:00:24.900> we'll<00:00:25.080> see<00:00:25.199> that

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
muscle becomes the fasi we'll see that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.410 
muscle becomes the fasi we'll see that
in<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> little<00:00:25.710> bit<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.910> itself<00:00:27.210> becomes

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
in a little bit that in itself becomes

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.900 
in a little bit that in itself becomes
the<00:00:27.689> tendon<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:29.130> don't<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.609> these

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the tendon if you don't have these

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.389 
the tendon if you don't have these
tendons<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> joints<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.769> hold<00:00:32.040> them

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
tendons at the joints to hold them

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
tendons at the joints to hold them
together<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.030> keep<00:00:33.180> them<00:00:33.420> stable<00:00:33.719> when<00:00:34.530> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
together and keep them stable when you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.500 
together and keep them stable when you
use<00:00:34.829> your<00:00:35.010> muscles<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.550> bend<00:00:35.760> your<00:00:35.910> arms<00:00:36.300> or

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
use your muscles to bend your arms or

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.700 
use your muscles to bend your arms or
something<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.170> bones<00:00:37.350> are<00:00:37.500> just

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
something like that the bones are just

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470 
something like that the bones are just
sort<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.980> fall<00:00:38.340> apart<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.760> pop<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.180> joint

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
sort of fall apart or pop out of joint

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.020 
sort of fall apart or pop out of joint
at<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.719> elbow<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.309> very<00:00:41.489> important<00:00:41.969> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
at the elbow so it's very important that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.280 
at the elbow so it's very important that
you<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.300> tendons<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> hold<00:00:43.020> everything

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
you have tendons to hold everything

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.830 
you have tendons to hold everything
together<00:00:44.030> your<00:00:45.030> muscles<00:00:45.329> also<00:00:45.570> help<00:00:45.719> you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
together your muscles also help you

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.440 
together your muscles also help you
fight<00:00:46.020> gravity<00:00:46.820> all<00:00:47.820> right<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.120> have

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
fight gravity all right they have

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.760 
fight gravity all right they have
strength<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.260> help<00:00:49.379> keep<00:00:49.620> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
strength to them they help keep you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.459 
strength to them they help keep you
upright<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.309> standing<00:00:50.850> otherwise<00:00:51.780> gravity

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
upright and standing otherwise gravity

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.020 
upright and standing otherwise gravity
kind<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> trying<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> push<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.640> towards

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
kind of trying to push you down towards

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.180 
kind of trying to push you down towards
the<00:00:54.180> Earth<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:55.260> right<00:00:55.379> muscles<00:00:55.770> help<00:00:55.949> fight

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the Earth all right muscles help fight

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.950 
the Earth all right muscles help fight
that<00:00:57.350> they<00:00:58.350> also<00:00:58.500> help<00:00:58.829> move<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.219> skeleton

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
that they also help move your skeleton

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.270 
that they also help move your skeleton
all<00:01:00.960> right<00:01:01.050> obviously<00:01:01.199> they<00:01:01.620> attach<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.949> your

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
all right obviously they attach to your

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
all right obviously they attach to your
bones<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.969> everything<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.660> they

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
bones and everything like that so they

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.910 
bones and everything like that so they
help<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> move<00:01:04.439> around<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.619> final

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
help you move around and the final

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620 
help you move around and the final
function<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.430> heat<00:01:08.640> production<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.479> also

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
function is heat production we also

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.870 
function is heat production we also
talked<00:01:10.020> about<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.640> were<00:01:11.729> talking

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
talked about that when we were talking

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
talked about that when we were talking
about<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> integumentary<00:01:12.540> system<00:01:12.570> right

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
about the integumentary system right

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.710 
about the integumentary system right
because<00:01:13.799> muscles<00:01:14.159> produce<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.760> heat<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.600> in

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because muscles produce the heat so in

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.990 
because muscles produce the heat so in
turn<00:01:15.990> your<00:01:16.200> integumentary<00:01:16.500> system<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
turn your integumentary system and the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.660 
turn your integumentary system and the
sweat<00:01:18.240> glands<00:01:18.509> produces<00:01:19.200> sweat<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.250> help<00:01:20.430> cool

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
sweat glands produces sweat to help cool

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
sweat glands produces sweat to help cool
your<00:01:20.790> body<00:01:20.970> down<00:01:21.150> through<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> process<00:01:22.020> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
your body down through the process of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.370 
your body down through the process of
evaporative<00:01:22.680> cooling<00:01:24.110> okay<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.320> three

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
evaporative cooling okay there are three

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.929 
evaporative cooling okay there are three
major<00:01:25.710> types<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.250> muscles<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.700> we're<00:01:26.820> going

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
major types of muscles that we're going

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.060 
major types of muscles that we're going
to<00:01:27.000> talk<00:01:27.180> about<00:01:27.420> smooth<00:01:28.229> cardiac<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to talk about smooth cardiac and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.210 
to talk about smooth cardiac and
skeletal<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:30.659> first<00:01:30.900> one<00:01:31.110> smooth<00:01:31.500> muscles<00:01:32.040> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
skeletal the first one smooth muscles is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.999 
skeletal the first one smooth muscles is
an<00:01:32.579> involuntary<00:01:33.060> muscle<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.799> case

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
an involuntary muscle in this case

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.850 
an involuntary muscle in this case
involuntary<00:01:36.000> means<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.860> it's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
involuntary means that it's it's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.800 
involuntary means that it's it's
controlled<00:01:38.460> automatically<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.420> your<00:01:39.450> body

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
controlled automatically in your body

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.569 
controlled automatically in your body
it's<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.680> something<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.250> consciously

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
it's not something that you consciously

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.179 
it's not something that you consciously
think<00:01:42.420> about<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.990> make<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> decision<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.950> do

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
think about and make the decision to do

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.940 
think about and make the decision to do
an<00:01:45.119> example<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.810> smooth<00:01:46.200> involuntary

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
an example of a smooth involuntary

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.389 
an example of a smooth involuntary
muscle<00:01:47.759> would<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.869> esophagus<00:01:49.399> alright

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
muscle would be your esophagus alright

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.310 
muscle would be your esophagus alright
once<00:01:50.610> you've<00:01:50.820> chewed<00:01:51.180> food<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.049> swallow

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
once you've chewed food up and swallow

the<00:02:51.989> concept<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.590> diaphragm<00:02:53.190> diaphragm<00:02:53.730> is

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
the concept of a diaphragm diaphragm is

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.490 
the concept of a diaphragm diaphragm is
quite<00:02:54.060> interesting<00:02:54.660> because<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.019> can<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.319> both

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
quite interesting because it can be both

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.509 
quite interesting because it can be both
voluntary<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.340> involuntary<00:02:57.950> it's<00:02:58.950> voluntary

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
voluntary and involuntary it's voluntary

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.850

because<00:02:59.700> off<00:03:00.120> more<00:03:00.720> often<00:03:00.959> than<00:03:01.140> not<00:03:01.170> you

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
because off more often than not you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.289 
because off more often than not you
breathe<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.370> don't<00:03:02.400> think<00:03:02.760> about<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.180> your

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
breathe you don't think about it your

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.789 
breathe you don't think about it your
body<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:03.720> automatically<00:03:04.260> does<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
body just automatically does it the

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.680 
body just automatically does it the
diaphragm<00:03:05.310> will<00:03:05.459> expand<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.000> contract<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
diaphragm will expand and contract and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.640 
diaphragm will expand and contract and
cause<00:03:07.349> your<00:03:07.650> body<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.160> inhale<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.760> exhale<00:03:09.150> air

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
now I'm going to be thinking about

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.130 
now I'm going to be thinking about
breathing<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:24.420> my<00:03:24.540> body<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.930> going<00:03:25.079> to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
breathing but my body is going to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.770 
breathing but my body is going to
continue<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.769> do<00:03:25.890> it

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
alright now the third type of muscle

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.940 
alright now the third type of muscle
that<00:03:29.310> we're<00:03:29.400> going<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.549> go<00:03:29.730> over<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.150> skeletal

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
that we're going to go over is skeletal

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.819 
that we're going to go over is skeletal
now<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.130> is<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> voluntary<00:03:33.030> muscle<00:03:33.590> right<00:03:34.590> you

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
now this is a voluntary muscle right you

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.800 
now this is a voluntary muscle right you
actually<00:03:35.220> do<00:03:35.459> think<00:03:35.790> okay<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.239> want<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.540> move

actually do think okay I want to move
and<00:03:37.200> now<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.100> might<00:03:38.250> not<00:03:38.430> be<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> super

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
and now it might not be a super

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.789 
and now it might not be a super
conscious<00:03:39.450> thought<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.870> I'm<00:03:40.049> going<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.590> get

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.830 
conscious thought like I'm going to get
up<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.220> walk<00:03:41.400> over<00:03:41.459> there<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.329> other<00:03:42.480> side

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
up and walk over there to the other side

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.960 
up and walk over there to the other side
of<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.109> room<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.680> when<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.400> stand<00:03:44.730> up<00:03:44.910> you

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
of the room and when you stand up you

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.759 
of the room and when you stand up you
sit<00:03:45.359> there<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.630> say<00:03:45.810> okay<00:03:45.930> hamstrings<00:03:46.650> and

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
sit there and say okay hamstrings and

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.170 
sit there and say okay hamstrings and
quadriceps<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.430> want<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.819> work<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.090> a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
quadriceps I want you to work in a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.360 
quadriceps I want you to work in a
coordinated<00:03:48.450> motion<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.470> will<00:03:49.620> cause<00:03:50.160> my

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
coordinated motion that will cause my

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.069 
coordinated motion that will cause my
leg<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:50.790> bend<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.239> start<00:03:51.510> walking<00:03:51.870> in<00:03:51.989> that

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
leg to bend and start walking in that

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.740 
leg to bend and start walking in that
direction<00:03:52.850> but<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:53.940> do<00:03:54.090> have<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.389> think<00:03:54.540> about

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
direction but you do have to think about

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.080 
direction but you do have to think about
it<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.380> it's<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.889> it's<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:56.280> decision<00:03:56.639> that<00:03:56.819> you

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
it it is it's a it's a decision that you

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.920 
it it is it's a it's a decision that you
make<00:03:57.329> consciously<00:03:58.079> I'm<00:03:59.069> even<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.489> reflex<00:04:00.060> right

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
make consciously I'm even a reflex right

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.530 
make consciously I'm even a reflex right
although<00:04:01.230> it's<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.440> quick<00:04:01.709> decision<00:04:02.329> right<00:04:03.329> it

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
although it's a quick decision right it

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.960 
although it's a quick decision right it
does<00:04:03.810> involve<00:04:04.220> sensory<00:04:05.220> neurons<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:05.760> motor

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
does involve sensory neurons and motor

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.930

not<00:04:09.090> part<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.510> that<00:04:09.739> autonomic<00:04:10.739> nervous

automatically<00:04:15.049> are<00:04:16.049> now<00:04:16.260> moving<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
actual structures of skeletal muscle now

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.190 
actual structures of skeletal muscle now
I<00:04:20.280> say<00:04:20.489> skeletal<00:04:21.090> muscle<00:04:21.419> specifically

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
I say skeletal muscle specifically

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.490 
I say skeletal muscle specifically
because<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:23.190> first<00:04:23.490> thing<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.300> fascia<00:04:24.840> this

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
because this first thing the fascia this

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.860 
because this first thing the fascia this
first<00:04:25.770> structure<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.460> only<00:04:26.700> in<00:04:27.210> skeletal

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
first structure is only in skeletal

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.780 
first structure is only in skeletal
muscles<00:04:28.199> and<00:04:28.500> if<00:04:29.130> you<00:04:29.220> look<00:04:29.400> at<00:04:29.520> what<00:04:29.669> it

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
muscles and if you look at what it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.219 
muscles and if you look at what it
becomes<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.479> fact<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.900> becomes

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
becomes the fact that it becomes

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.320 
becomes the fact that it becomes
attended<00:04:31.919> be<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.310> dead<00:04:32.580> giveaway<00:04:32.820> that<00:04:33.000> it's

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
attended be a dead giveaway that it's

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.320 
attended be a dead giveaway that it's
only<00:04:33.479> involved<00:04:33.900> with<00:04:34.020> skeletal<00:04:34.440> muscles

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
only involved with skeletal muscles

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.080 
only involved with skeletal muscles
because<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.570> tendons<00:04:37.080> are<00:04:37.880> necessary<00:04:38.880> to

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
because the tendons are necessary to

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.120 
because the tendons are necessary to
hold<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.810> joints<00:04:40.169> together<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.590> stabilize

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
hold the joints together to stabilize

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.500 
hold the joints together to stabilize
the<00:04:41.340> joints<00:04:41.760> right<00:04:41.910> remember<00:04:42.120> we<00:04:42.270> talked

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
the joints right remember we talked

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.420 
the joints right remember we talked
about<00:04:42.600> that<00:04:42.900> earlier<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.770> when<00:04:43.919> you<00:04:44.010> bend<00:04:44.190> your

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
about that earlier so when you bend your

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.909 
about that earlier so when you bend your
arm<00:04:44.610> you're<00:04:45.479> you<00:04:45.780> know<00:04:45.900> radius<00:04:46.500> all<00:04:46.680> that

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
arm you're you know radius all that

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.710 
arm you're you know radius all that
humerus<00:04:47.430> don't<00:04:47.639> all<00:04:47.760> pop<00:04:48.030> apart<00:04:48.300> from<00:04:48.510> one

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
humerus don't all pop apart from one

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.180 
humerus don't all pop apart from one
another<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:49.320> just<00:04:49.470> start<00:04:49.770> wiggling<00:04:49.949> around

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
another and just start wiggling around

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.710 
another and just start wiggling around
all<00:04:50.430> over<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.760> place<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.090> constantly<00:04:51.479> pop

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
all over the place and constantly pop

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.430 
all over the place and constantly pop
that<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:51.960> joint

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
that a joint

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.530 
that a joint
it's<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.070> tendons<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.639> hold<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:54.210> there<00:04:54.389> and

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
it's the tendons that hold it there and

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.590 
it's the tendons that hold it there and
keep<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.680> joint<00:04:56.240> stable<00:04:57.240> when<00:04:57.449> you're

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
keep that joint stable when you're

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.010 
keep that joint stable when you're
bending<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:58.199> and<00:04:58.229> flexing<00:04:58.919> it<00:04:59.479> all<00:05:00.479> that<00:05:00.840> good

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
bending it and flexing it all that good

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.250 
bending it and flexing it all that good
stuff<00:05:01.050> so<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:03.120> fascia<00:05:03.389> is<00:05:03.630> very<00:05:03.840> important

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
stuff so the fascia is very important

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.650 
stuff so the fascia is very important
but<00:05:04.380> only<00:05:04.620> found<00:05:04.949> the<00:05:05.039> skeletal<00:05:05.490> muscles<00:05:05.850> now

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
but only found the skeletal muscles now

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.260 
but only found the skeletal muscles now
the<00:05:06.750> next<00:05:07.110> thing<00:05:07.229> myofibrils<00:05:08.130> would<00:05:09.000> apply<00:05:09.240> to

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
the next thing myofibrils would apply to

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.500 
the next thing myofibrils would apply to
anything<00:05:09.600> Maya<00:05:10.560> meaning<00:05:11.370> muscle<00:05:11.789> fibrils

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
anything Maya meaning muscle fibrils

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.390 
anything Maya meaning muscle fibrils
meaning<00:05:12.840> fibers<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.919> says<00:05:14.100> muscle

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
meaning fibers and so it says muscle

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.219 
meaning fibers and so it says muscle
fibers<00:05:14.729> underneath<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.300> and<00:05:15.479> these<00:05:16.080> are

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
fibers underneath it and these are

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.900 
fibers underneath it and these are
actually<00:05:16.500> well<00:05:16.680> involved<00:05:17.250> in<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.370> process<00:05:17.789> of

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
actually well involved in the process of

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.390 
actually well involved in the process of
contraction<00:05:18.300> I<00:05:18.780> do<00:05:19.380> have<00:05:19.680> another<00:05:19.919> lecture

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
contraction I do have another lecture

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.830 
contraction I do have another lecture
that<00:05:20.550> I'll<00:05:20.639> be<00:05:20.789> giving<00:05:20.910> you<00:05:21.120> guys<00:05:21.330> later<00:05:21.660> this

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
that I'll be giving you guys later this

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.680 
that I'll be giving you guys later this
week<00:05:22.080> on<00:05:22.320> muscle<00:05:23.250> contraction<00:05:23.789> itself<00:05:24.150> so

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
week on muscle contraction itself so

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.939 
week on muscle contraction itself so
we're<00:05:24.810> not<00:05:24.930> going<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.110> go<00:05:25.380> into<00:05:25.770> too<00:05:25.919> much

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
we're not going to go into too much

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.650 
we're not going to go into too much
detail<00:05:26.310> of<00:05:26.639> the<00:05:26.789> functions<00:05:27.300> of<00:05:27.449> these

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
detail of the functions of these

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.060 
detail of the functions of these
structures<00:05:29.750> now<00:05:30.750> these<00:05:30.960> myofibrils<00:05:31.169> have

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
structures now these myofibrils have

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.190 
structures now these myofibrils have
different<00:05:32.490> parts<00:05:32.880> we're<00:05:33.870> going<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.050> talk

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
different parts we're going to talk

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.469 
different parts we're going to talk
about<00:05:34.380> two<00:05:34.620> of<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.860> key<00:05:35.039> filaments<00:05:35.789> they<00:05:36.419> are

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
about two of the key filaments they are

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.260 
about two of the key filaments they are
active<00:05:36.990> and<00:05:37.110> myosin<00:05:37.650> actin<00:05:38.340> is<00:05:38.849> a<00:05:38.880> thin

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
active and myosin actin is a thin

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.690 
active and myosin actin is a thin
filament<00:05:39.840> myosin<00:05:40.440> is<00:05:40.590> a<00:05:40.650> thick<00:05:41.130> filament

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
filament myosin is a thick filament

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.580 
filament myosin is a thick filament
again<00:05:42.360> these<00:05:42.510> are<00:05:42.660> both<00:05:42.870> involved<00:05:43.410> in<00:05:43.470> the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
again these are both involved in the

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.370 
again these are both involved in the
process<00:05:44.010> of<00:05:44.160> muscle<00:05:44.729> contraction<00:05:45.510> but<00:05:46.229> I<00:05:46.289> do

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
process of muscle contraction but I do

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.779 
process of muscle contraction but I do
have<00:05:46.650> another<00:05:46.919> lecture<00:05:47.190> where<00:05:47.550> we're<00:05:47.669> going

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
have another lecture where we're going

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.060 
have another lecture where we're going
to<00:05:47.849> get<00:05:47.970> into<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.360> functions<00:05:48.900> of<00:05:49.110> muscle

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
to get into the functions of muscle

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.290 
to get into the functions of muscle
contraction<00:05:50.639> all<00:05:50.820> these<00:05:51.000> different

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
contraction all these different

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.670 
contraction all these different
structures<00:05:51.539> that<00:05:51.840> we've<00:05:51.960> talked<00:05:52.200> about<00:05:52.320> and

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
structures that we've talked about and

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.770 
structures that we've talked about and
how<00:05:53.370> they're<00:05:53.580> actually<00:05:53.610> involved<00:05:54.180> in<00:05:54.599> a

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
how they're actually involved in a

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.400 
how they're actually involved in a
muscle<00:05:55.020> contracting<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:57.810> final<00:05:58.139> part<00:05:58.349> of

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
muscle contracting the final part of

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.350 
muscle contracting the final part of
this<00:05:58.590> lecture<00:05:58.830> is<00:05:59.310> just<00:05:59.639> getting<00:06:00.240> to

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
this lecture is just getting to

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.830 
this lecture is just getting to
understand<00:06:00.900> the<00:06:01.500> term<00:06:01.740> peristalsis

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
understand the term peristalsis

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.409 
understand the term peristalsis
peristalsis<00:06:03.840> is<00:06:04.199> actually<00:06:04.560> a<00:06:04.590> process<00:06:05.300> it's<00:06:06.300> a

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
peristalsis is actually a process it's a

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.140 
peristalsis is actually a process it's a
movement<00:06:06.690> through<00:06:07.169> smooth<00:06:07.830> muscle<00:06:08.340> now<00:06:09.090> if

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
movement through smooth muscle now if

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.400 
movement through smooth muscle now if
you<00:06:09.270> remember<00:06:09.539> the<00:06:09.630> example<00:06:09.720> of<00:06:10.139> smooth

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
you remember the example of smooth

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.629 
you remember the example of smooth
muscle<00:06:10.740> I<00:06:10.770> gave<00:06:11.010> earlier<00:06:11.310> it<00:06:11.370> was<00:06:11.490> your

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
muscle I gave earlier it was your

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.620 
muscle I gave earlier it was your
esophagus<00:06:12.139> so<00:06:13.139> you<00:06:13.740> swallow<00:06:14.130> food<00:06:14.490> all<00:06:15.479> right

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
esophagus so you swallow food all right

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.339 
esophagus so you swallow food all right
and<00:06:15.810> it<00:06:15.900> enters<00:06:16.229> into<00:06:16.410> your<00:06:16.680> esophagus<00:06:16.979> and<00:06:18.349> we

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
and it enters into your esophagus and we

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:20.570 
and it enters into your esophagus and we
did<00:06:19.500> mention<00:06:19.710> that<00:06:19.919> there<00:06:20.099> are<00:06:20.130> muscular

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
did mention that there are muscular

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.460 
did mention that there are muscular
contractions<00:06:21.180> that<00:06:21.330> then<00:06:21.449> push<00:06:21.750> it<00:06:21.900> down<00:06:22.080> into

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
contractions that then push it down into

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.170 
contractions that then push it down into
the<00:06:22.740> stomach<00:06:22.949> and<00:06:23.250> on<00:06:23.430> through<00:06:23.880> your

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
the stomach and on through your

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.960 
the stomach and on through your
digestive<00:06:24.389> system<00:06:25.070> but<00:06:26.070> there<00:06:26.250> is<00:06:26.340> a<00:06:26.370> specific

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
digestive system but there is a specific

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.659 
digestive system but there is a specific
type<00:06:27.240> of<00:06:27.270> movement<00:06:27.960> that<00:06:28.830> pushes<00:06:29.430> food

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
type of movement that pushes food

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.140 
type of movement that pushes food
through<00:06:30.120> these<00:06:30.330> circular<00:06:31.340> circular<00:06:32.340> organs

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
through these circular circular organs

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.350 
through these circular circular organs
hollow<00:06:33.510> organs<00:06:34.789> all<00:06:35.789> right<00:06:35.940> it's<00:06:36.120> called

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
hollow organs all right it's called

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.279 
hollow organs all right it's called
peristalsis<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:38.479> the<00:06:39.479> best<00:06:39.690> way<00:06:39.870> I<00:06:39.900> can<00:06:40.169> think

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
peristalsis and the best way I can think

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.270 
peristalsis and the best way I can think
to<00:06:40.560> describe<00:06:40.919> it<00:06:41.099> is

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
to describe it is

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.800 
to describe it is
it<00:06:41.400> actually<00:06:41.610> was<00:06:41.970> very<00:06:42.000> similar<00:06:42.420> to<00:06:42.630> how<00:06:42.750> you

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
it actually was very similar to how you

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.080 
it actually was very similar to how you
would<00:06:42.990> want<00:06:43.080> to<00:06:43.170> milk<00:06:43.410> a<00:06:43.530> cow<00:06:43.740> all<00:06:44.670> right<00:06:44.790> it's

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
would want to milk a cow all right it's

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.320 
would want to milk a cow all right it's
squeezing<00:06:45.900> kind<00:06:46.350> of<00:06:46.500> up<00:06:46.710> and<00:06:47.010> down<00:06:47.730> through

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
squeezing kind of up and down through

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.870 
squeezing kind of up and down through
the<00:06:48.389> circular<00:06:48.930> motion<00:06:48.960> to<00:06:49.380> push<00:06:49.880> something

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
the circular motion to push something

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.350 
the circular motion to push something
through<00:06:51.060> a<00:06:51.389> tube<00:06:52.130> in<00:06:53.130> class<00:06:53.400> I<00:06:53.580> can<00:06:53.730> I<00:06:53.880> also<00:06:54.060> do

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
through a tube in class I can I also do

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.000 
through a tube in class I can I also do
a<00:06:54.389> demonstration<00:06:55.080> where<00:06:55.410> I<00:06:55.470> take<00:06:55.710> a<00:06:55.740> tennis

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
a demonstration where I take a tennis

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.010 
a demonstration where I take a tennis
ball<00:06:56.340> and<00:06:56.460> I<00:06:56.520> put<00:06:56.730> it<00:06:56.820> inside<00:06:57.120> of<00:06:57.180> a<00:06:57.330> sock<00:06:57.630> and

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
ball and I put it inside of a sock and

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.260 
ball and I put it inside of a sock and
the<00:06:58.800> easiest<00:06:59.190> way<00:06:59.400> to<00:06:59.430> get<00:06:59.700> it<00:06:59.850> out<00:07:00.030> is<00:07:00.240> to

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
the easiest way to get it out is to

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.390 
the easiest way to get it out is to
actually<00:07:00.510> take<00:07:01.050> your<00:07:01.290> hand<00:07:01.620> if<00:07:02.130> you<00:07:02.250> could

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
actually take your hand if you could

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.980 
actually take your hand if you could
imagine<00:07:02.639> this<00:07:02.970> and<00:07:03.180> sort<00:07:03.419> of<00:07:03.540> physically

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
imagine this and sort of physically

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.110 
imagine this and sort of physically
start<00:07:04.200> squeezing<00:07:04.740> around<00:07:05.040> the<00:07:05.550> top<00:07:05.790> of<00:07:05.820> the

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
start squeezing around the top of the

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.080 
start squeezing around the top of the
tennis<00:07:06.480> ball<00:07:06.750> all<00:07:07.620> the<00:07:07.680> way<00:07:08.460> around<00:07:08.880> the

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
tennis ball all the way around the

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.090 
tennis ball all the way around the
complete<00:07:09.480> circle<00:07:09.900> to<00:07:10.020> start<00:07:10.260> pushing<00:07:10.620> it<00:07:10.919> down

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
complete circle to start pushing it down

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.030 
complete circle to start pushing it down
through<00:07:11.580> the<00:07:11.700> sock<00:07:11.940> to<00:07:12.180> get<00:07:12.330> it<00:07:12.450> out

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.040 
through the sock to get it out

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.180 
through the sock to get it out
that's<00:07:14.040> how<00:07:14.190> peristalsis<00:07:14.760> works
