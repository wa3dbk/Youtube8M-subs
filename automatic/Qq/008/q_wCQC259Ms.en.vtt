00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.600 
wind flying from the burning bush flung
from<00:03:13.290> her<00:03:13.440> fingers<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.160> hung<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.460> the<00:03:14.580> air

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
from her fingers and it hung in the air

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.090 
from her fingers and it hung in the air
in<00:03:15.210> this<00:03:15.450> moment<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.900> truth<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.800> crashed

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
in this moment of truth then it crashed

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.800 
in this moment of truth then it crashed
into<00:03:17.370> flames<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.150> end<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.480> our<00:03:18.630> you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
into flames like the end of our you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:29.020 
into flames like the end of our you
began<00:03:19.260> trapped<00:03:19.770> in<00:03:19.980> abstractions<00:03:20.700> reality<00:03:22.610> in

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:41.900 

consciousness<00:03:36.530> but<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:38.720> love<00:03:39.720> you
