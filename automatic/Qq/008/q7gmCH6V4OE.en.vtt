in terms of the world of animated gifs
and<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:42.090> think<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.819> some<00:02:44.819> people<00:02:45.030> are<00:02:45.120> annoyed

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and I think that some people are annoyed

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.420 
and I think that some people are annoyed
by<00:02:45.569> them<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.900> think<00:02:46.230> they're<00:02:46.410> more<00:02:46.620> annoyed<00:02:47.010> by

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430

by them I think they're more annoyed by
their<00:02:48.329> misuse<00:02:49.340> then<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:51.209> would<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.630> if<00:02:51.840> they

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
their misuse then they would be if they

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.720 
their misuse then they would be if they
saw<00:02:52.170> an<00:02:52.319> animated<00:02:52.709> gifs<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.130> was<00:02:53.250> done<00:02:53.459> with

gifs<00:04:09.450> i<00:04:09.599> created<00:04:10.079> because<00:04:10.650> i<00:04:10.769> used<00:04:11.099> to<00:04:11.160> create

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
gifs i created because i used to create

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.129 
gifs i created because i used to create
them<00:04:11.549> all<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:12.450> time<00:04:12.660> oh<00:04:12.900> i<00:04:12.989> did<00:04:13.260> one<00:04:13.500> with<00:04:13.790> a

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
them all the time oh i did one with a

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.310 
them all the time oh i did one with a
algorithm<00:04:16.139> so<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.959> more<00:04:19.139> of<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.289> visual

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
algorithm so I it's more of a visual

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.039 
algorithm so I it's more of a visual
thing<00:04:20.239> hang<00:04:21.239> on<00:04:21.359> let<00:04:21.389> me<00:04:21.479> see<00:04:21.630> if<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.750> can<00:04:21.870> find

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
thing hang on let me see if I can find

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.899 
thing hang on let me see if I can find
it<00:04:22.200> give<00:04:22.950> me<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.070> second<00:04:23.370> i'm<00:04:23.490> just<00:04:23.640> gonna<00:04:23.729> pull

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
I'll pull this laptop this way and show

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.380 
I'll pull this laptop this way and show
you<00:04:56.530> may<00:04:57.220> have<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.460> bump<00:04:57.940> up<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.180> brightness

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
you may have to bump up the brightness

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
you may have to bump up the brightness
there<00:04:58.810> so<00:04:59.520> algorithm<00:05:01.140> algorithm<00:05:02.790> algorithm

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
there so algorithm algorithm algorithm

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.030 
there so algorithm algorithm algorithm
algorithm<00:05:05.410> in<00:05:06.100> see<00:05:06.970> his<00:05:07.090> head<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:10.120> yeah

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
algorithm in see his head so yeah

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.150 
algorithm in see his head so yeah
algorithm<00:05:12.040> algorithm<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:13.860> could<00:05:14.860> have<00:05:14.950> done<00:05:15.130> it

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
algorithm algorithm I could have done it

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.590 
algorithm algorithm I could have done it
without<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.640> animation<00:05:16.150> but<00:05:16.240> I<00:05:16.300> thought<00:05:16.480> the

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
without the animation but I thought the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.360 
without the animation but I thought the
animation<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.500> know<00:05:17.620> made<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:17.950> that<00:05:18.340> much

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
animation you know made it that much

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.800 
animation you know made it that much
more<00:05:18.930> fun<00:05:20.160> it<00:05:21.160> grabs<00:05:21.700> people's<00:05:21.970> attention<00:05:22.210> if

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
more fun it grabs people's attention if

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.390 
more fun it grabs people's attention if
you<00:05:23.020> want<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:23.290> make<00:05:23.440> your<00:05:23.560> own<00:05:23.620> animated<00:05:24.130> gifs
