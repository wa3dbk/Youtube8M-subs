called<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.799> pearly<00:01:40.070> knee<00:01:40.130> system<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.729> it's

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
called the pearly knee system and it's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.280 
called the pearly knee system and it's
designed<00:01:41.180> for<00:01:41.240> carbonated<00:01:41.750> cocktails

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
designed for carbonated cocktails

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.010 
designed for carbonated cocktails
it<00:01:42.740> essentially<00:01:43.070> carbonates<00:01:43.610> anything<00:01:44.150> it's

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
it essentially carbonates anything it's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.300 
it essentially carbonates anything it's
designed<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.320> be<00:01:45.380> used<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:45.829> like<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.040> cocktail

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
designed to be used just like a cocktail

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.889 
designed to be used just like a cocktail
shaker<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:47.090> essentially<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.630> pressure

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
shaker it's essentially a pressure

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.999 
shaker it's essentially a pressure
system<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:50.360> start<00:01:50.570> off<00:01:50.659> with<00:01:50.780> ice<00:01:50.899> just<00:01:51.799> like

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
system you start off with ice just like

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.730 
system you start off with ice just like
you<00:01:52.130> would<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.280> shaker<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.619> drink

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
you would a shaker and this drink

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.990 
you would a shaker and this drink

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.460 

this<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.400> pretty<00:02:42.640> close<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.870> classic

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
this is pretty close to a classic

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.620 
this is pretty close to a classic
aviation<00:02:45.250> are<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.520> lot<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.000> cocktails<00:02:46.450> here

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
aviation are a lot of the cocktails here

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.750 
aviation are a lot of the cocktails here
inspired<00:02:47.349> by<00:02:47.860> classes<00:02:48.340> they're<00:02:48.520> almost

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
inspired by classes they're almost

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.430 
inspired by classes they're almost
always<00:02:48.940> inspired<00:02:49.420> by<00:02:49.510> classics<00:02:50.050> I<00:02:50.230> mean

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
always inspired by classics I mean

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.040 
always inspired by classics I mean
granted<00:02:51.040> there<00:02:51.340> are<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.450> many<00:02:52.569> classic

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
granted there are so many classic

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.930 
granted there are so many classic
cocktails<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.620> realistically<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.640> lot<00:02:54.819> of

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
cocktails and realistically a lot of

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.910 
cocktails and realistically a lot of
combinations<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:55.569> seem<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.410> get<00:02:56.530> repeated<00:02:56.800> a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
combinations just seem to get repeated a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.650 
combinations just seem to get repeated a
bit<00:02:57.040> okay<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:57.640> yeah<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.030> mean<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.300> base<00:02:58.540> is

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
bit okay so yeah this I mean the base is

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.880 
bit okay so yeah this I mean the base is
pretty<00:02:58.690> much<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.050> take<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.440> little<00:02:59.620> bit<00:02:59.830> of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
pretty much you take a little bit of

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.949 
pretty much you take a little bit of
taking<00:03:00.880> aviation<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.390> kind<00:03:01.569> of<00:03:01.599> combine<00:03:01.750> it

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
taking aviation you kind of combine it

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.120 
taking aviation you kind of combine it
with<00:03:01.989> it<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> little<00:03:02.319> bit<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.590> Arsenic<00:03:03.099> and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
with it a little bit of a Arsenic and

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.509 
with it a little bit of a Arsenic and
Old<00:03:03.250> Lace<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:05.380> walk<00:03:05.530> over<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.860> our<00:03:05.920> CEO<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.310> take

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
Old Lace we walk over to our CEO to take

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.000 
Old Lace we walk over to our CEO to take
what<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.120> attached<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.569> it<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.500> regulator

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
what is attached to it is a regulator

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.790 
what is attached to it is a regulator
uh-huh<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:10.510> actually<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:11.230> set<00:03:11.500> up<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.620> a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
uh-huh that actually is set up to a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.300 
uh-huh that actually is set up to a
certain<00:03:11.980> pressure<00:03:13.170> when<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.200> basically<00:03:14.560> pump

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
certain pressure when I basically pump

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.309 
certain pressure when I basically pump
it<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.540> at<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.630> top<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.870> has<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.989> one-way<00:03:17.290> valve

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
it up at the top it has a one-way valve

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.590 
it up at the top it has a one-way valve
it<00:03:18.040> just<00:03:18.250> stops<00:03:18.519> once<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:18.910> reached<00:03:19.060> for<00:03:19.269> the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
it just stops once it's reached for the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.509 
it just stops once it's reached for the
right<00:03:19.720> pressure<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.860> then<00:03:20.980> basically<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.370> mean

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
right pressure and then basically I mean

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.970 
right pressure and then basically I mean
it's<00:03:21.700> sitting<00:03:21.970> there.if<00:03:22.120> on<00:03:22.840> its<00:03:22.989> own<00:03:23.140> because

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
it's sitting there.if on its own because

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.190 
it's sitting there.if on its own because
it's<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.130> pressurized<00:03:24.489> system<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.940> co2

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
it's a pressurized system of co2

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.559 
it's a pressurized system of co2
it'll<00:03:27.040> carbonate<00:03:27.430> but<00:03:27.940> it'll<00:03:28.239> take<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.420> long

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
it'll carbonate but it'll take a long

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.559 
it'll carbonate but it'll take a long
time<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.930> carbonate<00:03:29.319> so<00:03:29.739> now<00:03:29.890> we<00:03:30.160> shake<00:03:30.370> it

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
time to carbonate so now we shake it

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.130 
time to carbonate so now we shake it
shaking<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:32.640> basically<00:03:33.640> causes<00:03:34.150> infinite

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
shaking it basically causes infinite

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.580 
shaking it basically causes infinite
surface<00:03:35.470> area<00:03:36.660> every<00:03:37.660> time<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.930> surface<00:03:38.290> area

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
surface area every time the surface area

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.990 
surface area every time the surface area
and<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.250> have<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.790> pressurized<00:03:40.150> system<00:03:40.420> of<00:03:40.690> gas

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
and you have a pressurized system of gas

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.190 
and you have a pressurized system of gas
it's<00:03:43.000> actually<00:03:43.330> gonna<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.660> gas<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.109> gonna

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
it's actually gonna that gas is gonna

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.170 
it's actually gonna that gas is gonna
dissolve<00:03:44.650> into<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:44.920> liquid<00:03:45.010> we<00:03:45.910> get<00:03:46.090> our

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
dissolve into the liquid we get our

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.130 
dissolve into the liquid we get our
glass<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:48.190> now<00:03:48.340> for<00:03:49.030> fun<00:03:49.180> aromatics<00:03:49.810> just<00:03:50.049> to
