00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
happen you might start this off with

some early circling speed attacks i

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.640 
some early circling speed attacks i
canna<00:02:33.840> get<00:02:34.020> in<00:02:34.140> there<00:02:34.290> i<00:02:34.320> think<00:02:34.410> well<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
canna get in there i think well the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.230 
canna get in there i think well the
timing<00:02:34.980> isn't<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.280> spot<00:02:35.550> he<00:02:35.700> knows<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
timing isn't a spot he knows that the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.920 
timing isn't a spot he knows that the
gas<00:02:36.420> was<00:02:36.630> he<00:02:37.590> knows<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.950> gas<00:02:38.130> was<00:02:38.280> up

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
gas was he knows that the gas was up

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.150 
gas was he knows that the gas was up
before<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.260> spawning<00:02:40.500> pool<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:40.860> i<00:02:40.920> think<00:02:40.980> i

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
before the spawning pool so i think i

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.380 
before the spawning pool so i think i
should<00:02:41.220> corner<00:02:41.610> setting<00:02:41.850> myself<00:02:41.940> up<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.330> you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
should corner setting myself up so you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.900 
should corner setting myself up so you
can<00:02:42.570> get<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.750> speedling<00:02:43.320> upgrade<00:02:43.680> before<00:02:44.100> he

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
can get the speedling upgrade before he

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.580 
can get the speedling upgrade before he
even<00:02:45.060> gets<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.690> wire<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.050> he's<00:02:46.380> gonna<00:02:46.500> have

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
even gets the wire so he's gonna have

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.930 
even gets the wire so he's gonna have
enough<00:02:46.890> gas<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.190> get<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> speeding<00:02:47.580> up<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
enough gas to get the speeding up and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.480 
enough gas to get the speeding up and
then<00:02:48.090> get<00:02:48.240> away<00:02:48.450> meanwhile<00:02:48.950> c1<00:02:49.950> racks<00:02:50.190> that's

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
then get away meanwhile c1 racks that's

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.620

that's<00:02:51.870> interesting<00:02:52.740> wondering<00:02:53.310> when<00:02:53.430> that's

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
that's interesting wondering when that's

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.160 
that's interesting wondering when that's
