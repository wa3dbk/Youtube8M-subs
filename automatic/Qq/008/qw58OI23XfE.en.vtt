00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.159
 hayato world meet today 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.350
 for one all my guys videos 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.790
 today it will be for predictions 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.049
 of cards for going on is a chemistry 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.340
 ultimate with again five new 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.630
 players he loves here as well as has to 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.280
 very good players and also I wanted 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.230
 come back from the very last 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.299
 episode of this prediction for stealing 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 16 it is not very well 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.439
 in the sense level feedback level 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.910
 and just like 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.160
 but now I just wanted you 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.420
 inform that more will motivate by 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.949
 report to the laity and comments to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.490
 welcome back the proposals of players 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.779
 etc. 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.660
 it makes me want to go out at the episode 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.070
 as quickly as possible because 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.480
 yes it's true that I got a little 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.950
 little compared to what was being done at 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 abroad and it's true that me by 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.260
 compared to my series it's to use the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 less good returns 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.719
 now but hey it's like 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.309
 that I still continued years then 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.200
 it's me who make the fix g and all the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.399
 tralala but that's soils it's not a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.050
 problem it's me who loved the back 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.460
 but it's just here without taking 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.780
 a lot of time a little bit behind 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.039
 in addition I have not been good either 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.149
 promised return had previously it's 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.620
 true that sometimes after a little bit 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.210
 but hey that's how we start 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.129
 with the first player it will be the Belgian 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 radja one golan the kind of lily 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.539
 Romanesque only to four bad stars 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.370
 foot and 3 stars of geotechnical so 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.650
 I decided to put a small 83.2 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.150
 general and he took a star so a 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.189
 bad foot in any case he will have 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.260
 really a very very very beautiful card 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.369
 this Belgian I think he will really have 80 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.380
 just about all everywhere in a very 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.520
 beautiful because we'll go to the French 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.840
 Olympique Lyonnais is common 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.400
 and found this carton really a very 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.909
 very very good seed 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.920
 he had 64 of general in bronze kart 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.820
 on 100 and cac 15h you died the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 meter 76 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.259
 she comes to add a star of 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.280
 technical gesture I believe and even 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.659
 frankly a very very nice card 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.250
 for him in any case he deserves it from 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.720
 blow this season and that a lot of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.280
 goals and have a lot of tenure 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.509
 on his part and that's always because 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.860
 that the enemy's half-time risk 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.380
 pollutants is being made 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.670
 disassemble by his mother there are 4 to 0 but 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.770
 that's the way it deserves 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.259
 this card there we will pass to the Argentine 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.640
 a barÃ§a is of course lionel messi 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.020
 yeah I still had not done any 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.729
 ronaldo medicine so there for my name is going 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.240
 heat messi why not in the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.259
 next episode 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.079
 ronaldo I do not know but in any case 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.969
 I would leave the same in genetics to my 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.420
 feet so 80 estimates three years my feet 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.100
 the same note of general 93 but just 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.079
 his position that would not change would be 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.520
 shot right winger where I think well 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.619
 sure 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.750
 after for the list is maybe will be 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.640
 modified on some small stadium 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.250
 maybe in a little more feel and a 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.120
 little powerful passes I think alas we have 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.540
 so hummels mats the German player the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.590
 borussia dortmund that I think leave to 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.269
 86.2 general I think he will have to little 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.209
 near the same note neither more nor less than that 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.650
 creates a lot of cards a shape but 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.420
 so I had the lesson of dortmund 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.950
 really very very difficult I think 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.209
 that there will be no strike even if 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.099
 it's true that he was one of the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.150
 time players all the goods the 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.040
 better simply 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.030
 but here is his card will not move in 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.709
 terms of general notes after 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.989
 maybe it will change a little bit more about 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.769
 his stats accurate and then to finish 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.410
 will have petr cech the guardian of peace 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.880
 national the Czech simply 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.470
 but here he had signed one and two of 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.970
 chelsea he wanted to have time 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.340
 I go that bell was barred by thibaut 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.130
 courteous but now I do not think he 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.840
 will have a downgrade of sap ag scheduled on 2 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.120
 meters 84 I think he will stay 85 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.459
 because he did not deserve a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.989
 any case to have a lower map 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.610
 went to parents even though they were 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.810
 substitutes it does not mean anything to 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.400
 me anyway it's really very very 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.260
 good guardian and I hope he will do 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.250
 become even better arsenal so 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.269
 here are the guys I really hope that 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.920
 this little video will have made you 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.329
 pleasure if it is the case ben here 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.579
 how am I going to say since the episode 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.590
 and then she like more videos like that 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.400
 will come out faster so that's it 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.480
 I hope we will still have a lot 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.359
 more good returns 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.989
 compared to the last episode of this 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.370
 series simply 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.989
 here I am, I tell you next time 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.030
 league 1 we do not pay attention to 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.650
 rats I see they have here I am 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.959
 cover the demand and like it's 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.459
 true that often this is the case but when 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.530
 I ask it is when I am a 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.280
 little bit disappointed compared to the greens to 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.170
 previous episodes 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.260
 simply because bell there is 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.760
 no reason for that for me as to 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.739
 episodes of diapers I see that 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.120
 walk a lot a lot behind 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.680
 of course you have a little summer a little 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.940
 little disappointed that it goes less well so 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.260
 you wonder why and try to 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.769
 make sure for the next ones that that 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.750
 is better 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.549
 here you have to try to understand 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.049
 a little bit I hope I'll say to the 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.280
 next for all our videos and gacÃ© 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.280
 terraza club have my regards
