00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
have a closer look is that it doesn't

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.980 
have a closer look is that it doesn't
use<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.619> suspension<00:01:18.490> style<00:01:19.000> harness<00:01:19.509> like<00:01:19.720> most

other<00:01:20.259> helmet<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.590> here<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:26.950> is<00:01:27.100> you've<00:01:27.310> got

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
other helmet so here it is you've got

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.200 
other helmet so here it is you've got
the<00:01:27.640> retracting<00:01:28.509> visor<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:30.340> again<00:01:30.640> how<00:01:30.850> plush

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
the retracting visor see again how plush

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.969 
the retracting visor see again how plush
it<00:01:31.240> sits<00:01:31.660> on<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.960> helmet<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.410> doesn't<00:01:32.770> stick

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
it sits on the helmet it doesn't stick

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.980 
it sits on the helmet it doesn't stick
up<00:01:33.160> compelte<00:01:34.030> or<00:01:34.270> earmuffs

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
up compelte or earmuffs

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.790 
up compelte or earmuffs
these<00:01:35.860> bends<00:01:36.729> is<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:37.240> think<00:01:37.630> 11<00:01:37.990> vents<00:01:38.410> on<00:01:38.679> the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
these bends is I think 11 vents on the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.639 
these bends is I think 11 vents on the
helmet<00:01:39.190> line<00:01:40.060> with<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.360> mesh<00:01:40.750> screen<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.560> you

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
helmet line with a mesh screen so you

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.730 
helmet line with a mesh screen so you
don't<00:01:41.800> get<00:01:41.920> debris<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.550> stuff<00:01:42.850> in<00:01:43.060> there<00:01:43.740> but

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
don't get debris and stuff in there but

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.389 
don't get debris and stuff in there but
you<00:01:44.830> still<00:01:44.890> get<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.340> airflow<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:47.130> turn<00:01:48.130> wheel

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
you still get the airflow a turn wheel

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.620 
you still get the airflow a turn wheel
to<00:01:48.759> adjust<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.869> helmet<00:01:50.800> size<00:01:51.100> one<00:01:52.000> size<00:01:52.300> fits
