00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
unique features are on the DD JSX so

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
unique features are on the DD JSX so
let's<00:00:29.760> start<00:00:29.970> off<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.269> some<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> inputs<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
let's start off on some of the inputs I

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.900 
let's start off on some of the inputs I
know<00:00:31.769> everybody's<00:00:32.160> always<00:00:32.219> very<00:00:32.520> interested

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.459 
touch sensitivity selectors for the jog
wheels<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> I'll<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.690> outputs<00:00:57.469> so

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
wheels that I'll go on to the outputs so

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.139 
wheels that I'll go on to the outputs so
let's<00:00:58.620> start<00:00:58.859> at<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:58.980> end<00:00:59.160> we've<00:00:59.850> got<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
let's start at this end we've got the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.070 
let's start at this end we've got the
master<00:01:00.539> output<00:01:00.780> switch<00:01:01.260> saw<00:01:01.440> XLR<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.309> RCA

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
master output switch saw XLR and RCA

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.509 
master output switch saw XLR and RCA
booth<00:01:04.080> outputs<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.860> know<00:01:04.949> everybody<00:01:05.309> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
booth outputs which I know everybody so

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.920 
booth outputs which I know everybody so
is<00:01:05.640> quite<00:01:05.850> concerned<00:01:06.240> about<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.570> controller

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
is quite concerned about on controller

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.469 
is quite concerned about on controller
so<00:01:07.140> we've<00:01:07.229> got<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.590> quarter<00:01:07.860> inch<00:01:07.979> jacks

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
so we've got that on quarter inch jacks

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.359 
so we've got that on quarter inch jacks
four<00:01:09.479> channel<00:01:09.869> inputs<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.130> all

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
four channel inputs that are all

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.429 
four channel inputs that are all
switchable<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.420> also<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> standalone

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
switchable and also it's a standalone

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.289 
switchable and also it's a standalone
mixers<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.430> chuck<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:14.909> existing

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
mixers go you can chuck in your existing

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.080 
mixers go you can chuck in your existing
CDJs<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:15.900> turntables<00:01:16.560> Brown<00:01:17.310> impose<00:01:17.759> four

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
CDJs or turntables Brown impose four

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.300 
CDJs or turntables Brown impose four
turntables<00:01:18.810> here<00:01:20.509> combi<00:01:21.509> XLR<00:01:22.130> input<00:01:23.130> four

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
turntables here combi XLR input four

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.520 
turntables here combi XLR input four
microphones<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> quarter-inch<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.570> Jack

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
microphones or a quarter-inch in Jack

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.249 
microphones or a quarter-inch in Jack
input<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> microphone<00:01:26.549> USB<00:01:27.090> power<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
input for a microphone USB power and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.950 
input for a microphone USB power and
obviously<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> Kensington<00:01:28.920> lock<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.630> jog

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
obviously a Kensington lock so the jog

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.969 
obviously a Kensington lock so the jog
wheel<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.290> was<00:01:31.380> talking<00:01:31.710> about<00:01:31.829> it's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
wheel that was talking about it's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 
wheel that was talking about it's
anti-static<00:01:32.490> conductivity<00:01:33.150> technology

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
anti-static conductivity technology

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.580 
anti-static conductivity technology
which<00:01:34.290> basically<00:01:34.560> means<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.040> works<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:36.590> static

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
which basically means it works on static

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560 
which basically means it works on static
electricity<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.670> how<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> pressure

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
electricity and that's how the pressure

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810 
electricity and that's how the pressure
comes<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> jog<00:01:40.320> wheel<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.189> our<00:01:41.400> CDJs

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
comes on to the jog wheel so our CDJs

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
comes on to the jog wheel so our CDJs
our<00:01:42.000> pressure-sensitive<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.200> as

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
our pressure-sensitive but this is as

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
our pressure-sensitive but this is as
soon<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.770> make<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> connection<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
soon as you make the connection and the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.670 
soon as you make the connection and the
circuit<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.479> complete<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.229> platter<00:01:46.470> will

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
circuit is complete the platter will

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010 
circuit is complete the platter will
stop<00:01:46.860> basically<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:48.060> little<00:01:48.329> put<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
stop basically and this little put is is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.830 
stop basically and this little put is is
the<00:01:49.320> adjustment<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.860> tension<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the adjustment of the tension on it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.569 
the adjustment of the tension on it
we<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.530> these<00:01:52.680> eight<00:01:52.920> velocity-sensitive

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
we have these eight velocity-sensitive

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.260 
we have these eight velocity-sensitive
pads<00:01:55.009> which<00:01:56.009> give<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.340> DJ<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.850> ability<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
pads which give the DJ the ability to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.539 
pads which give the DJ the ability to
perform<00:01:57.540> live<00:01:58.140> using<00:01:58.649> new<00:01:58.950> features<00:01:59.310> inside

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
perform live using new features inside

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.870 
perform live using new features inside
Serato<00:01:59.970> such<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.479> hot<00:02:00.659> cue<00:02:00.899> roll<00:02:01.700> slicer<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
Serato such as hot cue roll slicer and
