00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.910
 welcome to cardigan kitchens today we go 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.760
 to prepare a hamburger style more 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:36.400
 mcdonald's chicken and the ingredients 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:39.910
 they are vegetable oil about 40-50 milliliters 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.030
 three eggs two to three teaspoons 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.460
 of garlic powder ground black pepper or 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.760
 to grind and two to three teaspoons 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.310
 onion powder 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.079
 a little salt 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.079
 about 20 milliliters of water 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.780
 two chicken breasts that are well 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.780
 musical so they are well chubby 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.080
 lettuce of the one that we like more in this 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.840
 case if it is seen and divided into julienne and bread 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.720
 for hamburger with sesame in addition 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.340
 also to use flour I do not say 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.189
 this we will already see 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.399
 so now with all this said 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.600
 we started with our recipe we will put 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.600
 two eggs on a plate 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.520
 and these are going to beat 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.280
 We beat vigorously until I 'm 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.280
 totally well beaten 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.300
 once beaten we are going to add the 20 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.650
 milliliters of water 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.110
 and we go back to soaking 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.320
 After a couple of minutes we booked 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.670
 we go with the flour we put abundant 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.240
 ground black pepper 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.240
 you think 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.550
 a teaspoon and a half of garlic powder 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.910
 and another teaspoon and a half of onion in 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.620
 dust and now this mixture we're going to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.570
 move very well so that everything is integrated 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.000
 to the flour we take our breasts 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.170
 and we will put a transparent paper for you 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.840
 over and we're going to hit them with something 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:34.710
 let's have at home that is firm as 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.780
 for example the roller now once 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.280
 we have already given them with the roller 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.190
 we will put a little salt to our 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.510
 breasts but without happening and now we go 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:51.540
 by the batter first by egg 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:53.480
 then for the flour we soak very well 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.860
 all on one side and on the other 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.620
 we will return to the egg 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.330
 and again for the flour and this very 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.350
 process we will also do with the others 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.350
 breasts that we want 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.620
 now we are going to wrap these dates 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.620
 on transparent kitchen paper 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.220
 and once we have them wrapped 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.080
 We are going to put them in the freezer 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.750
 for about 20 minutes if 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.250
 is a little bit more because nothing happens 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.260
 we are preparing our mayonnaise 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.800
 we can also make it with mayonnaise 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:35.950
 jar or jar we will put the salt in the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.950
 Oil the egg a few drops of lemon 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.860
 and we are going to beat 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.170
 you already know that these slowly so that 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:49.280
 do not cut us we reserve the mayonnaise and 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.160
 let's put in a pan oil 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.110
 this is sunflower and when it is well 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.270
 hot let's fry our steaks 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.010
 As you can see, I have not made them round 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.410
 but you can cut them out and 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.930
 make them and adapt them to the extent that 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.180
 you most like it and have to 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.430
 get super super crispy and super 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.430
 gold so patience 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.650
 we will take like three tablespoons or four 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.980
 of mayonnaise and we will put garlic powder 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.370
 and onion powder this goes on tastes 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.380
 and we'll move it well to mayonnaise and so 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.700
 that integrates everything has to be left 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.360
 something like that 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.860
 go try not leave it too strong like that 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.020
 let mounting and is the last 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.540
 for our hamburger in the part of 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.540
 below the bread we will put enough salsita 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.140
 over our steaks as you see me 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.880
 I have lengthened them but I have already told you 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.070
 that you can cut them out or make them like 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.000
 you want 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.510
 we'll put plenty of sauce in the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.510
 top part 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.040
 A) Yes 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:06.379
 we put lettuce to finish 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.939
 and we close with our loaves of 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.729
 hamburger and ready 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:13.310
 we already have a delicious chicken mac 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.259
 super easy to do and it's also that 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.360
 they are super super equal you have to 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.349
 approve a greeting and see you next time 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.349
