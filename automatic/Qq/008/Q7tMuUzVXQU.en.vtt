00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.860 

when<00:00:35.739> I<00:00:35.770> came<00:00:35.890> into<00:00:36.250> a<00:00:36.430> into<00:00:37.089> the<00:00:37.330> art<00:00:37.449> program

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
when I came into a into the art program

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.170 
when I came into a into the art program
and<00:00:38.110> then<00:00:38.199> into<00:00:38.470> X<00:00:38.650> I<00:00:38.980> realized<00:00:39.519> the<00:00:39.640> change<00:00:39.940> in

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
and then into X I realized the change in

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.750 
and then into X I realized the change in
myself<00:00:40.360> I<00:00:41.110> realized<00:00:41.830> that<00:00:41.980> if<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:42.280> dedicated

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
myself I realized that if I dedicated

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.090 
myself I realized that if I dedicated
myself<00:00:43.000> much<00:00:43.540> more<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:44.079> what<00:00:44.140> I<00:00:44.230> was<00:00:44.410> doing<00:00:44.860> and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
myself much more to what I was doing and

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.149 
myself much more to what I was doing and
focused<00:00:45.760> harder<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.839> lot<00:00:47.440> could<00:00:47.620> be<00:00:47.680> achieved

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
focused harder a lot could be achieved

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.189 
focused harder a lot could be achieved
from<00:00:48.430> it<00:00:48.640> whenever<00:00:48.940> I<00:00:49.150> approached<00:00:49.570> my<00:00:49.809> artwork

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
from it whenever I approached my artwork

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.170 
from it whenever I approached my artwork
I<00:00:50.589> consider<00:00:51.129> my<00:00:51.280> art<00:00:51.430> to<00:00:51.579> be<00:00:51.699> very<00:00:51.850> personal

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
I consider my art to be very personal

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.689 
I consider my art to be very personal
and<00:00:52.629> before<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:53.140> felt<00:00:53.470> like<00:00:53.530> like<00:00:54.309> I<00:00:54.400> was<00:00:54.519> making

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
and before I felt like like I was making

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.670 
and before I felt like like I was making
pretty<00:00:55.030> pictures<00:00:55.150> but<00:00:56.019> after<00:00:56.320> being<00:00:56.559> on

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
pretty pictures but after being on

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.009 
pretty pictures but after being on
Project<00:00:57.129> X<00:00:57.430> I<00:00:57.760> realized<00:00:58.269> that<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.570> am<00:00:58.869> a

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
Project X I realized that I am a

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.840 
Project X I realized that I am a
creative<00:00:59.320> person<00:00:59.799> I<00:00:59.920> am<00:01:00.070> an<00:01:00.250> artist<00:01:02.850> working

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
creative person I am an artist working

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.210 
creative person I am an artist working
on<00:01:04.000> Project<00:01:04.420> X<00:01:04.570> was<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:05.140> hands-on<00:01:05.590> experience

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
on Project X was a hands-on experience

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.980 
on Project X was a hands-on experience
that<00:01:06.430> we<00:01:06.580> wouldn't<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:06.880> gotten<00:01:07.150> not<00:01:07.600> working

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
that we wouldn't have gotten not working

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.200 
that we wouldn't have gotten not working
on<00:01:08.080> an<00:01:08.200> actual<00:01:08.500> film<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:09.100> think<00:01:09.490> other<00:01:09.820> schools

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
on an actual film I think other schools

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.210 
on an actual film I think other schools
don't<00:01:10.600> hold<00:01:10.869> themselves<00:01:11.290> to<00:01:11.770> such<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.009> high

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
don't hold themselves to such a high

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.920 
don't hold themselves to such a high
standard<00:01:12.520> we<00:01:13.030> were<00:01:13.150> really<00:01:13.330> going<00:01:13.570> for<00:01:13.900> a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
standard we were really going for a

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.929 
standard we were really going for a
professional<00:01:14.590> look<00:01:14.799> and<00:01:15.040> it<00:01:15.369> got<00:01:15.580> me<00:01:15.729> ready

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
professional look and it got me ready

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.630 
professional look and it got me ready
for<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.360> professional<00:01:17.290> world<00:01:17.500> how<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.400> deal

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
for the professional world how to deal

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.190 
for the professional world how to deal
with<00:01:18.670> your<00:01:18.970> co-workers<00:01:19.210> because<00:01:19.960> we<00:01:20.080> were

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
with your co-workers because we were

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.929 
with your co-workers because we were
co-workers<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:20.979> weren't<00:01:21.250> really<00:01:21.430> students

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
co-workers you weren't really students

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.399 
co-workers you weren't really students
anymore<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:25.060> was<00:01:25.210> always<00:01:25.420> something<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:26.020> do<00:01:26.200> it

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
anymore it was always something to do it

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.139 
anymore it was always something to do it
was<00:01:26.469> always<00:01:26.619> something<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.070> be<00:01:27.280> done<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.969> you

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
was always something to be done and you

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.539 
was always something to be done and you
never<00:01:28.329> really<00:01:28.600> stopped<00:01:29.320> working<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:30.429> were

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
never really stopped working we were

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.849 
never really stopped working we were
always<00:01:30.670> rigging<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.270> was<00:01:31.359> a<00:01:31.420> lot<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.600> fun<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.229> I

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
always rigging it was a lot of fun and I

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.020 
always rigging it was a lot of fun and I
guess<00:01:33.039> that's<00:01:33.219> affect<00:01:33.490> my<00:01:33.640> day-to-day<00:01:33.789> work

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
guess that's affect my day-to-day work

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.819 
guess that's affect my day-to-day work
now<00:01:34.359> and<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.749> I<00:01:34.990> don't<00:01:35.170> like<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.289> sit<00:01:35.499> idle

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
now and that I don't like to sit idle

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.830 
now and that I don't like to sit idle
and<00:01:36.189> I<00:01:36.399> would<00:01:36.549> rather<00:01:36.729> work<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.329> crazy
