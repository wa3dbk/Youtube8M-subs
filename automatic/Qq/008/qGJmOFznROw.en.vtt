00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
movement and flexibility in today I

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.249 
movement and flexibility in today I
don't<00:01:29.700> usually<00:01:29.970> hurt<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.140> were

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
don't usually hurt I think they were

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.870 
don't usually hurt I think they were
just<00:01:31.439> playing<00:01:31.710> into<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.250> was<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.759> down

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
just playing into what was going down

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.450 
just playing into what was going down
inside<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> match<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.829> second<00:01:35.250> fall

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
inside of the match but that second fall

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.210 
inside of the match but that second fall
was<00:01:36.000> awesome<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.840> honestly<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:37.799> hoping<00:01:38.100> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
was awesome I I honestly was hoping that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.289 
was awesome I I honestly was hoping that
they<00:01:38.310> were<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> second<00:01:39.180> fall

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
they were just to get the second fall

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.999 
they were just to get the second fall
out<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> way<00:01:39.720> everybody<00:01:40.020> knows<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.350> they

out of the way everybody knows that they

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.639

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the win but he wasn't able to do it and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.969 
the win but he wasn't able to do it and
you<00:02:05.430> know<00:02:06.350> that's<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.560> came<00:02:07.680> down<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
