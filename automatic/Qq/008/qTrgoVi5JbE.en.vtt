00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
probably a little bit more of a flexible

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.570 
probably a little bit more of a flexible
learns<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.560> allows<00:01:10.799> me<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.369> bit

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
learns it allows me to get a little bit

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640 
learns it allows me to get a little bit
closer<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.119> my<00:01:12.240> subject<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> still<00:01:13.470> be

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
closer to my subject but to still be

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
closer to my subject but to still be
able<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.950> shoot<00:01:14.189> wide<00:01:14.490> kind<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> wide<00:01:15.180> angle

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570

and<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.900> able<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> zoom<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.770> play<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> little

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and be able to zoom in and play a little

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.910 
and be able to zoom in and play a little
bit<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> third<00:01:19.110> lens<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.680> want<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
bit now the third lens that I want to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
bit now the third lens that I want to
talk<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> about<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.119> probably<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
talk to you about this is probably a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499 
talk to you about this is probably a
little<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.350> more<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.009> specialty<00:01:23.610> lens<00:01:23.939> it's

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
little bit more of a specialty lens it's

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.850 
little bit more of a specialty lens it's
a<00:01:24.770> 75<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.189> 35<00:01:26.640> millimeter<00:01:27.119> zoom<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.560> really

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
a 75 to 35 millimeter zoom and I really

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.350 
a 75 to 35 millimeter zoom and I really
kind<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.100> use<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.909> right<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
kind of use this it's right on the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.030 
kind of use this it's right on the
borderline<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> being<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> fish<00:01:31.500> out<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:31.890> not

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
borderline of being a fish out but not

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.319 
borderline of being a fish out but not
really<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.369> fish<00:01:32.579> out<00:01:32.790> because<00:01:33.090> there's<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
really a fish out because there's a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.149 
really a fish out because there's a
magnification<00:01:33.840> factor<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> digital

magnification factor with a digital

magnification factor with a digital
thing<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.820> 1.5<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.960> that's<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.650> another

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
thing in it 1.5 but that's for another

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920 
thing in it 1.5 but that's for another
time<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.220> store<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.270> pretty<00:01:39.390> much<00:01:39.509> gives

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
time of store but it pretty much gives

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
time of store but it pretty much gives
me<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> ability<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.680> shoot<00:01:40.860> wide<00:01:41.130> angle<00:01:41.520> shots

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
me the ability to shoot wide angle shots

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.100 
me the ability to shoot wide angle shots
if<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.939> ever<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.210> those<00:01:42.329> shots<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.960> see

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
if you ever see those shots we can see

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.350 
if you ever see those shots we can see
way<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.710> left<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.280> way<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.850> right<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
way to the left and way to the right and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.609 
way to the left and way to the right and
everything<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.079> middle<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.380> pushed

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
everything in the middle is pushed

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.109 
everything in the middle is pushed
really<00:01:46.920> far<00:01:47.100> back<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.549> probably<00:01:47.759> shot<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
really far back they probably shot it

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.179 
really far back they probably shot it
with<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> fisheye<00:01:48.689> lens<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.740> that's<00:01:49.890> pretty

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
with the fisheye lens and that's pretty

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.370 
with the fisheye lens and that's pretty
close<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.549> what<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.899> not<00:01:52.079> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
close to what this one is but not really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.450 
close to what this one is but not really
and<00:01:53.220> also<00:01:53.790> I've<00:01:54.329> got<00:01:54.530> what<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.799> probably<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and also I've got what is probably a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.719 
and also I've got what is probably a
dinosaur<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> modern<00:01:58.110> era<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:59.040> shooting

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
dinosaur in the modern era of shooting

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.550 
dinosaur in the modern era of shooting
but<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> fixed<00:02:00.570> focal<00:02:00.990> length<00:02:01.140> lens<00:02:01.380> is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
but this is a fixed focal length lens is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.940 
but this is a fixed focal length lens is
the<00:02:01.649> 50<00:02:01.950> millimeter<00:02:02.310> lens<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.969> doesn't<00:02:03.509> zoom

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
the 50 millimeter lens it doesn't zoom

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.530 
the 50 millimeter lens it doesn't zoom
and<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:05.130> I'll<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.610> I'll<00:02:05.700> kind<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.240> open

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and what I'll do is I'll kind of open

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.089 
and what I'll do is I'll kind of open
this<00:02:06.600> aperture<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.229> you'll<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.890> can

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
this aperture up you'll see if you can

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.619 
this aperture up you'll see if you can
actually<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.459> through<00:02:08.879> there<00:02:09.060> maybe<00:02:09.270> see<00:02:09.569> how

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
actually see through there maybe see how

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.930 
actually see through there maybe see how
that<00:02:09.780> thing<00:02:09.959> opens<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> fixed

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that thing opens up but this is a fixed

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.610 
that thing opens up but this is a fixed
focal<00:02:12.300> length<00:02:12.450> lens<00:02:12.660> 50<00:02:13.050> millimeter

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
focal length lens 50 millimeter

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.670 
focal length lens 50 millimeter
coming<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.730> know<00:02:14.849> decent<00:02:15.239> for<00:02:15.680> macro

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
coming you know decent for macro

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.649 
coming you know decent for macro
