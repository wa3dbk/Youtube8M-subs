very one handable with lube it'll become
a lot<00:04:27.600> faster<00:04:27.960> not<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.380> fastest<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.890> all<00:04:28.980> Q's

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
a lot faster not the fastest of all Q's

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.800 
a lot faster not the fastest of all Q's
and<00:04:29.430> how<00:04:29.550> corner-cutting<00:04:30.000> with<00:04:30.300> these

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
and how corner-cutting with these

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.940 
and how corner-cutting with these
extremely<00:04:31.560> tight<00:04:31.770> tensions<00:04:33.230> it's<00:04:34.230> 45<00:04:34.650> with

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
extremely tight tensions it's 45 with

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.740 
extremely tight tensions it's 45 with
those<00:04:35.130> really<00:04:35.430> take<00:04:35.610> tensions<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.150> this<00:04:36.540> is

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
those really take tensions and this is

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.390 
those really take tensions and this is
obviously<00:04:37.140> smaller<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:40.080> yeah<00:04:40.800> this<00:04:40.980> is<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.160> nice

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
obviously smaller so yeah this is a nice

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.880 
obviously smaller so yeah this is a nice
puzzle<00:04:41.850> okay<00:04:42.780> sticking<00:04:43.140> with<00:04:43.260> mo<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.530> now<00:04:43.830> we

really nice definitely a good cue this
is<00:05:36.240> gonna<00:05:36.390> be<00:05:36.480> a<00:05:36.510> lot<00:05:36.660> of<00:05:36.690> fun<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:36.960> solve<00:05:38.030> okay

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
is gonna be a lot of fun to solve okay

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.490 
is gonna be a lot of fun to solve okay
now<00:05:39.330> let's<00:05:39.480> check<00:05:39.600> out<00:05:39.780> these<00:05:39.960> other<00:05:40.230> two

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
now let's check out these other two

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.040 
now let's check out these other two
puzzles<00:05:40.910> we'll<00:05:41.910> check<00:05:42.090> out<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.360> Fisher<00:05:42.750> Cube

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
puzzles we'll check out the Fisher Cube

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.050 
puzzles we'll check out the Fisher Cube
first<00:05:43.380> is<00:05:43.890> this<00:05:44.190> one's<00:05:44.400> just<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.760> regular

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
first is this one's just a regular

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.290 
first is this one's just a regular
domestic<00:05:45.630> shame<00:05:46.080> on<00:05:46.230> ooh<00:05:46.380> what<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:47.060> okay<00:05:48.060> well

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
domestic shame on ooh what the okay well

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.510 
domestic shame on ooh what the okay well
first<00:05:48.510> things<00:05:48.900> first<00:05:49.020> this<00:05:49.380> sticker<00:05:49.710> is

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
first things first this sticker is

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.010 
first things first this sticker is
coming<00:05:50.790> off<00:05:50.970> let's<00:05:51.150> see<00:05:51.270> if<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.390> can<00:05:51.540> place<00:05:51.810> that

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
coming off let's see if I can place that

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.180 
coming off let's see if I can place that
real<00:05:52.260> quick<00:05:54.560> here<00:05:55.560> I'll<00:05:55.650> just<00:05:55.770> put<00:05:55.950> on<00:05:56.040> my

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
real quick here I'll just put on my

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.640 
real quick here I'll just put on my
knife<00:05:56.490> so<00:05:56.670> I<00:05:56.790> get<00:05:57.000> more<00:05:57.330> accuracy<00:06:00.650> I'm

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
knife so I get more accuracy I'm

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.720 
knife so I get more accuracy I'm
probably<00:06:01.860> gonna<00:06:02.040> have<00:06:02.160> to<00:06:02.190> glue<00:06:02.400> that<00:06:02.550> on

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
probably gonna have to glue that on

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.940 
probably gonna have to glue that on
because<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.120> doesn't<00:06:03.420> stay<00:06:03.630> on<00:06:03.870> very<00:06:03.900> well<00:06:04.320> but

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
because it doesn't stay on very well but

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.290 
because it doesn't stay on very well but
for<00:06:05.130> now<00:06:05.250> I<00:06:05.280> think<00:06:05.430> it'll<00:06:05.700> be<00:06:05.820> okay

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
for now I think it'll be okay

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.100 
for now I think it'll be okay
this<00:06:06.510> is<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.810> YJ<00:06:07.260> Fisher<00:06:07.620> cube<00:06:07.920> and<00:06:08.130> I<00:06:08.780> have<00:06:09.780> it

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
this is the YJ Fisher cube and I have it

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.960 
this is the YJ Fisher cube and I have it
turns<00:06:10.320> exactly<00:06:10.890> like<00:06:11.040> my<00:06:11.190> windmill<00:06:11.520> q<00:06:11.760> here's

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
turns exactly like my windmill q here's

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.580 
turns exactly like my windmill q here's
what<00:06:12.120> I<00:06:12.150> will<00:06:12.270> cube<00:06:12.660> they<00:06:12.810> kind<00:06:13.380> of<00:06:13.410> look

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
what I will cube they kind of look

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.290 
what I will cube they kind of look
similar<00:06:13.770> but<00:06:14.490> the<00:06:14.610> stickers<00:06:14.940> are<00:06:15.060> a<00:06:15.090> little

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
similar but the stickers are a little

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.560 
similar but the stickers are a little
bit<00:06:15.390> different<00:06:15.690> but<00:06:16.700> they<00:06:17.700> turn<00:06:17.910> exactly<00:06:18.450> the

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
bit different but they turn exactly the

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.460 
bit different but they turn exactly the
same<00:06:20.510> yup<00:06:21.510> this<00:06:21.720> one<00:06:21.750> might<00:06:22.050> be<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.200> little<00:06:22.260> bit

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
same yup this one might be a little bit

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.080 
same yup this one might be a little bit
smoother<00:06:22.830> oh<00:06:23.010> yeah<00:06:23.490> it's<00:06:23.670> just<00:06:23.730> already<00:06:24.030> go

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
smoother oh yeah it's just already go

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.240 
smoother oh yeah it's just already go
through<00:06:24.150> been<00:06:24.390> through<00:06:24.510> a<00:06:24.540> mod<00:06:25.070> pretty<00:06:26.070> easy

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
through been through a mod pretty easy

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
through been through a mod pretty easy
to<00:06:26.370> solve<00:06:26.580> if<00:06:26.700> you<00:06:26.790> know<00:06:26.910> what<00:06:27.000> you're<00:06:27.090> doing

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
to solve if you know what you're doing

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.660 
to solve if you know what you're doing
and<00:06:27.480> then<00:06:28.410> the<00:06:28.560> last<00:06:28.740> cube<00:06:29.070> is<00:06:29.160> this<00:06:29.310> key

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
and then the last cube is this key

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.820 
and then the last cube is this key
