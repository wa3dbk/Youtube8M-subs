great weather all year round and it's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.880 
great weather all year round and it's
almost<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> mini<00:00:25.050> Vegas<00:00:25.470> down<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.290 
almost like a mini Vegas down on the
strip<00:00:26.070> there<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.550> think<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.119> players

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
strip there so I think the players

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.580 
strip there so I think the players
should<00:00:27.449> enjoy<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> fan<00:00:28.320> should<00:00:28.470> have
