more<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.470> a<00:00:51.800> fantastic<00:00:52.580> other<00:00:53.060> stats<00:00:53.750> such<00:00:54.050> as

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
more of a fantastic other stats such as

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.470 
more of a fantastic other stats such as
I<00:00:54.260> believe<00:00:54.650> it's<00:00:54.920> 96<00:00:55.490> agility<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.240> some<00:00:56.390> other

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
I believe it's 96 agility and some other

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.870 
I believe it's 96 agility and some other
really<00:00:56.840> incredible<00:00:57.680> stats<00:00:58.010> they're<00:00:58.460> all<00:00:58.580> very

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
really incredible stats they're all very

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.400 
really incredible stats they're all very
very<00:00:59.150> high<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.600> which<00:00:59.750> probably<00:01:00.020> gives<00:01:00.350> him

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
very high and which probably gives him

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.450 
very high and which probably gives him
his<00:01:00.710> 86<00:01:01.400> overall<00:01:02.210> rating<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.189> Marcus<00:01:04.189> Eddie's

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
his 86 overall rating and Marcus Eddie's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.880 
his 86 overall rating and Marcus Eddie's
548<00:01:04.939> so<00:01:05.150> it's<00:01:05.269> quite<00:01:05.479> small<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:05.869> very<00:01:06.409> very

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
548 so it's quite small but very very

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.890 
548 so it's quite small but very very
fast<00:01:07.100> now<00:01:07.369> you're<00:01:07.850> going<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.060> see<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.270> these<00:01:08.390> in

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.660 
assume I'd do it here I cut back past
the<00:01:33.259> player<00:01:33.469> and<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.770> always<00:01:33.950> falls<00:01:34.369> them<00:01:34.579> it

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
the player and it always falls them it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.910 
the player and it always falls them it
gives<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:34.999> a<00:01:35.030> really<00:01:35.390> open<00:01:35.689> shot<00:01:36.499> onto<00:01:36.679> the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
gives you a really open shot onto the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.700 
gives you a really open shot onto the
goal<00:01:37.100> which<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.399> just<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:37.969> so<00:01:38.329> useful<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.020> nine

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
goal which is just so so useful and nine

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.770 
goal which is just so so useful and nine
times<00:01:40.460> out<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.759> ten<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.210> will<00:01:41.329> probably<00:01:41.539> result

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
times out of ten it will probably result

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.569 
times out of ten it will probably result
in<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.109> getting<00:01:42.139> a<00:01:42.409> goal<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.100> so

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
in you getting a goal is so so

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.669 
in you getting a goal is so so
overpowered<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:44.270> had<00:01:44.389> a<00:01:44.420> lot<00:01:44.659> more<00:01:44.719> versions<00:01:45.590> of

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
skills and obviously it works even

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.740

better<00:02:16.340> when<00:02:16.790> they<00:02:16.939> have<00:02:17.090> got<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.360> five<00:02:17.569> and

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
all the pace as well and 94 dribbling

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.080 
all the pace as well and 94 dribbling
believe<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.470> just<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.460> good<00:02:22.640> at<00:02:22.850> beating

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
believe is just so so good at beating

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.110 
believe is just so so good at beating
the<00:02:23.300> bit<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.320> defenders<00:02:24.830> now<00:02:25.010> I'm<00:02:25.670> really

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
the bit in the defenders now I'm really

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.280 
the bit in the defenders now I'm really
struggling<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.600> think<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.810> any<00:02:26.930> faults<00:02:27.260> for

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
struggling to think of any faults for

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.930 
struggling to think of any faults for
him<00:02:27.500> up<00:02:27.590> there<00:02:27.620> as<00:02:27.920> always<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.520> try<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:28.880> think

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
him up there as always I try and think

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.970 
him up there as always I try and think
of<00:02:29.090> any<00:02:29.210> problems<00:02:29.600> with<00:02:29.750> players<00:02:30.020> in<00:02:30.350> these<00:02:30.590> in

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
of any problems with players in these in

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.230 
of any problems with players in these in
these<00:02:31.010> reviews<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:31.670> there<00:02:31.820> isn't<00:02:32.060> too<00:02:32.210> much

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
these reviews but there isn't too much

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.690 
these reviews but there isn't too much
it's<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.200> fighting<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.650> maybe<00:02:34.130> his<00:02:34.370> strength

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
it's a fighting for maybe his strength

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.850 
it's a fighting for maybe his strength
isn't<00:02:35.000> perfect<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:35.690> he<00:02:35.870> occasionally<00:02:36.530> does

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
isn't perfect so he occasionally does

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.320 
isn't perfect so he occasionally does
get<00:02:37.100> pushed<00:02:37.370> off<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.550> ball<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:37.910> bullied<00:02:38.210> off

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
get pushed off the ball and bullied off

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.570 
get pushed off the ball and bullied off
it<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:38.750> that's<00:02:39.290> not<00:02:39.440> really<00:02:39.620> not<00:02:40.340> really<00:02:40.400> a

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
it but that's not really not really a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.910 
it but that's not really not really a
problem<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:41.120> guess<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.810> payson<00:02:42.620> and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
problem I guess it's just the payson and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.370 
problem I guess it's just the payson and
the<00:02:43.190> dribbling<00:02:43.670> it's<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:44.420> too<00:02:44.510> good<00:02:44.960> it

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
the dribbling it's just it's too good it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.990 
the dribbling it's just it's too good it
every<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.010> really<00:02:46.310> don't<00:02:46.490> find<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.820> problem

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
every you really don't find a problem

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.850 
every you really don't find a problem
with<00:02:47.270> his<00:02:47.390> strength<00:02:47.690> because<00:02:48.050> usually<00:02:48.530> he'll

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
with his strength because usually he'll

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.650 
with his strength because usually he'll
be<00:02:48.980> able<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.160> keep<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> ball<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:49.790> close<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.570> his

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
be able to keep the ball so close to his

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.930 
be able to keep the ball so close to his
feet<00:02:50.900> or<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.620> use<00:02:51.830> enough<00:02:52.190> pace<00:02:52.460> to<00:02:52.670> get<00:02:52.850> away

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
feet or just use enough pace to get away

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.790 
feet or just use enough pace to get away
from<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.390> player<00:02:53.630> anyway<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.050> it's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
from the player anyway so it's

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.290 
from the player anyway so it's
absolutely<00:02:55.160> fantastic<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.820> also<00:02:56.030> scored<00:02:56.270> a

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
absolutely fantastic you also scored a
