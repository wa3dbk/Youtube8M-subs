still be poured in the reason why we're
doing<00:03:57.170> this<00:03:57.380> in<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.650> bag<00:03:57.860> is<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:59.000> it

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
doing this in the bag is that so it

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.540 
doing this in the bag is that so it
doesn't<00:03:59.959> both<00:04:00.140> go<00:04:00.790> everywhere<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:04.100> type<00:04:04.400> it

take a brush that before you cut the bag
open<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:37.100> can<00:04:37.730> just<00:04:38.000> push<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.390> down<00:04:39.550> like<00:04:40.550> this

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.330 

the<00:04:44.560> right<00:04:44.800> here<00:04:45.100> we<00:04:45.400> have

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
the right here we have

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.140 
the right here we have
we<00:04:47.850> have<00:04:47.970> no<00:04:48.120> space<00:04:48.449> left

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.250 

it<00:04:51.210> two<00:04:51.570> more<00:04:51.810> drops

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
it two more drops

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.650 
it two more drops
let<00:04:53.830> me<00:04:53.950> start<00:04:54.130> blending<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:55.210> can<00:04:55.360> use<00:04:55.540> the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
let me start blending you can use the

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.800 
let me start blending you can use the
bobby<00:04:55.870> pin<00:04:56.140> I<00:04:56.350> use<00:04:56.620> this<00:04:57.330> but<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.450> works<00:04:58.630> just

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
bobby pin I use this but it works just

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.159 
bobby pin I use this but it works just
as<00:04:59.080> good

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
as good

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.339 
as good
now<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.860> alcohol<00:05:02.490> you<00:05:02.699> can<00:05:02.879> use<00:05:03.120> up<00:05:03.900> from

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
now the alcohol you can use up from

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.779 
now the alcohol you can use up from
seventy<00:05:05.279> five<00:05:05.460> percent<00:05:05.520> alcohol<00:05:06.150> up<00:05:06.689> to<00:05:06.990> 100

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
seventy five percent alcohol up to 100

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.019 
seventy five percent alcohol up to 100
they<00:05:08.789> also<00:05:09.120> have<00:05:09.650> thirty-eight<00:05:10.650> percent

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:11.029 
they also have thirty-eight percent

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.899 
they also have thirty-eight percent
that's<00:05:12.029> really<00:05:12.330> good<00:05:12.539> too<00:05:12.779> I<00:05:13.580> use<00:05:14.580> the

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
that's really good too I use the

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.129 
that's really good too I use the
thirty-eight<00:05:15.300> percent

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
thirty-eight percent

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.040 
thirty-eight percent
it<00:05:17.289> is<00:05:17.969> and<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:21.009> reason<00:05:21.219> if<00:05:21.610> you<00:05:21.759> use<00:05:22.050> higher

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
it is and the reason if you use higher

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.760 
it is and the reason if you use higher
percentage<00:05:24.270> now<00:05:25.270> shadow<00:05:25.689> will<00:05:25.870> be<00:05:26.080> faster<00:05:26.740> to

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
percentage now shadow will be faster to

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.239 
percentage now shadow will be faster to
dry<00:05:27.129> so<00:05:27.639> you<00:05:27.699> need<00:05:27.999> to<00:05:28.360> be<00:05:29.349> a<00:05:29.379> little<00:05:29.710> quicker

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:30.249 
dry so you need to be a little quicker

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:32.059 
dry so you need to be a little quicker
if<00:05:30.580> you're<00:05:30.759> using<00:05:30.909> like<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.270> hundred<00:05:31.509> percent

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
if you're using like a hundred percent

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:39.690 
if you're using like a hundred percent
to<00:05:33.069> quit<00:05:33.310> a<00:05:33.340> little<00:05:33.669> quicker<00:05:33.849> to<00:05:33.969> Britain's

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.150 

okay<00:05:40.700> and<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.810> get<00:05:41.960> this<00:05:42.140> page<00:05:42.440> you<00:05:42.650> just<00:05:42.860> pass

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
okay and to get this page you just pass

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.460 
okay and to get this page you just pass
it<00:05:43.340> down<00:05:43.520> with<00:05:43.880> your<00:05:43.910> finger

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.740 

like<00:05:48.740> this

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
like this

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.910 
like this
then<00:05:51.610> take<00:05:52.810> two<00:05:53.810> drops<00:05:54.430> again

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.270 

then<00:05:58.490> put<00:05:58.850> the<00:05:58.940> rest<00:05:59.120> of<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.390> eyeshadow

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.590 

yes<00:06:04.970> is<00:06:05.300> this

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.470 

this<00:06:12.590> is<00:06:12.770> false<00:06:13.040> out<00:06:13.310> don't<00:06:13.760> be<00:06:13.940> alarmed<00:06:14.150> you

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
this is false out don't be alarmed you

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.330 
this is false out don't be alarmed you
do<00:06:14.750> it<00:06:14.870> was<00:06:14.990> just

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
do it was just

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.300 
do it was just
but<00:06:16.820> at<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:16.970> end<00:06:17.060> of<00:06:17.389> your<00:06:17.540> table<00:06:17.949> that<00:06:18.949> put<00:06:19.190> it

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
but at the end of your table that put it

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.680 
but at the end of your table that put it
right<00:06:19.910> it

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
right it

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.439 
right it
so<00:06:22.690> that's<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:23.710> problem

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
so that's the problem

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.890 
so that's the problem
then<00:06:25.990> take<00:06:26.319> two<00:06:26.590> drops<00:06:26.949> more

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:40.760 

like<00:06:30.199> this<00:06:30.759> and<00:06:31.759> you<00:06:31.910> start<00:06:32.150> blogging<00:06:32.330> again

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:58.310 

this

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.439 

then<00:06:58.980> you<00:06:59.430> take<00:06:59.700> a<00:06:59.760> thinker

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449 
then you take a thinker

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:04.540 
then you take a thinker
they're<00:07:01.990> just<00:07:02.379> like<00:07:02.590> before

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
they're just like before

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.620 
they're just like before
you<00:07:04.640> press<00:07:04.970> it<00:07:05.000> down

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.930

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:19.670 
alcohol will be a little bit longer to

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.210 
alcohol will be a little bit longer to
dry<00:07:20.200> but<00:07:21.200> using<00:07:21.650> takes<00:07:21.920> about<00:07:22.370> 20<00:07:23.060> minutes

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.220

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.680 
dry but using takes about 20 minutes
sometimes<00:07:25.220> it<00:07:25.340> takes<00:07:25.490> the<00:07:25.790> shorter<00:07:26.150> time<00:07:26.390> and

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690 
sometimes it takes the shorter time and

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.070 
sometimes it takes the shorter time and
sometimes<00:07:27.260> it's<00:07:27.680> smoker<00:07:28.270> so<00:07:29.270> it's<00:07:29.630> best<00:07:29.900> to

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
sometimes it's smoker so it's best to
