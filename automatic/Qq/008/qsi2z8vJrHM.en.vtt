this<00:00:44.250> weight<00:00:44.550> gravity<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.600> coming<00:00:45.870> straight

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
this weight gravity is coming straight

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
this weight gravity is coming straight
down<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> our<00:00:46.860> biceps<00:00:47.399> are<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.640> curling

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
down on it our biceps are not curling

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.970 
down on it our biceps are not curling
anymore<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> advantage<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> machine

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
anymore so the advantage of the machine

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.590 
anymore so the advantage of the machine
weight<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.030> constant

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
weight is that it's a constant

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.990 
weight is that it's a constant
resistance<00:00:51.719> throughout<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> motion<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.789> keep

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
resistance throughout the motion so keep

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.910 
resistance throughout the motion so keep
switching<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.629> go<00:00:54.840> back<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.230> forth<00:00:55.440> but

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
switching it up go back and forth but

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.569 
switching it up go back and forth but
for<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.190> straight<00:00:57.090> bar<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> curl<00:00:58.579> I'm
