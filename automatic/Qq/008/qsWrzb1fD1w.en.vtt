00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
do you think that the bicyclist is
totally<00:01:42.689> responsible<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.649> happened<00:01:43.979> or

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
totally responsible for what happened or

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.859 
totally responsible for what happened or
do<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.700> think<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.030> they<00:01:45.119> both<00:01:45.270> share<00:01:45.329> some

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
do you think that they both share some

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.499 
do you think that they both share some
responsibility<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.860> my<00:01:47.670> view<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.240> both

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
responsibility in my view they both

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
responsibility in my view they both
share<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:49.049> responsibility<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.369> wouldn't

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
share some responsibility and I wouldn't

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.399 
share some responsibility and I wouldn't
be<00:01:50.700> surprised<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.659> pedestrian<00:01:52.170> turns

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
be surprised if the pedestrian turns

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
be surprised if the pedestrian turns
around<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.860> counter<00:01:53.280> sues<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.490> bicyclist

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
around and counter sues the bicyclist

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
around and counter sues the bicyclist
for<00:01:54.720> causing<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> accident<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.680> shattered

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
for causing the accident that shattered

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.800 
for causing the accident that shattered
her<00:01:56.280> elbow<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> bottom<00:01:57.360> line<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
her elbow so the bottom line that you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.359 
her elbow so the bottom line that you
have<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.079> look<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:58.649> evaluating<00:01:59.040> this

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
have to look at when evaluating this

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.219 
have to look at when evaluating this
type<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.759> cases<00:02:00.180> who's<00:02:00.719> actually<00:02:00.960> responsible

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
type of cases who's actually responsible

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.530 
type of cases who's actually responsible
and<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> turns<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.909> both<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.450> them

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
and if it turns out that both of them

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.719 
and if it turns out that both of them
are<00:02:03.689> actually<00:02:03.840> responsible<00:02:04.560> then<00:02:05.159> neither

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
are actually responsible then neither

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.249 
are actually responsible then neither
one<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> them<00:02:06.210> will<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.450> able<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.689> recover<00:02:06.960> full

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
one of them will be able to recover full

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.719 
one of them will be able to recover full
compensation<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.220> their<00:02:08.310> injuries
