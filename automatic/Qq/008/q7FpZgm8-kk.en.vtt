00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
other evidence of this other than this

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.030 
other evidence of this other than this
image<00:00:34.090> which<00:00:34.330> could<00:00:34.690> have<00:00:34.809> been<00:00:34.930> doctored<00:00:35.440> but

re-imagined<00:02:07.600> i<00:02:07.780> don't<00:02:08.170> think<00:02:08.410> it's<00:02:08.560> going<00:02:08.769> to

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
re-imagined i don't think it's going to

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.880 
re-imagined i don't think it's going to
be<00:02:09.190> like<00:02:10.030> what<00:02:10.269> we<00:02:10.420> saw<00:02:10.660> on<00:02:10.869> terminal<00:02:11.440> 4<00:02:11.709> modern

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
be like what we saw on terminal 4 modern

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.789 
be like what we saw on terminal 4 modern
warfare<00:02:11.980> 3<00:02:12.269> terminal<00:02:13.269> was<00:02:13.570> basically<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
warfare 3 terminal was basically the

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.979 
warfare 3 terminal was basically the
same<00:02:15.010> map<00:02:15.340> with<00:02:15.610> just<00:02:15.940> different<00:02:16.329> coloring<00:02:16.810> I

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
same map with just different coloring I

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.710 
same map with just different coloring I
mean<00:02:17.169> I<00:02:17.320> know<00:02:17.440> they<00:02:17.709> added<00:02:18.070> different<00:02:18.730> visuals

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
mean I know they added different visuals

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.920 
mean I know they added different visuals
etc<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> backgrounds<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.250> was<00:02:21.549> still

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
etc in the backgrounds but it was still

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.350 
etc in the backgrounds but it was still
essentially<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.080> same<00:02:23.290> map<00:02:23.850> whereas<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.880> think

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
essentially the same map whereas I think

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.710 
essentially the same map whereas I think
with<00:02:25.960> firing<00:02:26.500> range<00:02:26.830> as<00:02:27.430> being<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.970> reimagined

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
with firing range as being a reimagined

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.780 
with firing range as being a reimagined
adaptation<00:02:29.620> there's<00:02:30.010> going<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.400> be<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.550> lot

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
adaptation there's going to be a lot

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.880 
adaptation there's going to be a lot
different<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.840> know<00:02:31.930> maybe<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:32.350> part

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
different and you know maybe it's part

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.280 
different and you know maybe it's part

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
of a studio set but it's set similar to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.050 
of a studio set but it's set similar to
how<00:02:35.530> firing<00:02:36.040> ranges<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.520> guess<00:02:36.670> we'll<00:02:36.850> have<00:02:36.910> to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060

it's<00:03:45.880> pretty<00:03:46.060> cool<00:03:46.360> they<00:03:47.050> got<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.260> lot<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.770> lot

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
it's pretty cool they got a lot of a lot

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.949 
it's pretty cool they got a lot of a lot
of<00:03:48.280> features<00:03:48.580> added<00:03:48.850> into<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.209> map<00:03:49.420> so<00:03:49.840> go

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
of features added into that map so go

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.770
