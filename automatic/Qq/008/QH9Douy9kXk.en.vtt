 hello in this lesson we are with you 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.389
 learn how to braid the braid of 3 strands and with 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.279
 ribbon for this we need 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.259
 ribbon 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.259
 comb and beautifull our model 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.609
 remove three strands 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.430
 the ribbon here goes one 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.430
 the other hand on the strand goes up 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.890
 we drive the middle strand with a tape I take 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:17.930
 the other hand the other another strand in the third 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.930
 put down do not add hairs 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.470
 one thing the other way . 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.420
 for someone who wants to learn this spit 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.270
 actually need to start with spit 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.950
 vice versa with two ribbons 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.950
 after it you can learn this spit 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.410
 will be simpler 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.709
 viscosity time is poured over the middle strand 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.709
 moves from hand to hand 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.130
 either this caste can try everything 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.489
 braid from the tail is also much easier 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.800
 than 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.800
 immediately lead over the head with a cover 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:34.710
 the right ribbon also finish braid 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:48.950
 rubber band all previous braids 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:48.950
 end at the tip of taping 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:59.199
 You can braid the bow, you can not 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.199
 do with a bow 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.680
 do you like 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.830
 made a little more luxuriant 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:42.440
 why you can fry the tail 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.910
 Spit will not be dismissed anywhere 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:18.300
 such a beautiful end is obtained 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.830
 twists me can leave 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.830
