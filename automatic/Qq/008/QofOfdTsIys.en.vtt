and it should slide in place it's a
little<00:01:59.999> bit<00:02:00.090> more<00:02:00.239> difficult<00:02:00.569> to<00:02:00.929> get<00:02:01.079> in

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
little bit more difficult to get in

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.289 
little bit more difficult to get in
sometimes<00:02:01.709> but<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.609> it<00:02:05.029> works<00:02:06.029> really

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
sometimes but they have it works really

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.249

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
well right it's kind of just make sure

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.690 
well right it's kind of just make sure
it's<00:02:10.410> nice<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.739> tight<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.310> there<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.670> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it's nice and tight in there so it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.459 
it's nice and tight in there so it
slides<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.269> place<00:02:14.299> works<00:02:15.299> really<00:02:15.689> well<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
slides in place works really well the

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.510 
slides in place works really well the
only<00:02:16.860> issue

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
only issue

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.210 
only issue
are<00:02:17.670> sometimes<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.720> don't<00:02:18.870> get<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.650> you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
are sometimes you don't get see as you

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.470 
are sometimes you don't get see as you
guys<00:02:20.340> could<00:02:20.520> see<00:02:20.700> it's<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.940> little<00:02:20.970> loose<00:02:21.270> right

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
guys could see it's a little loose right

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.850 
guys could see it's a little loose right
here<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.750> means<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.050> didn't<00:02:22.290> slide<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.710> in

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
here that means I didn't slide it in

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.060 
here that means I didn't slide it in
properly<00:02:23.960> you<00:02:24.960> just<00:02:25.170> got<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.350> make<00:02:25.590> sure<00:02:25.620> that

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
properly you just got to make sure that

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.280 
properly you just got to make sure that
when<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.910> slide<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.510> everything<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
when you slide it in everything is a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.880 
when you slide it in everything is a
line<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.040> case<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:31.200> really<00:02:31.320> hard<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.740> do

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
line on the case it's really hard to do

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.210 
line on the case it's really hard to do
this<00:02:32.070> well<00:02:32.430> being<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> camera<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:34.220> you

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
this well being on the camera but you

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.520 
this well being on the camera but you
kind<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.490> push<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:40.670> yeah<00:02:41.670> see<00:02:42.380> can't<00:02:43.380> get

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
kind of push it in yeah see can't get

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.500 
kind of push it in yeah see can't get
the<00:02:43.680> case<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.370> slide<00:02:44.610> on<00:02:44.760> properly<00:02:45.350> well<00:02:47.510> when

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
the case to slide on properly well when

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.660 
the case to slide on properly well when
it<00:02:48.660> works<00:02:48.900> properly<00:02:49.410> right<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.400> when<00:02:50.490> you're

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
it works properly right and when you're

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.440 
it works properly right and when you're
not<00:02:51.090> shooting<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:51.930> camera<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:54.360> it

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
not shooting this on camera you have it

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.790 
not shooting this on camera you have it
laying<00:02:54.660> face<00:02:54.870> down<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.230> table<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.650> you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
laying face down on the table and you

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.710 
laying face down on the table and you
just<00:02:55.980> slide<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:57.150> issues<00:02:57.480> with<00:02:57.630> this

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
just slide it in the issues with this

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.310 
just slide it in the issues with this
case<00:02:57.960> is<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.440> sliding<00:02:58.860> mechanism<00:03:00.020> isn't<00:03:01.020> as

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
case is the sliding mechanism isn't as

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.800 
case is the sliding mechanism isn't as
easy<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.590> put<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:01.890> as<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.760> would<00:03:02.940> like<00:03:03.150> right

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
easy to put on as I would like right

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:11.720 
easy to put on as I would like right
this<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.190> battery<00:03:05.610> component<00:03:06.210> case<00:03:10.730> and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
this is the battery component case and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
this is the battery component case and
you<00:03:11.790> also<00:03:11.970> slide<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.630> in<00:03:12.780> place<00:03:17.420> yeah<00:03:18.420> there

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
you also slide it in place yeah there

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.100 
you also slide it in place yeah there
you<00:03:18.870> go<00:03:19.910> battery<00:03:20.910> component<00:03:21.540> slides<00:03:21.750> on<00:03:21.930> much

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
you go battery component slides on much

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.830 
you go battery component slides on much
easier<00:03:22.470> than<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.100> actual<00:03:23.540> if<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.630> just

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
easier than the actual if you just

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.220 
easier than the actual if you just
wanted<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.200> use<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.620> sliding<00:03:26.160> type<00:03:26.340> mechanism

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
wanted to use the sliding type mechanism

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.920 
wanted to use the sliding type mechanism
works<00:03:28.230> really<00:03:28.500> well<00:03:28.700> no<00:03:29.700> real<00:03:29.940> watermarks<00:03:30.750> on

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
works really well no real watermarks on

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.370 
works really well no real watermarks on
the<00:03:31.640> we're<00:03:32.640> an<00:03:32.760> issue<00:03:32.940> on<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.390> glass<00:03:33.690> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
like that some water marks do occur

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.210 
like that some water marks do occur
especially<00:03:46.200> if<00:03:46.470> don't<00:03:46.620> clean<00:03:46.800> off<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.070> glass

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
especially if don't clean off the glass

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.620 
especially if don't clean off the glass
in<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.459> mills<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.790> can<00:03:47.940> see<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.150> didn't<00:03:48.480> clean

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
in the mills you can see I didn't clean

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.910 
in the mills you can see I didn't clean
the<00:03:48.660> sauce<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.230> see<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.410> watermark

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the sauce so you see that watermark

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.800 
the sauce so you see that watermark
pretty<00:03:50.190> clearly<00:03:50.459> on<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.880> when<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.510> depress

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810
