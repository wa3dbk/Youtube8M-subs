is going to unloosen a bit so the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.960 
is going to unloosen a bit so the
tighter<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:05.960> make<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.429> tighter<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:07.850> the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
tighter you make it the tighter in the

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.779 
tighter you make it the tighter in the
end<00:02:08.119> it'll<00:02:08.330> be

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.050 

so<00:02:11.360> there<00:02:12.049> we<00:02:12.230> go<00:02:12.260> all<00:02:12.709> right<00:02:13.430> once<00:02:13.819> you've
