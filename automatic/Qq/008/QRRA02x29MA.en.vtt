00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.700
 the king is clear clear they can 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.920
 begin to disassemble you have a letter 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.750
 Send rain white here. 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.310
 Guys I know that when they come to me 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.550
 a blank check for the link 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.350
 You think wow the milk went crazy. 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.480
 good no need to worry because the 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.890
 here's a plan on 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.660
 mind is a good plan also knows all 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.460
 light year has a huge party called 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.930
 want a beautiful football is a good event 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.000
 legal that unites all the elite of the city 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.290
 they drink tea, mother starts to spend 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 money buying a lot of things 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.900
 legal in the auction have even cars and 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.210
 pickup trucks 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.040
 and that's where the bank war is going to come in. 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.750
 I understand a little of marketing the author 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.180
 good you do not always have to stay on the verge of 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.500
 road let me back up the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.269
 His dreams I'm going to take to be 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.699
 auctioned in the event I'm going to show a 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.040
 little of the magic of gmac on stage at all 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.140
 world will bid on it but will only have 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.820
 a winner and one thing I can talk about 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.530
 Texans do not like to lose 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.270
 so in all other riches will 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.229
 to queue at Izhmash after one thing 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.729
 bigger and better 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.590
 Let's take this deal in there. 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.299
 before he changes his mind 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.000
 So the staff has 30 days to do 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.260
 a very special thing or car 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.260
 send rain will close the doors 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.850
 who would say 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.770
 It's been a while before for my birthday. 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.770
 but today gave me a present 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.960
 Do you know what a horse looks like? 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.110
 Grandson's teeth are entitled to direction 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.550
 right giving the silverado key I can 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.140
 Do what I want in this car, I'll 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.330
 Make the most of it, we'll just go. 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.280
 keep the body already if all the rest 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.280
 will change first we will demote 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.200
 down to the ground because that's what we do 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.660
 with old pickup trucks for this we need 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.340
 of new suspensions in front and back 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.350
 Maybe we need to get the bucket to 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.720
 forward to do this we will 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.940
 install a new ls7 chevrolet engine in 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.770
 sheet with 600 horsepower 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.390
 then we go for big wheels we love 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.670
 the rim 22 and this is what we will use 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.440
 my dreams r 35 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.270
 after a two-tone painting and the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.920
 custom interior we will have 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.640
 a truck with big tires and lots of 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.530
 power 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.730
 will be one of the cool things that 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.730
 We already did on Gmac. 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.070
 I think you're very excited about 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.420
 this project 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.190
 Actually, I know it's because I 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.020
 It's also going to be one of the things most 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.540
 We've done it and we've done it. 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.360
 very good things recently and I think 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.130
 that there has the potential to be the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.709
 best of all we are not 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.320
 inventing the wheel that our pickup truck will 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.150
 follow a very well-known pattern 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.190
 The difference is that these builders who 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.440
 do these pickups have many and many 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.660
 months to do the service and we just 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.970
 has four weeks and a team well 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.230
 so small to do that job at 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.610
 people are going to have to rethink the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.260
 work here get hurt a while 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.060
 higher spending in the beginning will blame us 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.980
 a long time in the end a problem that the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.209
 We had people when we tried. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.070
 set up something that did not have 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.350
 I disassembled it gave a lot of work to 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.209
 people who did not dispute a window and 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.950
 from there to do the shop and you try 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.330
 to go back to the window he did not talk to 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.030
 You were missing two screws 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.239
 and one of them was with the crooked trio 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.239
 therefore in this specific case who 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.590
 dismounting will be 100% responsible for 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.300
 ride back 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.370
 You have to do something that you 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.540
 You know you're good at a project like this. 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.130
 You can try to learn. 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.420
 sometimes it gives but we have to be 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.489
 fast and everyone has a 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.590
 specialty then concentrate on what 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.970
 You know you will not want the Carter Stadium. 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.090
 no load 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.530
 Everyone here is professional and 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.780
 did a lot of this work so we 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.060
 will do my best because I 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.250
 I would love to deliver on time and 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.739
 pressure is great I would like it to stay 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.849
 perfect I'm ready if everyone 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.069
 are ready 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:58.450
 Okay, we'll start the process. 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:59.739
 take this thing down and look at the pickup truck 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.690
 is starting with the right foot to 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.819
 to evaluate face everyone is motivated 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.670
 entering with everything in the construction looks 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.829
 This is really cool, it's cool. 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.319
 gorgeous gorgeous 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.220
 the cool thing is that it 's a big screen in 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.690
 White 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.910
 now the sad thing is that we're going to use 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.310
 very little of the future but also that goes 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.410
 Call when we're done. 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:26.710
 it will be fast 40 lowered and more 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.000
 one thing this will come out a lot but a lot 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.550
 same expensive 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.229
 But you heard the rhythm we have. 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.539
 carte blanche can do anything 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.539
 So, lets do it 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.830
 in this workshop they compete to see 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.630
 who has a higher snoring 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.630
 the motors 11
