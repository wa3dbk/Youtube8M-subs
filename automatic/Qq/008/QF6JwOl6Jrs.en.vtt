00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
mask before application right so I got

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.790 
mask before application right so I got
confused<00:02:14.030> which<00:02:14.630> wasn't<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.170> big<00:02:15.380> deal<00:02:15.410> because

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
confused which wasn't a big deal because

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.760 
confused which wasn't a big deal because
this<00:02:16.700> sucker<00:02:16.970> isn't<00:02:17.450> supposed<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.050> scratch<00:02:18.440> so

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
this sucker isn't supposed to scratch so

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.460 
this sucker isn't supposed to scratch so
it<00:02:18.860> doesn't<00:02:19.130> really<00:02:19.250> matter<00:02:19.610> no<00:02:20.300> but<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.380> know

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
it doesn't really matter no but you know

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.050 
it doesn't really matter no but you know
the<00:02:21.590> important<00:02:21.950> thing<00:02:22.069> is<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.220> know<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.849> this

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
the important thing is to know that this

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.970 
the important thing is to know that this
is<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.330> adhesive<00:02:23.900> side<00:02:24.110> which<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.530> number<00:02:24.680> two

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
is the adhesive side which is number two

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.940 
is the adhesive side which is number two
and<00:02:25.280> then<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.569> take<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.440> off<00:02:27.620> when<00:02:27.830> you're

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
and then you take this off when you're

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.589 
and then you take this off when you're
done<00:02:28.099> or<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.730> can<00:02:28.849> take<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.090> off<00:02:29.180> before<00:02:29.330> you

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
done or you can take it off before you

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.699 
done or you can take it off before you
start<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.959> think<00:02:29.989> that's<00:02:30.230> kind<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.470> what<00:02:30.590> they

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
start I think that's kind of what they

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.610 
start I think that's kind of what they
meant<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.270> but<00:02:32.270> typically<00:02:32.900> when<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.110> do<00:02:33.230> on<00:02:33.590> a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
meant and but typically when I do on a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.050 
meant and but typically when I do on a
screen<00:02:33.920> shield<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.459> like<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.700> keep<00:02:34.910> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
screen shield and so I like to keep the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.210 
screen shield and so I like to keep the
protective<00:02:35.510> piece<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:35.930> while<00:02:36.650> I'm<00:02:36.800> scraping

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
protective piece on while I'm scraping

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.949 
protective piece on while I'm scraping
away<00:02:37.520> trying<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.090> get<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.390> bubbles<00:02:38.569> out<00:02:38.780> or

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
away trying to get the bubbles out or

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.830 
away trying to get the bubbles out or
getting<00:02:39.140> it<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:40.040> stick<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.209> phone<00:02:41.510> so

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
getting it to to stick to the phone so

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.119 
getting it to to stick to the phone so
it<00:02:42.019> doesn't<00:02:42.319> slide<00:02:42.560> around<00:02:42.620> while<00:02:43.040> you're

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
it doesn't slide around while you're

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.390 
it doesn't slide around while you're
doing<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.519> so<00:02:44.030> I'm<00:02:44.750> sure<00:02:45.019> maybe<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.799> just<00:02:45.890> me

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
doing it so I'm sure maybe it's just me

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.190 
doing it so I'm sure maybe it's just me
so<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.760> figured<00:02:47.120> I'd<00:02:47.239> throw<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.840> out<00:02:47.989> there

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
so I figured I'd throw that out there

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.910 
so I figured I'd throw that out there
for<00:02:48.439> you<00:02:48.530> guys<00:02:48.939> to<00:02:49.939> see<00:02:50.209> what<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.959> think<00:02:51.260> but
