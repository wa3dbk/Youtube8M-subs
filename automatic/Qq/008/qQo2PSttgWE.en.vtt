that they had the design had a peacock

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.149 
that they had the design had a peacock
design<00:01:11.340> with<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> tribal<00:01:13.020> tattoo<00:01:13.200> design<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
design with a tribal tattoo design you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.910 
design with a tribal tattoo design you
were<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.610> mixed<00:01:15.000> together<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> then

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
were kind of mixed together and so then

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.890 
were kind of mixed together and so then
they<00:01:17.040> updated<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.820> design<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.600> they<00:01:18.689> made

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
they updated that design and they made

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.859 
they updated that design and they made
this<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> now<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.820> pluma<00:01:21.420> deck<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
this that is now the pluma deck and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.130 
this that is now the pluma deck and
didn't<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.680> Puma<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:24.090> least<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.479> Spanish<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
didn't know Puma at least in Spanish and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.690 
didn't know Puma at least in Spanish and
I<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> couple<00:01:25.560> other<00:01:25.950> languages<00:01:26.460> means

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
I think a couple other languages means

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.630 
I think a couple other languages means
feather<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.259> that's<00:01:28.680> fitting<00:01:29.280> because<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
feather and so that's fitting because of

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.960 
feather and so that's fitting because of
all<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> feathers<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:32.130> deck<00:01:32.369> has<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
all the feathers on here the deck has a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.600 
all the feathers on here the deck has a
couple<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> add<00:01:33.689> cards<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.710> most<00:01:34.979> bicycle

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
slippery and I feel pretty secure and

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.119 
slippery and I feel pretty secure and
the<00:03:39.669> overall<00:03:39.970> Fanning<00:03:40.629> is<00:03:40.840> smooth<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.590> not

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129

the overall Fanning is smooth and not
extremely<00:03:42.639> clumpy<00:03:44.310> finally<00:03:45.310> let's<00:03:45.639> look<00:03:45.790> at<00:03:46.299> a

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
extremely clumpy finally let's look at a

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.039 
extremely clumpy finally let's look at a
giant<00:03:47.500> fan<00:03:47.829> so<00:03:48.699> there<00:03:48.910> is<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.090> lot<00:03:49.299> of<00:03:49.540> design

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
giant fan so there is a lot of design

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.770 
giant fan so there is a lot of design
going<00:03:50.470> on<00:03:50.620> here<00:03:51.069> with<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.400> giant<00:03:51.790> fan<00:03:51.849> I<00:03:52.359> think

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
going on here with the giant fan I think

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.909 
going on here with the giant fan I think
it<00:03:52.900> looks<00:03:53.049> pretty<00:03:53.139> cool<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:55.560> think<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.680> debt

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
it looks pretty cool I think the debt

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:05.360 
it looks pretty cool I think the debt
can<00:03:57.430> be<00:03:57.459> used<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:57.970> magic<00:04:01.919> getting<00:04:02.919> carded<00:04:03.540> and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
can be used for magic getting carded and

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.490 
can be used for magic getting carded and
of<00:04:06.370> course<00:04:06.639> you<00:04:06.970> can<00:04:07.120> use<00:04:07.239> it<00:04:07.269> for<00:04:07.599> that<00:04:08.049> every

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
of course you can use it for that every

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.699 
of course you can use it for that every
day<00:04:08.530> card<00:04:09.129> game<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.900> that's<00:04:10.900> about<00:04:11.319> it<00:04:11.560> for

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
day card game and that's about it for

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.979 
day card game and that's about it for
this<00:04:12.010> deck<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.400> cards<00:04:12.819> I<00:04:13.000> personally<00:04:13.540> really

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989
