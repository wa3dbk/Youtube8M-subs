00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
look like so you go to go ahead are you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.640 
look like so you go to go ahead are you
going<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.210> cut<00:02:25.390> out<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.990> best<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.440> plan

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
going to cut out to the best of the plan

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.410 
going to cut out to the best of the plan
this<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.280> what<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.640> would<00:02:27.760> look<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:27.910> when<00:02:28.270> you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
this is what it would look like when you

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.560 
this is what it would look like when you
finished<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:30.100> then<00:02:30.400> you're<00:02:31.180> going<00:02:31.420> to

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
finished and and then you're going to

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:44.820 
finished and and then you're going to
fold<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.770> burnish<00:02:42.810> when<00:02:43.810> you've<00:02:44.080> folded<00:02:44.530> and
