00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 yes, welcome to this 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.940
 would like to show how to get one 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.040
 automatic cactus plantation so builds the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.090
 you can touch these 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.099
 automatically knows and 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.650
 pushed together and first of all 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.000
 here we have an inside surface of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.699
 9 to 9 each 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.880
 it will have so that the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.490
 Cacti are known to grow 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.430
 sand and that's why we have to go for it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.880
 make sure the captains are standing on sand 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.010
 can 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.859
 I put the blocks here like they do 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:39.450
 basically will be in the air 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.980
 still have to be seen and seen 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.420
 in between draws at most like that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.789
 could be planted that way 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.910
 but that is the danger that too big 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.020
 due to falling cactus on his blog 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:01:02.940
 weather then ready 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:06.710
 and that's why we put it that way 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.710
 the voting blocks in the country again 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.840
 so wrote the blocks and below 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.869
 underneath it is water 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.539
 put the water will be the sloping 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.030
 Catch products together and now 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.770
 we form below to respond even 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.039
 outflows that we have no problems 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:51.000
 certain things can stay together that way 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:53.640
 water becomes 85 6 that's what it should be 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.350
 miss 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.570
 right there, we need a lot 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.810
 water, that is, every corner that is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.810
 water 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.369
 And that had the consequence that the water 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.760
 come together and rule them all 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:19.239
 that hole might fall just that 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.220
 everything is okay then we put here too 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.540
 These blocks each have a country air and 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.540
 the fight of the grow can 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.510
 it is recommended and later here 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.190
 the walls are raised so that the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:43.490
 Partie does not fall out 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:45.830
 We can now exactly a cactus to one 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.360
 blogger and we can speak for it 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.200
 make sure that he also gets to the second block 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.150
 falls apart here 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.540
 and there are also the same 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.110
 method I want you here a first 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.110
 blog on it 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.950
 and the cactus talking now currently 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.140
 is this growing block high he leads 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.239
 would prevent it from happening again 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.920
 we put a sign to each 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.420
 side and this shield ensures that 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.040
 here are these two future ones 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.690
 appeals and this shield ensures 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.700
 that these two heads are waiting 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.230
 we can sit down now 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:30.160
 five shots of how effective that is 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:34.459
 for the luck of the 4 if the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.580
 cactus plantation about italian then 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.400
 You can also recommend these citizens for 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.680
 with a nice one here 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.670
 anyway he does not have the plantation 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.220
 but works just as well 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.140
 to be underground only then 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.220
 Make sure that you win is that 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.220
 for example someone 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.060
 Gray 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.040
 if necessary, you can still the walls 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.270
 loaded with torches but looking 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.270
 should then be bright enough 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.110
 there will also be possible torches between 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.110
 to put the wine 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.650
 that tells me if stop 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.720
 look closely, it is actually so 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.810
 we can only finish 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.280
 watch how the whole grows 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.280
 Thank you for these three days
