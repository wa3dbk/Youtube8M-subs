helmets seem to be from a feature
standpoint<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:07.860> ahead<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
standpoint a little bit ahead of the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.649 
standpoint a little bit ahead of the
game<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.880> comes<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> price<00:01:09.390> point

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
game when it comes to price point

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.050 
game when it comes to price point
compared<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.049> other<00:01:10.200> brands<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:11.189> test<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
compared to other brands they test and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210 
compared to other brands they test and
they<00:01:12.450> prototype<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.380> quickly<00:01:13.680> here

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
they prototype very quickly here

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
they prototype very quickly here
stateside<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.689> develop<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.259> helmet

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
stateside and they can develop a helmet

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.050 
stateside and they can develop a helmet
that<00:01:16.590> they<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.040> beat<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.820> wind

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that they can beat on they can wind

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
that they can beat on they can wind
tunnel<00:01:18.330> tests<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:18.900> water<00:01:19.350> tunnel<00:01:19.740> tests

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
tunnel tests they can water tunnel tests

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.490 
tunnel tests they can water tunnel tests
for<00:01:20.430> aerodynamics<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.479> airflow<00:01:22.049> through<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
for aerodynamics and airflow through the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
for aerodynamics and airflow through the
helmet<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:23.970> without

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
helmet but they can do it here without

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330 
helmet but they can do it here without
sending<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.869> speck<00:01:25.290> overseas<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.189> get

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
sending that speck overseas to get

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
sending that speck overseas to get
developed<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.210> sent<00:01:27.509> back<00:01:27.689> that's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
developed and then sent back that's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.390 
developed and then sent back that's
something<00:01:28.380> that's<00:01:28.560> huge<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:28.890> them<00:01:29.130> it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
something that's huge for them it's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.740 
something that's huge for them it's
actually<00:01:29.700> something<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.060> allowed<00:01:30.479> them

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
actually something that's allowed them

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.560 
actually something that's allowed them
to<00:01:30.780> incorporate<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.829> m2010<00:01:32.700> cell<00:01:33.119> standard

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
to incorporate the m2010 cell standard

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
to incorporate the m2010 cell standard
into<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.200> vortex<00:01:34.470> which<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.250> said<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
into this vortex which like I said is a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.270 
into this vortex which like I said is a
hundred<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.630> start<00:01:36.930> starting<00:01:37.380> point<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.619> 169

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
hundred to start starting point is 169

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.660 
hundred to start starting point is 169
dollar<00:01:38.640> helmet<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.040> see<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
dollar helmet so you can see that the

chin vent system that's going to come

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.540 
chin vent system that's going to come
down<00:02:47.820> here<00:02:48.350> you're<00:02:49.350> going<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.590> notice<00:02:49.800> when<00:02:50.400> we

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
down here you're going to notice when we

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.640 
down here you're going to notice when we
pop<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.790> shield<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.450> guy<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:52.410> it's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
pop the shield on this guy that it's

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.280 
pop the shield on this guy that it's
going<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.280> anti<00:02:53.880> fog<00:02:54.290> anti-scratch

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
going to be your anti fog anti-scratch

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.830 
going to be your anti fog anti-scratch
shield<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.370> actually<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:57.360> shield<00:02:57.660> is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
shield and this actually this shield is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.530 
shield and this actually this shield is
the<00:02:57.990> same<00:02:58.320> shield<00:02:58.830> as<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.520> bell<00:02:59.730> star<00:02:59.970> helmet

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
the same shield as the bell star helmet

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.630 
the same shield as the bell star helmet
so<00:03:00.900> again<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> race<00:03:01.920> level<00:03:02.340> shield

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
so again this is a race level shield

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.940 
so again this is a race level shield
it's<00:03:03.120> polycarbonate<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.500> has<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> quick

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
it's polycarbonate it has a quick

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.770 
it's polycarbonate it has a quick
release<00:03:05.160> system<00:03:05.460> which<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.940> really<00:03:06.150> nice<00:03:06.360> but

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
release system which is really nice but

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.420 
release system which is really nice but
you<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:06.990> get<00:03:07.110> all<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.290> same<00:03:07.740> colors<00:03:08.220> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
you can get all the same colors and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.820 
you can get all the same colors and
tints<00:03:08.970> they<00:03:09.300> make<00:03:09.480> for<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.750> star<00:03:10.050> for<00:03:10.710> this

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830
