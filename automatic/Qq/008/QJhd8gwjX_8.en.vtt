ropes<00:02:23.110> which<00:02:23.319> I<00:02:23.439> think<00:02:23.680> would<00:02:23.799> be<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:23.980> most

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
ropes which I think would be the most

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.839 
ropes which I think would be the most
fitting<00:02:24.459> as<00:02:25.980> anything<00:02:26.980> else<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.700> you'll

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
fitting as anything else that you'll

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.390 
fitting as anything else that you'll
want<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.299> do<00:02:28.629> just<00:02:29.560> some<00:02:29.709> notes<00:02:29.920> here<00:02:30.040> that

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
you'll probably want to join the College

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.830 
you'll probably want to join the College
of<00:02:32.530> Winterhold<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:33.220> become<00:02:33.519> more<00:02:33.819> powerful<00:02:34.269> in

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
Winterhold seems fitting I mean that's

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.330

completely up to you and then the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.440 
completely up to you and then the
probably<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.459> needed<00:02:48.730> thing<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.060> you'll<00:02:49.239> want

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
probably the needed thing is you'll want

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
zombie spell and anything that raises
