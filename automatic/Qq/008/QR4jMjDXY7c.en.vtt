00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it would be odd well then they could

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340 
it would be odd well then they could
share<00:01:23.400> tons<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.729> clothes<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:25.170> best

share tons of clothes and and be best

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.870 
share tons of clothes and and be best
friends<00:01:25.470> forever<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.159> she<00:01:26.220> would<00:01:26.430> marry<00:01:26.549> Elena

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
friends forever so she would marry Elena

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.700
