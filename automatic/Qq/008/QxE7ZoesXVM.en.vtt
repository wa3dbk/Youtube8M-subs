00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.090
 good we must learn a little bit that they are the justico we can not 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.039
 solve 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.279
 personally I think it is a very good option to kill time 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.619
 As for mathematics, they ask us to reason 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.650
 as I have already told you the mathematics 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.820
 perán parts 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.020
 try to understand them more than doing the operations simply by doing them 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.289
 and we help so much to network 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.019
 working with numbers 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.689
 like 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.910
 think of the best possible solution 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.320
 with respect our own 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.990
 way of thinking 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.470
 Now that is a sudoku 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.790
 a whole then this one 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.790
 what we want from the left side 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.180
 nine boxes 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.390
 down once rows 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.500
 first columns 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.180
 the idea of ​​solving a sudoku expose 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.660
 numbers from 1 to 9 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.370
 but without being repeated 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.300
 in the columns 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.130
 as in the rows as in these 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.560
 house 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.120
 we want here 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.120
 of 9 for evil 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.550
 if I put you a shindo here in three 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.550
 in this same square there can be neither one nor two nor three 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.350
 olea solve it assured 2 3 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.480
 4 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.690
 Yes a little bit 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.050
 efe 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.050
 8 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620
 let's see row 1 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.390
 the shoulder column 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.220
 if I have here 1 4 and 7 in these that I have empty 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.640
 I can not put 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.780
 neither the smoke nor in four days 7 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.370
 and if we see the first row 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.970
 that I have 1 2 and 3 that I can not put for any pines nor three nor one nor two 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.090
 nor three 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 because they would repeat 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.340
 this is the traditional sudoku and the most common fallen 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.590
 a lot more complex than they have more with a few bonuses 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.779
 rows 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:12.269
 but its goal is the same 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.269
 for that says this side requires sudoku 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.799
 it's a little bit easier 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.459
 because it only has four by four four rows and four columns 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.069
 and we can solve it easier 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.399
 then how would you solve 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.759
 as I said the first thing is to try to solve them life 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.789
 of all these four boxes 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:35.919
 the 1 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:36.889
 the three 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:37.869
 and the 4 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:39.969
 what pity easy to solve 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.099
 It would be the 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.829
 for the moment number three 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.430
 because that number 2 3 and 4 then we already know that the cydia 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.149
 quant row 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.769
 column 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.170
 or almost four already what four already has three answers 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.649
 this row we do not already have one the two the three 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:04.089
 then here already 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.099
 the 4 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.059
 row column or box 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.659
 you already have three answers 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.890
 the second row 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.589
 already has two the three and the four 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.589
 then I would go 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.439
 16 times the logic try to see 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.709
 which is the easiest to solve 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.209
 because it is the first column that have one the 2004 then I wanted 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.789
 Number 3 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:38.649
 which now has three 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.649
 here in none of the two options that we have 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.269
 this new direction that we meet we make votes 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.229
 at this price a little cleaner 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.069
 if we see 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.749
 this column has two this row sorry 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.919
 this row nothing more than two 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.569
 this column has two 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.349
 until we found a column that has one gave another column that 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.939
 they have 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.799
 in tolosa solve 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.799
 1 2 and 3 ticket office the number 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.849
 in this hour in this column we have 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.849
 2 4 and 3 here diaz listed 1 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.159
 and then we will collaborate to move confusing 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.650
 so that these two rows 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.650
 they already have 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.319
 three options 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.319
 in that we have 1 2 and 3 here the number 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.560
 and here we have 1 4 and 3 would require the number 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.249
 and now we go up 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.009
 this scare obviously this one is easy 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.490
 is to get acquainted with the Sudoku 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.349
 and now we have to check if in all rows 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.810
 columns and blocks 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.659
 the 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:56.710
 larumbe and 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.680
 that does not have to repeat itself let's see 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.319
 row one we have 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.979
 one two three four 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.789
 palomeada are agreed 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:04.639
 row 2 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.479
 one two three four 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:08.449
 and the 3 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.120
 one two three four 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.999
 to name none has been repeated 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.800
 row 4 one two three four 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.690
 columbarium 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.259
 by the columns 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:18.909
 the first column 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.909
 in the pub one two three four do not repeat 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.839
 a column are not repeated the third column also do not repeat the 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:28.529
 fourth column 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:29.830
 neither are they repeated 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.400
 why today to check 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.430
 by blocks of four 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.520
 these blocks of four 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.330
 the first batch of four are repeated no 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.849
 the second 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.930
 the third one and the fourth 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.240
 this is how it was resolved 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.330
 and that's his thing 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.550
 let's have a little more this sudoku on the big left side 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:59.569
 to see how he called him crying 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.159
 then we can can see the first row 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.050
 we have three 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.189
 4 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.240
 yes indicated 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.389
 CD 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.389
 8 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.470
 popeye if we fight asking 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.589
 we have the first box 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.360
 in the first column 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.150
 the first row forgiveness we can also solve the first column if we have 1 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.419
 4 7 we can put 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.499
 three Ecuadorians protest 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:29.660
 5 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.529
 6 the site is already 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:34.789
 8 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.219
 this is a good way to learn how to do sudokus from scratch 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:40.979
 make your own sudoku 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.550
 as they are provided 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.059
 upta do sudokus 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:46.050
 on the internet can count 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.669
 thousands of options you have the easiest that was like this one that we did here 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.460
 very complete match 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.919
 the subject of how to dress that only remain 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.559
 little options 

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:59.360
 I hope you liked the video you have served 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.629
 already know any questions or comments 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:05.629
 proposal that you have to make a video with pleasure 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.809
 he tried to solve it 

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:08.719
 or we make the video
