00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.230
 Who has helped us write the "sentence"? 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.370
 Everyone passes the note up. 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.370
 Trouble came to the front 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.990
 You are busy, I am responsible for moving the mouth~~ 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.160
 This game is like this....... 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.670
 The audience sitting behind may not understand 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.160
 The front row of people offer us some........... 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.410
 "暧昧" statement 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.250
 Completely from your imagination 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.410
 Jonathan and Ryan will perform a show 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.010
 They will put the "sentence" in their pockets. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.250
 And in this play 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.040
 The two of them will randomly extract the "sentence" 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.990
 And find a way to integrate it into the show. 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.180
 According to the "nonsense" you wrote down! ! 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.180
 ...........if possible! ! ! 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.700
 as usual...... 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.000
 Give me a ........ less common historical age 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Don't be like the Civil War..... 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.030
 (Ice Age.......) Ice Age! ! ! 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.520
 At the same time, I also hope to have some... dramatic performance. 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.250
 Maybe come... 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.770
 Dramatic Ice Age soap opera! ! (Ryan: Really fake??) 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.140
 It is dripping ~~~~ 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.980
 (Wood, you are a whole person, XDDDDD) 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.720
 you are late! Gongga! ! ! 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.020
 (XDDDDDD) 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.400
 I am busy making stones..... 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.510
 The stone is very good, the food is very hot, come and eat. 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.210
 Can you cook food? ? ? 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 Correct................ 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.030
 ... I just suddenly invented "fire" 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.730
 Super simple! ! ! 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.140
 Um... I carved the stone and you used the fire. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.410
 You are not very good at things that are going to be brainstorming. 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.390
 You are not like .... Strong........ Sen (Johnson has forgotten to help himself name XDDD) 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.870
 Yes....... 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.690
 I don’t know much.... 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.820
 People always say when I pass by: 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.850
 "You remind me of........." 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.290
 (Jonathan:??) 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.420
 "Abridged number"! ! ! 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.320
 I didn't listen to them. 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.020
 Because I am eager to get stones every time! ! 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.920
 All I have heard is: 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 "You remind me of..." 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.220
 I should stop for a little longer....... 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.600
 The tribe decided to announce the following to you: 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.770
 "God! ! I am so happy that I am a woman! ! ! 』 (Note 1) 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.940
 You make me want to find a drag king now (Note 2) 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.320
 This is why we have to hide in the back mountain (this sentence does not understand &gt; &lt;) 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.320
 I don't think yeah, after all, I have stones! ! 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.350
 I think every woman is very "ha" my stone 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.950
 (There is no strange meaning here!!) 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.140
 Do you think the stone is even worse than the fire? ? ! ! 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.520
 The woman is quite impressed with me and the boulder 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.820
 I am pretty sure they have said: 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.820
 "Are you getting fat?" ? 』 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.200
 That's right! ! Because you are cooking food now! ! ! 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.640
 I know what your ex-girlfriend said! ! ! 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.010
 (呃嗯.......??) 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.530
 She stood on the edge of the cliff and shouted: 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.020
 "I can't believe my man is a mature woman who eats tender grass!" ! ! 』 (Note 3) 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.780
 (Chirp: Really fake!!!) 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.780
 (Chipp: He really didn't mess...) 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.030
 .......you mean Helen. 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.980
 That's right! ! 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.410
 I haven't seen Helen for a long time.... 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.500
 .......... Helen is frozen! ! 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.790
 (big shock) Is it frozen? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.880
 (Change) She is dead! ! ! 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.310
 Why am I never aware of this? ? 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.820
 You are busy making stones! ! 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.990
 Then why don't you use fire to help her thaw? ? ? 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.150
 Helen doesn't like me, Helen likes you. 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.670
 Helen is now frozen, hahaha. 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.830
 Helen told me... 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.910
 what did you say? ? 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.830
 Helen told me: 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.670
 "Purple monkey is climbing a tree. 』 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.840
 (The audience is thinking about what XDDD is) 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.270
 That is talking about things! ! ! 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.600
 No purple monkey at all 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.760
 There is no big tree 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.930
 I am a big tree~~~~ (my Tian A XDDD) 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.550
 Didn't you see what I carved on this stone? ? 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.260
 on the rocks.... 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.500
 Have you carved something on it? ? (right!!) 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.500
 Look at what I carved..... 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.020
 "I can't believe you are such a boyantal! ! ! 』 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.190
 BOYANTAL? ? what does that mean? ? ? 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.570
 I do not know either! ! 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.570
 Then............. Why are you engraving it? ? ? ! ! ! 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.170
 I....... 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.980
 I think what it must represent... 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.680
 You actually engraved something you didn't know is! ! ! ! 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.010
 Bang, bang..... 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.170
 It is a vol ! ! 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.610
 The volcano is about to explode! ! ! 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.660
 God is angry! ! 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.850
 Hot, sticky things are about to be sprayed out! ! ! 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.510
 remember! ! When God speaks loudly to us in heaven: 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.010
 "Do you want to see the unification of the lions tomorrow? ? ? 』
