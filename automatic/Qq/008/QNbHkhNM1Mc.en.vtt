00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
crayon tends to move the fabric more

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800

than<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> pencil<00:01:40.770> would<00:01:41.180> now<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
than a pencil would now here we have a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.380 
than a pencil would now here we have a
very<00:01:43.740> nice<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.159> machine<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.270> like

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
very nice little machine it's just like

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
very nice little machine it's just like
Ruby<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> think<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.409> I'll<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
Ruby here so I think what I'll do is I

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.609 
Ruby here so I think what I'll do is I
will<00:01:47.189> color<00:01:47.850> her<00:01:48.030> red<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:52.200> course<00:01:52.439> it's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
will color her red and of course it's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.580 
will color her red and of course it's
not<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:52.920> beautiful<00:01:53.399> or<00:01:53.520> red<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:54.950> Ruby<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.070> but

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
not as beautiful or red as Ruby is but

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.640 
not as beautiful or red as Ruby is but
we<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.770> always<00:01:59.009> add<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.219> color<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> it

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.800 

and<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:05.610> we're<00:02:05.790> coloring<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.270> fabric<00:02:06.690> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and because we're coloring on fabric it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.680 
and because we're coloring on fabric it
won't<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.290> will<00:02:07.470> not<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.830> as<00:02:08.009> vibrant<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:09.270> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
won't it will not be as vibrant but the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.540 
won't it will not be as vibrant but the
color<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.350> we<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.710> will<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.009> more<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.400> an

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
color that we get will be more of an

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.920 
color that we get will be more of an
antique<00:02:11.970> ish<00:02:12.150> feel<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:14.660> now<00:02:15.660> I'm<00:02:15.780> also

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
antique ish feel to it now I'm also

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.870 
antique ish feel to it now I'm also
going<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.260> put<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> little<00:02:16.800> bit<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.190> gold<00:02:17.640> I

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
going to put a little bit of gold I

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.330 
going to put a little bit of gold I
think<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.600> there<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.320> find<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.770> nice<00:02:19.950> gold

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
think in there if I can find a nice gold

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.510 
think in there if I can find a nice gold
well<00:02:20.760> here's<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.000> nice<00:02:21.650> here's<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.710> silver<00:02:22.950> we'll

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
well here's a nice here's a silver we'll

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.140 
well here's a nice here's a silver we'll
use<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.880> silver<00:02:24.150> right<00:02:24.450> here<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.940> hand

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
use the silver right here on the hand

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.370 
use the silver right here on the hand
wheel<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.510> think<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.810> need<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:30.990> little<00:02:31.260> bit

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
wheel and I think we need a little bit

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.310 
wheel and I think we need a little bit
of<00:02:31.500> black<00:02:32.420> for<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.630> belt

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
of black for the belt

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.630 
of black for the belt
and<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.500> don't<00:02:34.680> have<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.070> go<00:02:35.220> right<00:02:35.610> with

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
and you don't have to go right with

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.120 
and you don't have to go right with
whatever<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:37.500> actual<00:02:37.770> machine

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
whatever it is that the actual machine

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.430 
whatever it is that the actual machine
is<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:41.209> then<00:02:42.209> we<00:02:42.330> can<00:02:42.360> start<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.990> quilt<00:02:43.230> if

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
is and then we can start on the quilt if

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.620 
is and then we can start on the quilt if
we<00:02:43.590> wanted<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.610> do<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> little<00:02:45.060> bit<00:02:45.450> of

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
we wanted to and just do a little bit of

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.010 
we wanted to and just do a little bit of
coloring<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.530> quilt<00:02:46.890> maybe<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.750> design<00:02:48.750> of

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
coloring in that quilt maybe a design of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.930 
coloring in that quilt maybe a design of
colors<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.830> I'm<00:02:50.100> gonna<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.760> whole

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
colors that I'm gonna do just a whole

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.260 
colors that I'm gonna do just a whole
bunch<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.180> different<00:02:51.300> color<00:02:51.630> blues<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.260> think

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
bunch of different color blues I think

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.850 
bunch of different color blues I think
just<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.360> give<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.660> an<00:02:54.780> idea<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.440> how<00:02:55.680> they

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
just to give you an idea of how they

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.970 
just to give you an idea of how they
each<00:02:56.040> come<00:02:56.310> across<00:02:56.640> differently<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:58.230> this

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
each come across differently on this

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.350 
each come across differently on this
quilt<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.890> don't<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.400> very<00:03:02.790> very

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
quilt and you don't have to be very very

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.270 
quilt and you don't have to be very very
neat<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.900> tidy<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.410> don't<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:04.980> stay<00:03:05.160> in

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
neat and tidy you don't have to stay in

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.070 
neat and tidy you don't have to stay in
the<00:03:05.400> lines<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:12.269> don't<00:03:12.420> even<00:03:12.570> have<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.870> color

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
the lines you don't even have to color

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.790 
the lines you don't even have to color
in<00:03:13.320> every<00:03:13.680> square<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.250> don't<00:03:14.430> want<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:15.800> you

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
in every square if you don't want to you

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.160 
in every square if you don't want to you
can<00:03:16.920> go<00:03:17.040> back<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.580> can<00:03:17.760> maybe<00:03:18.170> duplicate

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
can go back and you can maybe duplicate

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.860 
can go back and you can maybe duplicate
in<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.350> couple<00:03:19.650> areas<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:26.180> think<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.420> want<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.660> try

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
in a couple areas I think I want to try

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.720 
in a couple areas I think I want to try
a<00:03:27.900> different<00:03:28.470> blue<00:03:28.709> now<00:03:28.890> because<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.310> don't

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
a different blue now because I don't

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.830 
a different blue now because I don't
know<00:03:29.910> which<00:03:30.510> one<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.870> around<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.880> there<00:03:33.090> now

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
know which one is around it so there now

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.410 
know which one is around it so there now
if<00:03:34.440> we<00:03:34.650> want<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.920> do<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.130> flowers<00:03:35.580> I'm<00:03:36.209> just

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
can do this with quilts as well where

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.220 
can do this with quilts as well where
you<00:03:47.070> can<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.489> take<00:03:47.670> fabric<00:03:47.940> iron<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.810> piece<00:03:49.019> of

didn't come off on the wax paper but

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.670 
didn't come off on the wax paper but
what<00:05:08.460> it<00:05:08.580> did<00:05:08.760> was<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.570> made<00:05:10.050> it<00:05:10.200> so<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.410> way

what it did was it made it so that way

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.640 
what it did was it made it so that way
it<00:05:10.890> would<00:05:11.010> become<00:05:11.280> part<00:05:11.580> of<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.850> fabric<00:05:12.290> so<00:05:13.290> if

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
it would become part of the fabric so if

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.110 
it would become part of the fabric so if
you<00:05:13.830> want<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.220> do<00:05:14.340> something<00:05:14.729> fun<00:05:14.940> and
