00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.260 

five<00:01:13.450> feet<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:15.100> five<00:01:15.520> feet<00:01:15.730> from<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:16.090> green

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
five feet I'm five feet from the green

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.520 
five feet I'm five feet from the green
screen<00:01:16.480> and<00:01:16.600> as<00:01:16.840> you've<00:01:16.990> seen<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.380> works

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
screen and as you've seen it works

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.130 
screen and as you've seen it works
pretty<00:01:17.740> well<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.360> camera<00:01:19.690> is<00:01:19.720> probably

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
pretty well so the camera is probably

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.520 
pretty well so the camera is probably
seven<00:01:21.010> feet<00:01:21.190> away<00:01:21.310> at<00:01:21.550> this<00:01:21.700> point<00:01:22.050> if<00:01:23.050> you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
seven feet away at this point if you

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.070 
seven feet away at this point if you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
can't find this material another thing

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.290 
can't find this material another thing
that<00:01:26.110> works<00:01:26.380> real<00:01:26.620> well<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.760> inexpensive

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
that works real well is this inexpensive

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.080 
that works real well is this inexpensive
plastic<00:01:28.810> tablecloth<00:01:29.770> sheeting<00:01:30.250> now<00:01:30.760> this<00:01:30.910> is

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
plastic tablecloth sheeting now this is

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.390 
plastic tablecloth sheeting now this is
a<00:01:31.120> roll<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.230> it's<00:01:32.470> it's<00:01:32.830> not<00:01:33.040> quite

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
a roll of it and it's it's not quite

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.220 
a roll of it and it's it's not quite
four<00:01:33.730> feet<00:01:33.940> i<00:01:34.030> think<00:01:34.210> it's<00:01:34.300> 40<00:01:34.720> inches<00:01:34.990> one<00:01:35.200> way

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
four feet i think it's 40 inches one way

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.610 
four feet i think it's 40 inches one way
and<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:37.060> role<00:01:37.330> was<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.630> hundred<00:01:38.230> feet<00:01:38.409> when<00:01:38.590> i

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
and this role was a hundred feet when i

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.740 
and this role was a hundred feet when i
bought<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.400> it<00:01:39.820> was<00:01:39.880> twenty<00:01:40.210> dollars<00:01:40.540> and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
bought it and it was twenty dollars and

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.600 
bought it and it was twenty dollars and
again<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.500> can<00:01:41.530> find<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:41.980> at<00:01:42.100> party<00:01:42.370> stores

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
again you can find it at party stores

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.270 
again you can find it at party stores
and<00:01:42.820> places<00:01:42.880> like<00:01:43.150> that<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.800> little<00:01:45.070> thin

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
and places like that it's a little thin

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.870 
and places like that it's a little thin
so<00:01:46.150> you<00:01:46.210> sometimes<00:01:46.870> have<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.080> double<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.880> but

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
so you sometimes have to double it but

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.190 
so you sometimes have to double it but
it's<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.150> cheap<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.570> nice<00:01:49.720> thing<00:01:49.930> is<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.080> can

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
it's so cheap the nice thing is you can

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.070 
it's so cheap the nice thing is you can
just<00:01:50.590> put<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.430> up<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.790> when<00:01:52.780> you're<00:01:52.810> done<00:01:53.020> just

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080
