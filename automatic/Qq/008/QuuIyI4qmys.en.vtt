00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.730
 capcom has for the debut in the world 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.650
 of the high definition of his series 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.090
 blockbuster has chosen to play 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.070
 on the safe side proposes in a version 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.449
 revised and corrected of chapter 3 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.980
 so for an episode completely 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.660
 new in high definition 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.790
 unfortunately we will have to wait a little longer 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.800
 never mind because monster hunter 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.180
 3 last hits is definitely the experience 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.980
 definitive for fans of this one 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.960
 particular saga 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.340
 we will spend too many words in the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.470
 describe the mechanics of a title 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.790
 already released years ago in more versions but 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.620
 for those who did not know this 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.150
 particular capcom series we could 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.739
 try to paint it as a game of 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.879
 role in which to play the role of a 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.440
 hunter 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.360
 your goal will be to explore 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.280
 pristine territories populated by 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.470
 bizarre creatures a little prehistoric and 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.690
 a little fantasy for the purpose of killing them 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.610
 and thus collect non- trophy resources 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.229
 there are levels or classes but everything is 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.630
 based on equipment and creation 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.310
 or strengthening of the same to be able to 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.869
 access to new armor and weapons will be 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.789
 need to have sufficient money 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.649
 or better yet find during the 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.600
 your wander around the useful materials from 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.560
 give to the locksmith from this 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.780
 apparently game plant 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.340
 simple will suffice inter put together 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.470
 a videogame experience for some 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.940
 verse only fascinating that if you 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.920
 catch doesn't let you go anymore 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.360
 strong in a content proposal 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.830
 exterminated 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.300
 the main novelty of wii u is 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.860
 clearly the game pad he has 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.479
 provided the first renewal cue for 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.940
 the ultimate version of this monster 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.890
 hunter thanks to a feature anyway 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.270
 it is in fact possible to transfer 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.280
 all the crowded interface on 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.990
 small monitor that you will hold in your hands 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.789
 completely freeing the screen but 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.560
 not only is this renewed interface 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.910
 fully editable allowing for 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.539
 move the different windows a 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.399
 will 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.319
 a detail that some may 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.789
 appearing with marginal means instead 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.739
 for a title like this an important one 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.450
 evolutionary step for a series that begins 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.760
 to look shyly towards the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.470
 modernity moster hunter is indeed a 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.849
 stubborn product still linked different 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.500
 stylistic features of a way of conceiving the 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.540
 video game that belongs to an era 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.220
 passed many enthusiasts could 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.959
 confirm how this is one of his 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.580
 big strong points but at the same time 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.930
 is one of the features that it 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.230
 make a product still undigested a 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.340
 part of the western public 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.260
 wander around solo the search for 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.819
 mythical creatures to hunt is just the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.520
 tip of the iceberg of a title that gives 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.510
 the best of himself played in the company 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.250
 visiting the servers is indeed possible 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.349
 at any time choose one of the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.970
 hundreds of missions available 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.890
 find three fellow hunters and leave 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.750
 for epic adventures a feature 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.310
 intriguing of moster hunter 3 latest hits 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.020
 in addition to the new quests and is the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.360
 possibility to participate through the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.459
 3ds version to local matches managed by 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.110
 a single console wii u also own 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.760
 the small of nintendo with the copy of 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.100
 dedicated game guarantees the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.690
 saving sharing 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.580
 so you can continue your own 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.260
 adventure even away from home for 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.760
 more details of the version between 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.280
 we invite you to read the version 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.380
 textual of this monster review 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.000
 hunter 3 last does not differ in the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.100
 substance compared to the original for wii 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.840
 but fortunately capcom thought of 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.310
 thicken the offer with new monsters 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.010
 some adjustments to the bosses and from the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.720
 balancing additional items and giving 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.280
 the result is certainly the chapter 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.080
 most complete of the series 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.790
 while free dlc that will come 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.170
 released in the future will enrich 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.300
 further the title for one 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.770
 scary longevity if the front 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.220
 playability lends itself to a few 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.810
 critical 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.340
 except the lack of a true e 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.600
 own novelty in the structure the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.180
 technical sector suffers heavily 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.950
 the origin of the monster hunter title 3 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.720
 ultimate is the version 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.910
 hd of the namesake released on wii as many as three 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.490
 years ago with a few touches is a successful 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.780
 upscaling to 1080p development perhaps a 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.580
 hasty bit did not allow one 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.200
 finishing with some occasional shots 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.670
 which we hope will be filed with the 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.350
 patch is expected next month 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.540
 this should also integrate servers 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.070
 Europeans with American ones and insert 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.900
 the always welcome feature from the remote 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.520
 play or the possibility of continuing 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.780
 to play on the wii impact screen 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.780
 u turning off the TV 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.810
 monster hunter 3 last is not a title 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.670
 which amazes but does its duty more than 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.380
 admirably it is the revised version e 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.270
 correct of the wii chapter with a tide 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.590
 of support additions 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.570
 to the father's screen definitely 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.490
 welcome is well done and a multiplayer 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.380
 vast that allows you to cancel the 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.360
 social life of enthusiasts 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.950
 the definitive chapter of the ideal saga 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.450
 even for those who try their hand at the first one 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.550
 time with this particular series 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.470
 the only contraindications are a 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.510
 same provenance of the game if you have 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.980
 already devoured monster hunter tri could 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.280
 not worth recovering this 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.280
 new episode
