 Ato 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:36.230
 The remaining cards are 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:36.230
 The passage if put Do raw because not even Nomashi have a name kill real 300,000 but we need 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.240
 It is nice to have cut the mountain now 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.550
 Card-8 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.680
 Review 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.260

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:59.360
 The first turn of the cutter his press his bow Jean length 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.360
 Let's go as a jaunter 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.670
 N buzz heater Gaa 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.950
 Superball 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.440
 You can't show him the other party 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.300
 I'm waiting 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:18.620
 First of all their guard 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.479
 Damage +30 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.330
 So if you do the question and answer qualification 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.880
 You can get it done with 40 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.880
 I think do not know because the more there is no 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.760
 It is not wrong 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.990
 The background is doing 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.689
 Do 30 guys 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.689
 So this is a good time 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.920
 Was 40 and got 40 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:01.640
 The head must be in the middle opposition but it is not this time 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.090
 Learn with your head 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.440
 Mix up your next card 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.420
 It Vaulx-en-mosquito Lupi et al card Once 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.420

 My house will also plant the amount of wind 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:48.430
 From among those that seem to be a name, it is shown to the other party from your choice, and it is added to your hand. 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.730
 The remaining 9 cards are also for labor and management 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.909
 Take the deck 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.909
 Hmm 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.590
 So the bolt loss is not a draw but a tea ceremony 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.010
 I will try to the next place 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.510

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:19.330
 Thick opponent is 40 and 20 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.850

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.739
 If your own life is a bill from your parents , that division 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:50.569
 In a hurry because I wanted to show to the one to choose the other party today 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:54.760
 But I gave it a bolt loss because I did it earlier 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.760
 And look + 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.860

 Dither Starbolt is dead 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.950
 If I put on my side dies opponent 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:27.150
 If you have 3 pieces on the side first 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.150
 It will win 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:42.150
 I thought Sekishita like it courted once 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.150
 Become a partner if you use the technique 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.990
 Opponent's turn 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.360
 That was 110 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.639
 It became 100 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.330
 This time, it is small 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.330
 Rush 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.070

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.070

 3:00 Sign inner city to the next next became a pond book 50 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:22.340
 Because the patent is also so 40 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:24.699
 But the habit Pokemo from the fact that I drew a card for a minute and I was fine 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.699
 Gepp 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.710

 The Lord is familiar with it 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.470
 Since the guy dog was 60 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.670
 The other party is dead and can be put on the side 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.670
 In one more shoe 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.670
