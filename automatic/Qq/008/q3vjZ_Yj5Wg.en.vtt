you see that I'll just chop it all the
way<00:02:30.700> inside<00:02:31.240> like<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:33.250> close<00:02:33.610> it

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
way inside like that and then close it

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.700 
way inside like that and then close it
even<00:02:34.390> if<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.630> close<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.080> like<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.440> it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
even if you close it like that it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.100 
even if you close it like that it
doesn't<00:02:35.950> look<00:02:36.190> very<00:02:36.250> bulky<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:37.300> still<00:02:37.900> looks

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
doesn't look very bulky it still looks

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.370 
doesn't look very bulky it still looks
fired<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.250> think<00:02:39.540> that's<00:02:40.540> one<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.170> best

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
fired so I think that's one of the best

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.460 
fired so I think that's one of the best
things<00:02:41.830> about<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.310> wallet<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:43.600> don't<00:02:44.290> for

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
things about this wallet I don't for

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.650

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
sure and those people who have the other

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.660 
sure and those people who have the other
big<00:02:47.020> wallets<00:02:47.440> from<00:02:47.650> Louie<00:02:47.860> Vuitton<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.580> know

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
big wallets from Louie Vuitton I know

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.840 
big wallets from Louie Vuitton I know
that<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.090> price<00:02:49.360> range<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.890> from<00:02:51.100> 600<00:02:51.820> to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
that the price range is from 600 to

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.230 
that the price range is from 600 to
maybe<00:02:52.330> 700<00:02:53.110> or<00:02:53.230> 800<00:02:53.770> dollars<00:02:54.100> but<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:54.970> one<00:02:55.210> I

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
maybe 700 or 800 dollars but this one I

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.660 
maybe 700 or 800 dollars but this one I
think<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.990> cheapest<00:02:56.530> wallet<00:02:56.980> big<00:02:57.250> wallet

that they have I'm not really sure why

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.120 
that they have I'm not really sure why
maybe<00:03:00.940> because<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.630> material<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.860> maybe

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
maybe because of the material and maybe

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.450 
maybe because of the material and maybe
because<00:03:03.490> it's<00:03:03.670> not<00:03:03.940> very<00:03:04.560> sturdy<00:03:05.560> just<00:03:06.340> like
