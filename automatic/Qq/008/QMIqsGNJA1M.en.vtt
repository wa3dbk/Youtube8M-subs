00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
difficult to build up an atmosphere the

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.020 
difficult to build up an atmosphere the
way<00:00:09.150> there<00:00:09.300> was<00:00:09.360> just<00:00:10.050> awful<00:00:10.260> again<00:00:10.650> but<00:00:11.400> full

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
way there was just awful again but full

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
credit to Coventry who I actually think

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.189 
credit to Coventry who I actually think
had<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> really<00:00:14.969> good<00:00:15.210> game<00:00:15.389> now<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:15.780> changed

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
had a really good game now it's changed

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.930 
had a really good game now it's changed
some<00:00:16.320> guys<00:00:16.470> after<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> match<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.430> didn't

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
some guys after the match and I didn't

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.640 
some guys after the match and I didn't
think<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.210> had<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> particularly<00:00:19.020> good<00:00:19.170> game<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
think I had a particularly good game and

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.349 
think I had a particularly good game and
I<00:00:19.710> say<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:19.949> because<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:21.000> didn't

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
I say that because we just didn't

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
I say that because we just didn't
control<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> midfield<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.350> hurt<00:00:22.470> or<00:00:22.710> wasn't

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
control the midfield and hurt or wasn't

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.620 
control the midfield and hurt or wasn't
really<00:00:23.130> impacting<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.000> he<00:00:24.449> wasn't

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
really impacting on that he wasn't

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.880 
really impacting on that he wasn't
getting<00:00:24.810> involved<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.350> play<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.590> much<00:00:25.769> as

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
getting involved in the play as much as

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.170 
getting involved in the play as much as
you<00:00:25.949> should<00:00:26.130> do<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.490> that's<00:00:26.699> not<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.000> say<00:00:27.150> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
you should do but that's not to say that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.460 
you should do but that's not to say that
other<00:00:27.420> missed<00:00:27.660> field<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.930> also<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.320> doing

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
other missed field is also out doing

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.960 
other missed field is also out doing
their<00:00:28.590> job<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> second<00:00:29.550> half<00:00:29.699> for

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
their job I think in the second half for

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.999 
their job I think in the second half for
the<00:00:30.029> first<00:00:30.269> I've<00:00:30.810> know<00:00:31.019> 25<00:00:31.410> 30<00:00:31.650> minutes<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the first I've know 25 30 minutes that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.040 
the first I've know 25 30 minutes that
same<00:00:32.219> half<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.579> honestly<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
same half I honestly think that the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.389 
same half I honestly think that the
Coventry<00:00:34.530> were<00:00:34.620> bordering<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> better

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
Coventry were bordering on the better

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.060 
Coventry were bordering on the better
team<00:00:35.700> coventry<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> Ligue<00:00:36.510> 1<00:00:36.540> now<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.829> could

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
team coventry of Ligue 1 now you could

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
team coventry of Ligue 1 now you could
swing<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.489> argument<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> other<00:00:39.090> way<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.329> say

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
swing the argument the other way and say

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.270 
swing the argument the other way and say
well<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:39.899> were<00:00:39.989> tuning<00:00:40.320> up<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.680> didn't<00:00:40.890> need<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
well we were tuning up we didn't need to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.220 
well we were tuning up we didn't need to
push<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.910> win<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> actually<00:00:42.989> shows<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
push on for a win and actually shows a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.170 
push on for a win and actually shows a
bit<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.500> tech<00:00:43.680> tactical<00:00:44.309> mouse<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.820> an

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
bit of tech tactical mouse and an

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.119 
bit of tech tactical mouse and an
improvement<00:00:45.539> from<00:00:45.930> let's<00:00:46.800> say<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.100> example

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
improvement from let's say for example

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.490 
improvement from let's say for example
backbone<00:00:47.969> last<00:00:48.210> season<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.410> really

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
backbone last season so it was really

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
backbone last season so it was really
interesting<00:00:49.800> game<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.030> atmosphere<00:00:51.149> was

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
interesting game and the atmosphere was

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.650 
interesting game and the atmosphere was
okay<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.559> we're<00:00:53.340> always<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> win<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.210> few

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
okay but we're always going to win a few

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.299 
okay but we're always going to win a few
points<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.289> point<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.620> before<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.070> start

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
option know it near as good as Chamakh

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.170 
option know it near as good as Chamakh
in<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.350> opinion<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.159> was<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> neat<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:32.850> side

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
in my opinion that was a neat one side

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.090 
in my opinion that was a neat one side
if<00:01:33.360> he<00:01:33.390> finds<00:01:33.780> his<00:01:34.020> level<00:01:34.380> against<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> league

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
if he finds his level against the league

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
if he finds his level against the league
one<00:01:35.280> side<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.790> can't<00:01:36.030> find<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.420> level

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
one side will can't find this level

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.840 
one side will can't find this level
that's<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.680> good<00:01:37.829> enough<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.159> Arsenal<00:01:38.520> so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that's not good enough for Arsenal so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.160 
that's not good enough for Arsenal so
