00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello everyone with you gift and today I 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.519
 I'll tell you again how to solve the problem with 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.429
 sony vegas pro 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.370
 to be exact what to do if sony 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.710
 vegas pro does not accept avi file 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.449
 I have already made a video on this topic but since 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 there were so many questions about comments 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.590
 that is, more than two hundred and 65 comments 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.689
 about 50 percent of them are questions 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.570
 or just calling from people 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.940
 which did not work out in general 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.380
 I rewrite the movie if there is something right there 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.440
 was annotations if you do not work 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.899
 cancel then download codecs in general i'm still 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.649
 time I will explain everything I will explain in better 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.879
 I will explain more precisely what to do 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.920
 how to do and why do we get started 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.140
 First of all, let's analyze the method that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.199
 I understood this in this 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.879
 video in general, I talked about 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.260
 that you just need to replace one file in the root 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.989
 sony vegas pro folders 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.850
 which you have set in common that we are 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.860
 must do we must go by 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.860
 download links given here 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.900
 here here in the description I will again give in 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.979
 description for this video and download 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 save us file appeared avi flag dnr 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.270
 he was me but I downloaded for your sake 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.950
 since now we have to go to the root 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.920
 folder with sony vegas pro 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.820
 as a rule that is, up to default this 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.090
 disk c program files 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.810
 sony and daddy with your vegas 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.340
 you are using 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.240
 I use 13.0 after that I need to find 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.610
 file folder 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.439
 and plug-ins here find the avi blessing folder and 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.829
 we will have this picture here 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.320
 there will be only one avi file for now 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.159
 must do with it we have to push 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.650
 rename button write avi pla 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.150
 wake up 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.090
 basically you can call it as 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.450
 want the main thing that the name was different 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.030
 both posters eg a weblog 1.avi boards 12 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.580
 overclock run just well not really matter 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.920
 the main thing that you had ave poster 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.750
 the standard that you had yourself 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.030
 start as you installed sony vegas 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.190
 because if you have something not 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.580
 you can always return 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.990
 old file before or after that here 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.570
 This is the file and throw here here with us 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.270
 should be and I just called us 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.090
 will not just otmazyvatsya one and 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.780
 just vipok esin now he's replaced 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.820
 try more and more we do nothing 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.840
 and after that we go to sony vegas 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.840
 there we must earn everything of course 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.880
 as elsewhere, this option does not work in 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.450
 everyone on the computer is not all sony vegas 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.590
 hence I will analyze another option 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.070
 for that for this option us 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.070
 need to install codecs that we 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:10.070
 need we need to go to google go to 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.870
 google search engine itself and write k-lite 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.160
 codec pack 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.459
 after that we have to come again 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.930
 links codes guide and choose any of 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.660
 versions that you want can be taken 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.390
 newer it does not matter after that swing 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:33.390
 download basic after this world of mouth 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.940
 here we choose a house lot and swing 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.320
 I have already downloaded it after that 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.130
 go download well or at the very least 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.200
 as far as you swing him and find this to 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.060
 lite codec pack 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:53.959
 it will be exe format here it is after this 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.959
 he should run it before 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:02.439
 next pure for quick update 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.909
 that is, we need to update our codecs at 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.750
 my wife now may not even be updated 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.709
 because I have already installed everything and 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.769
 he will start to install 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:17.600
 it happens the codec is installed on 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.169
 pretty quickly pressing the finish button 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.449
 and restart the computer after that at 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.419
 you have installed new codecs and should 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:30.530
 all work even if it is not 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.660
 It helps you with this in the issuance of this 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.570
 Error sony Vegas you have in the box 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.880
 see which error number and 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.240
 google ivan google and you will open 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.780
 sony support sony technical support 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.930
 and here you can ask your question or 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.840
 look at the solution to this question if 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.280
 did this even help me can 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.130
 advise you either upgrade windows 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.020
 either buy a new iron or just 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.979
 use other programs for 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.320
 video editing 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.110
 this may be kamtazia studio need 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.940
