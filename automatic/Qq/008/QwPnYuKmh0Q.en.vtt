00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
where we can see how our level of play

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.310 
where we can see how our level of play
is<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.460> now<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.539> better<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.019> do

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
is as of now and what better way to do

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.960 
is as of now and what better way to do
that<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.739> against<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> reigning<00:01:05.580> NBA

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
