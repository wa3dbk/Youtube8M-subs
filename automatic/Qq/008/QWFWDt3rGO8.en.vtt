311 it there's a couple reasons one

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.780 
311 it there's a couple reasons one
because<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.650> hardcore<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.369> play<00:01:32.610> you're

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
because in hardcore like I play you're

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.400 
because in hardcore like I play you're
gonna<00:01:32.910> kill<00:01:33.210> people<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.690> friendly<00:01:34.050> if<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
gonna kill people and friendly if you

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.600 
gonna kill people and friendly if you
put<00:01:34.590> mines<00:01:34.860> randomly<00:01:35.310> around<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
put mines randomly around the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
put mines randomly around the
battlefield<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.360> want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.690> keep<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:36.930> close

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
battlefield so I want to keep them close

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.219 
battlefield so I want to keep them close
as<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.310> their<00:01:39.030> deployment<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
as I can to their deployment and of

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.320 
as I can to their deployment and of
course<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.250> second<00:01:41.610> reason<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:42.000> once<00:01:42.180> your

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
course the second reason is once your

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.600 
course the second reason is once your
captain<00:01:42.750> space<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.590> gonna<00:01:43.710> put<00:01:44.009> pressure<00:01:44.040> on

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
captain space it's gonna put pressure on

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.880 
captain space it's gonna put pressure on
the<00:01:44.850> backend<00:01:45.060> meaning<00:01:45.660> when<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> other<00:01:46.710> team

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the backend meaning when the other team

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
the backend meaning when the other team
spawns<00:01:47.280> they're<00:01:47.700> more<00:01:48.330> likely<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.750> hop<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.140> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
spawns they're more likely to hop in a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.660 
spawns they're more likely to hop in a
tank<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.679> vehicle<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> something<00:01:50.369> else<00:01:50.490> and

know seeing in this instance here sure
enough<00:01:55.020> some<00:01:55.259> DEET<00:01:55.440> Hopsin<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.460> go

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
enough some DEET Hopsin and then you go

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.130 
enough some DEET Hopsin and then you go
obviously<00:01:57.240> you've<00:01:57.420> got<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> base

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
obviously you've got to take the base

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.419 
obviously you've got to take the base
once<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.470> take<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> base<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.190> going<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
once you take the base that's going to

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.600 
once you take the base that's going to
put<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.759> pressure<00:01:59.970> on<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:01.800> happens<00:02:02.429> all<00:02:02.580> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
put that pressure on it happens all the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.040 
put that pressure on it happens all the
time<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.479> know<00:02:03.600> I've<00:02:03.810> made<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
time as you can see you know I've made a

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.010 
time as you can see you know I've made a
mess<00:02:04.410> as<00:02:05.039> you<00:02:05.220> can<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:06.360> complete

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
mess as you can see you know complete

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.150 
mess as you can see you know complete
mess<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.530> breaks<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:08.009> how<00:02:08.069> I'm

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
mess here it breaks you see how I'm

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.260 
mess here it breaks you see how I'm
putting<00:02:08.280> them<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.490> an<00:02:08.580> angle<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> whole

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
putting them on an angle that the whole

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.120 
putting them on an angle that the whole
reason<00:02:09.450> there's<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:10.619> goes<00:02:10.740> further<00:02:10.920> up

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
reason there's is as it goes further up

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.200 
reason there's is as it goes further up
that<00:02:11.280> road<00:02:11.490> they're<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> cut<00:02:11.970> out<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
that road they're going to cut out the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.309 
that road they're going to cut out the
angle<00:02:12.540> when<00:02:12.630> they're<00:02:12.750> coming<00:02:12.960> in<00:02:13.020> from<00:02:13.140> their

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
angle when they're coming in from their

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.570 
angle when they're coming in from their
deployment<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> got<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.160> think<00:02:14.340> smart

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
deployment so you got to think smart

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.620 
deployment so you got to think smart
about<00:02:14.760> where<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:14.970> place<00:02:15.090> them<00:02:15.360> as<00:02:15.450> well

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
about where you place them as well

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.630 
about where you place them as well
obviously<00:02:16.260> using<00:02:16.800> shadows<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.280> stuff<00:02:17.490> we

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
obviously using shadows and stuff we

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880 
obviously using shadows and stuff we
talked<00:02:17.850> about<00:02:18.060> earlier<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> earlier

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.080 

shadows<00:02:25.709> Rumble<00:02:26.040> debris<00:02:26.340> craters<00:02:26.850> we've

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
shadows Rumble debris craters we've

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.670 
shadows Rumble debris craters we've
already<00:02:27.270> dealt<00:02:27.540> with<00:02:27.630> all<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.110> obviously

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
already dealt with all that obviously

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.410 
already dealt with all that obviously
here<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.069> working<00:02:29.220> well<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.760> think<00:02:30.209> like<00:02:30.330> I

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
here it's working well I think like I

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.640 
here it's working well I think like I
said<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.690> main<00:02:30.840> thing<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.170> there's<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.440> very

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
said the main thing is there's a very

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.870 
said the main thing is there's a very
little<00:02:31.800> chance<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.250> these<00:02:32.370> roads<00:02:32.640> that

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
little chance on these roads that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.030 
little chance on these roads that
friendly<00:02:33.810> forces<00:02:34.230> are<00:02:34.350> gonna<00:02:34.470> be<00:02:34.590> coming<00:02:34.860> down

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
friendly forces are gonna be coming down

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.120 
friendly forces are gonna be coming down
and<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:36.090> course<00:02:36.300> friendly<00:02:36.660> forces<00:02:36.959> is<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.560> huge

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
and of course friendly forces is a huge

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.430 
and of course friendly forces is a huge
issue<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:39.330> know<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> was<00:02:39.810> kind<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.110> trolling

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
issue you know I was kind of trolling

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
here you know hoping maybe I'd get some

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.740 
here you know hoping maybe I'd get some
well<00:02:45.220> as<00:02:45.460> you<00:02:45.640> could<00:02:45.760> see<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.300> didn't<00:02:46.720> quite

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
well as you could see it didn't quite

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.780 
well as you could see it didn't quite
quick<00:02:47.260> cutters<00:02:47.560> plan<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.160> know<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.490> don't

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
quick cutters plan so you know I don't

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.949 
quick cutters plan so you know I don't
know<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.030> doesn't<00:02:49.300> work<00:02:49.390> too<00:02:49.510> well<00:02:49.540> maybe<00:02:49.810> if

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
know it doesn't work too well maybe if

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.300 
know it doesn't work too well maybe if
people<00:02:50.230> get<00:02:50.319> more<00:02:50.500> used<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.740> seeing<00:02:50.920> but<00:02:51.040> even

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
people get more used to seeing but even

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.740 
people get more used to seeing but even
someone<00:02:51.580> might<00:02:51.670> think<00:02:51.700> it's<00:02:51.940> c4<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.480> go<00:02:52.600> buy

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
someone might think it's c4 and go buy

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.910 
someone might think it's c4 and go buy
it<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:54.130> know<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:55.000> other<00:02:55.150> problem<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.540> people

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
it you know the other problem is people

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.040 
it you know the other problem is people
this<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.340> where<00:02:57.430> everyone<00:02:57.640> tank<00:02:57.940> drivers<00:02:58.300> and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
this is where everyone tank drivers and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.570 
this is where everyone tank drivers and
then<00:02:59.170> anyone's<00:02:59.590> going<00:02:59.770> near<00:02:59.920> them<00:03:00.040> as<00:03:00.370> you

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
then anyone's going near them as you

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.740 
then anyone's going near them as you
know<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.000> fire<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.300> guy<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:01.600> from

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
know it's like a fire this guy is from

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.870 
know it's like a fire this guy is from
it<00:03:01.900> does<00:03:02.230> not<00:03:02.500> matter<00:03:02.800> how<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.070> survived<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.850> I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
it does not matter how I survived that I

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.540 
it does not matter how I survived that I
don't<00:03:04.120> fucking<00:03:04.420> know<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.280> course<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
don't fucking know but and of course the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.479 
don't fucking know but and of course the
next<00:03:06.730> thing<00:03:06.790> we<00:03:06.910> want<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.120> look<00:03:07.209> at<00:03:07.480> is

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
next thing we want to look at is

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.100 
next thing we want to look at is
locations<00:03:09.489> again<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.239> said<00:03:10.300> let's<00:03:10.930> take

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
locations again like I said let's take

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.070 
locations again like I said let's take
an<00:03:11.260> example<00:03:11.380> this<00:03:11.800> 64-player<00:03:12.459> map<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
an example this 64-player map and the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.479 
an example this 64-player map and the
different<00:03:14.410> paces<00:03:14.800> where<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.190> get<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.400> little

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
different paces where I get the little

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.250 
different paces where I get the little
circles<00:03:15.970> is<00:03:16.090> where<00:03:16.270> I'd<00:03:16.480> be<00:03:16.690> put<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:17.020> them<00:03:17.140> I

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
circles is where I'd be put in them I

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.810 
circles is where I'd be put in them I
wouldn't<00:03:17.560> again<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.190> get<00:03:18.340> if<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:18.610> especially

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
wouldn't again you get if you especially

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.100 
wouldn't again you get if you especially
on<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.060> hardcore<00:03:19.360> core<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.660> guess<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.989> doesn't

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
on the hardcore core I guess it doesn't

the<00:04:56.080> block<00:04:56.170> p.m.<00:04:56.590> two<00:04:56.830> slams<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.580> call<00:04:57.880> them

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
the block p.m. two slams I call them

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.030 
the block p.m. two slams I call them
claymores<00:04:58.510> four<00:04:58.750> tones<00:04:59.050> well<00:04:59.740> they're<00:04:59.860> kind

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
claymores four tones well they're kind

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.910 
claymores four tones well they're kind
of<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.160> cross<00:05:00.370> between<00:05:00.520> c4<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.450> claymores<00:05:01.990> one

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
of a cross between c4 and claymores one

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.170 
of a cross between c4 and claymores one
of<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.040> great<00:05:03.190> things<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.550> think<00:05:03.580> about<00:05:04.030> them

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
of the great things I think about them

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.420 
of the great things I think about them
is<00:05:04.300> is<00:05:04.540> because<00:05:05.410> they're<00:05:05.560> motion<00:05:05.980> sensitive

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
is is because they're motion sensitive

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.760 
is is because they're motion sensitive
of<00:05:06.580> common<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.690> know<00:05:07.810> they're<00:05:08.440> not<00:05:08.560> going<00:05:08.710> to

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
of common you know they're not going to

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.170 
of common you know they're not going to
blow<00:05:08.950> until<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.310> tank<00:05:09.580> drives<00:05:09.820> away<00:05:09.970> or

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
blow until the tank drives away or

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.970 
blow until the tank drives away or
anything<00:05:10.300> like<00:05:10.480> that<00:05:10.540> but<00:05:11.260> if<00:05:11.440> you<00:05:11.560> get<00:05:11.740> shot

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
anything like that but if you get shot

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.190 
anything like that but if you get shot
by<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.160> gunner<00:05:12.520> or<00:05:12.670> if<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.270> get<00:05:13.450> shot<00:05:13.720> by<00:05:13.960> some

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
by the gunner or if you get shot by some

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.260 
by the gunner or if you get shot by some
other<00:05:14.350> ground<00:05:14.650> through<00:05:14.890> much<00:05:15.760> like<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.000> mine

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
other ground through much like a mine

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.550 
other ground through much like a mine
it's<00:05:16.480> gonna<00:05:16.630> stay<00:05:16.870> there<00:05:16.990> after<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:17.380> die

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
it's gonna stay there after you to die

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.010 
it's gonna stay there after you to die
and<00:05:17.590> that<00:05:18.010> guy<00:05:18.220> will<00:05:18.550> still<00:05:18.820> go<00:05:18.970> down<00:05:19.000> c4<00:05:19.930> on

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
and that guy will still go down c4 on

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.630 
and that guy will still go down c4 on
the<00:05:20.080> other<00:05:20.200> hand<00:05:20.410> once<00:05:20.650> you're<00:05:20.830> dead<00:05:21.040> it's

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
the other hand once you're dead it's

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.700 
the other hand once you're dead it's
done<00:05:21.970> now<00:05:22.630> you<00:05:22.660> can<00:05:22.870> find<00:05:23.050> lots<00:05:23.170> of<00:05:23.320> invented

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
done now you can find lots of invented

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.710 
done now you can find lots of invented
places<00:05:24.040> but<00:05:24.250> at<00:05:24.400> this<00:05:24.550> one<00:05:24.790> the<00:05:25.270> opposing

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
places but at this one the opposing

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.150 
places but at this one the opposing
force<00:05:25.930> can't<00:05:26.230> see<00:05:26.470> it<00:05:26.560> when<00:05:26.680> they're<00:05:26.800> driving

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
force can't see it when they're driving

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.920 
force can't see it when they're driving
up<00:05:27.280> but<00:05:27.490> my<00:05:27.640> team<00:05:27.940> will<00:05:28.210> be<00:05:28.390> able<00:05:28.510> to<00:05:28.630> see<00:05:28.780> them

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
up but my team will be able to see them

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.310 
up but my team will be able to see them
so<00:05:29.140> hopefully<00:05:29.290> we<00:05:30.160> want<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.400> drive<00:05:30.580> into<00:05:30.820> those

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
so hopefully we want to drive into those

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.080 
so hopefully we want to drive into those
again<00:05:32.320> this<00:05:32.500> is<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.830> objective<00:05:33.370> closest<00:05:33.970> to

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
again this is the objective closest to

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.870 
again this is the objective closest to
the<00:05:34.180> enemy's<00:05:34.480> base<00:05:34.660> on<00:05:35.020> Shanghai<00:05:35.950> now<00:05:36.730> we're

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
the enemy's base on Shanghai now we're

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.970 
the enemy's base on Shanghai now we're
gonna<00:05:37.000> stick<00:05:37.210> them<00:05:37.360> here<00:05:37.390> always<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.350> nice<00:05:38.590> spot

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
gonna stick them here always a nice spot

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.710 
gonna stick them here always a nice spot
anything<00:05:39.460> you'll<00:05:39.730> always<00:05:39.880> find<00:05:40.210> action<00:05:40.630> when

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
anything you'll always find action when

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.210 
anything you'll always find action when
you're<00:05:40.870> taking<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.170> bases<00:05:41.620> closest<00:05:42.040> to

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
you're taking the bases closest to

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.910 
you're taking the bases closest to
theirs<00:05:42.450> you're<00:05:43.450> always<00:05:43.690> gonna<00:05:44.140> find<00:05:44.410> action

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
theirs you're always gonna find action

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.670 
theirs you're always gonna find action
and<00:05:45.250> all<00:05:45.370> there's<00:05:45.610> this<00:05:45.730> kid<00:05:46.560> running<00:05:47.560> around

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
and all there's this kid running around

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.100 
and all there's this kid running around
here<00:05:48.040> take<00:05:48.280> him<00:05:48.490> out<00:05:48.700> and<00:05:49.420> eventually<00:05:49.900> yes

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
here take him out and eventually yes

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.380 
here take him out and eventually yes
indeed<00:05:50.740> these<00:05:50.980> mines<00:05:51.250> do<00:05:51.520> actually<00:05:52.030> go<00:05:52.180> off

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
indeed these mines do actually go off

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.690 
indeed these mines do actually go off
you<00:05:53.380> know<00:05:53.500> we<00:05:53.770> found<00:05:53.950> a<00:05:54.100> guy<00:05:54.220> who<00:05:54.250> got<00:05:54.460> through

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
you know we found a guy who got through

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.340 
you know we found a guy who got through
the<00:05:54.820> front<00:05:55.180> end<00:05:55.390> so<00:05:55.600> he<00:05:55.750> didn't<00:05:55.960> actually<00:05:56.080> come

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
the front end so he didn't actually come

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.510 
the front end so he didn't actually come
through<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.650> back<00:05:56.800> that's<00:05:57.100> why<00:05:57.220> I<00:05:57.250> didn't

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
through the back that's why I didn't

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.400 
through the back that's why I didn't
trip<00:05:57.730> him<00:05:57.880> and<00:05:58.600> while<00:05:58.870> we're<00:05:59.020> getting<00:05:59.200> shot

trip him and while we're getting shot

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.680 
trip him and while we're getting shot

merit just with the simple thought that

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.400 
merit just with the simple thought that
I<00:06:13.000> don't<00:06:13.270> know<00:06:13.360> it's<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.600> human<00:06:13.930> mind<00:06:14.110> but

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
I don't know it's the human mind but

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.770 
I don't know it's the human mind but
it's<00:06:14.650> seasoned<00:06:15.190> a<00:06:15.280> couple<00:06:16.030> of<00:06:16.090> pillars<00:06:16.540> it

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
it's seasoned a couple of pillars it

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.810 
it's seasoned a couple of pillars it
wants<00:06:17.080> to<00:06:17.140> drive<00:06:17.350> through<00:06:17.680> them<00:06:17.830> and<00:06:18.520> sure

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
wants to drive through them and sure

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.250 
wants to drive through them and sure
enough<00:06:18.850> a<00:06:19.180> few<00:06:19.360> moments<00:06:19.720> later<00:06:19.870> well<00:06:20.110> we're

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
enough a few moments later well we're

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.520 
enough a few moments later well we're
guarding<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.620> objective<00:06:21.160> bang<00:06:22.230> now<00:06:23.230> the<00:06:23.290> guy

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
guarding the objective bang now the guy

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.380 
guarding the objective bang now the guy
down<00:06:23.830> so<00:06:24.400> again<00:06:24.640> you<00:06:24.880> could<00:06:25.000> stick<00:06:25.270> them

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
down so again you could stick them

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.820 
down so again you could stick them
anywhere<00:06:25.690> and<00:06:25.750> it's<00:06:25.960> really<00:06:26.230> nice<00:06:26.410> something

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
anywhere and it's really nice something

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.930 
anywhere and it's really nice something
comes<00:06:27.010> through<00:06:27.250> there<00:06:27.430> it<00:06:27.520> doesn't<00:06:27.760> have<00:06:27.850> to
