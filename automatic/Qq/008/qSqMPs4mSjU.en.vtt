effort<00:00:24.270> that's<00:00:24.390> been<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.020> over<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
effort that's been going on over the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.670 
effort that's been going on over the
past<00:00:25.590> few<00:00:26.010> years<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.730> how<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.779> move<00:00:28.140> sound

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
past few years was how can we move sound

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.640 
past few years was how can we move sound
beyond<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.490> we've<00:00:29.609> been<00:00:29.760> able<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.210> today

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
beyond what we've been able to do today

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.739 
beyond what we've been able to do today
and<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.890> would<00:00:32.039> that<00:00:32.070> look<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.600> so<00:00:33.600> when<00:00:33.659> we

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:33.749 
and what would that look like so when we

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:35.629 
and what would that look like so when we
look<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> evolution<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.499> sound<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.129> film

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:35.639 
look at the evolution of sound in film

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:39.169 
look at the evolution of sound in film
and<00:00:35.850> cinema<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.629> started<00:00:37.019> off<00:00:37.139> with<00:00:37.289> mono<00:00:38.179> then

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
and cinema we started off with mono then

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.959 
and cinema we started off with mono then
we<00:00:39.510> moved<00:00:39.749> to<00:00:39.870> stereo<00:00:40.319> we<00:00:41.219> added<00:00:41.549> two<00:00:41.760> more

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
we moved to stereo we added two more

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.719 
we moved to stereo we added two more
speakers<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.569> created<00:00:42.899> two<00:00:43.049> more<00:00:43.229> channels

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:43.729 
speakers and created two more channels

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.160 
speakers and created two more channels
then<00:00:44.729> it<00:00:44.909> was<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> evolution<00:00:46.049> and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
then it was the evolution and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.079 
then it was the evolution and
introduction<00:00:46.769> of<00:00:46.889> surround<00:00:47.459> sound<00:00:47.819> that<00:00:47.999> we

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
introduction of surround sound that we

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.639 
introduction of surround sound that we
were<00:00:48.179> able<00:00:48.299> to<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.690> put<00:00:48.989> sounds<00:00:49.530> all

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
were able to actually put sounds all

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.090 
were able to actually put sounds all
around<00:00:49.979> the<00:00:50.339> audience<00:00:50.729> then<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.659> 5.1<00:00:52.499> we

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
around the audience then with 5.1 we

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.669 
around the audience then with 5.1 we
were<00:00:53.309> able<00:00:53.639> to<00:00:53.670> split<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.179> room<00:00:54.389> in<00:00:54.659> half<00:00:55.109> and

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
were able to split the room in half and

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.559 
were able to split the room in half and
now<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.339> left<00:00:56.639> surround<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.269> a<00:00:57.329> rate

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
now have a left surround and a rate

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.840 
now have a left surround and a rate
surround<00:00:58.049> to<00:00:58.559> allow<00:00:58.829> us<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.339> sense

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
surround to allow us to have more sense

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.149 
surround to allow us to have more sense
of<00:00:59.999> movement<00:01:00.479> of<00:01:00.629> sound<00:01:01.109> across<00:01:01.499> the<00:01:01.679> audience

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
of movement of sound across the audience

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.260 
of movement of sound across the audience
we've<00:01:03.029> 7.1<00:01:03.869> we<00:01:04.199> split<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.680> room<00:01:04.859> again<00:01:05.270> into

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
we've 7.1 we split the room again into

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.399 
we've 7.1 we split the room again into
four<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.619> had<00:01:07.890> left<00:01:08.539> right<00:01:09.539> back<00:01:10.140> wall

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
four so now we had left right back wall

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.639 
four so now we had left right back wall
left<00:01:10.770> back<00:01:11.189> wall<00:01:11.430> right<00:01:11.750> logic<00:01:12.750> would<00:01:13.409> make

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
left back wall right logic would make

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.649 
left back wall right logic would make
sense<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.430> next<00:01:14.700> progression<00:01:14.880> would<00:01:15.509> be

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
sense that the next progression would be

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.590 
sense that the next progression would be
like<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> 9.1<00:01:16.649> or<00:01:16.890> an<00:01:17.130> 11-point<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.969> or<00:01:18.149> even<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
like a 9.1 or an 11-point one or even a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
like a 9.1 or an 11-point one or even a
13-point<00:01:19.259> one<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.219> feedback<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.700> we

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
13-point one but the feedback that we

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.209 
13-point one but the feedback that we
got<00:01:21.179> from<00:01:21.240> content<00:01:21.810> creators<00:01:22.200> was<00:01:22.469> it<00:01:22.859> wasn't

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
got from content creators was it wasn't

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:24.889 
got from content creators was it wasn't
going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.429> good<00:01:23.520> enough<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.630> when

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
going to be good enough and that's when

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.169 
going to be good enough and that's when
we<00:01:24.990> knew<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:26.070> had<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.369> make<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:26.789> bolder

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
we knew we had to make a more bolder

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.239 
we knew we had to make a more bolder
step<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.810> moving<00:01:28.140> forward<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.100> we

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
step in moving forward so what if we

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.940 
step in moving forward so what if we
could<00:01:32.369> start<00:01:32.909> again<00:01:33.350> what<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.469> we<00:01:34.619> could<00:01:34.770> go

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
could start again what if we could go

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
could start again what if we could go
back<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.219> completely<00:01:35.850> redefine<00:01:36.600> how<00:01:37.350> we

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
back and completely redefine how we

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.590 
back and completely redefine how we
bring<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.070> surround<00:01:38.460> sound<00:01:38.579> experience<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
bring the surround sound experience to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.830 
bring the surround sound experience to
audiences<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:41.999> Dolby<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.329> bringing<00:01:42.630> now

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
audiences so what Dolby is bringing now

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.919 
audiences so what Dolby is bringing now
is<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.859> next-generation<00:01:44.369> surround<00:01:45.329> format

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
is the next-generation surround format

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.109 
is the next-generation surround format
for<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.380> industry<00:01:46.859> we<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.609> a<00:01:47.640> channel<00:01:47.939> based

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
for the industry we have a channel based

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.690 
for the industry we have a channel based
solution<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.469> have<00:01:49.619> today<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.219> I<00:01:50.340> wanted<00:01:50.609> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
solution as we have today if I wanted to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.249 
solution as we have today if I wanted to
create<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.999> sensation<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.600> movement<00:01:51.780> it's

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
create a sensation of movement it's

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.789 
create a sensation of movement it's
either<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.079> gives<00:01:55.499> you<00:01:55.679> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
either here or here so gives you the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.980 
either here or here so gives you the
sensation<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.490> movement<00:01:56.639> but<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.539> doesn't

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
sensation of movement but it doesn't

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.440 
sensation of movement but it doesn't
have<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.289> precision<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.189> movement<00:01:59.399> so<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
have that precision of movement so the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.849 
have that precision of movement so the
fundamental<00:02:00.899> shift<00:02:01.109> and<00:02:01.319> what's<00:02:01.439> happening

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
fundamental shift and what's happening

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.520 
fundamental shift and what's happening
is<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.159> now<00:02:02.880> we're<00:02:03.329> migrating<00:02:03.780> away<00:02:04.200> from

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
is that now we're migrating away from

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.889 
is that now we're migrating away from
channels<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.759> ability<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.149> move<00:02:06.359> a<00:02:06.420> sound<00:02:06.689> for

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
channels the ability to move a sound for

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.590 
channels the ability to move a sound for
the<00:02:07.020> room

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
technology which will sit with them for

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.990 
technology which will sit with them for
a<00:03:43.290> significant<00:03:44.290> period<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.709> time<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.850> what

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
a significant period of time so what

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.479 
a significant period of time so what
we're<00:03:46.180> doing<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.660> really<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.380> huge<00:03:47.860> fundamental

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
we're doing is really a huge fundamental

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.569 
we're doing is really a huge fundamental
shift<00:03:48.820> in<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.060> way<00:03:49.150> audio<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.350> not<00:03:50.860> only<00:03:51.130> mixed

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
shift in the way audio is not only mixed

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.300 
shift in the way audio is not only mixed
but<00:03:51.790> also<00:03:51.970> receive<00:03:52.900> inside<00:03:53.620> your<00:03:53.829> theaters

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
but also receive inside your theaters

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.500 
but also receive inside your theaters
and<00:03:54.959> it's<00:03:55.959> really<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.530> huge<00:03:57.130> change<00:03:57.640> from<00:03:58.090> five

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
and it's really a huge change from five

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.569 
and it's really a huge change from five
point<00:03:58.810> one<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.170> seven<00:03:59.440> point<00:03:59.769> one<00:03:59.829> that<00:04:00.370> was

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
point one to seven point one that was

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.910 
point one to seven point one that was
only<00:04:00.760> an<00:04:00.940> incremental<00:04:01.450> change<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.709> what

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
only an incremental change and that what
