00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
and you just squeeze this side together

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.480 
and you just squeeze this side together
to<00:01:36.270> make<00:01:36.479> sure<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.990> adhesive<00:01:37.590> holds

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
together this is optional but it really

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.080 
together this is optional but it really
helps<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:43.020> paper<00:01:43.229> crimper<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.090> crimp
