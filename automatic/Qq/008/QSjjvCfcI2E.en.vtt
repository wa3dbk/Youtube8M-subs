00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
too and the last thing that I'm throwing

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.559 
too and the last thing that I'm throwing
in<00:04:09.849> here<00:04:10.120> is<00:04:10.650> dark<00:04:11.650> chocolate<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:12.849> what<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.180> use

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
in here is dark chocolate so what I use

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.000 
in here is dark chocolate so what I use
is<00:04:13.870> lint<00:04:14.169> dark<00:04:14.590> chocolate<00:04:15.329> ninety<00:04:16.329> percent

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
is lint dark chocolate ninety percent

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.270 
is lint dark chocolate ninety percent
lint<00:04:18.010> is<00:04:18.220> an<00:04:18.849> awesome<00:04:19.329> source<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:20.280> dark

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
lint is an awesome source of dark

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.880 
lint is an awesome source of dark
chocolate<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.969> the<00:04:22.060> reason<00:04:22.390> why<00:04:22.539> is<00:04:22.570> because

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
chocolate and the reason why is because

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.600 
chocolate and the reason why is because
there's<00:04:23.890> more<00:04:24.250> fiber<00:04:24.940> in<00:04:25.120> here

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
there's more fiber in here

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.570 
there's more fiber in here
then<00:04:26.030> there<00:04:26.270> is<00:04:26.300> sugar<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.080> there's<00:04:27.830> equal<00:04:28.310> I

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
then there is sugar and there's equal I

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.339 
then there is sugar and there's equal I
mean<00:04:28.610> there's<00:04:28.969> more<00:04:29.060> protein<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:29.960> here<00:04:30.169> than

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
mean there's more protein in here than

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.980 
mean there's more protein in here than
there<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.560> sugar<00:04:30.919> as<00:04:31.219> well<00:04:31.300> dark<00:04:32.300> chocolate<00:04:32.389> is

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
there is sugar as well dark chocolate is

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.260 
there is sugar as well dark chocolate is
very<00:04:33.469> surprisingly<00:04:34.460> if<00:04:34.759> you<00:04:34.879> don't<00:04:35.060> already

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
very surprisingly if you don't already

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.740 
very surprisingly if you don't already
know<00:04:35.419> this<00:04:35.750> very<00:04:36.199> high<00:04:36.469> in<00:04:36.830> antioxidants

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
know this very high in antioxidants

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.110 
know this very high in antioxidants
protein<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:39.050> fiber<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.009> just<00:04:40.460> for<00:04:40.610> example

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
protein and fiber so just for example

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.119 
protein and fiber so just for example
just<00:04:41.419> three<00:04:41.750> squares<00:04:42.169> of<00:04:42.439> this<00:04:42.560> bar<00:04:42.860> is

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
just three squares of this bar is

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.850 
just three squares of this bar is
getting<00:04:43.879> you<00:04:44.000> four<00:04:44.360> grams<00:04:44.659> of<00:04:44.900> fiber<00:04:45.139> so

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
getting you four grams of fiber so

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.559 
getting you four grams of fiber so
that's<00:04:46.069> more<00:04:46.310> than<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.490> cup<00:04:46.729> of<00:04:46.879> broccoli<00:04:47.090> in

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
that's more than a cup of broccoli in

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.809 
that's more than a cup of broccoli in
terms<00:04:47.780> of<00:04:47.960> fiber<00:04:48.199> intake<00:04:48.680> there's<00:04:49.370> three

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
terms of fiber intake there's three

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.879 
terms of fiber intake there's three
grams<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.270> protein<00:04:50.539> which<00:04:50.990> is<00:04:51.020> great<00:04:51.469> I<00:04:51.710> mean

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
grams of protein which is great I mean

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.450 
grams of protein which is great I mean
we're<00:04:52.069> getting<00:04:52.340> more<00:04:52.490> protein<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:54.250> just<00:04:55.250> from

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
we're getting more protein and just from

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.200 
we're getting more protein and just from
chocolate<00:04:55.879> and<00:04:56.409> 16<00:04:57.409> grams<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.860> fat<00:04:58.009> so<00:04:58.279> 180

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
chocolate and 16 grams of fat so 180

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.450 
chocolate and 16 grams of fat so 180
calories<00:04:59.830> just<00:05:01.180> in<00:05:02.180> three<00:05:02.569> squares<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:03.650> what

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
calories just in three squares so what

do with the chocolate is I either break
it<00:05:48.710> up<00:05:48.860> into<00:05:49.099> really<00:05:49.490> small<00:05:49.610> squares<00:05:50.330> or<00:05:50.659> I

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
it up into really small squares or I

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.230 
it up into really small squares or I
actually<00:05:51.500> cheese<00:05:52.009> grade<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.460> so<00:05:52.669> you<00:05:52.759> can<00:05:53.029> take
