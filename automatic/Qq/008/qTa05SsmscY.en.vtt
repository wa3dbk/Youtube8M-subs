negative side effects just a little bit
more<00:00:50.910> energy<00:00:51.030> obviously<00:00:51.710> don't<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:52.949> my

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
more energy obviously don't know if my

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.299 
more energy obviously don't know if my
metabolism<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:54.000> sped<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.100> probably<00:00:56.100> next

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
metabolism is sped up so probably next
