00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it's good enough and you can hope the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
it's good enough and you can hope the
number<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.940> you<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.450> there<00:01:09.710> basically

number that you have in there basically

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
number that you have in there basically
if<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.100> something<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.729> let's<00:01:12.570> say<00:01:12.780> we

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
put a phone over here I'm gonna take a

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.179 
put a phone over here I'm gonna take a
reading<00:01:17.149> hold<00:01:18.149> the<00:01:18.299> reading<00:01:18.600> take<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
reading hold the reading take it out and

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.700 
reading hold the reading take it out and
you<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.000> four<00:01:21.899> point<00:01:22.140> eight<00:01:22.259> ounces

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
you can see it's four point eight ounces

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520 
you can see it's four point eight ounces
if<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.729> had<00:01:23.820> USPS<00:01:24.450> make<00:01:24.810> sure<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.110> round<00:01:25.320> off

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
if you had USPS make sure you round off

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.730 
if you had USPS make sure you round off
to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.979> nearest<00:01:26.130> uh<00:01:26.790> per<00:01:27.420> ounce<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.619> why

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
to the nearest uh per ounce that's why

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.440 
to the nearest uh per ounce that's why
you<00:01:28.799> should<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.399> that'd<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.729> five<00:01:30.000> ounces

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you should do so that'd be five ounces

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.469 
you should do so that'd be five ounces

for this thing and you can hit it again

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.940 
for this thing and you can hit it again

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
things here yeah you could zero it out

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.959 
things here yeah you could zero it out
stuff<00:01:43.469> from<00:01:43.590> zero<00:01:43.859> over<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.159> take<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.850> out

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
stuff from zero over there take it out

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.959 
stuff from zero over there take it out
and<00:01:45.539> it<00:01:45.689> goes<00:01:45.810> negative<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.729> just<00:01:47.729> want<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
and it goes negative I just want to

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.249 
and it goes negative I just want to
mention<00:01:48.090> some<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> features<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.109> for

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
mention some of the features I have for
my<00:01:49.409> scale<00:01:49.729> different<00:01:50.729> ones<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.030> don't<00:01:51.210> have

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
my scale different ones you don't have

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.480 
my scale different ones you don't have
to<00:01:51.359> show<00:01:51.479> off<00:01:51.719> and<00:01:51.960> turn<00:01:52.079> off<00:01:52.259> turn<00:01:53.039> off<00:01:53.219> and

turn<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.759> back<00:01:53.969> on<00:01:55.310> zero<00:01:56.310> itself<00:01:56.579> out<00:01:56.789> again<00:01:56.820> so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
turn it back on zero itself out again so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.370 
turn it back on zero itself out again so
you<00:01:57.539> know<00:01:57.659> these<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:57.869> relatively

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you know these are relatively

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.740 
you know these are relatively
inexpensive<00:01:59.750> depending<00:02:01.159> how<00:02:02.159> much<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.689> in<00:02:03.689> a
