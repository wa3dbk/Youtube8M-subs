00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
two ways to do skill trees maybe one is

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.130 
two ways to do skill trees maybe one is
like<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> idea<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:30.960> making

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
like the idea that you're making

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
likely to this do exactly so that's the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
likely to this do exactly so that's the
that's<00:01:44.670> that's<00:01:45.030> direction<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.479> went<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.869> you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that's that's direction we went and you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.160 
that's that's direction we went and you
can<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.110> everything<00:01:46.259> from

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
you know learning to ride the elephant

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.160 
you know learning to ride the elephant
so<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.299> can<00:01:49.420> go<00:01:49.509> around<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.869> cause<00:01:50.020> some

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
so you can go around and cause some

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.289 
so you can go around and cause some
carnage<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.369> know<00:01:51.490> different<00:01:51.759> takedowns

for above or below all that and

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.190 
for above or below all that and
shangri-la<00:01:55.060> actually<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:55.600> can<00:01:55.720> learn<00:01:55.869> unique

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
shangri-la actually you can learn unique

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.050 
shangri-la actually you can learn unique
skills<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:57.280> bring<00:01:57.490> back<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.880> main

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
skills that you bring back to the main

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.340 
skills that you bring back to the main
game<00:01:58.270> obviously<00:01:58.689> this<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.960> not<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.200> same

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
game obviously this is not the same

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.260 
game obviously this is not the same
world<00:01:59.649> as<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.070> main<00:02:00.250> game<00:02:00.460> right<00:02:00.850> but<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.119> can

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
world as the main game right but you can

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.550 
world as the main game right but you can
actually<00:02:01.390> learn<00:02:01.720> unique<00:02:02.110> skills<00:02:02.409> in

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
actually learn unique skills in

actually learn unique skills in
shangri-la<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.190> take<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.340> bite<00:02:03.539> so<00:02:04.539> because

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
shangri-la and take a bite so because

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.600 
shangri-la and take a bite so because
you<00:02:05.110> can<00:02:05.259> ride<00:02:05.440> animals<00:02:05.680> so<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.159> can<00:02:06.250> jump<00:02:06.520> in

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
you can ride animals so you can jump in

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.699 
you can ride animals so you can jump in
a<00:02:06.670> wing<00:02:06.850> tsun<00:02:07.180> fly<00:02:07.509> around<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:07.990> seems<00:02:08.319> like<00:02:08.560> the

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
a wing tsun fly around it seems like the

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.430 
a wing tsun fly around it seems like the
map<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.220> pretty<00:02:09.850> large<00:02:10.179> how<00:02:10.989> big<00:02:11.260> are<00:02:11.350> we

because I couldn't I'm sure it screw it
up<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.100> then<00:02:21.220> we'd<00:02:21.310> have<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.550> issue<00:02:21.670> an

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
up and then we'd have the issue an

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.220 
up and then we'd have the issue an
apology<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.300> it's<00:02:22.450> like<00:02:22.569> it's<00:02:22.720> basically

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
apology but it's like it's basically

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.780 
apology but it's like it's basically
it's<00:02:23.410> been<00:02:23.560> physically<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.190> same<00:02:24.220> size<00:02:24.610> as

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
it's been physically the same size as

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.020 
it's been physically the same size as
the<00:02:24.880> Far<00:02:25.060> Cry<00:02:25.180> 3<00:02:25.269> world<00:02:25.690> which<00:02:26.700> mass<00:02:27.700> yeah

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
the Far Cry 3 world which mass yeah

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.610 
the Far Cry 3 world which mass yeah
which<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.360> think<00:02:28.569> was<00:02:28.660> like<00:02:28.840> 18<00:02:29.170> square<00:02:29.410> miles

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
which I think was like 18 square miles

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.960 
which I think was like 18 square miles
it's<00:02:29.799> not<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.040> doesn't<00:02:30.069> sound<00:02:30.400> as<00:02:30.580> much<00:02:30.760> but

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
it's not it doesn't sound as much but

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.449 
it's not it doesn't sound as much but
it's<00:02:31.150> when<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.660> have<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.900> walk<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.290> oh<00:02:32.530> yeah<00:02:33.040> or

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
it's when you have to walk it oh yeah or

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.340 
it's when you have to walk it oh yeah or
like<00:02:33.730> wingsuit<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.510> does<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.930> mountain<00:02:35.319> over

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
like wingsuit it does that mountain over
