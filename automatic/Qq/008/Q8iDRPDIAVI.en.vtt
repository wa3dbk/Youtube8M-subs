Africa<00:01:11.970> my<00:01:12.390> last<00:01:12.659> memory<00:01:13.460> playing

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
Africa my last memory playing

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.700 
Africa my last memory playing
netherlands<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.180> amsterdam<00:01:15.930> arena<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.440> not

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
netherlands in amsterdam arena was not

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.380 
netherlands in amsterdam arena was not
the<00:01:16.830> best<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.190> think<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.430> chased<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> ball<00:01:18.000> for

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the best i think we chased the ball for

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.590 
the best i think we chased the ball for
probably<00:01:19.110> 90<00:01:19.380> minutes<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.270> hopefully<00:01:21.270> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
probably 90 minutes so it's hopefully a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120 
probably 90 minutes so it's hopefully a
little<00:01:21.870> different<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.409> time<00:01:22.470> hopefully<00:01:22.799> we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
little different this time hopefully we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.860 
little different this time hopefully we
have<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.250> little<00:01:23.460> more<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.760> game<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.659> our

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
have a little more of the game it's our

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.620 
have a little more of the game it's our
real<00:01:25.610> really<00:01:26.610> our<00:01:26.729> last<00:01:26.940> chance<00:01:27.180> against<00:01:27.510> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
real really our last chance against a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.750 
real really our last chance against a
top<00:01:27.870> top<00:01:28.140> team<00:01:28.380> before<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.860> world<00:01:29.010> cup<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.490> so

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
top top team before the world cup and so

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.550 
top top team before the world cup and so
we<00:01:30.030> want<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> make<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> most<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.320> obviously

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the way they run off the ball so it just

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.550 
the way they run off the ball so it just
gives<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.610> chance<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.180> play<00:02:00.720> in<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.380> game

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
where the bars real high in terms of

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.609 
where the bars real high in terms of
just<00:02:06.920> reactions<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
just reactions and

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.610 
just reactions and
and<00:02:08.759> executing<00:02:09.759> plays<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.360> it's<00:02:11.230> good<00:02:11.379> for<00:02:11.409> us

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
and executing plays and it's good for us

and executing plays and it's good for us
you<00:02:12.280> only<00:02:12.430> get<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:12.790> many<00:02:12.879> chances<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.450> be

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
you only get so many chances to be

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.140 
you only get so many chances to be
together<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> team<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.489> we'll<00:02:16.060> get

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
together as a team and we'll get

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.119 
together as a team and we'll get
together<00:02:16.299> in<00:02:16.629> May<00:02:16.810> before<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.560> world<00:02:17.709> cup<00:02:17.830> and

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
together in May before the world cup and

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.009 
together in May before the world cup and
that<00:02:18.250> will<00:02:18.340> be<00:02:18.430> helpful<00:02:18.549> but<00:02:18.849> to<00:02:19.540> have<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> real

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
that will be helpful but to have a real

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.869 
that will be helpful but to have a real
game<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:20.650> in<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.459> middle<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.730> our

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
game like this in the middle of our

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.300 
game like this in the middle of our
seasons<00:02:22.330> now<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.010> guys<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:24.159> are

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
seasons now for the guys that are

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.770 
seasons now for the guys that are
playing<00:02:24.549> in<00:02:24.700> Europe<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:25.569> it's<00:02:25.659> really

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
playing in Europe I think it's really

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.449 
playing in Europe I think it's really
beneficial<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:27.040> good<00:02:27.280> way<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
beneficial and it's it's a good way to

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.270 
beneficial and it's it's a good way to
gauge<00:02:27.760> where<00:02:28.030> we're<00:02:28.180> at<00:02:28.530> good<00:02:29.530> way<00:02:29.680> for<00:02:29.709> Bob<00:02:30.129> to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
gauge where we're at good way for Bob to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.430 
gauge where we're at good way for Bob to
gauge<00:02:30.430> where<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> team<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.540> also<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
gauge where the team is at and also and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.170 
gauge where the team is at and also and
the<00:02:32.920> bigger<00:02:33.129> scheme<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:34.599> make<00:02:34.629> some<00:02:35.079> some

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
the bigger scheme to make some some

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.009 
the bigger scheme to make some some
assessments<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.269> how<00:02:37.390> guys<00:02:37.569> are<00:02:37.690> going<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.870> be

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
assessments on how guys are going to be

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.050 
assessments on how guys are going to be
and<00:02:38.230> help<00:02:39.069> make<00:02:39.220> choices<00:02:39.459> for<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.819> World<00:02:40.000> Cup

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
and help make choices for the World Cup

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.640 
and help make choices for the World Cup
I<00:02:40.390> think<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.750> good<00:02:40.900> performance<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.379> go<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.500> long

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
I think a good performance to go a long

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.059 
I think a good performance to go a long
way<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.720> always<00:02:43.900> want<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.170> win<00:02:44.349> you<00:02:44.769> know<00:02:44.890> but

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
way you always want to win you know but

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.400 
way you always want to win you know but
i<00:02:45.099> think<00:02:45.370> i<00:02:45.609> think<00:02:46.120> if<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.239> can<00:02:46.510> come<00:02:47.230> away<00:02:47.349> from

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
i think i think if we can come away from

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.170 
i think i think if we can come away from
90<00:02:47.709> minutes<00:02:48.010> feeling<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:48.430> everyone<00:02:48.910> put<00:02:49.060> in

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
90 minutes feeling like everyone put in

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.240 
90 minutes feeling like everyone put in
a<00:02:49.239> really<00:02:49.420> good<00:02:49.569> shift<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.829> know<00:02:51.040> from

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
a really good shift and you know from

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.360 
a really good shift and you know from
the<00:02:51.370> back<00:02:51.549> route<00:02:51.790> we<00:02:52.030> were<00:02:53.069> we<00:02:54.069> were<00:02:54.159> pretty

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
the back route we were we were pretty

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.509 
the back route we were we were pretty
solid<00:02:54.790> i<00:02:54.970> think<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.659> will<00:02:55.780> be<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:56.379> step<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.489> the

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
solid i think that will be a step in the

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.039 
solid i think that will be a step in the
right<00:02:57.609> direction<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:58.269> course<00:02:58.629> you<00:02:58.780> want<00:02:58.959> to

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
right direction of course you want to

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.960 
right direction of course you want to
win<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.409> know<00:02:59.680> but<00:03:00.010> certainly<00:03:00.670> not<00:03:00.760> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
win you know but certainly not the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.130 
win you know but certainly not the
expense<00:03:01.299> of<00:03:01.420> having<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.720> bad<00:03:01.930> performance

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
expense of having a bad performance

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.590 
expense of having a bad performance
either
