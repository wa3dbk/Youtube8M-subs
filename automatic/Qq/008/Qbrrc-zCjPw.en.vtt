00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
this case and as you can see they all

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.149 
this case and as you can see they all
came<00:02:01.590> off<00:02:02.570> now<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.170> realized<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.979> reason

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
came off now what I realized the reason

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.300 
came off now what I realized the reason
why<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.610> came<00:02:05.790> off<00:02:06.060> was<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.979> then<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
why they came off was because then the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.980 
why they came off was because then the
type<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.700> case<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.780> is

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
type of case it is

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.140 

it's<00:02:12.710> hard<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.100> see<00:02:13.250> because<00:02:13.340> it's<00:02:13.610> black<00:02:13.820> but

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
it's hard to see because it's black but

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.300 
it's hard to see because it's black but
see<00:02:14.510> how<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.690> inside<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.380> cases<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:16.010> shiny

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
see how the inside of the cases is shiny

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.360 
see how the inside of the cases is shiny
and<00:02:16.520> hard<00:02:17.090> plastic<00:02:17.600> that's<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.710> good<00:02:18.860> material

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
and hard plastic that's a good material

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.190 
and hard plastic that's a good material
now<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.600> flip<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.520> it's<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:23.780> almost

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
now if I flip it it's it's almost

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.710 
now if I flip it it's it's almost
somewhat<00:02:25.190> like<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.430> velvety<00:02:25.910> or<00:02:26.180> rubbish

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
somewhat like a velvety or rubbish

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.800 
somewhat like a velvety or rubbish
texture<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.800> top<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.250> do<00:02:28.910> not<00:02:29.120> glue

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
texture on top of it do not glue

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.440 
texture on top of it do not glue
anything<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.100> they<00:02:31.280> will<00:02:31.520> come<00:02:31.910> off<00:02:32.090> it'll

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
anything on it they will come off it'll

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.190 
anything on it they will come off it'll
peel<00:02:32.780> off<00:02:33.080> little<00:02:33.860> by<00:02:33.980> little<00:02:34.100> you'll<00:02:34.610> notice

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
peel off little by little you'll notice

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.520 
peel off little by little you'll notice
rhinestones<00:02:36.200> coming<00:02:36.650> off<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.520> glue

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
rhinestones coming off and the glue
