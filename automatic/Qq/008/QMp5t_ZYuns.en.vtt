melanoma<00:00:25.770> is<00:00:26.430> uh<00:00:26.489> it's<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:28.169> of<00:00:28.259> the<00:00:28.320> worst

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
melanoma is uh it's one of the worst

ones really if you start googling it if
you<00:00:30.869> find<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.200> you've<00:00:31.320> got<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.680> you're<00:00:31.980> not

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you find out you've got it you're not

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.979

going to be very happy especially when

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.800 
going to be very happy especially when
you<00:00:34.110> hit<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.380> 55<00:00:35.219> year<00:00:35.430> mortality<00:00:36.000> rates<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
you hit this 55 year mortality rates you

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.260 
you hit this 55 year mortality rates you
know<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.190> I'm<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.430> glad<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.880> hear<00:00:39.030> that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
know and I'm really glad to hear that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.090 
know and I'm really glad to hear that
melanoma<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> these<00:00:40.530> five<00:00:40.740> because<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
melanoma is one of these five because I

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.210 
melanoma is one of these five because I
think<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.490> have<00:00:41.970> a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.240> of<00:00:42.270> tools<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
think they have a lot of tools to

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.430 
think they have a lot of tools to
already<00:00:44.520> bring<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.910> down<00:00:45.060> just<00:00:45.390> talking<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
already bring it down just talking to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.080 
already bring it down just talking to
the<00:00:46.530> doctor<00:00:46.920> initially<00:00:47.400> made<00:00:47.640> me<00:00:47.730> feel<00:00:47.880> a<00:00:47.910> lot

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the doctor initially made me feel a lot

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.770 
the doctor initially made me feel a lot
better<00:00:48.350> about<00:00:49.350> my<00:00:50.160> chances<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:50.880> with<00:00:51.660> all

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
better about my chances and now with all

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.080 
better about my chances and now with all
this<00:00:51.900> extra<00:00:52.190> focus<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.700> I<00:00:53.790> think<00:00:53.820> it's

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this extra focus on it I think it's

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.920 
this extra focus on it I think it's
going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.240> be<00:00:54.329> able<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> make<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.720> big

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
going to be able to make a big

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.200 
going to be able to make a big
difference<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.040> lot<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.190> people<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:57.030> what

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
difference for a lot of people from what

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
difference for a lot of people from what
I've<00:00:57.300> read<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.720> research<00:00:58.050> there's<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> lot

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
I've read in the research there's a lot

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.900 
I've read in the research there's a lot
of<00:00:59.010> a<00:01:00.410> data<00:01:01.410> towards<00:01:01.739> vaccinations<00:01:02.520> really

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of a data towards vaccinations really

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.260 
of a data towards vaccinations really
answer<00:01:03.480> because<00:01:03.989> melanoma<00:01:04.949> works<00:01:05.579> with<00:01:06.149> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
answer because melanoma works with the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.700 
answer because melanoma works with the
immune<00:01:06.479> system<00:01:06.509> a<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.200> bit<00:01:07.290> more<00:01:07.439> it's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
immune system a little bit more it's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.870 
immune system a little bit more it's
affected<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.190> immune<00:01:08.340> system<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.729> little

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
affected by the immune system a little

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
affected by the immune system a little
bit<00:01:08.970> more<00:01:09.090> than<00:01:09.240> other<00:01:09.360> cancers<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.960> hoping

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
bit more than other cancers I'm hoping

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.330 
bit more than other cancers I'm hoping
that<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.800> can<00:01:10.950> find<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> vaccine

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that they when they can find a vaccine

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000 
that they when they can find a vaccine
for<00:01:11.880> melanoma<00:01:12.720> completely<00:01:13.290> which<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> way

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
for melanoma completely which in a way

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.180 
for melanoma completely which in a way
would<00:01:14.400> technically<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.210> cure<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.190> they

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
would technically be a cure so they

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.680 
would technically be a cure so they
really<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.760> day<00:01:17.880> should<00:01:18.120> be<00:01:18.240> able<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> cure

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
really one day should be able to cure

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.570 
really one day should be able to cure
cancer<00:01:19.100> that's<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:20.250> hope<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.810> melanoma<00:01:22.580> it's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
cancer that's my hope for melanoma it's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.730 
cancer that's my hope for melanoma it's
interesting<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.750> man<00:01:24.930> st.<00:01:25.290> standing<00:01:25.650> on

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
interesting the one man st. standing on

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
interesting the one man st. standing on
stage<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.190> talked<00:01:27.030> about<00:01:27.270> he<00:01:27.450> had<00:01:27.540> like

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
stage that talked about he had like

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.690 
stage that talked about he had like
three<00:01:28.530> or<00:01:28.620> four<00:01:28.680> different<00:01:28.920> campus<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.549> row

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
three or four different campus in a row

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.010 
three or four different campus in a row
and<00:01:29.760> he<00:01:29.850> kept<00:01:29.970> talking<00:01:30.120> about<00:01:30.360> hope<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.810> hope

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
and he kept talking about hope and hope

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
and he kept talking about hope and hope
and<00:01:31.229> that's<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:32.010> what<00:01:32.190> it<00:01:32.310> boils<00:01:32.340> down<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and that's really what it boils down to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.149 
and that's really what it boils down to
