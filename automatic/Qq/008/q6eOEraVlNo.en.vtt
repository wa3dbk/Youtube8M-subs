00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.470 
because as much I don't like this setup
is<00:03:37.810> there<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.980> also<00:03:39.100> killstreak<00:03:39.820> setup<00:03:40.090> I'm

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
is there and also killstreak setup I'm

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.360 
is there and also killstreak setup I'm
running<00:03:40.690> like<00:03:40.990> eight<00:03:41.170> nine<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.620> eleven<00:03:42.190> right

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
running like eight nine and eleven right

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.150 
running like eight nine and eleven right
now<00:03:42.550> mainly<00:03:43.420> because<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:43.780> know<00:03:43.990> high<00:03:44.650> reward

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
now mainly because you know high reward

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.750 
now mainly because you know high reward
high<00:03:45.850> risk<00:03:46.120> high<00:03:46.240> reward<00:03:46.750> kind<00:03:47.020> of<00:03:47.140> scenarios

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
high risk high reward kind of scenarios

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.750 
high risk high reward kind of scenarios
but<00:03:48.760> in<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.450> same<00:03:49.630> aspect<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:51.310> can't<00:03:51.550> put

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
but in the same aspect you can't put

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.400 
but in the same aspect you can't put
these<00:03:51.880> together<00:03:52.060> all<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.630> time<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:53.110> they

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
these together all the time and they

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.710 
these together all the time and they
what<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.730> what<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.240> most<00:03:55.390> effective

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
what is the what is the most effective

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.949 
what is the what is the most effective
way<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.050> go<00:03:56.290> about<00:03:56.440> it<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:57.520> just<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:58.180> lose

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
way to go about it is it just to lose

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.570 
way to go about it is it just to lose
the<00:03:59.170> 11<00:03:59.470> kill<00:03:59.680> streak<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.190> goes<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.459> the

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
the 11 kill streak and goes to the

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.180 
the 11 kill streak and goes to the
chopper<00:04:00.970> gunner<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.450> not<00:04:02.440> use<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.740> Blackbird

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
chopper gunner and not use the Blackbird

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.970 
chopper gunner and not use the Blackbird
because<00:04:03.550> I<00:04:03.700> don't<00:04:03.910> see<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.150> Blackbirds<00:04:04.540> point

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
because I don't see the Blackbirds point

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.070 
because I don't see the Blackbirds point
with<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.270> with<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:07.390> chopper<00:04:07.690> gunner<00:04:07.930> because

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
with a with the chopper gunner because

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.420 
with a with the chopper gunner because
you<00:04:08.140> only<00:04:08.260> need<00:04:08.440> one<00:04:08.620> more<00:04:08.800> for<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.040> chopper

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
you only need one more for the chopper

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.429 
you only need one more for the chopper
gunner

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
gunner

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.380 
gunner
like<00:04:11.439> I<00:04:11.579> what<00:04:12.579> do<00:04:12.640> you<00:04:12.730> guys<00:04:12.819> think<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.180> best

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
like I what do you guys think the best

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.479 
like I what do you guys think the best
killstreak<00:04:13.659> setup<00:04:14.140> is<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.439> optimize<00:04:14.650> kills

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
killstreak setup is to optimize kills

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.060 
killstreak setup is to optimize kills
like<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.449> get<00:04:16.630> over<00:04:16.780> high<00:04:17.019> rate<00:04:17.289> of<00:04:17.320> kills<00:04:17.620> fast

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
like to get over high rate of kills fast

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.580 
like to get over high rate of kills fast
and<00:04:18.430> influence<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.030> TDM<00:04:19.509> in<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:20.169> TDM

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
and influence the TDM in a TDM

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.909 
and influence the TDM in a TDM
environment<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:22.050> know<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.229> dogs<00:04:23.530> are<00:04:23.740> pretty

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
environment I know the dogs are pretty

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.070 
environment I know the dogs are pretty
much<00:04:23.979> useless<00:04:24.340> but<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.970> dogs<00:04:25.210> are<00:04:25.509> I<00:04:25.660> use<00:04:25.930> the

do you think the best killstreak setup

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.290 
do you think the best killstreak setup
is<00:04:36.250> for<00:04:36.870> optimizing<00:04:37.870> kills<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:39.400> are<00:04:39.610> easier

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
is for optimizing kills that are easier

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.990 
is for optimizing kills that are easier
to<00:04:40.360> put<00:04:40.660> together
