sweet potato slips you need to look
pretty<00:00:20.100> closely<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.300> sweet<00:00:21.570> potato<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:22.289> a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
pretty closely at a sweet potato have a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.590 
pretty closely at a sweet potato have a
look<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.710> now<00:00:23.609> along<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> length<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
look at this now along the length of the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.099 
look at this now along the length of the
potato

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
potato

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.470 
potato
there<00:00:25.710> are<00:00:25.859> lots<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.250> lots<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.670> eyes<00:00:27.000> just

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
there are lots and lots of eyes just

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.259 
there are lots and lots of eyes just
like<00:00:27.630> an<00:00:27.779> ordinary<00:00:27.900> potato<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.060> these<00:00:30.060> will

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
like an ordinary potato and these will

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.460 
like an ordinary potato and these will
grow<00:00:30.420> out<00:00:30.630> now<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:30.990> we're<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> do

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
grow out now what we're going to do

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.120 
grow out now what we're going to do
instead<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.070> planting<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> whole<00:00:33.480> potato

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
instead of planting the whole potato

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.520 
instead of planting the whole potato
we're<00:00:35.130> actually<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.059> cut<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.200> into

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
we're actually going to cut this into

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.709 
we're actually going to cut this into
four<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:40.879> these<00:00:41.879> eyes<00:00:42.270> will<00:00:42.570> produce

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
four so that now these eyes will produce

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.450 
four so that now these eyes will produce
a<00:00:42.960> plant

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.330 

these<00:00:52.120> eyes<00:00:52.390> will<00:00:52.420> produce<00:00:52.750> a<00:00:52.989> plant<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
these eyes will produce a plant and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.250 
these eyes will produce a plant and
these<00:00:54.969> eyes<00:00:55.210> will<00:00:55.239> produce<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.780> plant<00:00:56.020> so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
these eyes will produce a plant so

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.560 
these eyes will produce a plant so
rather<00:00:56.649> than<00:00:56.829> having<00:00:57.010> one<00:00:57.300> we're<00:00:58.300> going<00:00:58.449> to

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
rather than having one we're going to

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.049 
rather than having one we're going to
have<00:00:58.750> four<00:00:59.579> essentially<00:01:00.579> we're<00:01:00.699> growing

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
have four essentially we're growing

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.030 
have four essentially we're growing
these<00:01:01.300> in<00:01:01.809> our<00:01:02.079> grow<00:01:02.290> bag<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.739> we're<00:01:02.829> going<00:01:02.980> to

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
these in our grow bag and we're going to

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.130 
these in our grow bag and we're going to
divide<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.489> grow<00:01:03.640> bag<00:01:03.820> into<00:01:04.119> two<00:01:04.420> halves<00:01:04.809> and

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
divide the grow bag into two halves and

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.580 
divide the grow bag into two halves and
put<00:01:05.740> two<00:01:05.979> slips<00:01:06.340> in<00:01:06.880> each<00:01:07.210> half<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:08.170> grow<00:01:08.350> bag

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
put two slips in each half the grow bag

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.730 
put two slips in each half the grow bag
is<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:08.950> perfect<00:01:08.979> medium<00:01:09.940> for<00:01:10.360> growing<00:01:11.320> sweet

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
is the perfect medium for growing sweet

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.130 
is the perfect medium for growing sweet
potato<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.640> quite<00:01:12.909> literally<00:01:13.330> we're<00:01:13.960> just

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
potato and quite literally we're just

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.030 
potato and quite literally we're just
going<00:01:14.290> to<00:01:14.380> push<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:15.210> sweet<00:01:16.210> potato<00:01:16.330> slip<00:01:17.170> into

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
going to push a sweet potato slip into

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.870 
going to push a sweet potato slip into
the<00:01:18.340> bag<00:01:19.800> two<00:01:20.800> on<00:01:20.950> one<00:01:21.070> side<00:01:23.490> two<00:01:24.490> on<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.729> other

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
the bag two on one side two on the other

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.040 
the bag two on one side two on the other
side<00:01:28.080> water<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.470> little<00:01:29.740> way<00:01:30.840> because<00:01:31.840> we're

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
side water and little way because we're

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.440 
side water and little way because we're
watering<00:01:32.440> these<00:01:32.619> quite<00:01:32.979> regularly<00:01:33.429> we<00:01:34.270> need<00:01:34.420> a

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
watering these quite regularly we need a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.169 
watering these quite regularly we need a
few<00:01:34.660> irrigation<00:01:35.289> holes<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.820> they<00:01:36.910> don't<00:01:37.090> get

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
few irrigation holes so they don't get

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.900 
few irrigation holes so they don't get
waterlogged<00:01:37.830> we<00:01:38.830> go<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.009> water<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.820> feed

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
waterlogged we go to water and feed

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.630 
waterlogged we go to water and feed
these<00:01:40.840> plants<00:01:41.380> with<00:01:41.979> general-purpose

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
these plants with general-purpose

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.749 
these plants with general-purpose
fertilizer<00:01:43.420> every<00:01:43.780> two<00:01:44.740> weeks<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.550> by<00:01:45.700> the

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
fertilizer every two weeks and by the

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.490 
fertilizer every two weeks and by the
end<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.179> the<00:01:46.300> summer<00:01:46.509> you'll<00:01:47.020> have<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.259> good

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
end of the summer you'll have a good

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.850 
end of the summer you'll have a good
kilo<00:01:48.009> of<00:01:48.220> sweet<00:01:48.909> potato<00:01:49.270> in<00:01:49.630> each<00:01:50.229> half<00:01:50.560> of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
kilo of sweet potato in each half of

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.520 
kilo of sweet potato in each half of
this<00:01:51.340> go<00:01:51.580> back<00:01:51.789> all<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:52.569> need<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.810> do<00:01:52.929> now<00:01:53.110> is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
this go back all we need to do now is

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.560 
this go back all we need to do now is
pop<00:01:53.830> them<00:01:53.950> into<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.250> greenhouse<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:57.570> that's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
pop them into the greenhouse and that's

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.610 
pop them into the greenhouse and that's
how<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.840> grow<00:01:59.049> three<00:01:59.649> potato<00:02:00.040> slips
