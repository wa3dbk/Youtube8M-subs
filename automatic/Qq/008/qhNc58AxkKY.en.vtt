00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
switch your wheels and your bearings out

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.660 
switch your wheels and your bearings out
quickly<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:09.980> first<00:00:10.980> thing<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.219> do<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.519> get

quickly so first thing you do is get

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.400 
quickly so first thing you do is get
your<00:00:11.880> your<00:00:12.780> tool<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.759> screw<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.450> nut<00:00:15.630> off

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.980 

and<00:00:20.119> on<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.449> outside<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.800> any

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
and on the outside just like on any

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.570 
and on the outside just like on any
truck<00:00:24.990> there's<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.099> speed<00:00:26.400> ring

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
truck there's going to be a speed ring

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.320 
truck there's going to be a speed ring
don't<00:00:27.539> lose<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.789> then<00:00:29.789> there's<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
don't lose it and then there's going to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
don't lose it and then there's going to
be<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.480> speed<00:00:30.779> ring<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> inside<00:00:31.500> which<00:00:31.830> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
be a speed ring on the inside which you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.410 
be a speed ring on the inside which you
also<00:00:32.160> don't<00:00:32.460> want<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.700> lose<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.239> do

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
also don't want to lose because you do

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.540 
also don't want to lose because you do
need<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.440> what<00:00:34.980> you're<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
need them and what you're going to do is

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.740 
need them and what you're going to do is
you're<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.820> take<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.210> bearing<00:00:36.570> right

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you're going to take the bearing right

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.500 
you're going to take the bearing right
here<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.579> just<00:00:38.579> stick<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.850> right<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.360> end

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
here and just stick it right on the end

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.880 
here and just stick it right on the end
of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> axle<00:00:41.870> like<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.739> hangs

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
of the axle like that just so it hangs

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
of the axle like that just so it hangs
off<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:47.090> sorry<00:00:52.399> twist<00:00:53.399> until<00:00:54.050> your

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
off and then sorry twist until your

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.479 
off and then sorry twist until your
bearing<00:00:55.350> comes<00:00:55.559> off<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:55.949> push<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.219> in

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
bearing comes off and then push it in

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
bearing comes off and then push it in
then<00:00:57.449> take<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> bearing<00:00:58.109> spacer<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.710> in

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
then take the bearing spacer that was in

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.430 
then take the bearing spacer that was in
your<00:00:58.920> wheel<00:00:59.329> put<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> back<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> axle<00:01:01.230> then

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
your wheel put it back on the axle then

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280 
your wheel put it back on the axle then
take<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.859> outside<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.359> outside<00:01:03.750> bearing<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
take the outside the outside bearing and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.310 
take the outside the outside bearing and
then<00:01:05.250> put<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.580> back<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
then put it back on so the in so the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.719 
then put it back on so the in so the
outside<00:01:07.470> shield<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.159> facing<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.229> again

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
outside shield is facing in and again

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.370 
outside shield is facing in and again
just<00:01:11.729> torque<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> torque<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.930> until<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> comes

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
just torque the torque it until it comes

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.590 
just torque the torque it until it comes
off<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.610> set<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
off and then it's set like that so that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.469 
off and then it's set like that so that
the<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.250> inner<00:01:17.250> shield<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> bearing<00:01:18.330> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the the inner shield of the bearing is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.910 
the the inner shield of the bearing is
actually<00:01:18.869> facing<00:01:19.259> outwards<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> that's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
actually facing outwards and that's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.789 
actually facing outwards and that's
that's<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.970> way<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.270> supposed<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.900> then

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that's the way it's supposed to be then

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.429 
that's the way it's supposed to be then
you<00:01:22.920> take<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.250> new<00:01:23.369> wheel<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:25.020> outside

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you take your new wheel and the outside

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.800 
you take your new wheel and the outside
of<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> wheel<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.240> first<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
of the wheel is going to go on first and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
of the wheel is going to go on first and
then<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:30.350> push<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:35.299> switch

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
then you just push it on like so switch

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.899 
then you just push it on like so switch
it<00:01:36.450> around<00:01:37.880> push<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.119> snug<00:01:40.729> take<00:01:41.729> your

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it around push it on snug take your

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.080 
it around push it on snug take your
speed<00:01:42.570> ring<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.140> back<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.759> screw<00:01:44.759> your<00:01:44.909> nut

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
speed ring put it back on screw your nut

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.270 
speed ring put it back on screw your nut
on<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:49.520> then<00:01:50.520> tighten<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.030> bolt<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.479> down
