it<00:01:53.640> um<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.329> hard<00:01:54.780> stuff<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.380> i<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.649> here

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
it um with hard stuff that i have here

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.069 
it um with hard stuff that i have here
but<00:01:56.579> i<00:01:56.640> took<00:01:56.759> some<00:01:57.030> poster<00:01:57.420> board<00:01:57.450> cut<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
but i took some poster board cut it to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.600 
but i took some poster board cut it to
the<00:01:58.110> length<00:01:58.380> i<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> hat<00:01:59.159> measures

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the length i think the hat measures

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.230 
the length i think the hat measures
about<00:01:59.790> 8<00:02:00.060> inches<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.719> length<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.850> did

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
about 8 inches in length so on all I did

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.149 
about 8 inches in length so on all I did
is<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.600> cut<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> link<00:02:04.409> i<00:02:04.469> wanted<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
is I cut it to the link i wanted in the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.770 
is I cut it to the link i wanted in the
width<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.490> wanted<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.000> then<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.270> stapled

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
width that I wanted and then I stapled

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.839 
width that I wanted and then I stapled
both<00:02:06.960> ends<00:02:07.320> together<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.280> top<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.729> then

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
both ends together on the top and then

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.890 
both ends together on the top and then
the<00:02:08.940> bottom<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.479> didn't<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> stapler<00:02:10.619> too

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
the bottom I didn't have a stapler too

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900 
the bottom I didn't have a stapler too
long<00:02:12.900> enough<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.349> reach<00:02:13.530> them

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
long enough to reach them

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.540 
long enough to reach them
it<00:02:13.970> also<00:02:14.120> i<00:02:14.300> took<00:02:14.660> duct<00:02:15.020> tape<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.920> taped<00:02:16.280> it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
on the front and in the back just so I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.580

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
didn't need any glue because the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.470 
didn't need any glue because the
adhesive<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.410> this<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:36.740> really<00:03:37.160> good<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:38.240> I

is a smaller version I cut the size of
the<00:04:21.020> rim<00:04:21.230> that<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.500> wanted<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.190> then<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:23.030> took

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
the rim that I wanted and then I took

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.200 
the rim that I wanted and then I took
the<00:04:23.930> body<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.710> Hat<00:04:24.979> let's<00:04:25.520> pretend<00:04:25.940> again

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
the body of the Hat let's pretend again

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.260 
the body of the Hat let's pretend again
but<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.720> top<00:04:26.960> is<00:04:26.990> our

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
but the top is our

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.809 
but the top is our
he<00:04:27.360> covered<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.379> put<00:04:28.710> slits<00:04:29.129> all<00:04:29.370> around

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
he covered and I put slits all around

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:34.040 
he covered and I put slits all around
the<00:04:29.940> Hat<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.509> then<00:04:31.080> I'd<00:04:31.289> hold<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:33.020> glued<00:04:34.020> the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
the Hat and then I'd hold it I glued the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.180 
the Hat and then I'd hold it I glued the
slits<00:04:34.650> all<00:04:35.389> down<00:04:36.389> on<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.870> fusible<00:04:37.229> webbing<00:04:37.530> so

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
slits all down on the fusible webbing so

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.040 
slits all down on the fusible webbing so
this<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.610> what<00:04:38.789> it<00:04:38.909> looks<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:39.270> again<00:04:39.629> the<00:04:39.810> rim

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
this is what it looks like again the rim

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.379 
this is what it looks like again the rim
it's<00:04:40.379> depending<00:04:41.340> on<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.759> size<00:04:41.940> that<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.240> want

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
it's depending on the size that you want

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.839 
it's depending on the size that you want
right<00:04:42.840> so<00:04:43.229> then<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.740> glued<00:04:44.099> this<00:04:44.370> all<00:04:44.699> around

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
right so then you glued this all around

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.420 
right so then you glued this all around
once<00:04:45.389> it's<00:04:45.629> completely<00:04:46.050> gluten<00:04:46.560> down<00:04:46.800> then

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
once it's completely gluten down then

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.430 
once it's completely gluten down then
you're<00:04:47.639> going<00:04:47.849> to<00:04:47.909> flip<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.300> over<00:04:48.599> and<00:04:48.900> you're

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
you're going to flip it over and you're

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.649 
you're going to flip it over and you're
going<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.680> cut<00:04:49.979> an<00:04:50.099> X<00:04:50.340> in<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.729> middle<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.300> the

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
going to cut an X in the middle of the

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.399 
going to cut an X in the middle of the
fusible<00:04:52.319> webbing<00:04:52.729> once<00:04:53.729> you<00:04:54.000> cut<00:04:54.300> an<00:04:54.449> X<00:04:54.690> you're

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
fusible webbing once you cut an X you're

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.909 
fusible webbing once you cut an X you're
gonna<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.979> let<00:04:56.129> me<00:04:56.220> show<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:56.400> here<00:04:57.919> you're

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
going to glue the fusible webbing to the

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.270 
going to glue the fusible webbing to the
inside<00:05:03.449> body<00:05:03.780> of<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.229> Hat<00:05:04.440> this<00:05:04.949> is<00:05:05.159> the
