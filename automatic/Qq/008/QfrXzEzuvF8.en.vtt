00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.440 
end actually in front of us and then
we're<00:01:32.460> also<00:01:32.549> seeing<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> concrete<00:01:33.270> being

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
we're also seeing the concrete being

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.090 
we're also seeing the concrete being
poured<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.020> those<00:01:34.140> support<00:01:34.590> beams<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
poured on all those support beams that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.350 
poured on all those support beams that
have<00:01:35.220> been<00:01:35.310> being<00:01:35.549> worked<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.880> now<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.240> nine

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
have been being worked on now for nine

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
have been being worked on now for nine
months<00:01:36.509> right<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.259> below<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> concourse

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
months right down below on the concourse

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.969 
months right down below on the concourse
i'm<00:01:38.880> sure<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.479> images<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.470> concourse

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
i'm sure we have images of the concourse

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.679 
i'm sure we have images of the concourse
opening<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.060> could<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> pretty<00:01:42.600> good

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
opening up so we could get a pretty good

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.740 
opening up so we could get a pretty good
feel<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.320> how<00:01:43.770> wide<00:01:44.310> wide<00:01:44.850> open<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
feel for how wide wide open it is and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.130 
feel for how wide wide open it is and
the<00:01:45.960> angular<00:01:46.549> bowl<00:01:47.549> columns<00:01:48.119> are<00:01:48.780> being

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the angular bowl columns are being

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.630 
the angular bowl columns are being
encased<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.710> concrete<00:01:49.890> that's<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.430> fire

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
encased in concrete that's a fire

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.850 
encased in concrete that's a fire
protection<00:01:50.820> measure<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.689> take<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.140> it's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
protection measure that we take and it's

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.859 
protection measure that we take and it's
looking<00:01:52.979> good<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.360> angle

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
looking good and you can see the angle

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.209 
looking good and you can see the angle
of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.049> building<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.619> lean<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
of the building and the lean of the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.319 
of the building and the lean of the
building<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.700> starting<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> take<00:01:57.270> shape

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
building really starting to take shape

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.929 
building really starting to take shape
now<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.680> mock-up<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.670> in

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
now you do have a mock-up going in in

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.520 
now you do have a mock-up going in in
the<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.479> end<00:02:00.689> zone<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the one end zone that is that is the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.020 
the one end zone that is that is the
mock-up<00:02:01.799> area<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.100> saw<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.280> concrete<00:02:02.670> mock<00:02:02.820> up

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
mock-up area we saw the concrete mock up

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999 
mock-up area we saw the concrete mock up
a<00:02:03.180> couple<00:02:03.630> months<00:02:03.750> ago<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.229> right<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:04.530> you're

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
a couple months ago and right now you're

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.170 
a couple months ago and right now you're
doing<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> mock<00:02:05.399> up<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.640> actually<00:02:05.939> what<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
doing a mock up of actually what the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.910 
doing a mock up of actually what the
west<00:02:06.450> side<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.259> structure<00:02:07.619> will<00:02:07.829> look

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
west side of the structure will look

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160 
west side of the structure will look
like<00:02:08.099> right<00:02:08.550> half<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.360> west<00:02:09.599> side<00:02:09.690> will<00:02:10.050> be

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
like right half of the west side will be

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.930 
like right half of the west side will be
all<00:02:10.379> glass<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.920> other<00:02:11.039> half<00:02:11.280> will<00:02:11.489> be<00:02:11.520> metal

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
all glass the other half will be metal

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.790 
all glass the other half will be metal
panel<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:13.170> want<00:02:13.440> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
panel so we want to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.310 
panel so we want to
simulate<00:02:14.520> if<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.760> will<00:02:14.940> what<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.050> metal

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
simulate if you will what the the metal

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.830 
simulate if you will what the the metal
panel<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.800> look<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.280> color<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
panel will look like in color and in and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.560 
panel will look like in color and in and
Bend<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.010> an<00:02:20.160> angle<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:21.030> how<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.270> reacts

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
Bend and an angle and see how it reacts

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.600 
Bend and an angle and see how it reacts
to<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> sunlight<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.470> make<00:02:23.010> sure<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.580> it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
to the sunlight and make sure we have it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.120 
to the sunlight and make sure we have it
all<00:02:23.820> right<00:02:24.000> for<00:02:24.330> our<00:02:24.360> our<00:02:25.320> designer<00:02:25.710> building

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
all right for our our designer building

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.490 
all right for our our designer building
I<00:02:26.310> was<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> reality<00:02:27.240> right<00:02:27.480> now<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
I was the reality right now that the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.870 
I was the reality right now that the
September<00:02:29.010> weather<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.340> cooler<00:02:29.670> than

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
September weather a little cooler than

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.220 
September weather a little cooler than
what<00:02:29.970> we're<00:02:30.090> used<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:30.480> today<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.960> this<00:02:31.080> is

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
what we're used to in today that this is

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.780 
what we're used to in today that this is
almost<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.980> perfect<00:02:32.220> weather<00:02:32.640> for

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
almost the perfect weather for

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.880 
almost the perfect weather for
everything<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.660> going<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.020> it's<00:02:34.680> great

we've<00:02:35.400> been<00:02:35.550> blessed<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.000> weather<00:02:36.180> hasn't

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
we've been blessed the weather hasn't

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.120 
we've been blessed the weather hasn't
been<00:02:36.690> too<00:02:36.840> wet<00:02:37.020> hasn't<00:02:37.440> been<00:02:37.560> too<00:02:37.710> hot<00:02:37.920> and
