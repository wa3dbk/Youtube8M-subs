pointers and this should help everybody
out<00:00:45.130> for<00:00:45.550> measuring<00:00:45.910> at<00:00:46.030> home<00:00:46.239> for<00:00:47.050> your

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
out for measuring at home for your

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.180 
out for measuring at home for your
harness<00:00:47.440> this<00:00:48.430> is<00:00:48.610> hazel<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.890> first

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
harness this is hazel and the first

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.220 
harness this is hazel and the first
thing<00:00:54.460> that<00:00:54.489> we<00:00:54.730> start<00:00:55.120> with<00:00:55.360> is<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:56.079> neck

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
thing that we start with is the neck

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.110 
thing that we start with is the neck
measurement<00:00:56.469> neck<00:00:57.430> measurement<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:58.030> very

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
measurement neck measurement is very

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.910 
measurement neck measurement is very
important<00:00:58.750> in<00:00:58.840> a<00:00:58.930> harness<00:00:59.290> because<00:00:59.469> it<00:00:59.739> bits

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
important in a harness because it bits

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.870 
important in a harness because it bits
off<00:01:00.130> its<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:02.829> it's<00:01:02.980> too<00:01:03.280> large<00:01:03.520> it's<00:01:04.439> create

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
off its if it's too large it's create

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.609 
off its if it's too large it's create
the<00:01:06.880> whole<00:01:07.090> fit<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:07.539> the<00:01:07.659> harness<00:01:07.869> changes

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
the whole fit of the harness changes

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.730 
the whole fit of the harness changes
because<00:01:09.609> then<00:01:09.789> it's<00:01:09.939> lower<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:11.530> can

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
because then it's lower and it can

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.419 
because then it's lower and it can
create<00:01:11.889> rub<00:01:12.399> on<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.819> armpits<00:01:13.829> and<00:01:14.829> so<00:01:15.369> you

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
create rub on the armpits and so you

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.279 
create rub on the armpits and so you
really<00:01:15.909> want<00:01:16.209> to<00:01:16.299> take<00:01:16.509> good<00:01:16.780> care<00:01:17.049> when

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
really want to take good care when

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.349 
really want to take good care when
you're<00:01:17.439> measuring<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.889> neck<00:01:18.189> of<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.399> dog<00:01:18.639> now

breastbone<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:08.520> above<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.550> breastbone<00:02:10.119> its

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
breastbone and above that breastbone its

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.810 
breastbone and above that breastbone its
soft<00:02:11.020> just<00:02:11.560> like<00:02:11.710> if<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.070> were<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.280> press<00:02:12.520> on

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
soft just like if you were to press on

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.820 
soft just like if you were to press on
your<00:02:13.300> own<00:02:13.420> collar<00:02:13.750> bone<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.200> press<00:02:14.410> above<00:02:14.560> it

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
your own collar bone and press above it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.050 
your own collar bone and press above it
into<00:02:15.070> your<00:02:15.220> throat

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
into your throat

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.730 
into your throat
and<00:02:16.420> when<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.660> press<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:17.050> your<00:02:17.140> throat<00:02:17.410> it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and when you press on your throat it

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.500 
and when you press on your throat it
doesn't<00:02:17.800> feel<00:02:18.280> very<00:02:18.580> good<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:18.910> what<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.300> want

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
doesn't feel very good so what you want

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.240 
doesn't feel very good so what you want
to<00:02:19.600> do<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.020> want<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.290> make<00:02:20.410> sure<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:21.069> that

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
to do is you want to make sure that that

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.000 
to do is you want to make sure that that
harness<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.910> fitting<00:02:22.890> against<00:02:23.890> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
harness is fitting against the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.490 
harness is fitting against the
breastbone<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.880> what<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:26.230> find

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
breastbone so what you do is you find

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.470 
breastbone so what you do is you find
that<00:02:26.709> triangular<00:02:27.130> bone<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.760> then<00:02:27.940> about<00:02:28.150> one

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
that triangular bone and then about one

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.320 
that triangular bone and then about one
thumbprint<00:02:29.170> onto<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.160> where<00:02:30.520> my<00:02:30.850> measuring

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
thumbprint onto it is where my measuring

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.300 
thumbprint onto it is where my measuring
point<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:31.780> going<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.050> be<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.890> I've<00:02:33.100> already

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
point is going to be so I've already

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.580 
point is going to be so I've already
found<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.940> top<00:02:34.150> here<00:02:34.480> I'm<00:02:34.690> going<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.140> draw

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
found the top here I'm going to draw

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.990 
found the top here I'm going to draw
that<00:02:36.010> down<00:02:36.940> along<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.230> going<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:39.000> give

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
that down along and it's going to give

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.090 
that down along and it's going to give
me<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.120> baby<00:02:40.239> try<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:40.959> have<00:02:41.080> your<00:02:41.260> your<00:02:41.860> dog

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
me a baby try and have your your dog

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.949 
me a baby try and have your your dog
look<00:02:42.340> forward<00:02:42.790> you're<00:02:43.390> gonna<00:02:43.450> find<00:02:43.780> that

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
look forward you're gonna find that

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.449 
look forward you're gonna find that
again<00:02:44.230> draw<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.100> down<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.730> pull<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.120> tight

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
again draw it down and pull it tight

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.440 
again draw it down and pull it tight
another<00:02:48.459> important<00:02:48.970> thing<00:02:49.150> when<00:02:49.300> you're

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
another important thing when you're

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.090 
another important thing when you're
measuring<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.440> make<00:02:50.590> sure<00:02:50.620> your<00:02:50.920> dog<00:02:51.070> is

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
measuring is to make sure your dog is

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.360 
measuring is to make sure your dog is
standing<00:02:52.350> if<00:02:53.350> they're<00:02:53.590> sitting<00:02:53.980> for<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.220> neck

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
standing if they're sitting for the neck

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.729 
standing if they're sitting for the neck
measurement<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:55.209> would<00:02:55.600> work<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.019> standing

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
measurement that would work but standing

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:05.840 
measurement that would work but standing
is<00:02:56.890> ideal<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:58.180> again<00:02:58.450> just<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.810> show<00:02:58.900> you

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.380 

shoulder<00:03:06.850> blades<00:03:08.700> making<00:03:09.700> sure<00:03:09.880> it's<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.209> her

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
shoulder blades making sure it's on her

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.110 
shoulder blades making sure it's on her
breast<00:03:10.690> plate<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:12.280> measures<00:03:12.790> out<00:03:12.970> of

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
breast plate and that measures out of

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.050 
breast plate and that measures out of
ten<00:03:13.390> what<00:03:14.350> I'm<00:03:14.500> not<00:03:14.709> gonna<00:03:15.069> do<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.640> I'm<00:03:15.850> not

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
ten what I'm not gonna do is I'm not

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.790 
ten what I'm not gonna do is I'm not
gonna<00:03:16.300> take<00:03:16.660> this<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.170> draw<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.410> all<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> way

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
gonna take this and draw it all the way

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.400 
gonna take this and draw it all the way
up<00:03:17.830> around<00:03:18.269> look<00:03:19.269> where<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.569> sits<00:03:19.900> it's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
up around look where it sits it's

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.410 
up around look where it sits it's
sitting<00:03:20.769> on<00:03:20.860> her<00:03:21.070> neck<00:03:21.280> it's<00:03:22.090> really

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
sitting on her neck it's really

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.380 
sitting on her neck it's really
difficult<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.930> take<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.260> circumference<00:03:23.860> of

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
difficult to take the circumference of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.080 
difficult to take the circumference of
of<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.750> fit<00:03:26.049> because<00:03:26.320> if<00:03:27.070> you<00:03:27.670> look<00:03:27.850> at<00:03:28.000> the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
of this fit because if you look at the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.210 
of this fit because if you look at the
shape<00:03:28.329> of<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.600> harness<00:03:28.870> opening<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.650> comes<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.190> a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
shape of a harness opening it comes to a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.270 
shape of a harness opening it comes to a
V<00:03:30.549> it's<00:03:30.970> not<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.239> ground<00:03:31.690> circle<00:03:32.500> really<00:03:32.680> so

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
V it's not a ground circle really so

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.470 
V it's not a ground circle really so
what<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.579> want<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.790> do<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.120> want<00:03:34.299> to<00:03:34.329> make

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
what you want to do is you want to make

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.060 
what you want to do is you want to make
sure<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.720> get<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.049> tangle<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.680> where<00:03:35.890> the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
sure you get that tangle of where the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.789 
sure you get that tangle of where the
harness<00:03:36.340> is<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.620> next<00:03:41.980> really<00:03:42.220> important

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
harness is the next really important

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.440 
harness is the next really important
measurement<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:45.040> going<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:45.910> be<00:03:46.030> from<00:03:46.269> that

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
measurement is going to be from that

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.780 
measurement is going to be from that
exact<00:03:46.870> same<00:03:47.200> spot<00:03:47.560> up<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.340> front<00:03:48.609> of<00:03:48.700> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
exact same spot up in front of the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.270 
exact same spot up in front of the
shoulder<00:03:49.120> plates<00:03:50.130> back<00:03:51.130> down<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:53.890> her<00:03:54.100> last

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
shoulder plates back down to her last

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.990 
shoulder plates back down to her last
rib<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.650> right<00:03:56.890> where<00:03:57.070> she<00:03:57.280> tucks<00:03:57.549> up<00:03:57.730> in<00:03:57.880> her

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
rib so right where she tucks up in her

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.630 
rib so right where she tucks up in her
tummy<00:03:58.299> here<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:59.079> can<00:03:59.260> see<00:03:59.470> her<00:03:59.980> chest<00:04:00.310> comes

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
tummy here you can see her chest comes

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.460 
tummy here you can see her chest comes
and<00:04:00.850> she<00:04:01.000> starts<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.480> tuck<00:04:01.690> up<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.109> it's<00:04:02.230> funny

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and she starts to tuck up and it's funny

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.280 
and she starts to tuck up and it's funny
because<00:04:02.560> their<00:04:02.980> fur<00:04:03.310> actually<00:04:04.060> shows<00:04:05.019> you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
because their fur actually shows you

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.009 
because their fur actually shows you
quite<00:04:05.859> often<00:04:06.070> as<00:04:06.430> well<00:04:06.459> this<00:04:07.450> is<00:04:07.660> where<00:04:07.870> the

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
quite often as well this is where the

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.110 
quite often as well this is where the
harness<00:04:08.470> will<00:04:08.709> say

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
harness will say

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.600 
harness will say
right<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.959> here<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:10.890> want<00:04:11.099> to<00:04:11.190> draw<00:04:11.550> the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
right to here so you want to draw the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.440 
right to here so you want to draw the
new<00:04:11.970> angle<00:04:12.480> right<00:04:12.930> back<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.890> for<00:04:14.640> her<00:04:14.819> I<00:04:15.090> would

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
new angle right back and for her I would

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.390 
new angle right back and for her I would
say<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.989> she's<00:04:16.230> about<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.590> 13<00:04:20.630> then<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:23.040> next

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
when I'm when I'm making a custom-made

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.070 
when I'm when I'm making a custom-made
harness<00:04:29.100> these<00:04:29.750> measurements<00:04:30.750> are<00:04:30.810> really

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
harness these measurements are really

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.969 
harness these measurements are really
important<00:04:31.560> for<00:04:31.710> me<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.949> know<00:04:32.070> about<00:04:32.220> your<00:04:32.460> dog

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
at the withers or just in front of these

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.000 
at the withers or just in front of these
shoulder<00:04:37.650> blades

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
shoulder blades

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.340 
shoulder blades
I'm<00:04:38.370> gonna<00:04:38.610> draw<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.000> straight<00:04:39.720> down<00:04:40.080> her

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
I'm gonna draw that straight down her

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.930 
I'm gonna draw that straight down her
spine<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:42.780> where<00:04:42.990> her<00:04:43.860> tail<00:04:44.160> leaves<00:04:44.490> her<00:04:44.669> body

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
spine to where her tail leaves her body

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.409 
spine to where her tail leaves her body
the<00:04:45.360> base<00:04:45.919> right<00:04:46.919> there<00:04:46.979> she's<00:04:47.610> about<00:04:47.790> a<00:04:47.850> 21<00:04:48.389> or

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
the base right there she's about a 21 or

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:54.320 
the base right there she's about a 21 or
21<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.229> half<00:04:50.600> so<00:04:51.600> those<00:04:52.200> points<00:04:52.770> again<00:04:53.330> when

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
21 and a half so those points again when

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.820 
21 and a half so those points again when
you're<00:04:54.510> finding<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.110> shoulder<00:04:55.440> blades<00:04:55.650> and

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
you're finding the shoulder blades and

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.740 
you're finding the shoulder blades and
you're<00:04:55.979> finding<00:04:56.580> jut<00:04:56.910> that<00:04:57.090> spot<00:04:57.389> right<00:04:57.570> in

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
you're finding jut that spot right in

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.010 
you're finding jut that spot right in
front<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:59.220> is<00:04:59.610> showing<00:05:00.090> right<00:05:00.570> where<00:05:00.840> this

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
front that is showing right where this

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.170 
front that is showing right where this
harness<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:01.560> gonna<00:05:01.770> sit<00:05:02.130> that's<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.760> point

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
harness is gonna sit that's that point

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.450 
harness is gonna sit that's that point
and<00:05:03.510> when<00:05:04.139> you're<00:05:04.289> drawing<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.860> tape<00:05:05.100> down

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:46.839 
going to let me know right where this
harness<00:06:42.289> needs<00:06:42.559> to<00:06:42.889> stop<00:06:44.379> and<00:06:45.379> as<00:06:45.649> I<00:06:45.829> said<00:06:45.889> when

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
harness needs to stop and as I said when

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.089 
harness needs to stop and as I said when
you<00:06:46.969> get<00:06:47.149> your<00:06:47.329> harness<00:06:47.719> you<00:06:47.989> can<00:06:48.169> look<00:06:48.289> at<00:06:48.499> how

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
you get your harness you can look at how

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:50.949 
you get your harness you can look at how
a<00:06:49.129> harness<00:06:49.459> should<00:06:49.759> fit<00:06:49.999> video<00:06:50.329> and<00:06:50.629> it'll

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:50.959 
a harness should fit video and it'll

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:55.089 
a harness should fit video and it'll
show<00:06:51.289> you<00:06:51.349> exactly<00:06:53.199> where<00:06:54.199> the<00:06:54.709> webbing

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
show you exactly where the webbing

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.600 
show you exactly where the webbing
should<00:06:55.579> stop<00:06:55.939> at<00:06:56.269> the<00:06:56.629> base<00:06:56.990> of<00:06:57.019> the<00:06:57.319> tail<00:06:57.610> and

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
should stop at the base of the tail and

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.759 
should stop at the base of the tail and
so<00:06:58.939> that's<00:06:59.240> why<00:06:59.479> we<00:06:59.689> need<00:06:59.899> those<00:07:00.110> measurements

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:00.769 
so that's why we need those measurements

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:03.999 
so that's why we need those measurements
they<00:07:00.919> really<00:07:01.339> do<00:07:02.409> accommodate<00:07:03.409> us<00:07:03.589> in<00:07:03.889> the

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:04.009 
they really do accommodate us in the

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:05.980 
they really do accommodate us in the
attachment<00:07:04.639> points<00:07:05.029> and<00:07:05.089> the<00:07:05.240> actual<00:07:05.599> fit<00:07:05.869> of

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
attachment points and the actual fit of

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.769 
attachment points and the actual fit of
the<00:07:06.050> harness<00:07:06.339> so<00:07:07.339> with<00:07:07.699> those<00:07:07.849> few<00:07:08.240> those

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:08.779 
the harness so with those few those

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:10.600 
the harness so with those few those
three<00:07:09.199> measuring<00:07:09.740> points<00:07:10.159> are<00:07:10.309> the<00:07:10.429> most

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610 
three measuring points are the most

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.229 
three measuring points are the most
important<00:07:11.329> in<00:07:11.990> finding<00:07:12.740> a<00:07:12.949> real<00:07:13.429> good<00:07:13.699> fit<00:07:14.029> in

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:14.239 
important in finding a real good fit in

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:16.179 
important in finding a real good fit in
a<00:07:14.329> full<00:07:14.599> length<00:07:14.839> or<00:07:15.139> either<00:07:15.289> regular<00:07:15.559> X<00:07:15.949> back

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:16.189 
a full length or either regular X back

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:18.669 
a full length or either regular X back
or<00:07:16.459> Collard<00:07:17.029> style<00:07:17.389> harness<00:07:17.779> for<00:07:18.319> your<00:07:18.379> dog

hopefully a perfect fitting harness in

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:27.040 
hopefully a perfect fitting harness in
the<00:07:23.929> end<00:07:24.110> and<00:07:24.800> if<00:07:25.759> you<00:07:26.029> go<00:07:26.209> to<00:07:26.269> measure<00:07:26.569> and

the end and if you go to measure and
your<00:07:27.289> dog<00:07:27.469> just<00:07:27.499> won't<00:07:28.129> sit<00:07:28.429> still<00:07:28.459> if<00:07:28.939> you've

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:29.089 
your dog just won't sit still if you've

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:30.850 
your dog just won't sit still if you've
got<00:07:29.300> a<00:07:29.329> young<00:07:29.659> dog<00:07:29.989> that<00:07:30.439> just<00:07:30.679> isn't

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
got a young dog that just isn't

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.699 
got a young dog that just isn't
cooperating<00:07:31.159> or<00:07:31.909> you're<00:07:32.389> you<00:07:32.749> got<00:07:33.079> questions

cooperating or you're you got questions
