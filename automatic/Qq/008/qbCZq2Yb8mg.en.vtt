these tricks I would say the main one to

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.280 
these tricks I would say the main one to
work<00:00:44.980> on<00:00:45.190> as<00:00:45.850> far<00:00:46.120> as<00:00:46.300> this<00:00:46.480> is<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.840> front<00:00:47.020> shuv

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.930 
work on as far as this is the front shuv
it's<00:00:47.559> kind<00:00:47.739> of<00:00:47.800> hard<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.070> say<00:00:48.309> that<00:00:48.550> though<00:00:48.730> and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
it's kind of hard to say that though and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.819 
it's kind of hard to say that though and
only<00:00:49.300> saying<00:00:49.540> you<00:00:49.660> do<00:00:49.809> one<00:00:50.079> of<00:00:50.110> each<00:00:50.500> of<00:00:50.710> the

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
only saying you do one of each of the

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.030 
only saying you do one of each of the
tricks<00:00:51.160> but<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.059> more<00:00:52.300> you<00:00:52.570> do<00:00:52.899> them<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:53.380> just

tricks but the more you do them I just

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.590

know im a im an incredible singer so you
see<00:01:45.969> that<00:01:46.359> flick<00:01:46.630> of<00:01:46.810> your<00:01:46.899> front<00:01:47.139> foot<00:01:47.259> that's

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
see that flick of your front foot that's

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.959 
see that flick of your front foot that's
a<00:01:47.709> good<00:01:47.859> practice<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.459> that<00:01:48.639> you're<00:01:48.759> doing

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
a good practice that that you're doing

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.059 
a good practice that that you're doing
but<00:01:49.419> then<00:01:49.599> when<00:01:49.779> you<00:01:49.810> actually<00:01:50.079> try<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.709> trick

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
but then when you actually try the trick

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.949 
but then when you actually try the trick
you<00:01:51.310> don't<00:01:51.549> do<00:01:51.819> that<00:01:51.849> practice<00:01:52.479> step<00:01:52.659> at<00:01:52.810> all

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
you don't do that practice step at all

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:54.959 
you don't do that practice step at all
so<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.770> point<00:01:53.919> of<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.189> practice<00:01:54.579> steps<00:01:54.789> are

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
so the point of the practice steps are

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.999 
so the point of the practice steps are
that<00:01:55.119> they're<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.509> little<00:01:55.749> breakdown<00:01:56.439> pieces

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
that they're the little breakdown pieces

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.809 
that they're the little breakdown pieces
of<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.310> full<00:01:57.579> trick<00:01:57.969> put<00:01:58.239> together<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.789> what<00:02:00.789> I

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
of the full trick put together so what I

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.760 
of the full trick put together so what I
want<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.209> to<00:02:01.389> do<00:02:01.539> is<00:02:01.779> that<00:02:01.989> practice<00:02:02.469> step<00:02:02.649> I

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
want you to do is that practice step I

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.609 
want you to do is that practice step I
gave<00:02:03.009> you<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.399> actually<00:02:04.299> stepping<00:02:04.689> off<00:02:05.079> with

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
gave you of actually stepping off with

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.440 
gave you of actually stepping off with
your<00:02:05.859> back<00:02:06.099> foot<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.609> leaving<00:02:06.999> your<00:02:07.029> front

stepping<00:03:24.759> off<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:25.209> your<00:03:25.329> back<00:03:25.540> foot<00:03:25.810> you

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
stepping off with your back foot you

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.960 
stepping off with your back foot you
could<00:03:26.379> still<00:03:26.769> get<00:03:27.069> into<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.489> motion<00:03:27.879> of

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
could still get into the motion of

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.210 
could still get into the motion of
flicking<00:03:28.299> down<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.079> then<00:03:29.650> bringing<00:03:29.949> your

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
flicking down and then bringing your

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.039 
flicking down and then bringing your
front<00:03:30.459> foot<00:03:30.519> back<00:03:30.939> above<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.509> board<00:03:31.780> and

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
front foot back above the board and

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.830 
front foot back above the board and
landing<00:03:32.349> on<00:03:32.439> the<00:03:32.560> board<00:03:32.859> with<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.579> top<00:03:33.909> lining

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
landing on the board with the top lining

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.319 
landing on the board with the top lining
on<00:03:34.930> top<00:03:35.109> of<00:03:35.199> the<00:03:35.259> board<00:03:35.439> with<00:03:35.620> your<00:03:35.859> front<00:03:36.129> foot

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
on top of the board with your front foot

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.849 
on top of the board with your front foot
because<00:03:37.329> your<00:03:37.810> back<00:03:37.989> foot<00:03:38.259> is<00:03:38.379> on<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.530> ground

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
because your back foot is on the ground

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.819 
because your back foot is on the ground
but<00:03:39.819> with<00:03:40.359> that<00:03:40.540> said<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:40.900> means<00:03:41.379> you<00:03:41.530> have

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
but with that said that means you have

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.699 
but with that said that means you have
to<00:03:41.859> know<00:03:42.370> how<00:03:42.729> to<00:03:43.150> flick<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.750> proper<00:03:44.229> kickflip

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
to know how to flick a proper kickflip

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.909 
to know how to flick a proper kickflip
so<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.579> have<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.269> know<00:03:46.479> that<00:03:46.989> these<00:03:47.530> are<00:03:47.739> just

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
so you have to know that these are just

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.369 
so you have to know that these are just
the<00:03:48.040> motions<00:03:48.699> to<00:03:48.879> go<00:03:49.030> through<00:03:49.329> so<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:50.109> let's

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
the motions to go through so just let's

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.409 
the motions to go through so just let's
watch<00:03:50.949> my<00:03:51.220> feet<00:03:51.459> closely<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.090> break<00:03:52.269> this

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
watch my feet closely and break this

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.439 
watch my feet closely and break this
down<00:03:52.599> very<00:03:52.900> carefully<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:54.250> my<00:03:54.489> toe<00:03:54.549> drags<00:03:55.180> up

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
down very carefully so my toe drags up

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.809 
down very carefully so my toe drags up
and<00:03:55.720> then<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.930> ankle<00:03:56.319> pops<00:03:56.650> up<00:03:57.009> right<00:03:57.340> at<00:03:57.669> the

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
and then the ankle pops up right at the

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.270 
and then the ankle pops up right at the
edge<00:03:58.030> like<00:03:58.659> right<00:03:58.959> up<00:03:59.139> towards<00:03:59.379> the<00:03:59.590> nose<00:03:59.829> and

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
edge like right up towards the nose and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.309 
edge like right up towards the nose and
the<00:04:00.310> direction<00:04:01.060> of<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.419> flick<00:04:01.689> is<00:04:01.840> up<00:04:02.019> towards

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
the direction of the flick is up towards

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.580 
the direction of the flick is up towards
the<00:04:02.409> nose<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.549> here<00:04:03.819> let's<00:04:04.060> watch<00:04:04.150> this<00:04:04.509> my<00:04:05.169> toe

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
the nose so here let's watch this my toe

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.030 
the nose so here let's watch this my toe
drags<00:04:06.099> up<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.939> then<00:04:07.449> right<00:04:08.079> there<00:04:08.319> my<00:04:08.530> ankle

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
drags up and then right there my ankle

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.029 
drags up and then right there my ankle
goes<00:04:09.250> up<00:04:09.549> similar<00:04:10.509> to<00:04:10.810> an<00:04:10.930> ollie<00:04:11.199> but<00:04:11.799> in<00:04:11.919> the

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:12.039 
goes up similar to an ollie but in the

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.770 
goes up similar to an ollie but in the
ollie<00:04:12.219> you're<00:04:12.519> not<00:04:12.669> you<00:04:12.939> don't<00:04:12.969> have<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.359> flick

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
ollie you're not you don't have a flick

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.170 
ollie you're not you don't have a flick
your<00:04:13.930> ankle<00:04:14.259> doesn't<00:04:14.409> pop<00:04:14.859> up<00:04:15.129> like<00:04:15.549> right<00:04:16.030> at

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
your ankle doesn't pop up like right at

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.420 
your ankle doesn't pop up like right at
the<00:04:16.299> edge<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:16.930> it's<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.829> very<00:04:17.979> important

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
the edge and it's a very important

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.430 
the edge and it's a very important
timing<00:04:18.880> thing<00:04:19.120> but<00:04:19.539> this<00:04:19.719> part<00:04:19.989> right<00:04:20.049> here<00:04:20.169> in

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
timing thing but this part right here in

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.290 
timing thing but this part right here in
terms<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.799> dragging<00:04:21.190> your<00:04:21.280> toe<00:04:21.519> that's<00:04:22.000> very

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300

similar<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.810> an<00:04:22.900> ollie<00:04:23.169> it's<00:04:23.860> just<00:04:24.039> a

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
similar to an ollie it's just a

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.980 
similar to an ollie it's just a
different<00:04:24.370> part<00:04:24.729> of<00:04:24.820> your<00:04:24.880> shoe<00:04:25.270> it's<00:04:25.570> just<00:04:25.750> on

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
right there the rest of the trick is

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
right there the rest of the trick is
just<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:39.680> easy<00:04:40.460> there's<00:04:41.360> nothing<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.290> it<00:04:42.500> your

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
just so easy there's nothing to it your

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.250 
just so easy there's nothing to it your
back<00:04:43.400> foot<00:04:43.730> you<00:04:44.120> just<00:04:44.360> bend<00:04:44.630> your<00:04:44.840> knee<00:04:44.990> and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
then if your front foot flick is good

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.800 
then if your front foot flick is good
your<00:04:48.410> actual<00:04:49.370> flick<00:04:49.880> is<00:04:50.060> going<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.390> send<00:04:50.630> the
