00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.230
 is a low carb diet with a lot of endurance 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.240
 arrange sports 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.400
 that is in my case every other day 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.140
 two to three hours of intense 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
 endurance training and when the summer is here 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.410
 every day is two hours with one 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.070
 Of course, a pallet truck a week would like 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.689
 I also do not have to lose the crowd 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.070
 I can not help you for the sake of it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.940
 answer why because you do not write 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 if you continue to do weight training 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:40.040
 so obmann muscle mass gets or not 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.879
 is a question of adequate 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.950
 protein and intensive training 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:51.899
 with weights that preserve the muscle 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.260
 provoked or maintaining the muscle 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.610
 Do these two things if you can 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.219
 weight in training will not do 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.469
 losing muscle mass is a low 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.320
 Carb diet compatible with a lot of sports 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.820
 yes, I already believe the performance 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.369
 could possibly be a bit at the beginning 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.900
 suffer if you but has for doing so 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.520
 not somehow skin him with four grams 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.939
 proteins something but really easy 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.860
 makes 80 grams of calf moderate 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.000
 protein and and a lot of fat then it can 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.180
 be good because endurance sports 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.180
 actually very fat burning effect 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.030
 Oxidative that one is, so to speak, the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.890
 not so that's not the way they talk too 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.329
 Performance Saxony is also now 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.729
 hours or there are many 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.610
 Endurance athletes who like to be low 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.320
 working carb but is just a 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.579
 getting used to and is also by man 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.290
 to human different so I am 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.899
 actually already with carp 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.250
 meanwhile, I too would have been me 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.299
 but I could also do a low carb 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.680
 I am a human who can become you 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.520
 but find out for yourself quite honestly 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.570
 I'm reading nothing 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.799
 Weight training and when I'm out of nothing 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.820
 of strength training then read 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.360
 musculature go on it 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.219
 quite simply if nevertheless strength training 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.840
 then I see no problem at all 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.100
 to do it with a lot of astra 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.540
 he agrees both from the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.390
 Performance here you will be thanked 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.530
 but usually needs to 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.960
 you really watch that performance 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.190
 does not break in both 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.990
 there sports as well as strength training and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.020
 from the muscle mass he has the low carb 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.880
 nothing to do but it is the 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.070
 free is a white supply the height 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.600
 the calorie deficit and whether you 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.590
 continue to train weights that are 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.130
 the three factors the muscle mass 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.130
 receive
