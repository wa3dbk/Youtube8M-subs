00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.460
 hello today many a review on this 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.680
 commutes 3 x 3 x 3 this one was from 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.390
 Witten produces that is actually 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.500
 even a normal weather you 2 x 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.690
 2 that's completely the same thing only 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.530
 is the special feature that he is here 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.930
 a transparent plexiglas has that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.570
 one sees this inner life 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.579
 inner life is exactly the same 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.219
 and here you can see clearly now that 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.579
 normal 3 x 3 is and he has here 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.660
 Known a center known and same 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.579
 Corner edge corner so is a three times 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.879
 Three only that's what this inner knew 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.350
 here that was abolished so that one 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 who can not see anymore and you only have 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.470
 even the corner extends the beautiful 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.340
 this one will really have outside 1 2 x 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.260
 2 there is nothing different 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.420
 the only difference is that you have one 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.369
 this sexy glass does not have to solve 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.580
 That's why you do not have to go outside 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.390
 talent but has the inner 3 x 3 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.360
 to solve 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.580
 it makes you wonder how can you get a three 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.630
 solve three times if only twice 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.710
 There are two possibilities for movement 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.439
 interesting here is that this 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.740
 orange white blue corner not moving 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.600
 is just like the edged stones though 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.140
 I try this orange corner here 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.590
 both move from it 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.130
 level once the middle and once 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.810
 the outer slice is the same with it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:02.670
 these two are again two 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.430
 and the lower one is called this orange 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.039
 is blue corner is between these 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.649
 edged stone and can become 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.650
 then do not move away 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.189
 they would be with my in the solution 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.819
 hold back left and would then here 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.450
 ahead 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.989
 the front page the right side and 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.939
 the upper side solve this here behind 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.950
 all one would will not solve may 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.150
 You do not even move away no matter what you do 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.379
 try team just not 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.849
 This gives you the possibility that you 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.180
 the right side 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.609
 turn the front side upside down 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.370
 can and therefore can also be the front 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:46.459
 Loosen right and top 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.170
 that's why it's finished 3 x 3 x 3 because 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:54.230
 basically it is dissolved in it 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.940
 a not quite rotatable 3 x 3 but 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.909
 externally there is only a two by two 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.939
 and I think this makes the dice very much 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.629
 interesting looks especially visually 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:08.659
 very nice because you just like that 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.769
 It had never been there before 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.099
 but also a variation 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.500
 there is such a sticker on the outside 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.690
 on it the Jesus diagonal is that the 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.629
 works is gone where then again 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.459
 somehow money on it is in the beginning thinks 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.889
 you look okay when you get in there a 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.680
 has three times three and outside a two times 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.870
 two then the whole is a little bit 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.549
 harder because you are now in 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.500
 the three times three must solve and 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.290
 outside this sexy glass once the 2 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.440
 x 2 must solve this is unfortunately not so 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.500
 because I was told or that was me 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.750
 was explained which is perfectly clear 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.419
 that if I'm here in games ticker 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.299
 give draufmachen always in this 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:52.519
 corner stays that means you would be easy 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.870
 just intensify the color in it again 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.729
 and stick on the outside 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.530
 which makes no difference because 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:01.449
 This stone is yellow and we know that 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.790
 no matter how I would then turn 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:06.739
 It would always make sense to keep money here 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.599
 makes no difference and sees 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.440
 not quite as elegant as 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:15.620
 now here the normal 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.820
 Processing from the summit is pretty 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.169
 well what annoys me is just that 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.889
 or what luck I had now 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.120
 these 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.300
 white blue corner is here yes 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.340
 locked in 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.330
 that means that one can not say yes 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.979
 move out 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:38.849
 that's because of this blue-orange 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:42.180
 Known here has a well so that 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.319
 this center so that now, 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.389
 between these branches not 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.680
 can be turned out 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.189
 with me it was so good that the 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.479
 white corner is blocked in the stop 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:56.939
 my last level I have to solve money 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.699
 but there is also the possibility that 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:02.159
 For example, I 'll say this orange 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.050
 corner is clamped so is finished 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.569
 that you have to move then you would have to 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.120
 I'll solve this red level last 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.580
 and this would be a bit of the whole 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.339
 Of course, that does not make it difficult for the people 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.610
 the dice or three times 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:19.349
 three colors neutral call on youtube 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.939
 solve for the yard no problem me 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.279
 But I got a little bit on three times 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.800
 lessing accustomed to the freis 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:28.860
 harder he sings now 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.259
 luck that this was a white stone 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.310
 this white blue orange is the one here 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.120
 was trapped 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.650
 that I could solve money it could 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.629
 Of course it would be different but it would be 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.560
 a bit annoying 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:46.020
 and you can not change that because 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:51.479
 this orange blue pinched so 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.460
 stuck in there and if you have the 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.039
 would exchange with their others 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.199
 Stein would still have the color blue 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:01.319
 and orange but only another place 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.270
 mw wise here between red and blue the 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.699
 Of course , no sense at all 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.710
 that's why these stones have to be here 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.639
 stay and it really only ever gets 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.300
 a corner held 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:18.089
 otherwise the cube turns very much like 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.589
 So there you can now there you can 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:24.210
 really expect a lot because that 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:27.210
 is just the entrance in Leipzig and that 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.039
 are about the best two times 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.389
 two cubes that are so that will be 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.830
 recommended by most speedcubers 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.770
 Many say landon is pretty 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.180
 good or how 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:43.430
 but you can really say that 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:45.140
 the majority recommends this and asks 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.930
 that is also in whims from now 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:53.780
 he also turns out to be incredibly good 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:58.940
 good place koller cutting here once 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:02.120
 reverse so a bit of a normal 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.700
 koller katri fits even more than 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.480
 540 degrees is amazing so here is 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:11.320
 So, this Jesus is now approaching this column 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.090
 very much about it and I still can 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.750
 so horner kathi do without 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.160
 Problems here ends a bit though 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.340
 that's more than 540 degrees 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:27.410
 unbelievable turned out to be incredible 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:35.450
 fast and does not actually punch 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:36.940
 More looks so a great dice makes 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.650
 really fun to solve 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.419
 and he has a very different look and feel 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.850
 different solution path and is therefore of 

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:46.100
 very interesting to look at it 

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.080
 I hope you liked it again 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.700
 if you still have questions or comments 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.020
 then just write here or on 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.020
 my homepage a nice comment
