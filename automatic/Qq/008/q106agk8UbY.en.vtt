00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.940 

and<00:03:00.790> make<00:03:00.940> another<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.360> here

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.350 

and<00:03:09.459> my<00:03:10.180> waist<00:03:10.540> was<00:03:10.930> 27<00:03:11.920> inches<00:03:12.400> all<00:03:12.640> around<00:03:13.060> so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
and my waist was 27 inches all around so

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.479 
and my waist was 27 inches all around so
I<00:03:13.390> have<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.660> divide<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.319> in<00:03:14.709> half<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:16.200> it's

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
I have to divide that in half and it's

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:25.949 
I have to divide that in half and it's
13<00:03:18.489> inches<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.300> a<00:03:19.510> half<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.849> I<00:03:25.420> made<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> mark

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
13 inches and a half and I made a mark

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.930 
13 inches and a half and I made a mark
in<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.260> middle<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:27.100> it's<00:03:27.250> easier<00:03:29.550> so<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.580> just

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
in the middle so it's easier so you just

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:40.040 
in the middle so it's easier so you just
fold<00:03:31.239> it

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.980 

mark<00:03:40.680> here

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.380 

you<00:03:47.110> can<00:03:47.290> see<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.740> sort<00:03:48.070> we're<00:03:48.760> wasted<00:03:49.270> to

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
you can see the sort we're wasted to

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:59.640 
you can see the sort we're wasted to
Nepean<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:51.090> then<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:54.010> butt<00:03:54.280> area<00:03:58.290> mine<00:03:59.290> was

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
Nepean and then the butt area mine was

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.420 
Nepean and then the butt area mine was
37<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.250> divide<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:04.000> by<00:04:04.240> two<00:04:04.300> which<00:04:04.960> is<00:04:05.430> 17

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
37 so I divide that by two which is 17

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.140 
37 so I divide that by two which is 17
and<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.790> half<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.920> 17<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.610> a<00:04:09.670> half<00:04:09.700> is<00:04:09.970> going<00:04:10.090> to

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
and a half so 17 and a half is going to

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:22.350 
and a half so 17 and a half is going to
go<00:04:10.330> along<00:04:10.600> here<00:04:20.250> doing<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.430> line<00:04:21.670> straight

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
go along here doing a line straight

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.710 
go along here doing a line straight
across<00:04:22.750> from<00:04:23.500> our<00:04:24.330> waist<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.060> bottom<00:04:28.630> of

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
across from our waist to the bottom of

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.310 
across from our waist to the bottom of
the<00:04:28.840> dress<00:04:32.850> be<00:04:33.850> making<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.300> armhole<00:04:34.780> about<00:04:35.050> 10

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
the dress be making the armhole about 10

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.120 
the dress be making the armhole about 10
inches<00:04:35.560> on<00:04:36.010> each<00:04:36.160> side<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:40.200> after<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.680> just

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
inches on each side and after that just

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.230 
inches on each side and after that just
make<00:04:42.250> a<00:04:42.670> line<00:04:42.970> straight<00:04:43.630> across<00:04:44.020> from<00:04:44.680> the

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
make a line straight across from the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.080 
make a line straight across from the
waist<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.110> armhole<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:51.370> both<00:04:51.730> sides

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
waist to the armhole and so both sides

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.410 
waist to the armhole and so both sides
are<00:04:52.480> equal<00:04:53.110> we're<00:04:53.440> going<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.620> be<00:04:54.300> placing<00:04:55.300> it

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
are equal we're going to be placing it

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:11.060 
are equal we're going to be placing it
in<00:04:55.630> half<00:04:59.610> make<00:05:00.610> sure<00:05:00.820> you<00:05:00.940> pin<00:05:01.240> it<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:01.600> it<00:05:01.720> is<00:05:01.840> it

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.750 

cutting<00:05:12.070> it<00:05:12.250> now<00:05:12.720> I'm<00:05:13.720> going<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.050> be<00:05:14.200> adding

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
cutting it now I'm going to be adding

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.370 
cutting it now I'm going to be adding
maybe<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:15.940> book<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.360> fourth<00:05:16.660> of<00:05:16.780> an<00:05:16.930> inch<00:05:17.020> or<00:05:17.290> more

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
maybe a book a fourth of an inch or more

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:25.589 
maybe a book a fourth of an inch or more
just<00:05:17.680> in<00:05:17.830> case

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.980 

so<00:05:26.169> it<00:05:26.349> looks<00:05:26.589> once<00:05:27.099> I've<00:05:27.339> cut<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:27.849> sides<00:05:28.210> and
