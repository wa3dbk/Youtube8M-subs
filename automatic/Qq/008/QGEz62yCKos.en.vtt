got<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.160> take<00:00:14.250> care<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.109> double<00:00:16.109> check

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
got to take care of on that double check

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.740 
got to take care of on that double check
the<00:00:16.410> fenders<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:16.890> stuff<00:00:17.130> we'll<00:00:17.670> sand<00:00:18.539> this

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
the fenders and stuff we'll sand this

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.150 
the fenders and stuff we'll sand this
down<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.410> bit<00:00:19.740> make<00:00:19.949> sure<00:00:19.980> we

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
down just a little bit make sure we

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.849 
down just a little bit make sure we
don't<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.369> any<00:00:20.430> dents<00:00:20.880> hiding<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
don't have any dents hiding on that and

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.130 
don't have any dents hiding on that and
we<00:00:23.100> will<00:00:23.279> continue<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.180> our<00:00:24.449> lines<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
we will continue to get our lines a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.900 
we will continue to get our lines a
little<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.529> tighter<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.130> little<00:00:26.550> bit<00:00:26.640> tighter

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
little bit tighter a little bit tighter

00:00:26.910 --> 00:01:28.210 
little bit tighter a little bit tighter
and<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.390> little<00:00:27.720> bit<00:00:27.840> tighter

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:37.600 

a<00:01:33.190> real<00:01:34.190> typical<00:01:34.520> area<00:01:34.970> for<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.520> pieces<00:01:37.520> that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
a real typical area for the pieces that

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.700 
a real typical area for the pieces that
becomes<00:01:37.880> separated<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:39.200> clamp<00:01:39.500> them

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
becomes separated so just clamp them

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.780 
becomes separated so just clamp them
down<00:01:40.000> drill<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.030> couple<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.330> holes<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.790> clamp

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
down drill a couple of holes and clamp

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.730 
down drill a couple of holes and clamp
it<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:44.150> weld<00:01:44.360> up<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.600> holes<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.050> then<00:01:45.560> do

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
it and weld up the holes and then do

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.830 
it and weld up the holes and then do
this<00:01:45.890> whole<00:01:46.130> thing<00:01:46.160> here<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:47.690> won't

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
this whole thing here so that it won't

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.330 
this whole thing here so that it won't
come<00:01:47.960> apart<00:01:48.260> again

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
come apart again

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.120 
come apart again
also<00:01:50.060> you'll<00:01:50.270> see<00:01:50.360> me<00:01:50.890> shrinking<00:01:51.890> from<00:01:51.980> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
also you'll see me shrinking from the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.770 
also you'll see me shrinking from the
inside<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:53.060> can<00:01:53.600> get<00:01:53.840> some<00:01:54.140> sandpaper<00:01:54.860> of<00:01:55.220> this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
inside I can get some sandpaper of this

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.090 
inside I can get some sandpaper of this
and<00:01:58.300> do<00:01:59.300> this<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.720> find<00:01:59.960> my<00:02:00.200> high<00:02:00.470> spots<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.070> I

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
and do this to find my high spots and I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.670 
and do this to find my high spots and I
can<00:02:01.250> shrink<00:02:01.490> from<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.910> backside<00:02:02.390> too<00:02:02.750> while

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
can shrink from the backside too while

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.980 
can shrink from the backside too while
I'm<00:02:03.830> working<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.369> these<00:02:04.550> what<00:02:05.510> we're<00:02:05.690> doing

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
I'm working on these what we're doing

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.250 
I'm working on these what we're doing
over<00:02:06.110> here<00:02:06.260> is<00:02:07.330> we<00:02:08.330> want<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.869> know<00:02:09.020> where<00:02:09.229> our

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
over here is we want to know where our

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.590 
over here is we want to know where our
problems<00:02:10.070> are<00:02:10.399> before<00:02:10.910> we<00:02:11.150> take<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
problems are before we take it to the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.600 
problems are before we take it to the
sandblaster<00:02:11.990> not<00:02:12.470> after<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.430> we're<00:02:13.580> just

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
sandblaster not after so we're just

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.460 
sandblaster not after so we're just
standing<00:02:14.180> down<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.840> seeing<00:02:15.170> where<00:02:15.320> all<00:02:15.440> our

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
standing down and seeing where all our

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.710 
standing down and seeing where all our
low<00:02:15.770> spots<00:02:16.100> are<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.550> we'll<00:02:16.970> knock<00:02:17.209> all<00:02:17.450> those

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
low spots are and we'll knock all those

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.080 
low spots are and we'll knock all those
up<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.380> can<00:02:19.160> see<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:19.370> got<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.550> pretty<00:02:19.820> good

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
up you can see we got a pretty good

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:43.600 
up you can see we got a pretty good
wanker<00:02:20.810> over<00:02:21.140> there<00:02:21.380> so

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.790 

again<00:02:44.610> we<00:02:44.820> are<00:02:44.850> using<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.750> metal<00:02:46.110> discs<00:02:46.590> that

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
again we are using the metal discs that

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:56.770 
again we are using the metal discs that
we<00:02:46.950> get<00:02:47.190> from<00:02:47.430> Wolf's<00:02:48.000> metal<00:02:48.570> fabrication

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.480 

so<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.840> hit<00:02:57.990> this<00:02:58.140> disc<00:02:58.470> here<00:02:58.680> using<00:02:59.160> small

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
so we hit this disc here using small

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.550 
so we hit this disc here using small
discs<00:02:59.760> mainly

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
discs mainly

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.670 
discs mainly
let's<00:03:02.220> say<00:03:02.400> for<00:03:02.640> instance<00:03:03.030> we've<00:03:04.020> got<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> dent

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
let's say for instance we've got a dent

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.770 
let's say for instance we've got a dent
right<00:03:04.920> here

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.140 

so<00:03:08.350> if<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.560> take<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.920> disk<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.460> I<00:03:09.520> just<00:03:09.910> hit<00:03:10.120> it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
so if I take the disk and I just hit it

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.690 
so if I take the disk and I just hit it
on<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.810> high<00:03:10.990> spot<00:03:11.350> there<00:03:11.620> then<00:03:12.370> it's

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
on the the high spot there then it's

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.340 
on the the high spot there then it's
only<00:03:13.090> going<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.450> have<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.810> heat<00:03:13.990> at<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.200> high

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
only going to have the heat at the high

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.410 
only going to have the heat at the high
spot<00:03:14.710> it'll<00:03:15.310> wear<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.730> metals<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.120> little<00:03:16.300> bit

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
spot it'll wear the metals a little bit

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.890 
spot it'll wear the metals a little bit
thinner

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
thinner

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.740 
thinner
it'll<00:03:17.290> get<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.530> oh<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:18.430> maybe<00:03:18.550> too<00:03:18.880> hard<00:03:19.120> so

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
it'll get it oh but maybe too hard so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.990 
it'll get it oh but maybe too hard so
I'm<00:03:19.990> not<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.200> working<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:20.890> very<00:03:21.190> top<00:03:21.580> I'm

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
I'm not just working this very top I'm

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.410 
I'm not just working this very top I'm
working<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.810> entire<00:03:22.960> area<00:03:23.860> when<00:03:24.700> I've<00:03:24.850> got<00:03:25.120> my

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
working the entire area when I've got my

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.680 
working the entire area when I've got my
