to<00:01:34.650> score<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.490> top<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.970> Russell

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
to score and on top of that Russell

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.780 
to score and on top of that Russell
Westbrook<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.439> Kevin<00:01:37.500> Durant<00:01:37.829> are<00:01:38.189> not<00:01:38.460> great

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
Westbrook and Kevin Durant are not great

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.100 
Westbrook and Kevin Durant are not great
defenders<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.240> their<00:01:39.450> own<00:01:39.600> right<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:39.900> now

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
defenders in their own right but now

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.899 
defenders in their own right but now
with<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:40.979> against<00:01:41.250> Tony<00:01:41.430> Parker<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
with going up against Tony Parker and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.700 
with going up against Tony Parker and
Kawhi<00:01:42.150> Leonard<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.540> think<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.079> much<00:01:43.259> much

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
Kawhi Leonard I think that's a much much

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.990 
Kawhi Leonard I think that's a much much
bigger<00:01:43.770> mismatch<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> lot<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.909> people

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
bigger mismatch and a lot of people

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
bigger mismatch and a lot of people
thought<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.509> Parker<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.560> Leonard<00:01:46.979> are<00:01:47.040> both

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
thought and Parker and Leonard are both

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.429 
thought and Parker and Leonard are both
really<00:01:47.490> blowing<00:01:47.790> via<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.930> forcing

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
really blowing via and really forcing

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.499 
really blowing via and really forcing
Durant<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.340> Westbrook<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.939> work<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
Durant and Westbrook to work on the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.730 
Durant and Westbrook to work on the
defensive<00:01:51.960> end<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.200> think<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> could<00:01:52.619> be

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
defensive end I think it could be

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740 
defensive end I think it could be
limiting<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.490> Thunder<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.540> game

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
limiting the Thunder here in this game

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.630 
limiting the Thunder here in this game
but<00:01:54.899> either<00:01:55.079> way<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.250> both<00:01:56.430> teams

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
but either way I think that both teams

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249 
but either way I think that both teams
will<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:56.969> able<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> score<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> bunches

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
will be able to score in the bunches

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.590 
will be able to score in the bunches
during<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.649> entire<00:01:59.040> series<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.579> over<00:02:00.000> 210

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
during this entire series and over 210

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.789 
during this entire series and over 210
and<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.750> half<00:02:00.930> seems<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> pretty<00:02:01.590> good

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
and a half seems like a pretty good

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.130 
and a half seems like a pretty good
wager<00:02:02.040> heading<00:02:02.939> into<00:02:03.060> game<00:02:03.270> number<00:02:03.299> two<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
wager heading into game number two the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.539 
wager heading into game number two the
total<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.619> said<00:02:04.799> only<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.219> point<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
total like I said only about a point and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.800 
total like I said only about a point and
a<00:02:05.610> half<00:02:05.729> higher<00:02:05.939> than<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.329> got<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.600> game

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a half higher than what we got in game

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169 
a half higher than what we got in game

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
cashing seen all season as some of you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.940 
cashing seen all season as some of you
noticed<00:02:23.020> i<00:02:23.110> think<00:02:23.260> it's<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.410> another<00:02:23.740> good

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
noticed i think it's just another good

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.860 
noticed i think it's just another good
opportunity<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.640> take<00:02:24.820> me<00:02:24.970> over<00:02:25.120> once<00:02:25.750> again

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
opportunity to take me over once again

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.110 
opportunity to take me over once again
with<00:02:26.200> San<00:02:26.410> Antonio<00:02:26.830> Thunder<00:02:27.310> also<00:02:27.700> and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
with San Antonio Thunder also and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.270 
with San Antonio Thunder also and
although<00:02:28.510> they<00:02:28.660> had<00:02:28.960> not<00:02:29.110> been<00:02:29.290> great<00:02:29.650> coming

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
although they had not been great coming

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.890 
although they had not been great coming
off<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.670> loss<00:02:30.880> cashing<00:02:31.420> Lee<00:02:31.510> over<00:02:31.750> there

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
off of a loss cashing Lee over there

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.060 
off of a loss cashing Lee over there
actually<00:02:32.140> pretty<00:02:32.350> good<00:02:32.530> at<00:02:32.590> cashing<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
actually pretty good at cashing the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.860 
actually pretty good at cashing the
under<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.610> circumstance<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.630> are

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
under in that circumstance they are

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.020 
under in that circumstance they are
cashing<00:02:35.260> Lee<00:02:35.530> over<00:02:35.740> at<00:02:35.830> 11<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.310> 7<00:02:36.730> as<00:02:36.910> an

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
cashing Lee over at 11 and 7 as an

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.640 
cashing Lee over at 11 and 7 as an
underdog<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:37.690> season<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:38.500> there<00:02:38.620> is

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
underdog this season so I think there is

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.140 
underdog this season so I think there is
enough<00:02:38.740> value<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.490> enough<00:02:39.700> offensive

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
enough value and enough offensive

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.970 
enough value and enough offensive
mismatches<00:02:40.959> here<00:02:41.110> between<00:02:41.260> these<00:02:41.560> two<00:02:41.740> teams

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
mismatches here between these two teams

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.620 
mismatches here between these two teams
for<00:02:42.430> us<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.640> continue<00:02:42.790> betting<00:02:43.300> on<00:02:43.420> higher

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
for us to continue betting on higher

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.910 
for us to continue betting on higher
scoring<00:02:43.990> games<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.440> think<00:02:44.590> that's<00:02:44.709> where<00:02:44.800> we

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
scoring games I think that's where we

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.230 
scoring games I think that's where we
need<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.100> go<00:02:45.160> in<00:02:45.340> game<00:02:45.459> number<00:02:45.610> two<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.060> add

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
need to go in game number two so add

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.240 
need to go in game number two so add
over<00:02:46.570> 210<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.380> half<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.620> your<00:02:47.709> NBA<00:02:47.830> picks

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
over 210 and a half to your NBA picks

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.620 
over 210 and a half to your NBA picks
best<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.820> luck<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.120> on<00:02:49.240> that<00:02:49.300> one<00:02:49.540> if

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
best of luck to you on that one if

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.670 
best of luck to you on that one if
there's<00:02:49.780> still<00:02:49.959> time<00:02:50.140> make<00:02:50.320> sure<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.500> check

there's still time make sure you check

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.960 
there's still time make sure you check
