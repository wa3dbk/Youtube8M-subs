00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
I'm going to go over every muscle group

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.109 
I'm going to go over every muscle group
and<00:00:24.830> make<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> video<00:00:26.220> like<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.699> where<00:00:27.090> I

give you three quick tips that you can
start<00:00:29.429> implementing<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.449> order<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.619> better

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
start implementing in order to better

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.830 
start implementing in order to better
train<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.880> muscle<00:00:33.360> group

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
train that muscle group

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.590 
train that muscle group
alright<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.739> recently<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> did<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.090> chest

alright

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.490 
alright
so<00:00:48.960> tip<00:00:49.530> number<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:50.239> for<00:00:51.239> better<00:00:51.989> shoulder

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
so tip number one for better shoulder

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.910 
so tip number one for better shoulder
training<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:53.690> strengthen<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.110> weakest<00:00:55.530> link

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
training is strengthen the weakest link

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.450 
training is strengthen the weakest link
and<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:57.059> lot<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.270> people<00:00:57.690> may<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.829> assume<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and a lot of people may just assume that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
and a lot of people may just assume that
it<00:00:59.609> might<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> delt<00:01:01.050> heads<00:01:01.350> when

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it might be one of the delt heads when

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.570 
it might be one of the delt heads when
in<00:01:01.739> fact<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.910> actually<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:05.159> more

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
in fact it's actually not it is more

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.770 
in fact it's actually not it is more
than<00:01:05.760> likely<00:01:06.170> your<00:01:07.170> rotator<00:01:08.100> cuffs<00:01:08.780> alright

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
than likely your rotator cuffs alright

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.340 
than likely your rotator cuffs alright
so<00:01:10.140> what<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> would<00:01:10.710> recommend<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.930> one

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so what I would recommend is to do one

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.750 
so what I would recommend is to do one
of<00:01:13.650> two<00:01:14.100> things

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
of two things

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.719 
of two things
alright<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.840> either<00:01:16.080> number<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.580> very

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
alright so either number one at the very

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.660 
alright so either number one at the very
least<00:01:18.380> before<00:01:19.380> starting<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.220> direct

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
least before starting your direct

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.320 
least before starting your direct
shoulder<00:01:21.210> training<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:22.320> some<00:01:22.619> kind<00:01:22.979> of

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
shoulder training do some kind of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.080 
shoulder training do some kind of
mobility<00:01:24.330> work<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.860> work<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.340> warm<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
mobility work and work to warm up and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.620 
mobility work and work to warm up and
strengthen<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.619> rotator<00:01:29.520> cuffs<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.210> example

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
strengthen the rotator cuffs for example

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.679 
strengthen the rotator cuffs for example
maybe<00:01:31.200> traffic<00:01:31.860> lights<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> plate<00:01:33.360> or

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
maybe traffic lights with a plate or

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.170 
maybe traffic lights with a plate or
with<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> cable<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.520> things<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.060> are

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
with a cable you know things that are

with a cable you know things that are
going<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.570> train<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.680> rotator<00:01:38.130> cuff

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
going to train the rotator cuff

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.830 
going to train the rotator cuff
strengthen<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.170> warm<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.570> the

it is but that's a great exercise to
really<00:02:17.160> strengthen<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.390> rotator<00:02:18.840> cuffs<00:02:19.200> and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
really strengthen the rotator cuffs and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.670 
really strengthen the rotator cuffs and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
alright tip number two hit the mid delts

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.630 
alright tip number two hit the mid delts
all<00:02:45.000> right<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.410> other<00:02:46.470> day<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.769> was<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.190> gym

all right the other day I was at the gym
and<00:02:47.959> when<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.019> trained<00:02:49.350> heavy<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.769> tend<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.340> take

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
and when I trained heavy I tend to take

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.590 
and when I trained heavy I tend to take
long<00:02:51.750> rest<00:02:52.230> periods<00:02:52.800> in<00:02:52.980> between<00:02:53.040> my<00:02:53.970> sets<00:02:54.360> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
long rest periods in between my sets and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.860 
long rest periods in between my sets and
I'll<00:02:54.690> kind<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.019> sometimes<00:02:55.459> people<00:02:56.459> watch

I noticed that all his shoulder
exercises<00:03:07.799> or<00:03:08.310> some<00:03:08.790> kind<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.239> press<00:03:09.570> whether

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
exercises or some kind of press whether

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.580 
exercises or some kind of press whether
it<00:03:10.049> be<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.350> dumbbells<00:03:10.890> with<00:03:12.470> with<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
it be with dumbbells with with the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.670 
it be with dumbbells with with the
barbell<00:03:14.070> behind<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.180> neck<00:03:15.420> everything<00:03:16.110> was

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
barbell behind the neck everything was

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.640 
barbell behind the neck everything was
pressing<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:18.000> right<00:03:18.329> maybe<00:03:18.660> he<00:03:18.900> did<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.530> know

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
pressing all right maybe he did you know

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.009 
pressing all right maybe he did you know
some<00:03:19.980> rear<00:03:20.489> delt<00:03:20.850> work<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.600> was<00:03:21.750> pretty

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
some rear delt work but that was pretty

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.069 
some rear delt work but that was pretty
much<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.320> all<00:03:23.280> right<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.730> think<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.630> lot

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
much it all right and I think that a lot

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.880 
much it all right and I think that a lot
of<00:03:25.109> people<00:03:25.739> have<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:26.340> understanding<00:03:27.890> or

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
of people have this understanding or

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.460 
of people have this understanding or
lack<00:03:29.370> thereof<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:32.239> shoulders<00:03:33.440> or<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
lack thereof that the shoulders or the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.170 
lack thereof that the shoulders or the
mid<00:03:34.980> delts<00:03:35.459> are<00:03:35.640> trained<00:03:36.799> all<00:03:37.799> around<00:03:38.310> when

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
mid delts are trained all around when

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.880 
mid delts are trained all around when
you're<00:03:39.359> pressing<00:03:39.660> which<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.200> just<00:03:40.500> not<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
you're pressing which is just not the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.449 
you're pressing which is just not the
case<00:03:40.920> remember<00:03:42.049> there's<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.109> front<00:03:43.440> delt<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.980> mid

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
case remember there's a front delt a mid

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.090 
case remember there's a front delt a mid
delt<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:45.090> rear<00:03:45.299> delt<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:46.170> front<00:03:46.500> delt<00:03:46.739> is

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
delt and a rear delt the front delt is

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.009 
delt and a rear delt the front delt is
main<00:03:47.340> responsibility<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.359> function<00:03:48.870> is

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
main responsibility and function is

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.500 
main responsibility and function is
shoulder<00:03:49.739> flexion<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.790> whenever<00:03:51.180> we're

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
shoulder flexion so whenever we're

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.750 
shoulder flexion so whenever we're
flexing<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.170> shoulder<00:03:52.680> were<00:03:53.160> actually

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
flexing the shoulder were actually

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.420 
flexing the shoulder were actually
putting<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.420> significant<00:03:55.290> load<00:03:55.620> on<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.130> front

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
putting a significant load on the front

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.300 
putting a significant load on the front
delt<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.880> really<00:03:57.660> no<00:03:57.870> load<00:03:58.230> on<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.769> mid<00:03:59.010> or

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
delt and really no load on the mid or

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.930 
delt and really no load on the mid or
the<00:03:59.519> rear<00:03:59.760> delt<00:04:00.120> all<00:04:00.840> right<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.859> start

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
the rear delt all right so start

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.309 
the rear delt all right so start
training<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.150> mid<00:04:03.420> Dell

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
training the mid Dell

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.229 
training the mid Dell
not<00:04:04.530> only<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.069> biggest<00:04:05.580> part<00:04:05.879> of<00:04:05.970> your

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
not only is it the biggest part of your

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.050 
not only is it the biggest part of your
delts<00:04:07.170> but<00:04:07.799> it's<00:04:07.920> going<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.250> also<00:04:08.430> be<00:04:08.610> most

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
delts but it's going to also be most

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.440 
delts but it's going to also be most
responsible<00:04:09.870> for<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.200> 3d<00:04:11.010> effect<00:04:11.450> mainly

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
responsible for that 3d effect mainly

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.869 
responsible for that 3d effect mainly
because<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.560> front<00:04:13.829> delt<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.400> rear<00:04:14.579> delt

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
because the front delt and the rear delt

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.330 
because the front delt and the rear delt
are<00:04:15.120> already<00:04:15.420> kind<00:04:15.689> of<00:04:15.780> getting<00:04:16.109> hit<00:04:16.320> but<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
are already kind of getting hit but the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.870 
are already kind of getting hit but the
mid<00:04:17.549> Dell<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.000> lot<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.419> time<00:04:18.690> going

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
mid Dell is a lot of the time going

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.390 
mid Dell is a lot of the time going
untouched<00:04:21.440> unstimulated<00:04:22.440> or<00:04:22.620> if<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.250> do

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
untouched unstimulated or if you do

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.010 
untouched unstimulated or if you do
train<00:04:23.699> it<00:04:23.850> you<00:04:23.880> don't<00:04:24.120> train<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.510> as<00:04:24.600> much<00:04:24.810> as

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
train it you don't train it as much as

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.990 
train it you don't train it as much as
your<00:04:25.139> front<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.620> back<00:04:25.800> all<00:04:26.430> right<00:04:26.729> which

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
your front and back all right which

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.260 
your front and back all right which
brings<00:04:27.449> me<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.870> point<00:04:28.080> number<00:04:28.229> three<00:04:29.270> balanced

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
brings me to point number three balanced

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.810 
brings me to point number three balanced
training<00:04:30.960> all<00:04:31.560> right<00:04:31.919> just<00:04:32.280> like<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.669> guy<00:04:32.789> I

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.629 
training all right just like the guy I
mentioned<00:04:33.510> what's<00:04:34.139> happening<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:34.889> when<00:04:35.520> he's

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
mentioned what's happening is when he's

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.770 
mentioned what's happening is when he's
doing<00:04:35.940> his<00:04:36.060> chest<00:04:36.530> pressing<00:04:37.850> he's<00:04:38.850> involving

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
doing his chest pressing he's involving

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.830 
doing his chest pressing he's involving
a<00:04:39.960> lot<00:04:40.229> of<00:04:40.530> front<00:04:40.949> delt<00:04:41.250> all<00:04:42.150> right<00:04:42.389> so<00:04:42.630> when<00:04:42.780> he

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
a lot of front delt all right so when he

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.570 
a lot of front delt all right so when he
goes<00:04:43.050> over<00:04:43.199> and<00:04:43.440> do<00:04:43.530> his<00:04:43.650> shoulder<00:04:44.130> training

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
goes over and do his shoulder training

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.960 
goes over and do his shoulder training
again<00:04:45.270> when<00:04:45.870> he's<00:04:45.990> pressing<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.680> lot<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.639> front

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
again when he's pressing a lot of front

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.409 
again when he's pressing a lot of front
delt<00:04:48.270> when<00:04:48.810> he's<00:04:48.930> training<00:04:49.320> his<00:04:49.410> back

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
delt when he's training his back

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.060 
delt when he's training his back
retracting<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.510> scapula<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.320> lot<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:52.860> rear

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
retracting the scapula a lot of rear

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.029 
retracting the scapula a lot of rear
delt<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.580> then<00:04:53.699> on<00:04:53.910> his<00:04:54.210> shoulder<00:04:55.169> day<00:04:55.380> he's

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
delt and then on his shoulder day he's

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.770 
delt and then on his shoulder day he's
doing<00:04:56.370> whatever<00:04:56.820> he's<00:04:57.030> doing<00:04:57.210> for<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.600> rear

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
doing whatever he's doing for the rear

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.700 
doing whatever he's doing for the rear
delts<00:04:58.169> again<00:04:59.100> more<00:04:59.639> rear<00:04:59.910> delt<00:05:00.330> work<00:05:00.630> but<00:05:01.440> as

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
delts again more rear delt work but as

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.439 
delts again more rear delt work but as
you<00:05:02.010> can<00:05:02.190> see<00:05:02.660> there<00:05:03.660> is<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.650> lot<00:05:05.340> of

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
you can see there is a lot of

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.390 
you can see there is a lot of
stimulation<00:05:06.449> on<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.690> front<00:05:06.990> rear<00:05:07.260> delts<00:05:07.710> but

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
stimulation on the front rear delts but

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.200 
stimulation on the front rear delts but
very<00:05:08.699> little<00:05:09.210> if<00:05:09.449> any<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:11.130> mid<00:05:11.400> delt<00:05:11.699> so

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
very little if any to the mid delt so

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.890 
very little if any to the mid delt so
what<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.389> would<00:05:12.630> recommend<00:05:12.780> is<00:05:13.349> that<00:05:14.900> since

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
what I would recommend is that since

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.480 
what I would recommend is that since
you're<00:05:16.050> already<00:05:16.349> training<00:05:16.650> your<00:05:16.949> front<00:05:17.250> delt

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
you're already training your front delt

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.969 
you're already training your front delt
when<00:05:18.389> you're<00:05:18.539> doing<00:05:18.840> chest<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.710> you're

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
when you're doing chest and you're

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.279 
when you're doing chest and you're
already<00:05:20.280> training<00:05:20.699> your<00:05:21.150> front<00:05:21.479> delts<00:05:21.660> again

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
already training your front delts again

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.170 
already training your front delts again
when<00:05:23.010> you're<00:05:23.160> doing<00:05:23.460> shoulders<00:05:23.940> with

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
when you're doing shoulders with

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.820 
when you're doing shoulders with
overhead<00:05:24.750> presses<00:05:25.139> and<00:05:25.349> things<00:05:25.590> of<00:05:25.680> that

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
overhead presses and things of that

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.950 
overhead presses and things of that
nature<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:26.849> then<00:05:26.970> you're<00:05:27.120> already<00:05:27.599> training

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
nature and then you're already training

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.839 
nature and then you're already training
your<00:05:28.410> rear<00:05:28.650> delts<00:05:29.010> when<00:05:29.130> you're<00:05:29.250> doing<00:05:29.550> back

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
your rear delts when you're doing back

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.210 
your rear delts when you're doing back
and<00:05:30.380> again<00:05:31.380> you're<00:05:31.560> training<00:05:31.830> your<00:05:32.010> rear

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
and again you're training your rear

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.909 
and again you're training your rear
delts<00:05:32.580> when<00:05:33.180> you<00:05:33.479> are<00:05:33.690> isolating<00:05:34.470> them<00:05:34.620> during

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
delts when you are isolating them during

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.400 
delts when you are isolating them during
your<00:05:34.949> shoulder<00:05:35.430> training<00:05:35.900> well<00:05:36.900> then<00:05:37.289> it's

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
your shoulder training well then it's

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.580 
your shoulder training well then it's
only<00:05:37.620> fair<00:05:38.130> that<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:39.330> balance<00:05:39.630> everything<00:05:40.110> out

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
only fair that to balance everything out

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.150 
only fair that to balance everything out
that<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:42.150> mid<00:05:42.389> delts<00:05:42.750> gets<00:05:43.260> stimulated<00:05:43.620> twice

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
that the mid delts gets stimulated twice

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.800 
that the mid delts gets stimulated twice
a<00:05:44.539> week<00:05:45.539> as<00:05:45.750> well<00:05:46.340> right<00:05:47.340> so<00:05:47.580> not<00:05:48.180> only<00:05:48.510> should

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
a week as well right so not only should

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.520 
a week as well right so not only should
you<00:05:48.840> train<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:50.610> function<00:05:51.120> of<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.870> mid<00:05:52.139> delts

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
you train the function of the mid delts

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.560 
you train the function of the mid delts
on<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:53.099> days<00:05:53.310> where<00:05:53.610> you're<00:05:53.789> training<00:05:54.360> your

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
on the days where you're training your

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.540 
on the days where you're training your
shoulders<00:05:54.900> directly<00:05:55.440> but<00:05:55.949> you<00:05:56.010> should<00:05:56.310> also

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
shoulders directly but you should also

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.969 
shoulders directly but you should also
do<00:05:57.030> it<00:05:57.180> on<00:05:57.419> a<00:05:57.720> separate<00:05:58.199> day<00:05:58.320> maybe<00:05:58.590> on<00:05:58.830> your

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
do it on a separate day maybe on your

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.920 
do it on a separate day maybe on your
arm<00:05:59.190> day<00:05:59.430> you'll<00:05:59.639> throw<00:05:59.880> in<00:06:00.090> just<00:06:00.479> the<00:06:00.720> mid

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
arm day you'll throw in just the mid

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.140 
arm day you'll throw in just the mid
delts<00:06:01.260> or<00:06:01.409> maybe<00:06:01.590> some<00:06:02.430> mid<00:06:02.669> dealt<00:06:02.909> and<00:06:03.120> a

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
delts or maybe some mid dealt and a

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.909 
delts or maybe some mid dealt and a
little<00:06:03.449> bit<00:06:03.599> of<00:06:03.690> rear<00:06:03.870> delt<00:06:04.139> however<00:06:04.590> you<00:06:04.710> want

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
little bit of rear delt however you want

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.189 
little bit of rear delt however you want
to<00:06:05.010> do<00:06:05.130> it<00:06:05.280> just<00:06:05.310> make<00:06:05.760> sure<00:06:06.419> that<00:06:06.990> you're

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
to do it just make sure that you're

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.360 
to do it just make sure that you're
training<00:06:07.560> each<00:06:07.979> head<00:06:08.510> in<00:06:09.510> a<00:06:10.380> balanced<00:06:10.919> fashion
