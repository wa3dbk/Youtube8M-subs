or you want to you can but personally in
my<00:02:22.520> opinion<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.300> don't<00:02:23.330> think<00:02:23.750> it's<00:02:24.200> worth<00:02:24.410> it

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
my opinion I don't think it's worth it

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.890 
my opinion I don't think it's worth it
you<00:02:24.770> could<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.130> buy<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.700> body<00:02:26.180> shaper<00:02:26.720> for

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
you could just buy a body shaper for

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900 
you could just buy a body shaper for
maybe<00:02:27.140> twenty<00:02:27.590> dollars<00:02:27.980> maybe<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.280> Walmart<00:02:28.820> or

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
maybe twenty dollars maybe a Walmart or

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.030 
maybe twenty dollars maybe a Walmart or
something<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.930> think<00:02:30.170> that's<00:02:30.380> more<00:02:30.710> firm

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
something and I think that's more firm

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.160 
something and I think that's more firm
it<00:02:31.280> holds<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.700> firmer<00:02:32.030> okay<00:02:32.480> instead<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.990> this

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
it holds you firmer okay instead of this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.470 
it holds you firmer okay instead of this
this<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.340> really<00:02:34.700> kind<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.060> loose<00:02:35.240> it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
this this is really kind of loose it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.140 
this this is really kind of loose it
doesn't<00:02:35.840> really<00:02:35.960> do<00:02:36.620> what<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.010> says<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.910> my

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
doesn't really do what it says in my

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.340 
doesn't really do what it says in my
opinion<00:02:38.180> okay

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
opinion okay
