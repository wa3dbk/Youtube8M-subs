a week and a half after the live aquaria
order<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.100> i<00:01:17.970> never<00:01:18.180> made<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> video<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.229> but

order and i never made a video on it but
that's<00:01:20.100> what<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.580> think<00:01:20.790> got<00:01:21.180> us<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that's what we think got us it is the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980 
that's what we think got us it is the
angels<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:23.939> pretty<00:01:24.119> sure<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.659> coral

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
angels and I'm pretty sure the coral

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.080 
angels and I'm pretty sure the coral
beauty<00:01:25.350> angel<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> flame<00:01:26.430> angel<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
beauty angel we got a flame angel and a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.510 
beauty angel we got a flame angel and a
coral<00:01:27.600> beauty<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.290> day<00:01:28.470> along<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
coral beauty that one day along with the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.840 
coral beauty that one day along with the
two<00:01:29.729> Cronus's<00:01:30.390> which<00:01:31.290> really<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:32.430> should<00:01:32.670> have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
two Cronus's which really we should have

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.480 
two Cronus's which really we should have
waited<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.750> longer<00:01:34.110> after<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.310> live

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
waited a little longer after the live

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.219 
waited a little longer after the live
aquaria<00:01:36.000> order<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> live<00:01:36.869> equerry

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
aquaria order because the live equerry

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.260 
aquaria order because the live equerry
order<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.710> pretty<00:01:37.979> big<00:01:38.189> itself<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:39.119> if

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
order was pretty big itself like if

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.020 
order was pretty big itself like if
you've<00:01:39.450> seen<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.930> video<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you've seen that video and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.719 
you've seen that video and
so<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.110> think<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.680> went<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:44.010> little<00:01:44.190> too<00:01:44.310> quickly

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so I think we went a little too quickly

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.090 
so I think we went a little too quickly
and<00:01:45.180> we're<00:01:45.960> definitely<00:01:46.110> paying<00:01:46.650> for<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and we're definitely paying for that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.050 
and we're definitely paying for that
because<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:48.270> mean<00:01:48.770> it's<00:01:49.770> wiping<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.460> like

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
because I mean it's wiping out like

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.600 
because I mean it's wiping out like
everything<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.500> two<00:01:52.680> clowns<00:01:53.040> they're

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
everything but the two clowns they're

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.090 
everything but the two clowns they're
still<00:01:53.940> looking<00:01:54.090> good<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.960> guess<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> green

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
still looking good I guess the green

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.719 
still looking good I guess the green
chromis<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.759> doing<00:01:57.690> good<00:01:58.070> all<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.340> inverts

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
chromis is doing good all the inverts

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.050 
chromis is doing good all the inverts
are<00:01:59.940> all<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:02.310> yellow<00:02:02.490> tang<00:02:02.790> was

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
are all right and the yellow tang was

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.609 
are all right and the yellow tang was
really<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.540> looking<00:02:03.720> good<00:02:04.050> but<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> cold

starting to look a lot better but the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.610 
starting to look a lot better but the
things<00:02:23.100> we're<00:02:23.310> starting<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:24.030> did<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.930> get<00:02:25.230> try

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
to get rid of it can help it is we

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.270 
to get rid of it can help it is we
reduce<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.650> salinity<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:30.330> try<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.600> kill<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
reduce the salinity to try to kill the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.009 
reduce the salinity to try to kill the
ache<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:32.790> we've<00:02:33.000> also<00:02:33.269> been<00:02:33.600> feeding<00:02:33.870> a

garlic powder in the tank but the garlic

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.680 
garlic powder in the tank but the garlic
powder<00:02:49.590> we<00:02:49.799> put<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.310> food<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.880> course<00:02:51.329> not

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
powder we put on the food of course not

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.280 
powder we put on the food of course not
like<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> tank<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.810> you've<00:02:54.810> been<00:02:54.959> doing<00:02:55.200> a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
like in the tank and you've been doing a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.460 
like in the tank and you've been doing a
lot<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.470> water<00:02:55.769> changes<00:02:56.310> recently<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:57.320> I<00:02:58.320> mean

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
lot of water changes recently and I mean

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.050 
lot of water changes recently and I mean
we've<00:02:58.650> been<00:02:58.799> trying<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.130> do<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.850> natural

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
we've been trying to do it the natural

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.330 
we've been trying to do it the natural
way<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.810> not<00:03:01.200> like<00:03:01.620> put<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> bunch<00:03:02.190> of

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
way and not like put a bunch of

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.710 
way and not like put a bunch of
chemicals<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:02.910> there<00:03:03.060> because<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.510> would

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
chemicals in there because that would

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.259 
chemicals in there because that would
mess<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:04.680> all<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.010> inverts<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.850> everything

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
mess up all the inverts and everything

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.800 
mess up all the inverts and everything
like<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.380> mean<00:03:08.070> if<00:03:08.400> we<00:03:08.760> had<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> quarantine<00:03:09.480> tank

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
like I mean if we had a quarantine tank

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.660 
like I mean if we had a quarantine tank
I<00:03:09.989> guess<00:03:10.170> we<00:03:10.320> could<00:03:10.560> take<00:03:10.920> all<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.220> fish<00:03:11.430> out

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
I guess we could take all the fish out

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.900 
I guess we could take all the fish out
but<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.329> know

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
but you know

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.400 
but you know
have<00:03:13.270> that<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:15.360> there's<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.480> blood<00:03:16.810> drive<00:03:16.840> sent

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
have that so there's a blood drive sent

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:25.770 
have that so there's a blood drive sent
right<00:03:17.620> there<00:03:24.000> can't<00:03:25.000> really<00:03:25.210> see<00:03:25.540> him<00:03:25.660> but

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
right there can't really see him but

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.750 
right there can't really see him but
he's<00:03:25.900> back<00:03:26.140> there<00:03:26.380> he<00:03:26.560> doesn't<00:03:26.740> come<00:03:27.010> out<00:03:27.160> too

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
he's back there he doesn't come out too

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.120 
he's back there he doesn't come out too
much<00:03:27.970> they<00:03:28.960> actually<00:03:29.050> come<00:03:29.410> out<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.770> lot<00:03:29.920> more

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
much they actually come out a lot more

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.430 
much they actually come out a lot more
at<00:03:30.280> night<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.880> don't<00:03:31.660> know<00:03:31.750> why<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.960> pole<00:03:32.320> was

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
at night I don't know why the pole was

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.580 
at night I don't know why the pole was
messing<00:03:32.830> with<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.070> CERN<00:03:33.870> haven't<00:03:34.870> seen<00:03:35.470> him

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
messing with the CERN haven't seen him

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.510 
messing with the CERN haven't seen him
do<00:03:35.740> that<00:03:35.770> really

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.450 

so<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.120> mean<00:03:40.570> I'm<00:03:40.750> really<00:03:41.080> upset<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.830> all<00:03:42.280> this

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
left I think are going to be fine like

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.960 
left I think are going to be fine like
they<00:04:22.360> all<00:04:22.570> look<00:04:22.900> healthy<00:04:23.320> they're<00:04:23.500> all<00:04:23.620> eating
