00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.499 
of like a really light silvery grey and
I<00:01:20.560> have<00:01:20.770> noticed<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:21.310> either<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.240> black<00:01:22.479> or

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.020 
I have noticed that either the black or
the<00:01:22.780> blue<00:01:23.049> but<00:01:23.470> sorry<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.159> Wyatt<00:01:24.399> has<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.729> very

blue<00:01:25.330> tone<00:01:25.659> to<00:01:25.840> it<00:01:25.869> so<00:01:26.500> when<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:26.920> mix<00:01:27.070> these

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
blue tone to it so when you mix these

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.710 
blue tone to it so when you mix these
together<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.700> don't<00:01:27.909> end<00:01:28.090> up<00:01:28.180> with<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.390> true

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
is so good at doing stuff like this I

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.889 
is so good at doing stuff like this I
can't<00:01:48.490> stress<00:01:48.819> enough<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.630> it's<00:01:49.750> very

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
can't stress enough so it's very

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.450 
can't stress enough so it's very
important<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.500> steady<00:01:50.830> your<00:01:51.009> hand<00:01:51.190> when

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
you're doing something like this so I'm

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.059 
you're doing something like this so I'm
just<00:01:53.140> gonna<00:01:53.319> go<00:01:53.530> straight<00:01:53.799> ahead<00:01:55.950> start<00:01:56.950> from

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
just gonna go straight ahead start from

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.029 
just gonna go straight ahead start from
about<00:01:57.340> there<00:02:01.170> take<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.500> outer<00:02:02.649> edge<00:02:02.950> of

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
about there take it to the outer edge of

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.449 
about there take it to the outer edge of
my<00:02:03.130> eye<00:02:03.250> as<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:03.789> can<00:02:03.940> see<00:02:04.119> like<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:05.459> then

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
my eye as you can see like that then

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:11.190 
my eye as you can see like that then
pull<00:02:06.759> it<00:02:06.879> down<00:02:07.090> like<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.989> have<00:02:11.170> a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
pull it down like that so I have a

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.930 
pull it down like that so I have a
bottom<00:02:11.500> line<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:12.010> looks<00:02:12.190> like<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.550> now<00:02:12.819> I'm

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
bottom line that looks like this now I'm

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.940 
bottom line that looks like this now I'm
going<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.120> replicate<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.750> by<00:02:14.349> drawing<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
going to replicate that by drawing the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.610 
going to replicate that by drawing the
top<00:02:15.280> line<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:16.080> starting<00:02:17.080> from<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.470> behind

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
top line in starting from just behind

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.490 
top line in starting from just behind
the<00:02:18.720> upper<00:02:19.720> line<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:22.599> joining<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.379> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the upper line and joining it to the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.520 
the upper line and joining it to the
outer<00:02:23.709> edge<00:02:24.810> then<00:02:25.810> it's<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:26.050> case<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.260> just

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
outer edge then it's a case of just

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.880 
outer edge then it's a case of just
filling<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:28.319> once<00:02:29.319> you're<00:02:29.500> left<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:29.800> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
filling it in once you're left with the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.380 
filling it in once you're left with the
basic<00:02:30.250> shape<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.670> should<00:02:30.910> look<00:02:31.060> something

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
basic shape it should look something

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.540 
basic shape it should look something
like<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:32.170> now<00:02:32.800> I'm<00:02:32.950> going<00:02:33.129> to<00:02:33.220> take<00:02:33.400> my

to do that just some wild strokes I like

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.050 
to do that just some wild strokes I like
to<00:03:27.970> concentrate<00:03:28.270> it<00:03:28.570> more<00:03:28.750> at<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.960> front

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
to concentrate it more at the front

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.200 
to concentrate it more at the front
until<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.180> have<00:03:31.330> something<00:03:31.810> like<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:36.210> so

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
until you have something like that so

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.730 
until you have something like that so
this<00:03:37.360> is<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.630> finished<00:03:37.930> idea<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.710> just

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
this is the finished idea you just

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.410 
this is the finished idea you just
basically<00:03:39.070> get<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.400> little<00:03:39.670> bit<00:03:39.820> of<00:03:39.910> sense<00:03:40.150> of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
basically get a little bit of sense of

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.170 
basically get a little bit of sense of
like<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.320> sparking<00:03:41.980> lightness<00:03:42.550> at<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:42.940> front

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
like a sparking lightness at the front

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.000 
like a sparking lightness at the front
of<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.330> eyebrows<00:03:43.720> but<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.020> moves<00:03:44.290> around<00:03:44.560> as

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
of the eyebrows but it moves around as

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.310 
of the eyebrows but it moves around as
you<00:03:45.160> can<00:03:45.190> see<00:03:45.520> when<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.150> turn<00:03:46.840> your<00:03:46.960> head<00:03:47.140> and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
you can see when you turn your head and

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.840 
you can see when you turn your head and
things<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:48.010> this<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.310> basically<00:03:48.700> if

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
things like that so this is basically if

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.880 
things like that so this is basically if
anyone<00:03:49.210> who<00:03:49.360> wants<00:03:49.660> either<00:03:49.900> silver<00:03:50.440> eyebrows
