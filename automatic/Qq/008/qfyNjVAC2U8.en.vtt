unfortunately<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.460> did<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:23.640> heal<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> result

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
unfortunately it did not heal the result

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
unfortunately it did not heal the result
so<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.259> type<00:01:25.439> cerebrospinal<00:01:26.070> fluid

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
so you have to type cerebrospinal fluid

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.240 
so you have to type cerebrospinal fluid
in<00:01:26.969> order<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> cerebral<00:01:28.979> spinal
