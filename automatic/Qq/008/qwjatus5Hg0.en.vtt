00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
never design is a fascinating what is it

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.959 
never design is a fascinating what is it
a<00:00:30.539> science<00:00:31.019> or<00:00:31.260> well<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> science<00:00:32.669> it's

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
a science or well it is a science it's

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.930 
a science or well it is a science it's
it's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.390> very<00:00:33.420> new<00:00:33.780> science<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.520> it<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.820> look

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it's a very new science and it can look

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940 
it's a very new science and it can look
very<00:00:36.000> metaphysical<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.410> has<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> lot

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
very metaphysical because it has a lot

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.819 
very metaphysical because it has a lot
of<00:00:38.570> metaphysical<00:00:39.570> sciences<00:00:40.200> as<00:00:40.350> part<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.680> its

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
of metaphysical sciences as part of its

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.090 
of metaphysical sciences as part of its
makeup<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> end<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> day<00:00:43.100> it's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
makeup but at the end of the day it's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.560 
makeup but at the end of the day it's
something<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.700> people<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.149> experiment

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
something that people can experiment

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.869 
something that people can experiment
with<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.260> actually<00:00:46.469> use<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> science

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
with and actually use it like a science

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.400 
with and actually use it like a science
to<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.270> what<00:00:48.480> works<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.870> them<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.260> their

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
to see what works for them in their

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.680 
to see what works for them in their
lives<00:00:49.620> okay<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.879> made<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.449> what

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
lives okay now it's made up of what

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.209 
lives okay now it's made up of what

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
come earth did I say the HM yes quite a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.050 
come earth did I say the HM yes quite a
complete<00:01:04.229> complete<00:01:05.070> picture<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.939> a

philosophies and Sciences brought

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.240 
philosophies and Sciences brought
together<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.720> package<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.770> really

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
together in a package that's really

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.200

someone didn't understand about

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.570 
someone didn't understand about
astrology<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> Ching<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.259> whatever<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.159> they

astrology I Ching or whatever and they
just<00:01:23.759> want<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:25.220> capsulated<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
just want it like capsulated in like a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.319 
just want it like capsulated in like a
sentence<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.750> two<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.850> benefit

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
sentence or two of what is the benefit

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990 
sentence or two of what is the benefit
ok<00:01:31.229> well<00:01:31.409> that's<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:32.280> easy<00:01:32.520> because<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
ok well that's really easy because the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.760 
ok well that's really easy because the
benefit<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> there's<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.960> couple<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.320> things<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
benefit is there's a couple of things it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.410 
benefit is there's a couple of things it
it<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.640> call<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> science<00:01:36.360> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
it we call it a science of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.359 
it we call it a science of
differentiation<00:01:37.229> because<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.799> about<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
differentiation because it's about you

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.789 
differentiation because it's about you
really<00:01:38.759> understanding<00:01:39.479> who<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.380> are<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
really understanding who you are in a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
really understanding who you are in a
unique<00:01:41.130> way<00:01:41.189> how<00:01:41.610> you're<00:01:41.790> different<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
unique way how you're different to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.850 
unique way how you're different to
everybody<00:01:42.720> else<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.200> how<00:01:43.380> you're<00:01:43.530> designed

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
everybody else and how you're designed

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
everybody else and how you're designed
to<00:01:43.979> operate<00:01:44.250> differently<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.000> everybody<00:01:45.390> else

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
to operate differently to everybody else

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.020 
to operate differently to everybody else
as<00:01:45.899> well<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> gives<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.610> unique

as well as it gives you a very unique
way<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.720> understanding<00:01:49.200> how<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.680> make

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
way of understanding how you make

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.310
