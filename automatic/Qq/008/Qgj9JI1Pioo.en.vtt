00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 and what firemen says enough we have already 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.740
 crossed the line and we are not willing 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.370
 to consent that we continue working in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.000
 these courses yesterday a companion 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.160
 our got a call from the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.570
 national police and urging 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.789
 show up at police stations 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.350
 within two hours or what 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 the opposite has been put in search and 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.660
 captures the imputations that are presumed 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.640
 can be of insults and slander and is 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.540
 absolutely embarrassing that for that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 cause 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.469
 a partner has to go to testify to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.410
 police dependencies as now 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.629
 will explain the partner and more for 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.600
 some alleged statements in networks 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.510
 social issues the issue of the persecution of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.329
 that is being submitted to us has gone from 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 has risen and not only the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.410
 firefighters this we understand that already 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.420
 it is an absolute persecution of any 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.280
 citizen who at a certain time 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 raise your voice if you want to raze us 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.840
 They want to end the love we have 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.570
 the firefighters of the people want 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.000
 sell us as violent people as people 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.610
 undesirable and we're not going to spoil it 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.210
 neither with us nor with the rest of the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.470
 citizenship we have come to tell you everything 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 the world that with firemen are not going to be able 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.030
 enough we do not want to be followed 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.340
 chasing neither us nor any 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.160
 another citizen with laws of this type 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.550
 there was our defendant who was 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.310
 He phoned and accused by 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.400
 we could have official information 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.020
 by telephone and some alleged insults and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.340
 slander poured through some 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.360
 social networks and as he himself has said 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.070
 as Ruben has said it is true that it is not 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.810
 provided call to declare 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.740
 comisarÃ­a for some insults 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.229
 slander in social networks 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.479
 because if you do not comment with me 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 that would be imputed half Spain in 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.200
 this kind of situation is going to be for 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.330
 habitual cent is to send it to the court 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.340
 of instruction to proceed even 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.500
 a misdemeanor trial when 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.000
 social conflict situations all 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.040
 we know that firefighters are with the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.440
 village 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.540
 they are with people who suffer and they are 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.400
 demonstrating every day so 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.350
 go ahead the support of all the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.230
 municipal staff to the collective 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.120
 firefighters of the city council of madrid in 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.680
 second place has been talked about the last 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.810
 insults and we have heard rumors of 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.760
 that could be blaming him as 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.220
 insult to the accusation of fascist the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.290
 attitudes of certain members of the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.209
 police I want to say the following 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.000
 enter the security zone of a 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.159
 fire violate the security zone of 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.480
 a fire by the police is 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.400
 act against the law 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.080
 and immediately after having a fireman in 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.900
 act of service we understand that it is 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.019
 to go against the law to filter 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.879
 alleged police files that the 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.390
 police have to guard is 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:59.440
 act against the law 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.610
 threaten a firefighter with ordering a 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.780
 search and capture order that is only 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.850
 authority of the judicial authority is 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.150
 threaten and therefore is to violate the law 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.000
 and whoever violates the law can and should be 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.050
 considered a fascist 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.910
 not only those who are doing it but 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.740
 those who may be directing them and 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.870
 protecting them and if the delegate of 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.160
 government to which we have addressed 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.470
 by letter a few days ago not for this 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.390
 We understand that it is sheltering but 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.680
 directing and that is therefore 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.670
 acting within the framework of a state 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.200
 democratic with fascist attitudes not 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.660
 I'm insulting, I'm not a friend or 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.760
 insults or anything that is not peaceful 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.950
 I'm just arguing and 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.520
 saying that those attitudes can be 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.400
 perfectly qualified as contraries 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.620
 to the law and therefore defined as 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.330
 fascists is a problem that there is 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.540
 raise it to a political level it seems that 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.370
 politicians are bent on something in 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.560
 something for which we are not or for what 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.200
 we are we are for something else 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.450
 we are for help to 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.700
 citizen we are not for issues of 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.430
 security or public order and it 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.760
 They are pledging 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.310
 stubbornly saying in wanting to 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.930
 let's be what we 're never going to be 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.480
 we are going we are going to fold ourselves to intervene 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.600
 on issues of public disorder on issues of 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.370
 evictions we will not intervene 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.220
 absolutely because it is not 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.980
 our work our work is that of 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.169
 help assist in all 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.150
 help anxiety situations of 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.180
 danger of risk that the citizen has 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.639
 and it is to whom we owe we do not owe 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.830
 we owe it to the politicians to the citizen 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.130
 who is the one who pays us the day of 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.040
 arrest of the partner when he was 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.240
 paying a container we were 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.190
 next to the town hall firemen 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.570
 of madrid and how can it be otherwise 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.540
 way today we are also with the 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.610
 firefighters of madrid town hall 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.560
 we released a statement that you have 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.220
 seen you in the ones we talked about 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.020
 that we were not going to participate 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.900
 in interventions in which we had 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.540
 close to the special units of the 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.420
 riot police and this proves 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.730
 that you have to find a solution because 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.930
 If we continue with a harassment, we 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.720
 like the firemen of the town hall 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.130
 from madrid we also say enough is enough 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.740
 and because we are trying to use 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.830
 for everything because what they want us 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.660
 put yourself against citizenship 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.030
 we are official workers 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.830
 of public services we defend the 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.200
 public services and therefore not 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.580
 they are trying to make pay we defend 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.220
 the public services that we want to give 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.720
 good quality to the citizens and for 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.460
 that we do not want to participate in what we 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.710
 They are trying to force participation 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.500
 how are evictions like trying 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.150
 download a protester from a lamppost not 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.850
 let's participate in anything that is not 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.380
 an emergency first of all we are for 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.450

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.950
 citizens of madrid and the rest of the 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.080
 companions to the citizens of all the 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.780
 extreme do not ask for help because 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.760
 we have to send a message to the 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.200
 puppeteers of the delegation of 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.330
 government 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.880

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.849
