00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.320
 the 1222 cartridge is used for all 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.769
 balanced pressure mixers 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.990
 positive for tubs and pressure showers 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.420
 balanced means that after 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.880
 set the water temperature this is not 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.699
 will fall to more than two degrees in case of 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.279
 that the pressure varies and fits in only 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.169
 50b of a second lower the toilet 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.259
 turn on the washing machine or open the shower 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.360
 in the next room it does not matter with the 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.660
 Balanced pressure cartridge 1222 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.000
 there will be no more surprises in the shower and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.320
 like the moen 1222 cartridge is designed 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.440
 for all pressure valves 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.629
 balanced post-it in this case serves 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.390
 for a whole category of mixers 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.920
 for tubs and showers and the 12 22 is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 designed so that the waste of the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.120
 main pipeline pass during the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.489
 installation let's see in detail the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.670
 exclusive moen engineering and the solid 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.760
 wilaya card technology integrated into each 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.460
 1222 cartridge 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.460
 the body is made of polisur with a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.500
 High durability material is resistant 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.000
 Corrosion and does not suffer cracks 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.670
 contractions caused by 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.409
 changes in temperature on each side of the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.780
 body are rectangular seals 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.670
 rubber or separator gaskets and other 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.640
 packing on top for 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.890
 prevent leakage the rugged piston or 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.810
 stainless steel stem wilaya core 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.840
 is inside the body and surrounds 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.640
 the pressure compensating beam is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.110
 more phage has openings that allow 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.090
 that the water enters the lines of 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.649
 feed and compensates the pressure before 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.770
 of the emergence of water through the ports of 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.880
 out the hot water is up and the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.399
 cold water down 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.869
 the pressure compensating rocker is 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.270
 inside the stem of not moving 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.729
 freely so that the cold water and the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.409
 hot water flow according to demand if 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.950
 the ciat rocker now replace the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.159
 cartridge 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.990
 it is very easy to replace the 12 22 as in 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.340
 all plumbing project cutting the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.740
 water supply to the valve 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.300
 main and drain all the water from the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.000
 mixer 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.190
 then you can withdraw the way to and 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.640
 other parts of the mixer such as 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.080
 stop and adjustable temperature stop 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.020
 remove the fastener clip that keeps 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.730
 fixed to the cartridge put the tool 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.590
 placement on the cartridge stem 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.110
 and give an eighth of a turn with some 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.700
 pliers or other tool only until 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.319
 the seals of the valve body are 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.420
 break 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.920
 Now you can remove the cartridge and remove 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.680
 dust or debris from the valve 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.480
 with a cloth when you are ready to 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.730
 install the new cartridge check the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.760
 hot and cold indicators should 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.590
 point up to ensure that 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.150
 cartridge was well seated press 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.340
 on your shank with the tool 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.290
 placement of the repair fide when 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.730
 the locator notch is installed 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.879
 it must be down in position 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.829
 closed with the cartridge in position 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.330
 Install the clip fastener so that 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.400
 is fully inserted 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.220
 and replace the way to and other 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.780
 pieces of the mixer of course 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.330
 can be found with facilities 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.130
 Tim and shower head back to back is 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.900
 say two mixers on opposite sides 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.940
 of a wall can share the same 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.490
 supply of cold and hot water 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.380
 in these cases one side of the wall will have 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.200
 inverted the cold water positions and 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.110
 hot this is easily corrected 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.360
 remove the entire cartridge turn the 180 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.700
 degrees and re-insert it into the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.130
 valve the indicators of cold and 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.720
 hot should be down and notch 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.430
 locator must be up 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.930
 now the cold and hot keys 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.120
 they will work normally 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.700
 If you choose to repair instead of 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.470
 replace good send a kit 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.640
 repair both professionals and 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.190
 consumers that's part number 9 80 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.980
 40 and includes an instruction sheet 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.530
 a lubricant placement tool 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.870
 of silicon two separator gaskets a 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.200
 large packaging and four small ties 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.970
 it is very easy to repair the 12 22 after 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.890
 take out the cartridge pressures on the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.220
 Brass stem for removing and discarding 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.500
 the white body of old plastic 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.720
 remove the four small packages from the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.260
 shank and replace them with the gaskets 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.880
 new provided in the repair kit 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.380
 put some silicone lubricant 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.209
 in each package and the stem is 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.019
 will slide easily inside the body 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.019
 of plastic 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.330
 place the remaining large packing in the 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.010
 upper body apply a 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.080
 little silicone lubricant to 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.820
 interior of each new separator packaging 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.760
 that comes in your repair kit and 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.440
 place them on each side of the body 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.540
 align the cartridge as shown before 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.670
 with the indicators of cold and hot 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.860
 up and the locator notch 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.710
 down slide the cartridge in the 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.480
 valve keeping the alignment back 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.920
 to insert the bra and with what 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.820
 again the way 'the and the others 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.820
 parties of the mixer 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.819
 the repair kit 12 22 is for you 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.650
 and for consumers to solve 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.259
 any warranty incident that arises 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.330
 you can get it by calling 1 800 by 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.200
 mont or through your representative of 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.150
 moment sales 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.090
 whether you decide to replace it as 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.510
 repair it the 1222 cartridge facilitates it 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.510
 the task
