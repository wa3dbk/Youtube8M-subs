00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
well and my favorite part was not the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.310 
well and my favorite part was not the
Lich<00:03:23.070> throwback<00:03:24.070> but<00:03:24.430> was<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:25.120> new<00:03:25.870> frontier

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
Lich throwback but was the new frontier

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.020 
Lich throwback but was the new frontier
throwback<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:26.980> that's<00:03:27.160> an<00:03:27.310> episode<00:03:27.670> form<00:03:27.940> I

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
throwback and that's an episode form I

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.930 
throwback and that's an episode form I
think<00:03:28.060> season<00:03:28.989> four<00:03:29.260> three<00:03:29.769> Allen's<00:03:30.579> an<00:03:30.670> older

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
think season four three Allen's an older

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.080 
think season four three Allen's an older
one<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.299> in<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.440> one<00:03:32.620> pretty<00:03:32.920> much<00:03:33.090> it's

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
one but in that one pretty much it's

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.000
