some money and for a festival of this we

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.110 
some money and for a festival of this we
must<00:04:25.990> be<00:04:26.170> like<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.470> only<00:04:26.500> on<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.010> more<00:04:27.220> well

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.270 
must be like that only on the more well
maybe<00:04:28.330> even<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.750> more<00:04:28.900> risky<00:04:29.290> level<00:04:29.440> because

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
maybe even a more risky level because

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.680 
maybe even a more risky level because
you've<00:04:30.400> got<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.640> weather<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.210> deal<00:04:31.390> with<00:04:31.570> his

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690

you've got the weather to deal with his
work<00:04:31.900> I'll<00:04:32.200> just<00:04:32.440> go<00:04:32.680> inside<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.100> then<00:04:33.430> draw

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
work I'll just go inside and then draw

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.070 
work I'll just go inside and then draw
so<00:04:35.200> of<00:04:35.260> course<00:04:35.380> there<00:04:35.620> was<00:04:36.510> mega<00:04:37.510> triple<00:04:37.780> its

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
so of course there was mega triple its

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.170 
so of course there was mega triple its
originally<00:04:38.800> which<00:04:39.070> is<00:04:39.220> where<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.430> first<00:04:39.550> bumped

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
originally which is where I first bumped

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.700 
originally which is where I first bumped
into<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.660> then<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:40.990> became<00:04:41.230> parallel

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
into it then it became parallel

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.330 
into it then it became parallel

environment in in the in the country

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.740 
environment in in the in the country
environment<00:05:18.699> yeah<00:05:19.699> the<00:05:19.850> only<00:05:20.120> money<00:05:20.419> level

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
environment yeah the only money level

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.390 
environment yeah the only money level
this<00:05:20.900> not<00:05:21.139> that<00:05:21.169> masses<00:05:21.650> of<00:05:21.680> money<00:05:21.949> about<00:05:22.220> but

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
this not that masses of money about but

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.129 
this not that masses of money about but
sure<00:05:22.580> there's<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:22.820> lot<00:05:22.970> made<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.540> has<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.960> make

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
sure there's a lot made it has to make

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.740 
sure there's a lot made it has to make
money<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.560> think<00:05:25.400> there<00:05:25.580> was<00:05:25.610> last<00:05:26.270> year<00:05:26.540> there

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
money I think there was last year there

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.330 
money I think there was last year there
was<00:05:26.810> a<00:05:26.900> lot<00:05:27.020> of<00:05:27.050> unhappiness<00:05:27.500> about<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:28.040> yeah

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
was a lot of unhappiness about that yeah

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.640 
was a lot of unhappiness about that yeah
I<00:05:28.610> think<00:05:28.970> it's<00:05:29.120> probably<00:05:29.440> doing<00:05:30.440> quite<00:05:30.590> well

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
I think it's probably doing quite well

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.640 
I think it's probably doing quite well
now<00:05:31.010> I<00:05:31.419> just<00:05:32.419> want<00:05:32.810> people<00:05:32.930> to<00:05:33.050> get<00:05:33.199> on<00:05:33.350> it<00:05:33.500> to

now I just want people to get on it to

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.350 
now I just want people to get on it to
be<00:05:33.770> success<00:05:34.520> I<00:05:34.790> don't<00:05:35.090> know<00:05:35.150> how<00:05:35.330> you

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360

necessarily achieve that I think you had
a<00:05:37.160> good<00:05:37.340> admin<00:05:38.110> think<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:39.169> have<00:05:39.290> to<00:05:39.440> have<00:05:39.560> a

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
a good admin think you have to have a

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.040 
a good admin think you have to have a
team<00:05:39.860> where<00:05:40.100> people<00:05:40.520> as<00:05:40.639> she<00:05:40.820> talked<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:41.960> each
