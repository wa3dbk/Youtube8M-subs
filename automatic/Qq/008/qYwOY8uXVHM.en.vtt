00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.289
 it is already for the individual driver 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.690
 hard enough to find a place 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:11.130
 in today's busy traffic 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.200
 it becomes even more difficult when you are with 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.610
 move a group 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.610
 with the army they do no different 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.669
 in the previous episode we saw that we 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.380
 many different ones at the army 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.759
 driving vehicles 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.489
 You can do a number of these with one 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.710
 prepare a fairly regular driver's license 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:32.359
 but for other vehicles and yet 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.359
 some more specialist training needed 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.280
 and those courses are with the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.980
 Army done internally if we now go to 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.400
 home remains the usual at 12 minutes or 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.400
 eleven steps 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.100
 we saw the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.409
 standard Mercedes-Benz SUVs 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.329
 the four tons and the ten dollars 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.550
 there is much more to enthusiasts 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.800
 rolling stock at the Air Force 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.670
 that is the bushmaster you want , among other things 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.470
 I recently did one 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.720
 been news and the patria are 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.640
 two specific vehicles that meant 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.490
 are a bit safer in afghanistan 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.440
 figure patrols to drive and that anyway 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.300
 fairly dangerous area now and then 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.860
 so it's the first time 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.780
 that you calmly do not drive yourself 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.760
 especially think of the width of beyond 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.170
 the vehicle have the ypr 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.750
 trucks vehicles armored infantry 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.610
 tracked vehicle and only on a2 although that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.080
 not be driven here by ourselves 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.270
 used here as such a relief vehicle 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.729
 we have you on the tractor trailer 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.380
 impose training in particular 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.539
 to be able to transport the tank, so also it 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.229
 on and off the tank on such a draft 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.659
 educate 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.850
 is part of our curriculum and to what 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.840
 must meet candidate driver 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.969
 First of all you have to go to the court 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.590
 meet requirements that is b-daman anyway 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.030
 the c driving license otherwise you are allowed 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.649
 anyway not on that can be made again 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.209
 with a dimension of the vehicle it is 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.009
 wider it is larger than other type 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.319
 vehicle and we here in particular 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.390
 learned specific things for how 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.459
 I can best handle that thing in 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.130
 the terrain there was in afghanistan 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.750
 of course very different terrain as here 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.060
 really want to look the within sight 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.959
 and then you just have to 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.099
 driving direction 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.120
 hold here beginning had yes we follow 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.569
 the track 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.569
 to the left 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.880
 Yes 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.620
 vehicles here not on public ones either 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.630
 drive away only on our own site 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.910
 and then use the name it you the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.450
 terrain share the loose sand and that 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.390
 kind of business 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.670
 we have various jobs we have 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.940
 various hills with various 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.740
 ascent rates 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.420
 we have a container where we occasionally 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.310
 being able to drive in with various vehicles 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.780
 to really look at how can i get that 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.100
 I can go without too much 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.300
 problems and without much 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.310
 preparations 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.260
 what you see here is a land rover 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.910
 specially prepared for a deep 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.709
 You will see experience on this side later 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.130
 experience of one meter twenty in it 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.730
 really can these devices 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.730
 but in the landing 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.270
 it is then only for the movement 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.940
 ship beach or back and then the 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.390
 driver 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.390
 move on 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.080
 relates to parenting or completely empty again 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.080
 to make 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.170
 and the Marechaussee who runs here too 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.060
 makes its own part its own cross 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.220
 for one wants also one for our terms 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.720
 Young called it through the armed forces 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.490
 and those lessons so here especially 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.260
 because of course our traffic here as 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.910
 having to travel was what you know one 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.710
 The perfect stacked order is without hindrance 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.420
 classic from the middle class 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.920
 to practice and let people first 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.840
 wine to its own vehicle type 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.990
 expenses road go 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.180
 the intention is that nice but cc engine 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.800
 training here I am a taste of it 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.570
 ability goes down lay a bare one 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.580
 own driving training with 170 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.130
 drive up kilometers per hour and then 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.050
 have to make an emergency stop that is well 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.820
 exact task of the Marechaussee at the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.290
 driving a column 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.270
 well the Marechaussee is first 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.790
 enforcement authority 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.500
 road safety 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.530
 precisely because we give you those special rules 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.440
 have that we may drive through red 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.090
 That makes it a very important task 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.520
 from the Marechaussee to ensure that it 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.890
 all goes well to those intersections or 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.380
 as a military column with wider ones 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.420
 vehicles arrive and it is 2 lane away 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.970
 then they drive forward in an alert 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.370
 is the oncoming traffic on the site 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.960
 that they have to keep more right so that 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.470
 the column unrestricted passage can 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.930
 to get 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.180
 and because we are not always the same 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.190
 speed like other traffic with 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.660
 especially on the highway, they are behind 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.370
 the columns with 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.470
 signaling signaling the lighting 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.910
 among fellow road users is to the 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.440
 Gentlemen on the fact that we might 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.100
 drive much slower when talking about the 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.810
 traffic 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.000
 or if we drive onto the highway then 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.040
 if they drive forward, then they go on the 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.840
 insertion lane and advisors 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.850
 other traffic on inserting the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.170
 column by everyone to the left lane 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.580
 to conduct and that goal works 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.170
 drivers what is expected of them 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.600
 as the column approaches 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.370
 that is very variable are people who 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.590
 be aware of the rules 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.330
 with regard to driving column we are 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.660
 people who don't get rid of it 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.969
 know 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.209
 have forgotten everything acutely to it 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:07.189
 getting rough work 's and yes the one 

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:10.009
 time it all goes fine another 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.769
 once you encounter a lot of misunderstanding and yes 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.929
 all kinds of gestures on the way 

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:17.179
 so we are people who want to be 

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:19.009
 want to insert or hinder so that 

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:20.839
 celebrate armed forces parts 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.329
 quite handy 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:26.629
 yes with Marechaussee is natural 

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:28.549
 easier because you need some help with it 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.249
 yes when looking out because otherwise you have to 

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:33.639
 anyway you have to watch out anyway because 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:36.079
 You cannot trust the fact that 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.789
 everyone the road traffic law out of you 

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:39.789
 head knows is unfortunately not so
