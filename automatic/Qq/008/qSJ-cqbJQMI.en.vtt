00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 what's up whiskers welcome to this 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:11.370
 tutorial on how to learn how to make a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:13.410
 dock for you for the requirements are 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.730
 learn to make the bridge enlighten us 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.170
 few parties because it will give us the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.090
 strength needed to do this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.859
 movement there are two parts the second is 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.600
 much more difficult than the first the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.269
 First is standing back up 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.189
 and the other from standing in Spain we started 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.720
 The first thing we have to know is the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.250
 spring legs is not going to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.980
 execute with the feet I have to help 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.680
 with legs is the same thing what 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.720
 is 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.730
 the difference is broken in jos and the 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.800
 dock is that the dock will put the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.800
 feet away not over again 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:52.730
 here here then open is the same but 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:58.850
 using your hands is also worth only 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:03.949
 hands and fall we can only try 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.570
 move to the bridge if it's here we have it 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.700
 well let's go to the next step when 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.630
 we adjust and we will put the feet 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.340
 we have to do this with the body 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.590
 we raise and we have try to do it in 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.340
 the air and we help each other with our hands is 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.340
 say this 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.860
 the cam 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.940
 forward to the minister are trying 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.940
 put the works 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.200
 with this we can get up and do 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.450
 equal to the most difficult part more than 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.040
 nothing because it scares and fear makes 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.030
 make bad movement and it also makes you 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.680
 because of snow 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.150
 If you really have confidence, you do it 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.740
 well I recommend you use more mattress 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.270
 at the beginning to make this movement 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.080
 I show you the taxi because it gives more 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.600
 confidence it's about the balance dropped standing 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.070
 and when I'm here with my hands I look 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.740
 backwards as if it had a 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.490
 strong and in the air with the hip towards 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.399
 forward I jump and I fall with my hip like that 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.380
 and then then when I'm going to fall done 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.240
 the legs to the face and so I do the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.050
 dock the same mobile that I do for 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.050
 climb this 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.040
 then it is to play with this then it will do 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.110
 the same with manned and once you already 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.550
 we have with your feet and arms you have 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.980
 a little bit difficult now we have to 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.230
 try to jump with the confidence put 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.720
 arms and make the doll again 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.160
 that this 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.110
 without being careful when you do it because 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.430
 you usually give yourself a headbutt so 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:49.319
 we use mats but it would be 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:51.180
 basically this you have to be for 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.430
 always hands before the back 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.680
 because that way it cushions is the blow when 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.720
 you put your hands and you force 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.010
 go down and the blow is softer and up 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.990
 here the tutorial on how to learn to 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.730
 delicated springs do hope we have 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.900
 served the video that you share with 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.850
 everyone so that we can all 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.810
 learn what the apparitions tell me 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.810
 and see you
