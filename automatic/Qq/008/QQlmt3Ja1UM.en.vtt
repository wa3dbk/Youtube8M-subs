00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.900

 black shadow over top to seal a flex 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.970
 You come black only for this bass. 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.590
 Let's take a road with that one. 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.400
 we went here in 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.700
 up're a cool transition with 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.700

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.650
 my lower eyelashes 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.350

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:55.070
 finalized only as it was particularly 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:58.430
 It's my favorite eye to go to parties and 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.740
 is this we lips on amaran a 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.110
 red but today as my kitchen is 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.260
 more core dinha I decided to put a lipstick 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.419
 Gloss nude made a mix between the tilt 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.940
 from marina and smith 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:17.210
 I do not remember if Marino is more 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:20.060
 finally and the circe danix in my 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.610
 cheeks is a more marked taste 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.030
 What is the Jordanian Bronze College? 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:29.200
 He has a more earthy tone and that's it. 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.090
 this option is preferred because 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.370
 I know but that's it 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.700
 a big kiss process and until the next 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.700
