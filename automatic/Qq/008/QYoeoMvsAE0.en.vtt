00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.029 
Australia it's usually quite a bad time
I<00:04:20.750> mean<00:04:20.900> that's<00:04:21.049> because<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.590> hours<00:04:21.890> i'm

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
I mean that's because the hours i'm

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.460 
I mean that's because the hours i'm
doing<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.490> obviously<00:04:22.849> have<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.180> be<00:04:23.470> ours

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470
