00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.030
 I managed to find a subtitled version of 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:18.029
 A pizza movie in Brasilia 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.960
 My people arrived and do and redo and it's the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.960
 victory 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.320
 rehearsing the movie or playfully 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.290
 revolves around an 11- year-old girl 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 call her father, her job starts 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.090
 So the family moved to SÃ£o 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.940
 francisco are difficult times 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.950
 many adaptations and the film in the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.770
 It leads into the head of harley 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.280
 where in a control room operate its 5 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.270
 primary emotions sadness fear and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 rage 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.240
 little girl and the joy leader the concept does not 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.570
 It's very original, it resembles the movie a little. 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.270
 the dishes from where 2001 and the same 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.759
 tv series rahman said 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.369
 is not a new argument but the 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.830
 important here is execution that is 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.840
 excellent funny because most of the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 problems that I identified this movie 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.979
 has a justification or at least one 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.360
 compensation for example can be 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.369
 to argue that there is not much 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.050
 character development there is no air 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.180
 with the characters behave 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.369
 exactly as you expect from another 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.979
 side these characters are not human 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.270
 they are emotions then it is not for themselves 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.550
 expect them to have a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.289
 development that they leave 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.660
 of the primordial emotion that they are 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.280
 presenting the predictable film formula 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.649
 that you know exactly what goes 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.209
 happening is a way of learning more 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.399
 although sequence of events is 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:47.220
 predetermined in its structure in the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.590
 she is very creative the world 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.020
 created in this movie is full of good 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.330
 There are also several ideas where 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.950
 film to give a legal trip 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.229
 I say this in the best possible way. 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.050
 the film is well directed to a fluidity 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.509
 very well defined between three plans of 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.459
 action we have the underground of joy and 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.039
 of sadness an adventure within 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.349
 rai 2 head we have the arc of fear 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.180
 and twins forced to exercise their 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.370
 role of the main motivators of the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.860
 behavior of raehk three we have to 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 highly insee her family and how she 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.520
 deals with your emotional conflicts 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.200
 the film transitions very well between these 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.750
 plans to keep the pace 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.810
 saturated and tiring voice work in the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.080
 its majority is exceptional the berreiro does 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.730
 fear and meditated on it makes the disgusting 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.950
 two are competent but they are the ones 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.170
 least called attention to eni poet 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.100
 perfect as joy is very good. 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.320
 enthusiasm 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.300
 the character's over -optimism and 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.330
 happy same is the perfect counterpoint 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.160
 for her doing the sadness she is very 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.620
 Funny is the best character in the movie. 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.050
 light black makes anger who ever watched 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.450
 to tend calm of him who knows the 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.040
 This guy's humor style knows that he 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.290
 was the perfect choice for this 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.330
 character if possible watch the language 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.610
 original soundtrack of the film is 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.800
 forgettable what is rare for 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.320
 pixar but I can not do anything 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.270
 melody 3d is definitely not 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.670
 necessary does not draw attention now in 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.860
 terms of production design the film is 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.680
 much more than the movie 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.600
 does very well is to balance the jokes 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.910
 here are clearly geared towards 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.800
 children and there are others that will 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.930
 beats for the younger audience alias 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.150
 the vast majority of jokes work the 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.010
 movie is very funny fun to 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.320
 mind is a curious film he is 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.900
 extremely familiar and predictable 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.840
 at the same time very creative and moving 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.280
 symbolic with lots of humor and a message 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.740
 relevant note 8.60 speaks quickly about 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.170
 the short film called lava that has passed 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.690
 before the movie started i loved the short 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.780
 It's a beautifully animated mind. It's a story. 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.700
 to a threat of cruelty 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.340
 emotional here a beautiful song 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:02.010
 I even had her in the head until 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.840
 now it was from haia hol I sing once 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.240
 exceptionally only goes to
