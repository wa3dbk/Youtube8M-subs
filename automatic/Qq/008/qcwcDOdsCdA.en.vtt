melon<00:02:48.730> they<00:02:48.820> got<00:02:48.970> planted<00:02:49.239> by<00:02:49.360> accident<00:02:49.959> and

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
melon they got planted by accident and

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.710 
melon they got planted by accident and
another<00:02:50.950> one<00:02:51.100> over<00:02:51.220> there<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:52.180> guy<00:02:52.330> that's

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
another one over there that guy that's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.910 
another one over there that guy that's
why<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.870> had<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.020> drill<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.410> fence<00:02:53.680> around

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
why I had to drill this fence around

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.380 
why I had to drill this fence around
because<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.250> was<00:02:54.310> going<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.610> get<00:02:54.760> swallowed<00:02:55.120> up

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
because it was going to get swallowed up

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.840 
because it was going to get swallowed up
I<00:02:55.920> think<00:02:56.920> maybe<00:02:57.100> he<00:02:57.220> was<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> seed<00:02:57.640> in<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
I think maybe he was a seed in the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.840 
I think maybe he was a seed in the
