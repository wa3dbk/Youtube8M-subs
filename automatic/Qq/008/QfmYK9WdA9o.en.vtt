cheesing<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> was<00:02:00.299> expecting<00:02:00.600> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
cheesing this is what I was expecting to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.359 
cheesing this is what I was expecting to
see<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.259> any<00:02:01.320> rate<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.890> that's<00:02:02.009> why<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.159> picked

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
see at any rate and that's why I picked

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.709 
see at any rate and that's why I picked
these<00:02:02.520> replays<00:02:02.790> out<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> best<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.659> three

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
these replays out it is a best of three

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.319 
these replays out it is a best of three
by<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.049> way<00:02:04.170> guys<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.430> there<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:06.180> at

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
by the way guys so there will be at

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.630 
by the way guys so there will be at
least<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:06.960> game<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.380> series<00:02:07.640> etre

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
least one more game in this series etre

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.999 
least one more game in this series etre
here<00:02:08.849> already<00:02:09.030> scouted<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.619> he<00:02:10.709> sees<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
here already scouted it so he sees the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.260 
here already scouted it so he sees the
two<00:02:11.129> barracks<00:02:11.400> he<00:02:11.550> knows<00:02:11.700> what's<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.150> at

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
two barracks he knows what's going on at

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.190 
two barracks he knows what's going on at
this<00:02:12.390> point

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
this point

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.930 
this point
should<00:02:13.560> probably<00:02:14.069> think<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:14.370> producing<00:02:14.849> a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
should probably think about producing a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.670 
should probably think about producing a
lot<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.150> wings<00:02:15.300> right<00:02:15.540> now<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:15.989> fact<00:02:16.200> saving<00:02:16.590> up

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
lot of wings right now in fact saving up

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.869 
lot of wings right now in fact saving up
larvae<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.129> he's<00:02:17.250> producing<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.640> bunch<00:02:17.790> of

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
larvae and he's producing a bunch of

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.949 
larvae and he's producing a bunch of
links<00:02:18.000> bringing<00:02:18.300> Jones<00:02:18.480> off<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.660> line<00:02:18.840> as

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
links bringing Jones off the line as

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.300 
links bringing Jones off the line as
well<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.230> am<00:02:19.319> sure<00:02:19.470> coming<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.099> couple

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
well and am sure coming in with a couple

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.339 
well and am sure coming in with a couple
of<00:02:20.340> STDs<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.940> marine<00:02:21.180> namm<00:02:21.660> shares<00:02:21.900> look

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
of STDs and a marine namm shares look

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.229 
of STDs and a marine namm shares look
into<00:02:22.709> throw<00:02:23.099> down<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> couple<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.640> bunkers<00:02:24.030> no

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
into throw down a couple of bunkers no

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.089 
into throw down a couple of bunkers no
doubt<00:02:24.480> but<00:02:24.989> H<00:02:25.170> has<00:02:25.349> already<00:02:25.440> got<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> bunch<00:02:25.950> of

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
doubt but H has already got a bunch of

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.160 
doubt but H has already got a bunch of
drones<00:02:26.400> off<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.700> line<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.090> that's<00:02:27.239> probably

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
drones off the line and that's probably

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.190 
drones off the line and that's probably
going<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.620> repeal<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.489> barracks<00:02:30.200> now

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
going to repeal this to barracks now

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.930 
going to repeal this to barracks now
remember<00:02:31.530> guys<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.800> think<00:02:32.069> namm<00:02:32.280> shear<00:02:32.580> opened

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
remember guys I think namm shear opened

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.300 
remember guys I think namm shear opened
up<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.269> barracks<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.870> 10<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.290> 10<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.040> it's

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
up with a barracks on 10 and 10 so it's

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.460 
up with a barracks on 10 and 10 so it's
not<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> tuber<00:02:36.540> X<00:02:36.690> pressure<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.290> to

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
not like a tuber X pressure this is to

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.600 
not like a tuber X pressure this is to
barracks<00:02:37.970> super<00:02:38.970> cheese<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.980> very<00:02:40.980> very<00:02:41.130> open

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
barracks super cheese so very very open

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.220 
barracks super cheese so very very open
aggression<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:42.599> from<00:02:42.780> from<00:02:43.110> New<00:02:43.200> Hampshire

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
aggression here from from New Hampshire

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.440 
aggression here from from New Hampshire
and<00:02:43.709> we'll<00:02:44.519> see<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.879> was<00:02:45.030> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.269> be<00:02:45.330> able

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and we'll see if it was going to be able

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.120 
and we'll see if it was going to be able
to<00:02:45.810> deal<00:02:46.019> with<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.349> he's<00:02:46.560> got<00:02:46.709> speed<00:02:46.830> on<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
to deal with this he's got speed on the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.360 
to deal with this he's got speed on the
way<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.599> when<00:02:48.599> speed<00:02:48.870> comes<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.500> he<00:02:49.769> should<00:02:50.130> be

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
way and when speed comes in he should be

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.180 
way and when speed comes in he should be
just<00:02:50.730> fine<00:02:51.170> both<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.349> them<00:02:52.440> are<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:52.680> dancing

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
just fine both of them are just dancing

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.460 
just fine both of them are just dancing
and<00:02:53.549> playing<00:02:53.670> with<00:02:53.970> fire<00:02:54.239> right<00:02:54.480> now<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.900> am

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
and playing with fire right now and am

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.140 
and playing with fire right now and am
sure<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:55.739> got<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:55.860> pretty<00:02:56.160> large<00:02:56.700> pack<00:02:57.120> of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
sure it's got a pretty large pack of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.059 
sure it's got a pretty large pack of
Marines<00:02:57.569> at<00:02:57.720> some<00:02:57.959> point<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.380> marine<00:02:58.680> packet

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
Marines at some point that marine packet

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.650 
Marines at some point that marine packet
it<00:02:59.160> gets<00:02:59.370> exponentially<00:02:59.970> stronger<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
it gets exponentially stronger and

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.420 
it gets exponentially stronger and
stronger<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.110> at<00:03:01.170> some<00:03:01.380> point<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.920> reaches<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
stronger and at some point it reaches a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.089
