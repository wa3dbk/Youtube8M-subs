running<00:00:41.640> back<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> definitely<00:00:42.480> catch<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
running back and definitely catch the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.720 
running back and definitely catch the
ball<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.100> reasons<00:00:44.280> i<00:00:44.520> thought

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
ball and that's one of reasons i thought

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.069 
ball and that's one of reasons i thought
you<00:00:44.850> would<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> minute<00:00:45.270> excellent<00:00:45.750> pick<00:00:45.899> for
