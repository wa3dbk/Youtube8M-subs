half great catapults I wanted to put my
own<00:00:36.270> twist<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.489> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
own twist on it and you know make it a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.150 
own twist on it and you know make it a
little<00:00:38.790> bit<00:00:39.000> smaller<00:00:39.860> challenge<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> shape

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
little bit smaller challenge the shape

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.610 
little bit smaller challenge the shape
of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> Fox<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.879> whatnot

the<00:00:44.160> grip<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> atma<00:00:44.850> grip<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the grip is atma grip as you can see the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.450 
the grip is atma grip as you can see the
grip<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.289> actually<00:00:46.559> designed<00:00:46.710> by<00:00:46.980> your<00:00:47.219> eye

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
grip was actually designed by your eye

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.830 
grip was actually designed by your eye
so<00:00:47.520> I'm<00:00:47.730> sure<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> don't<00:00:48.059> need<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.480> tell<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.750> how

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
so I'm sure I don't need to tell you how

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.690 
so I'm sure I don't need to tell you how
comfortable<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.559> good<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.579> is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
comfortable and good it is this is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.860 
comfortable and good it is this is
probably<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> best<00:00:51.360> catapult

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
probably one of the best catapult

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.660 
probably one of the best catapult
designers<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> world<00:00:54.110> grip<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
designers in the world grip like so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.709 
designers in the world grip like so
hammer<00:00:56.670> gripping<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:57.539> get

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
hammer gripping you know you don't get

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
hammer gripping you know you don't get
no<00:00:57.899> better<00:00:58.079> grip<00:00:58.530> than<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.129> my<00:00:59.190> opinion

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
no better grip than that in my opinion

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.189

asked to catapult those so the original

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.240 
asked to catapult those so the original
one<00:02:54.720> was<00:02:54.900> designed<00:02:55.079> by<00:02:55.470> M<00:02:55.650> York's<00:02:56.040> brave

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250

himself<00:02:56.670> which<00:02:56.849> I<00:02:56.940> still<00:02:57.180> make<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.840> just

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
himself which I still make but I just

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.330 
himself which I still make but I just
wanted<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> make<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.709> little<00:02:58.829> bit<00:02:59.040> smaller
