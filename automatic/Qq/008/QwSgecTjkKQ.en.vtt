commonly<00:00:15.599> call<00:00:15.900> now<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.560> think<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
commonly call now I think is a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
commonly call now I think is a
politically<00:00:17.550> correct<00:00:17.910> thing<00:00:18.150> as<00:00:18.570> snoopin

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
politically correct thing as snoopin

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.779 
politically correct thing as snoopin
when<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.380> hear<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.710> word<00:00:19.830> hookah<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> always

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
when I hear the word hookah I always

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.509 
when I hear the word hookah I always
think<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> beatles<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.720> India<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> that's

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
think of the beatles in India so that's

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.800 
think of the beatles in India so that's
probably<00:00:23.760> why<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.150> changed<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.600> name<00:00:24.630> to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
probably why they changed the name to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.140 
probably why they changed the name to
snuba<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.010> snorkeling<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.970> scuba

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
snuba so it's like snorkeling and scuba

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.169 
snuba so it's like snorkeling and scuba
combine<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.380> what<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.910> reefs<00:00:30.029> they

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
combine and what that is the reefs they

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.700 
combine and what that is the reefs they
call<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.510> hookah<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.929> if<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> gets<00:00:31.380> because
