chapter 1 in our series on understanding
piston<00:00:09.690> rings<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.530> see<00:00:10.710> I've<00:00:10.800> got<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.010> handful

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
piston rings you see I've got a handful

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400 
piston rings you see I've got a handful
of<00:00:11.460> piston<00:00:11.910> rings<00:00:12.150> right<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.540> today<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
of piston rings right here today and

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.140 
of piston rings right here today and
this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.860> very<00:00:14.040> basic<00:00:14.219> chapter<00:00:14.880> we'll

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
this is the very basic chapter we'll

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.700 
this is the very basic chapter we'll
build<00:00:15.420> on<00:00:15.599> what<00:00:15.750> we<00:00:15.870> learned<00:00:16.109> today<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
build on what we learned today in the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.980 
build on what we learned today in the
next<00:00:17.010> units<00:00:17.340> coming<00:00:17.580> along<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.630> let's<00:00:18.810> talk

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
next units coming along so let's talk

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.200 
next units coming along so let's talk
about<00:00:19.050> piston<00:00:19.770> rings<00:00:20.010> these<00:00:20.550> rings<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.000> I'm

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
about piston rings these rings that I'm

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.300 
about piston rings these rings that I'm
holding<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.660> course<00:00:21.930> fit<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.350> Pistons<00:00:22.800> hence

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
holding a course fit on Pistons hence

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.370 
holding a course fit on Pistons hence
their<00:00:23.609> name<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.050> cute<00:00:25.289> little

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
their name you can see this cute little

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.109 
their name you can see this cute little
piston<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.189> right<00:00:26.430> here<00:00:26.460> which<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.939> out<00:00:27.090> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
piston I have right here which is out of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.089 
piston I have right here which is out of
a<00:00:27.269> chevrolet<00:00:27.689> cruze<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> look<00:00:28.890> carefully

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
a chevrolet cruze if you look carefully

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.330 
a chevrolet cruze if you look carefully
you'll<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.699> able<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.060> see<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.689> two<00:00:31.500> three

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
you'll be able to see one two three

you'll be able to see one two three
rings<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.969> piston<00:00:33.390> okay<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.530> ring<00:00:35.100> similar

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
rings on that piston okay a ring similar

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.889 
rings on that piston okay a ring similar
to<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> ones<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.000> held<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
to the ones I just held up here of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.619 
to the ones I just held up here of
course<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.350> much<00:00:37.530> smaller<00:00:37.969> now<00:00:38.969> different

there's a small diesel engine and you'll
see<00:00:44.280> again<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.000> piston<00:00:45.450> no<00:00:45.899> rings<00:00:46.230> but

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
see again on this piston no rings but

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.310 
see again on this piston no rings but
one<00:00:46.800> two<00:00:47.460> three<00:00:48.210> grooves<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> Pistons

very well with most modern engines as
you'll<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.900> from<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> chart<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.650> holding<00:01:08.010> up

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you'll see from the chart I'm holding up

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.789 
you'll see from the chart I'm holding up
here<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.810> most<00:01:10.049> modern<00:01:10.290> engines

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
here what we got and most modern engines

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.440 
here what we got and most modern engines
is<00:01:10.950> what<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.220> refer<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.970> three<00:01:12.299> ring

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
is what we refer to as a three ring

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.830 
is what we refer to as a three ring
piston<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> top<00:01:14.040> ring<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.659> as

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
piston we have the top ring that one as

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.539 
piston we have the top ring that one as
you'll<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> little<00:01:16.740> bar<00:01:17.009> graph<00:01:17.040> there

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you'll see on the little bar graph there

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.880 
you'll see on the little bar graph there
it's<00:01:17.790> job<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.390> 90<00:01:18.720> percent<00:01:18.900> controlling

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it's job is 90 percent controlling

it's job is 90 percent controlling
compression<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.820> keeps<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.360> gasses<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.990> in

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
compression it keeps the gasses up in

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.810 
compression it keeps the gasses up in
the<00:01:22.259> cylinder<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.860> out<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> crankcase

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the cylinder and out of the crankcase

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.539 
the cylinder and out of the crankcase
the<00:01:24.720> second<00:01:25.140> ring<00:01:25.290> surprises<00:01:25.950> most<00:01:26.159> folks

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the second ring surprises most folks

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
the second ring surprises most folks
because<00:01:27.000> even<00:01:27.570> though<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.810> call<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
because even though we call it a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.620 
because even though we call it a
compression<00:01:28.740> ring<00:01:28.890> its<00:01:29.369> primary<00:01:30.000> job<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
compression ring its primary job is to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.410 
compression ring its primary job is to
scrape<00:01:31.170> oil<00:01:31.470> off<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> cylinder<00:01:32.189> wall<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:33.150> call

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
scrape oil off the cylinder wall we call

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
scrape oil off the cylinder wall we call
it<00:01:33.570> fine<00:01:33.869> oil<00:01:34.200> control<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> ring<00:01:35.040> business

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
it fine oil control in the ring business

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
it fine oil control in the ring business
now<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> lower<00:01:36.390> ring<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.869> referred<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.619> an

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
now the lower ring is referred to as an

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.399 
now the lower ring is referred to as an
oil<00:01:37.950> ring<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.200> it's<00:01:40.200> easy

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
oil ring and because of that it's easy

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.109 
oil ring and because of that it's easy
to<00:01:40.530> figure<00:01:40.860> out<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.430> job<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
to figure out that it's job is to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.780 
to figure out that it's job is to
control<00:01:42.540> oil<00:01:42.659> also<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.369> refer<00:01:44.759> to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
control oil also it's what we refer to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.600 
control oil also it's what we refer to
