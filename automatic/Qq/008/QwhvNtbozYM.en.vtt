bother with that one because it's being

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.910 
bother with that one because it's being
retarded<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.990> was<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> curl<00:01:37.530> after<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920

actually<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.920> half<00:01:40.950> times<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.110> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
actually one and a half times so this is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.120 
actually one and a half times so this is
how<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.619> holds<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> curl<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.540> got<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> very

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
bit of shine not to weigh it down I had

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.250 
bit of shine not to weigh it down I had
a<00:02:55.900> whole<00:02:56.140> video<00:02:56.380> on<00:02:56.590> me<00:02:57.130> cutting<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:58.810> and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
a whole video on me cutting this and

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.170 
a whole video on me cutting this and
curling<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.400> but<00:03:00.670> that's<00:03:01.240> lost<00:03:01.630> in<00:03:01.870> limbo<00:03:02.200> so

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
curling it but that's lost in limbo so

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.660 
curling it but that's lost in limbo so
i'm<00:03:04.180> going<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.450> make<00:03:04.600> do<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:06.220> way<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.430> did

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
i'm going to make do and the way I did

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.360 
i'm going to make do and the way I did
the<00:03:06.700> bangs<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.330> did<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.630> kind<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.370> straight

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
the bangs I did it kind of a straight

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.550 
the bangs I did it kind of a straight
across<00:03:09.640> but<00:03:09.970> also<00:03:10.120> taper<00:03:10.600> down<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> side

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
across but also taper down to the side

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.800 
across but also taper down to the side
that<00:03:12.100> way<00:03:12.280> when<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.490> do<00:03:12.610> where<00:03:13.090> it's<00:03:13.330> not<00:03:13.540> just

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
that way when I do where it's not just

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.449 
that way when I do where it's not just
straight<00:03:14.200> Chinese<00:03:14.650> things<00:03:14.890> across<00:03:15.160> they

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
straight Chinese things across they

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.490 
straight Chinese things across they
actually<00:03:15.820> do<00:03:15.910> kind<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.239> float<00:03:16.510> down<00:03:16.780> but<00:03:17.380> I'll

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
actually do kind of float down but I'll

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.610 
actually do kind of float down but I'll
be<00:03:17.620> able<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.860> see<00:03:18.100> but<00:03:18.400> right<00:03:18.730> here<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:20.380> bangs

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
be able to see but right here the bangs

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.009 
be able to see but right here the bangs
actually<00:03:21.190> kind<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.489> taper<00:03:21.760> off<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.540> way<00:03:22.810> that

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
actually kind of taper off this way that

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.449 
actually kind of taper off this way that
they<00:03:23.110> also<00:03:23.260> blend<00:03:23.650> into<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:23.950> actual<00:03:24.220> length

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
they also blend into the actual length

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.070 
they also blend into the actual length
of<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.700> hair<00:03:26.790> now<00:03:27.790> as<00:03:27.940> far<00:03:28.180> as<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.600> coloring

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
of the hair now as far as the coloring

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.440 
of the hair now as far as the coloring
is<00:03:29.200> concerned<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:31.150> movie<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:32.650> top<00:03:32.980> which

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
is concerned the movie is on top which

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.759 
is concerned the movie is on top which
particularly<00:03:34.450> for<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:34.900> hair<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.230> really

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
particularly for this hair I really

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.500 
particularly for this hair I really
don't<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.640> one<00:03:36.820> being<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.239> one

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
don't like that the one being the one

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.870 
don't like that the one being the one
are<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.170> closely<00:03:38.650> color<00:03:39.310> matched<00:03:39.610> together

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
are so closely color matched together

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.090 
are so closely color matched together
usually<00:03:40.780> with<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> 1<00:03:41.230> B<00:03:41.440> there's<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.739> hint<00:03:41.950> of

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
usually with a 1 B there's a hint of

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.759 
usually with a 1 B there's a hint of
brown<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.850> can<00:03:43.030> see<00:03:43.530> unfortunately<00:03:44.530> not

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
brown that you can see unfortunately not

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.740 
brown that you can see unfortunately not
with<00:03:45.040> this<00:03:45.220> hair<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.760> one<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.390> one<00:03:46.570> we

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
with this hair the one and the one we

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.650 
with this hair the one and the one we
look<00:03:47.019> almost<00:03:47.320> exactly<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:48.580> same<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:49.420> have<00:03:49.540> to

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
look almost exactly the same you have to

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.840 
look almost exactly the same you have to
literally<00:03:49.930> hold<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.440> up<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.739> light<00:03:50.980> in<00:03:51.640> order

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
literally hold it up to light in order

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.400 
literally hold it up to light in order
to<00:03:52.030> be<00:03:52.150> able<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.390> tell<00:03:52.570> which<00:03:52.720> one<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.200> one

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
to be able to tell which one is the one

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.210 
to be able to tell which one is the one
deep<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:55.450> far<00:03:55.480> I'm<00:03:56.380> actually<00:03:56.590> liking<00:03:56.950> the

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
deep so so far I'm actually liking the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.000 
deep so so far I'm actually liking the
hair<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:58.660> comes<00:03:58.900> very<00:03:59.170> nicely<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.680> hasn't

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
hair it comes very nicely it hasn't

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.509 
hair it comes very nicely it hasn't
tangle<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.430> hasn't<00:04:02.280> Matador<00:04:04.000> yet

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519

took<00:04:24.510> heat<00:04:24.810> very<00:04:25.080> well<00:04:25.230> I<00:04:25.440> only<00:04:25.860> have<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.310> hit

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
took heat very well I only have to hit

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.730 
took heat very well I only have to hit
the<00:04:26.610> veins<00:04:26.820> with<00:04:27.030> heat<00:04:27.210> once<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:28.380> get<00:04:28.530> them

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
the veins with heat once to get them

the veins with heat once to get them
bump<00:04:29.010> this<00:04:29.310> way<00:04:29.580> which<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.270> always<00:04:30.480> a<00:04:30.720> plus

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
bump this way which is always a plus

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.290 
bump this way which is always a plus
because<00:04:31.920> if<00:04:32.040> you<00:04:32.160> have<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.460> hit<00:04:32.610> human<00:04:33.030> hair

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
because if you have to hit human hair

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.240 
because if you have to hit human hair
more<00:04:33.930> than<00:04:34.110> once<00:04:34.320> with<00:04:34.380> heat<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:34.920> means<00:04:35.100> it's

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
more than once with heat that means it's

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.580 
more than once with heat that means it's
not<00:04:35.310> human<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.150> probably<00:04:36.570> should<00:04:36.960> throw<00:04:37.410> it

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
not human you probably should throw it

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.360 
not human you probably should throw it
away<00:04:37.880> but<00:04:38.880> otherwise<00:04:39.180> here's<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.870> wig<00:04:40.370> that

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
able to tell that upon initial review it

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.880

doesn't look like here that will
withstand<00:05:32.070> being<00:05:32.700> washed<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:33.510> I'm<00:05:33.720> definitely

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
withstand being washed so I'm definitely

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.900 
withstand being washed so I'm definitely
not<00:05:34.410> going<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.330> test<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.480> waters<00:05:36.810> on<00:05:36.960> that<00:05:37.910> on

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
not going to test the waters on that on

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.760 
not going to test the waters on that on
this<00:05:39.090> definitely<00:05:39.630> would<00:05:40.020> be<00:05:40.140> hair<00:05:40.470> that<00:05:40.740> I

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
this definitely would be hair that I

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.680 
this definitely would be hair that I
would<00:05:41.010> use<00:05:41.250> if<00:05:41.460> I<00:05:41.550> want<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:41.940> make<00:05:42.090> another<00:05:42.210> wig

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
would use if I want to make another wig

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.600
