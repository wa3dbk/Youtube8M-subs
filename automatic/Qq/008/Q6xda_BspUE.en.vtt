00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.700
 And then people ask here I wanted 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.800
 Send a tip to you here that I 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 I even thought that and I saw that the result 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.670
 it was positive it was interesting 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.859
 they are seeing that the playstation 3 super 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.630
 line and this you already see here has a 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.400
 object underneath the team 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.439
 and that 's exactly what I wanted 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.300
 Talk to you here and I do not respect you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.090
 everybody knows the world speaks and the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.220
 playstation 3 super lindzen there he 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.340
 less energy you spend less energy 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.079
 but it still heats up, right? 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.300
 many playstation 3 cases that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.790
 superheated even being a super slim and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.710
 gave trouble them yellow anyway who 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.050
 accompanies who knows who left time 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.590
 three knows the problems he may have 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.460
 huh 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.449
 So what I thought for power is to give a 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.350
 ameliorated the anthem in the heat of the game 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.420
 generates 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 just went there has that cooling kit 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.149
 that arises in the course for mobile 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.949
 accelerate the cooler yes there is that but if 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.629
 You do not want to open your videogame. 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.309
 you can see why he does not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.710
 They are in space are open to the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.010
 through space is and so and I thought of 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.189
 do what you buy is a basis concluded 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.530
 Notebook and how to install it and 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.710
 Looks paid for the result if you can 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 but think the cure but look beneath 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.490
 Think with me the course below. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.740
 cooling the bottom of the video 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.259
 game will refer to one of the parties that 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.360
 they warm up of him, because I already 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.070
 before putting the one that played two 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.640
 three hours since it was okay to be 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.110
 It was good that it was very hot and 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.920
 in order to avoid future pains 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.829
 head 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.860
 buy and pay $ 39 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.939
 is a very cheap investment and also in the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.369
 your notebook 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.110
 also serves on xbox 360 but I go 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.240
 leave more here on playstation 3 by 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.790
 cause of these problems that he has in 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.280
 passed the other generations of him right 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.930
 on one specifically the super slim does not 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.850
 that he does not give a problem so he gives 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.439
 But it's good to stop talking, show it to me. 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.780
 you here only here is the USB cable 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.700
 control, and it does not lose its 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.770
 two usb and has two usb sack in front 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.300
 He left only up to you and you 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.209
 see 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.330
 Looks just has a beautiful one fan 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.360
 here below looks only the giant is a 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.060
 and a beautiful adventure in 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.810
 a silver metal grille and the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.060
 Playstation 3 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.800
 he is resting up here right up 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.959
 you put on if you could see 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.580
 put your hand underneath and that 's fine 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.410
 Fresh from the past 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.830
 today I spent a lot of time playing 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.260
 even if it did not get hot in the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.400
 of the video game got very hot here in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.489
 back part 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.260
 I think for him to generate part of 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.500
 low it helps a little bit to expel 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.680
 but the warm air inside the video game means 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.590
 this is for xbox 360 also serves 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.319
 it's the same scheme it fits you here 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.209
 on the videogame usb port and this stamp 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.260
 specific brand uses that comply with 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.420
 can be anyone 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.730
 but it lets you use that USB port 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.030
 inep has another outlet that for you 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.620
 do not miss the welcome and the 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.560
 buy it give it to you we will power 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.630
 give your videogame a longer life 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.819
 and this also works for the Playstation 4 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.400
 person can say whatever he wants but the 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.560
 playstation 4 heats very same people 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.319
 have three friends who have lost their 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.650
 video games that overheated a certain 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.690
 way you dropped the solder from the plate 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.150
 video game is that if there already 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.540
 is a defect or characteristics like this 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.190
 of playstation 3 or playstation 3 7 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.019
 and to avoid this the investment 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.299
 very cheap you can do both in the 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.190
 your playstation 3 as xbox 360 or 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.600
 even on playstation 4 right? 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.060
 it will certainly increase the service life 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.819
 about the game will have avoided the goal of 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.489
 headaches and unpleasant surprises in 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.540
 But people tried it was that today the floor 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.280
 I hope you liked it today. 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.540
 but it's once again here 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.480
 looks usb cooler using two 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.940
 same way just very simple very practical 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.489
 Quiet and silent, your videogame thanks 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.780
 Of course we are but you 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.160
 have liked the video anything 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.160
 commit and until the next
