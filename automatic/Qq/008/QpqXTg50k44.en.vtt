see most of them given by group

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.709 
see most of them given by group
and<00:00:44.519> generally<00:00:45.519> most<00:00:45.699> spinners<00:00:46.179> who<00:00:46.329> Boulder

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
and generally most spinners who Boulder

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.299 
and generally most spinners who Boulder
do<00:00:46.870> sure<00:00:47.079> nowadays<00:00:47.469> they<00:00:47.649> scramble<00:00:48.100> them<00:00:48.190> all

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
do sure nowadays they scramble them all

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.619 
do sure nowadays they scramble them all
the<00:00:48.429> time<00:00:48.579> because<00:00:48.820> then<00:00:49.089> you<00:00:49.179> can't<00:00:49.420> pick<00:00:49.600> it

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
the time because then you can't pick it

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.750 
the time because then you can't pick it
because<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.589> ball<00:00:50.769> spinning<00:00:51.100> this<00:00:51.309> way<00:00:51.489> but

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
because the ball spinning this way but

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.069 
because the ball spinning this way but
the<00:00:51.850> actual<00:00:52.120> seam<00:00:52.329> is<00:00:52.510> actually<00:00:52.780> probably

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
the actual seam is actually probably

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.380 
the actual seam is actually probably
going<00:00:53.379> in<00:00:53.530> all<00:00:53.890> different<00:00:54.039> directions<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
going in all different directions it

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.939 
going in all different directions it
makes<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:55.809> very<00:00:55.989> very<00:00:56.199> tough<00:00:56.500> you<00:00:56.679> know<00:00:56.769> you've

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
makes it very very tough you know you've

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.860 
makes it very very tough you know you've
got<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.219> be<00:00:57.250> what<00:00:57.519> in<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.760> botany<00:00:58.239> ball<00:00:58.390> really

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
got to be what in the botany ball really

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.289 
got to be what in the botany ball really
really<00:00:59.170> closely<00:00:59.440> to<00:01:00.369> see<00:01:00.609> some<00:01:00.909> form<00:01:01.210> of

really closely to see some form of

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.880 
really closely to see some form of
rotation<00:01:01.930> or<00:01:02.079> you've<00:01:02.260> got<00:01:02.409> to<00:01:02.439> be<00:01:02.559> picking<00:01:02.829> it

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
rotation or you've got to be picking it

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.469 
rotation or you've got to be picking it

Orthodox<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:18.929> delivery<00:01:19.929> that<00:01:20.049> I<00:01:20.229> have<00:01:20.500> a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
Orthodox the delivery that I have a

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.719 
Orthodox the delivery that I have a
problem<00:01:20.860> with<00:01:21.220> is<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:22.149> Dasara<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:23.679> ICC<00:01:24.459> have

problem with is the Dasara the ICC have

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.609 
problem with is the Dasara the ICC have
accommodated<00:01:25.390> this<00:01:25.840> delivery<00:01:26.409> they've

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
accommodated this delivery they've

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.680 
accommodated this delivery they've
changed<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.159> rules<00:01:27.399> basically<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:28.360> allow

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
changed the rules basically to allow

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.249 
changed the rules basically to allow
these<00:01:29.619> bowlers<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.340> bend<00:01:30.819> their<00:01:31.090> elbow<00:01:31.600> 15

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
these bowlers to bend their elbow 15

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.340 
these bowlers to bend their elbow 15
degrees<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.280> that's<00:01:33.819> what<00:01:34.030> makes<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.539> so

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
degrees and that's what makes it so

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.469 
degrees and that's what makes it so
difficult<00:01:35.649> for<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.220> batsman<00:01:36.819> let's<00:01:37.209> be

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
difficult for the batsman let's be

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.570 
difficult for the batsman let's be
honest<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.990> only<00:01:38.380> bowler<00:01:39.039> that's

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
honest the only bowler that's

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.660
