etc<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:25.130> conventional<00:00:26.330> question<00:00:27.330> there

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
etc so the conventional question there

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
etc so the conventional question there
is<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> may<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.070> pointing<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.609> the

is the what you may be pointing at the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
is the what you may be pointing at the
lead<00:00:29.880> certification<00:00:30.300> things<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:31.050> that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
lead certification things like that

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.330 
lead certification things like that
right<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:32.009> could<00:00:32.219> be<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:33.770> were<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.890> what

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
right it could be but we were not what

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.950 
right it could be but we were not what
up<00:00:35.489> chasing<00:00:36.170> certifications<00:00:37.280> where<00:00:38.280> were

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
up chasing certifications where were

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.389 
up chasing certifications where were
verifying<00:00:39.960> our<00:00:40.170> choice<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.620> Homo<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.129> lead<00:00:41.280> our

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.090 
verifying our choice of Homo to lead our
lives<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.510> those<00:00:42.629> choices<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.469> to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
lives so one of those choices is to to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.779 
lives so one of those choices is to to
reuse<00:00:44.520> materials<00:00:44.760> where<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.480> came<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.719> here

for sale at a government auction and we

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260 
for sale at a government auction and we
had<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.250> we're<00:00:56.789> able<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.090> get

had a bit for that and we're able to get

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779 
had a bit for that and we're able to get
in<00:00:57.750> our<00:00:57.899> opinion<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.559> quit<00:00:58.739> moving<00:00:59.010> material<00:00:59.670> at

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
in our opinion I quit moving material at

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.439 
in our opinion I quit moving material at
what<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.120> thought<00:01:00.329> was<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> discount<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
what we thought was a discount and the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.910 
what we thought was a discount and the
added<00:01:03.719> benefit<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.350> having<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> put<00:01:04.890> up

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
added benefit of not having to put up

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.460 
added benefit of not having to put up
drywall<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:06.060> we're<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.290> any

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
drywall so we're not going to have any

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.500 
drywall so we're not going to have any
drywall<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> house<00:01:08.310> that's<00:01:09.119> one<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.390> our

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
drywall in the house that's one of our

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
drywall in the house that's one of our
courses<00:01:11.119> that<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.380> anyway<00:01:14.210> there

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
courses that I think what anyway there

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
courses that I think what anyway there
is<00:01:15.390> there's<00:01:16.340> sustainable<00:01:17.340> drywall

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
is there's sustainable drywall

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.550 
is there's sustainable drywall
alternatives<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.380> don't

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
alternatives out there but if you don't

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.590 
alternatives out there but if you don't
have<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> use<00:01:19.950> why<00:01:20.130> why<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.479> this

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
have to use why why not because in this

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.710 
have to use why why not because in this
case<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:23.820> furniture<00:01:24.150> when<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.479> build

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720

there's<00:02:15.200> lots<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.530> things<00:02:15.590> wrong<00:02:15.920> because

there's lots of things wrong because

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.770 
there's lots of things wrong because
when<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.790> look<00:02:16.910> at<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.060> for<00:02:17.300> forestry

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
when you look at it for forestry

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.590 
when you look at it for forestry
perspective<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:19.010> takes<00:02:19.360> over<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.390> hundred

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
perspective it takes over a hundred

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.890 
perspective it takes over a hundred
years<00:02:20.690> for<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.640> forest<00:02:22.640> layer<00:02:23.510> of

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
years for that forest layer of

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.020 
years for that forest layer of
generations<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.770> reestablish<00:02:25.010> itself<00:02:25.670> so

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
generations to reestablish itself so

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.420 
generations to reestablish itself so
it's<00:02:26.180> for<00:02:26.330> now<00:02:26.739> and<00:02:27.739> likely<00:02:27.950> they're<00:02:28.190> going<00:02:28.340> to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
it's for now and likely they're going to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's for now and likely they're going to
put<00:02:28.610> pine<00:02:28.820> trees<00:02:29.090> on<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.959> what<00:02:30.290> we've<00:02:30.440> done

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.740 
get educated me about what's called a
crop<00:03:26.010> pre-release<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.940> that's<00:03:27.510> where<00:03:27.720> you

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
crop pre-release and that's where you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.819 
crop pre-release and that's where you
basically<00:03:27.989> go<00:03:28.379> in<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.840> forest<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:31.500> taught<00:03:31.709> me

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
basically go in and forest we taught me

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.500 
basically go in and forest we taught me
how<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:31.980> recognize<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.730> preferable<00:03:33.150> trees

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
how to recognize the preferable trees

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.879 
how to recognize the preferable trees
and<00:03:34.159> you'll<00:03:35.159> see<00:03:35.430> GU<00:03:36.060> rings<00:03:37.049> on<00:03:37.349> certain<00:03:37.680> trees

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
and you'll see GU rings on certain trees

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.410 
and you'll see GU rings on certain trees
that<00:03:38.129> are<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.280> ones<00:03:38.430> everything<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.299> then

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
that are the ones everything and then

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.390 
that are the ones everything and then
just<00:03:39.599> basically<00:03:39.870> go<00:03:40.049> along<00:03:40.349> with<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
just basically go along with the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.270 
just basically go along with the
chainsaw<00:03:41.639> and<00:03:41.879> cut<00:03:41.970> their<00:03:42.269> competitor<00:03:42.810> so

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
chainsaw and cut their competitor so

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.649 
chainsaw and cut their competitor so
that's<00:03:44.280> where<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.549> began<00:03:44.790> before<00:03:45.000> we<00:03:45.209> even<00:03:45.329> had

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
that's where it began before we even had

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.270 
that's where it began before we even had
our<00:03:45.840> policies<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.870> at<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.859> point<00:03:50.069> we<00:03:50.250> were

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
our policies and at that point we were

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.539 
our policies and at that point we were
camping<00:03:50.760> in<00:03:50.909> a<00:03:51.030> 1960s<00:03:51.569> teardrop<00:03:52.560> camper<00:03:52.769> in

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
camping in a 1960s teardrop camper in

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.210 
camping in a 1960s teardrop camper in
the<00:03:53.700> middle<00:03:53.939> of<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.090> field<00:03:55.099> occasionally<00:03:56.099> we

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
the middle of the field occasionally we

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.979 
the middle of the field occasionally we
put<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.519> camper<00:03:56.879> out<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.209> March<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.780> would<00:03:57.900> be

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
put the camper out in March and would be

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.140 
put the camper out in March and would be
the<00:03:58.139> perfect<00:03:58.440> spot<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.220> then<00:03:59.790> we<00:03:59.879> come<00:04:00.120> back

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
the perfect spot and then we come back

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.849 
the perfect spot and then we come back
and<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.540> would<00:04:00.629> be<00:04:00.720> May<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.109> we<00:04:01.230> we<00:04:01.560> picked

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
and it would be May and we we picked

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.539 
and it would be May and we we picked
like<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.220> perfect<00:04:02.489> patch<00:04:02.819> of<00:04:02.970> poison<00:04:03.090> ivy<00:04:03.440> to

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
like the perfect patch of poison ivy to

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:13.960 
like the perfect patch of poison ivy to
put<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.669> camper

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.259 

versus<00:04:14.970> instead<00:04:15.270> of<00:04:15.360> children<00:04:16.459> understand<00:04:17.459> so

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
versus instead of children understand so

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.640 
versus instead of children understand so
what<00:04:18.390> is<00:04:18.420> that<00:04:18.630> understand<00:04:19.079> across<00:04:19.470> at

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
what is that understand across at

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.920 
what is that understand across at
understanding<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.370> we<00:04:20.700> simply<00:04:21.570> are<00:04:21.750> more

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
understanding is that we simply are more

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.010 
understanding is that we simply are more
aware<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.230> how<00:04:22.350> we<00:04:22.790> use<00:04:23.790> power<00:04:24.090> so<00:04:24.780> for<00:04:24.960> example

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
aware of how we use power so for example

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.870 
aware of how we use power so for example
you'll<00:04:25.560> notice<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.980> change<00:04:26.010> for<00:04:26.340> years<00:04:26.580> on<00:04:26.760> the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
you'll notice a change for years on the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.280 
you'll notice a change for years on the
walls<00:04:27.590> last<00:04:28.590> night<00:04:28.830> we<00:04:29.540> returned<00:04:30.540> off<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.990> one

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
walls last night we returned off the one

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.920 
walls last night we returned off the one
camping<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.070> its<00:04:32.970> value<00:04:33.270> operation<00:04:33.810> and

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
camping and its value operation and

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.159 
camping and its value operation and
operated<00:04:34.590> by<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.400> candy<00:04:35.760> mine<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.090> perfect<00:04:36.540> so

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
operated by a candy mine is perfect so

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.260 
operated by a candy mine is perfect so
we'll<00:04:37.860> continue<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.370> make<00:04:38.490> those<00:04:38.610> choices<00:04:38.850> as

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
we'll continue to make those choices as

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.960 
we'll continue to make those choices as
the<00:04:39.840> house<00:04:39.990> is<00:04:40.200> built<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.830> then<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:41.610> think

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
the house is built and then you think

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.840 
the house is built and then you think
about<00:04:42.440> what<00:04:43.440> kind<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.680> materials<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:44.370> use<00:04:44.640> are

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
about what kind of materials you use are

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.490 
about what kind of materials you use are
they<00:04:44.970> are<00:04:45.270> degradable<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:46.200> on<00:04:46.320> all<00:04:46.350> the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
they are degradable and so on all the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.440 
they are degradable and so on all the
regular<00:04:46.919> standard<00:04:47.190> stuff<00:04:47.700> that<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.090> do<00:04:48.270> today

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
regular standard stuff that you do today

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.240 
regular standard stuff that you do today
construction<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:49.740> what<00:04:49.950> I<00:04:49.980> want<00:04:50.130> to

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
construction but what I want to

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.710 
construction but what I want to
emphasize<00:04:50.730> is<00:04:51.030> that<00:04:51.060> it's<00:04:51.360> much<00:04:51.540> more

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
emphasize is that it's much more

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.840 
emphasize is that it's much more
important<00:04:52.320> for<00:04:52.470> us<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.919> think<00:04:53.070> about<00:04:53.520> how<00:04:53.790> are

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
important for us to think about how are

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:43.809 
witnessed how the pulse performs with

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.079 
witnessed how the pulse performs with
nothing<00:05:44.259> i<00:05:44.499> mean<00:05:44.739> we<00:05:45.459> know<00:05:45.610> what<00:05:45.819> the<00:05:45.939> house

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
nothing i mean we know what the house

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.820 
nothing i mean we know what the house
feels<00:05:46.419> like<00:05:46.659> when<00:05:46.869> it's<00:05:47.019> 10<00:05:47.259> degrees<00:05:47.379> outside

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
feels like when it's 10 degrees outside

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:56.850 
feels like when it's 10 degrees outside
and<00:05:48.099> we<00:05:48.369> still<00:05:48.610> have<00:05:48.789> no<00:05:48.819> systems<00:05:55.649> just<00:05:56.649> for

and we still have no systems just for
fun<00:05:57.099> i'm<00:05:57.369> so<00:05:57.999> excited<00:05:58.119> these<00:05:58.749> six<00:05:59.110> degrees<00:05:59.830> and

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
fun i'm so excited these six degrees and

morning at 45 degrees so it sounds

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:21.959 
morning at 45 degrees so it sounds
horribly<00:06:20.860> cold<00:06:21.159> but<00:06:21.519> actually<00:06:21.819> isn't

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
horribly cold but actually isn't

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.059 
horribly cold but actually isn't
offensive<00:06:22.269> end<00:06:22.479> we<00:06:22.569> use<00:06:22.719> outside<00:06:22.959> and<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:23.889> just

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
offensive end we use outside and it just

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.799 
offensive end we use outside and it just
means<00:06:24.219> that<00:06:24.339> the<00:06:24.610> building<00:06:24.999> envelope<00:06:25.179> works

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:25.809 
means that the building envelope works

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:30.499 
means that the building envelope works
and<00:06:27.569> it<00:06:28.569> works<00:06:28.599> in<00:06:28.989> the<00:06:29.079> way<00:06:29.229> that<00:06:29.409> it<00:06:29.559> it

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
and it works in the way that it it

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.969 
and it works in the way that it it
optimizes<00:06:31.509> absorption<00:06:32.469> of<00:06:32.529> heat<00:06:32.589> from<00:06:32.889> the

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
optimizes absorption of heat from the

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.679 
optimizes absorption of heat from the
outside<00:06:33.429> and<00:06:33.729> it<00:06:33.849> minimizes<00:06:36.209> and<00:06:37.209> so<00:06:37.389> you<00:06:37.449> need

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:37.689 
outside and it minimizes and so you need

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.459 
outside and it minimizes and so you need
much<00:06:37.899> less<00:06:38.399> to<00:06:39.399> get<00:06:39.789> to<00:06:40.209> what<00:06:40.899> you<00:06:41.050> consider

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469 
much less to get to what you consider

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:46.139 
much less to get to what you consider
your<00:06:41.860> comfortable<00:06:42.729> 68<00:06:44.519> you<00:06:45.519> need<00:06:45.699> much<00:06:45.879> less

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.149 
your comfortable 68 you need much less

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:57.380 
your comfortable 68 you need much less
systems

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.740 

and<00:06:58.890> the<00:06:59.890> result<00:07:00.550> the<00:07:00.790> energy<00:07:01.090> audit<00:07:01.240> was<00:07:01.480> that

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
and the result the energy audit was that

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.720 
and the result the energy audit was that
they<00:07:01.840> recommended<00:07:02.380> so<00:07:03.040> forward<00:07:03.460> to<00:07:03.490> that

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
they recommended so forward to that

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.300 
they recommended so forward to that
scene<00:07:03.970> there<00:07:04.180> we've<00:07:04.360> begun<00:07:04.600> that<00:07:04.750> process

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
scene there we've begun that process

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.050 
scene there we've begun that process
that<00:07:06.310> because<00:07:06.610> they<00:07:06.700> were<00:07:06.790> able<00:07:06.850> to

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
that because they were able to

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.630 
that because they were able to
demonstrate<00:07:07.810> that<00:07:08.290> was<00:07:08.530> some<00:07:09.160> pictures<00:07:09.430> there

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:09.640 
demonstrate that was some pictures there

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:17.030 
demonstrate that was some pictures there
and<00:07:10.420> things<00:07:10.870> like<00:07:10.990> that<00:07:11.050> but<00:07:12.930> so<00:07:13.930> behavior<00:07:15.690> we

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
and things like that but so behavior we

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.040 
and things like that but so behavior we
the<00:07:18.150> system's<00:07:19.150> ended<00:07:19.420> up<00:07:19.540> being<00:07:19.750> actually

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
the system's ended up being actually

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.240 
the system's ended up being actually
very<00:07:20.320> simple<00:07:20.590> I<00:07:21.420> can<00:07:22.800> start<00:07:23.800> at<00:07:23.920> the<00:07:23.980> Warren

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
very simple I can start at the Warren

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.910 
very simple I can start at the Warren
collection<00:07:24.700> week
