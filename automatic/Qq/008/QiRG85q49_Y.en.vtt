00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
to make them look a little bit sharper

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.000 
to make them look a little bit sharper
so<00:02:18.640> I'm<00:02:18.730> just<00:02:18.819> going<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.560> tap<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:20.830> the

so I'm just going to tap it in the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.540 
so I'm just going to tap it in the
studio<00:02:21.310> finish<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:23.050> just<00:02:23.290> create<00:02:23.550> that
