00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 good afternoon today i wish you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.720
 present this video what's the difference 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.820
 between the steering rack 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.780
 golf 2 and passat b3 let's start with the fact that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 the first 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.930
 noticeable difference and that is the length itself 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.779
 slats 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:29.630
 length of the river golf 2 she is 500 25 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.360
 millimeters and the length of the river passat b3 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.380
 is 530 millimeters i.e. on 5 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.329
 millimeters it goes more that is 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:46.860
 longer farther as we notice and that is 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.440
 the difference is the teeth themselves the teeth go under different 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.350
 golf angle 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:01:01.350
 is about 1 there is one corner in passat b3 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.949
 another it is applied so that you passat 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.979
 b3 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.189
 now i keep the worm off with him and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:15.180
 on 5 petals myself 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:20.159
 it's a worm yes and at golf it goes to 6 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.540
 petals plus if you notice goes still 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.150
 length difference 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:31.369
 that is, there are more bison here than golf 2 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.140
 less golf is on the trade wind easier 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.729
 spin the wheel that is to say 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.200
 adapter between the hydraulic booster and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.820
 simple rail roughly speaking here 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.430
 fear is better the difference is still there 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.390
 noticeable so why did the lecture turn the wheel 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.549
 on the river from trades 53 because here we are 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:04.380
 we will come out and that is the fry which is on 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:07.770
 which we tighten the steering wheel if 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:13.830
 she taps yes here she goes with 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.959
 nylon rate yes to g3 and golf 2 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.150
 she goes unpretentious can there some 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.579
 have a brass kneel or something 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:31.319
 so similar as for the enclosures that 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:34.260
 d3 here it is inside, as it were, too 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.370
 nylon rate sleeve tu corps 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.660
 same 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.299
 what b300 2 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.750
 there can only be a difference if 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.609
 mechanics and there for example on the Passat b3 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.000
 it may not be this 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.280
 mounts but it is if the box is there 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.569
 goes to the cable if that is simple 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.569
 Kuris this here it's traction on it 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.079
 still such cardinal changes more 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:08.100
 no regard to what most rail Cat 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.389
 I'd rather say he passat b3 rake 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.560
 better because 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:16.260
 and the steering wheel is easier as if on the power steering 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.920
 and but still it's not power steering 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.609
 of the other, but on the graph it seems to be such 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.180
 tight 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:32.040
 but it's all that little stuff compared 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:35.130
 why everybody why are they so black 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.880
 This is from the fact that the moisture got there or 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:43.669
 water why does she get there because 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.669
 if you have for example 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.840
 there is such a boot and on top here he 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.590
 Comes yes if it is torn you moisture 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.810
 gets here through this hole and 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.400
 through the bearing and it spreads 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:06.650
 completely wigs and it's bad that she 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.660
 just starts to rust 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.770
 there are pimples of fossa and all that 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.800
 like because of this it follows 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.160
 conclusion make sure that you have this 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.260
 boot was always on normal 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.300
 condition and was not torn because 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.700
 I was Parma and moisture hit and 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:33.670
 consequence I changed two slats like this 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.670
 Thank you all for your attention.
