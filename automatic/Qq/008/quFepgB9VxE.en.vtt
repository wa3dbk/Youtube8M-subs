00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 d 4 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.630
 web 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.440
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.440
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.140
 Today is eh 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.780
 Well, it's a market for animal photographers, is it today? 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.480
 That Japan 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.720
 72100 mm is equivalent to grave 72100 mm tf 2.8 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.000
 the same 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.430
 Spec 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.390
 Japan 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.079
 I will try to compare the telephoto zoom lens with 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.770
 This is Canon's 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.050
 ef 74100 mm 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.050
 I say f 2.8 l 2 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:53.760
 It is about to support the high evaluation of that very much 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 On the other hand, this was new the other day, but the voice of Fujifilm's x series 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.990
 Because 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.980
 xf 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:06.159
 55 of 140 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.250
 is a two-part mixing of f 2.8 in Maa 50,140 of Tteyuu millimeter camera of aps c 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.720
 Because 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.530
 If you convert to 35 mm , it's just because 100 mm 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.409
 Because there is almost 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.409
 I would like to compare these two for a while today 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.390
 I 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.350
 It is the best from the patch or patch 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.160
 I Burley is an open specific 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.060
 wallet 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.060
 Four days 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.580
 Roots But comfort yer 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.770
 In the fortress 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.180
 It bloomed in with Dinner 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.180
 Is this young ? 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.200
 Pedigree 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.650
 Toka I also 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.090
 Do the group with the cannonball 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.090
 I think it 's kind of a reverse 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.709
 I will call it data 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.080
 It is early in Mitaka 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.210
 Yeah yeah yeah
