from plants you might still be curious
how<00:00:13.500> green<00:00:13.920> living<00:00:14.370> organisms<00:00:15.030> could

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
how green living organisms could

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.120 
how green living organisms could

you might also want to know what kind of
physical<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.550> chemical<00:00:24.789> changes<00:00:25.089> take<00:00:25.840> place

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
physical and chemical changes take place

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.859 
physical and chemical changes take place
during<00:00:26.500> this<00:00:26.769> process<00:00:27.039> and<00:00:27.759> why<00:00:28.509> these

during this process and why these
changes<00:00:29.470> are<00:00:29.739> significant

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.850

changes<00:00:39.580> have<00:00:39.940> taken<00:00:40.180> place

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.350 

these<00:00:45.350> gave<00:00:45.649> rise<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:45.950> a<00:00:46.309> myriad<00:00:46.730> life<00:00:46.970> forms

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
these gave rise to a myriad life forms

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.229 
these gave rise to a myriad life forms
including<00:00:48.350> coal<00:00:48.590> which<00:00:49.340> came<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:49.880> play<00:00:50.090> an

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
including coal which came to play an

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.110 
including coal which came to play an
integral<00:00:50.540> part<00:00:50.960> in<00:00:51.290> humans<00:00:51.680> lives

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.690 

so<00:00:55.120> how<00:00:55.270> did<00:00:55.330> coal<00:00:55.780> or<00:00:56.200> black<00:00:56.710> gold<00:00:57.070> as<00:00:57.340> it<00:00:57.580> is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
so how did coal or black gold as it is

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.440 
so how did coal or black gold as it is
also<00:00:57.880> known<00:00:58.270> come<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:59.140> exist<00:00:59.970> let's<00:01:00.970> look<00:01:01.240> for
