00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.790
 when my point of view was quite 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.570
 good this week because we could 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.929
 work more specifically with Guillermo 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 vÃ¡zquez fundamentals that have to 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.580
 we went back to pick up that they are very 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.380
 important in football and more in these 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 instances where competition is very 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.740
 strong and we have to do well our 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.670
 I work mostly in the defensive part 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.619
 get better and better 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.870
 close spaces for the forwards 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.960
 rivals and doing their job well 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.489
 starting from that base to be able to contribute what 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 greater than it can cope on 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.510
 all in forums like laterals and in front 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.330
 and try to give a little bit of support to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.769
 the people above the most important thing what 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.050
 What is worth mentioning is going out with the 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.910
 winning mentality that's always going to be 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 important to be able to get or 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.629
 aspire to achieve success and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.220
 dessert the three points that are very 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.610
 important to keep adding and continuing 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.680
 on this path that we managed to achieve 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.090
 the last game with three points follow 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.399
 by the same line that does very 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.050
 important to resume with the 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.660
 mentality of working to get the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.520
 team where you are and do it 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.619
 protagonist again put in the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.869
 places where this team deserves and is 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.020
 institution because of the size that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.670
 is that he has then we are with the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.430
 look set to continue working and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.860
 improve that the most important thing 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.590
 to get points that we have to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.750
 to start from it would be a pleasure to taste 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.940
 will again take to pumas 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.600
 places everything implies an effort a 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.200
 sacrifice we are working for that and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.570
 just like the last tournament we did it 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.070
 we took the caste each one contributed his 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.560
 grain of sand that was very important 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.720
 and we managed to maintain for several 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.400
 days especially in the final straight in 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.020
 the first places that are very 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.150
 important now we want to repeat what 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.740
 same but for this we need to go 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.310
 party to party work day to day 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.509
 day to go go pulling trumps 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.460
 that is going to be very important especially 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.220
 points that will give us the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.619
 possibility to be there we have an idea 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.920
 of the game that left a lot of dynamics a lot 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.520
 pressure is playing good football and good 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.470
 both I, not a person, and my partner 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.350
 we get to that though missing 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.340
 a lot of work is important work 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.930
 what are we doing and we hope to go little 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.340
 little improving that still much remains 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.190
 and not the truth that not here but it was 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.130
 clear when it came everyone has the same 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.960
 possibility of playing 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.470
 Well, I had to be on the bench 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.770
 but if I had minutes so I did not either 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.810
 I can not complain so that's that 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.160
 important that at least if not be 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.900
 in the initial have minutes and good here 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.140
 which is better is the teacher is going to put 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.870
 on court or the possibility of studying 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.990
 that javi was not around to be in the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.600
 eleven and good one works for that and more 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.330
 yes because good as I said 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.150
 I came with a good amount of goals here 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.189
 puma they brought me to make goals but 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.470
 I know that I am in debt that I can 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.540
 I can give more 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.290
 it's good that the goals I made were 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.260
 few but I do not take it with so much 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.950
 drama I know that with work and the 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.950
 possibility of playing
