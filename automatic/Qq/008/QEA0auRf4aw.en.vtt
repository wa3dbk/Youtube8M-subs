shape too alright let's see if we get it
started

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.790 

yeah

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.970 

good<00:03:26.800> enough

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.040 

you<00:03:32.980> can<00:03:33.130> see<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.400> has<00:03:33.550> all<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.910> original

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
you can see it has all the original

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.430 
you can see it has all the original
pinstriping<00:03:35.050> on<00:03:35.550> on<00:03:36.550> this<00:03:37.060> color

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
pinstriping on on this color

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.220 
pinstriping on on this color
hand-painted<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.400> decided<00:03:39.790> not<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.230> restore

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
hand-painted so I decided not to restore

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.340 
hand-painted so I decided not to restore
it<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.530> figured<00:03:41.800> it<00:03:42.069> might<00:03:42.220> be<00:03:42.400> worth<00:03:42.610> more<00:03:43.350> to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
it I figured it might be worth more to

00:03:44.350 --> 00:04:08.190 
it I figured it might be worth more to
most<00:03:44.950> people<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.520> way<00:03:45.640> it<00:03:45.760> is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.100 

smithing<00:04:09.129> the<00:04:09.250> lens<00:04:09.750> originally<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.900> went

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
smithing the lens originally that went

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.009 
smithing the lens originally that went
in<00:04:11.230> there<00:04:11.379> and<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:12.510> couldn't<00:04:13.510> figure<00:04:13.660> out<00:04:13.780> how

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
in there and I couldn't figure out how

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.540 
in there and I couldn't figure out how
to<00:04:14.080> get<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.290> lens<00:04:14.530> in<00:04:14.739> there<00:04:14.890> without<00:04:15.040> breaking

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
to get a lens in there without breaking

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.409 
to get a lens in there without breaking
the<00:04:15.670> other<00:04:15.819> lenses<00:04:16.299> so<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:16.510> just<00:04:17.310> made<00:04:18.310> up<00:04:18.419> lens

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
the other lenses so I just made up lens

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.510 
the other lenses so I just made up lens
out<00:04:19.720> of<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:20.010> hotel<00:04:21.010> light<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:22.290> just<00:04:23.520> super

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
out of a hotel light and just super

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.150 
out of a hotel light and just super
glued<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:24.850> on<00:04:24.970> there<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:26.380> way<00:04:26.530> if<00:04:26.710> somebody

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
glued it on there that way if somebody

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.710 
glued it on there that way if somebody
doesn't<00:04:27.460> want<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.820> on<00:04:27.940> there<00:04:28.120> if<00:04:28.240> they<00:04:28.419> want<00:04:28.570> to

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
doesn't want it on there if they want to

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.240 
doesn't want it on there if they want to
restore<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.110> original<00:04:29.680> they<00:04:29.830> can<00:04:29.950> get<00:04:30.100> that

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
restore it original they can get that

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.070 
restore it original they can get that
off<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.639> there<00:04:30.700> real<00:04:30.910> easy<00:04:31.120> just<00:04:31.570> superglue

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
off of there real easy just superglue

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:43.560 
off of there real easy just superglue
and<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:34.270> other<00:04:34.360> lenses<00:04:34.780> are<00:04:34.900> all<00:04:35.020> right

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.630 

and<00:04:44.080> see<00:04:44.230> all<00:04:44.320> that<00:04:44.470> pinch<00:04:44.740> they<00:04:44.980> did<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.220> lot<00:04:45.400> to

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
and see all that pinch they did a lot to

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.310 
and see all that pinch they did a lot to
pinstripe<00:04:46.180> this<00:04:46.420> thing<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.220> does<00:04:48.430> have<00:04:48.760> a

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
pinstripe this thing and it does have a

couple<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:50.530> dents<00:04:50.740> on<00:04:50.980> this<00:04:51.190> side<00:04:51.460> in<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:53.110> tank

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
couple of dents on this side in the tank

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.630 
couple of dents on this side in the tank
see<00:04:54.550> right<00:04:54.760> here<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.390> shallow<00:04:55.690> dent<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:57.460> then

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
right under here dented and right up

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:08.820 
right under here dented and right up
here<00:05:04.170> there's<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.410> original<00:05:05.500> plate

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.890 

tidy<00:05:09.490> plate<00:05:10.350> serial<00:05:11.350> numbers<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:11.830> whatnot

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.740 

minimal<00:05:15.770> rust<00:05:16.220> on<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:16.669> nothing's<00:05:17.150> rusted

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
minimal rust on this nothing's rusted

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.390 
minimal rust on this nothing's rusted
through<00:05:17.780> it's<00:05:18.139> just<00:05:18.320> got<00:05:18.440> surface<00:05:18.800> rust<00:05:19.040> in<00:05:19.310> a

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
through it's just got surface rust in a

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.040 
through it's just got surface rust in a
couple<00:05:19.699> spots<00:05:20.590> so<00:05:22.419> other<00:05:23.419> than<00:05:23.510> that<00:05:23.660> it's<00:05:23.900> in

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
couple spots so other than that it's in

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.490 
couple spots so other than that it's in
good<00:05:24.080> condition
