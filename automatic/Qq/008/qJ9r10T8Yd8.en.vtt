00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello like such seats you ask yourself 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.700
 now it's basically quite simple - 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.559
 Recently, when a tripod so eradicating 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.190
 what's stuck on top is broken 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.450
 Broken 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.389
 I had two options now 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.770
 either I do not do a video or me 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.970
 race again with the camera one hand 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.130
 up and then of course I thought so 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.420
 Only clear as the run I stop 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.189
 The camera is very classic 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.019
 I'll go back to the cellar but then 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.640
 I thought for a moment with me the guy the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.410
 untidily I could do him the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.029
 theoretically on pipes I have to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.730
 changed my mind and now I have the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.500
 Solution found because of my strategy 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.719
 what I'm using right now I use one 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 shrine and an external hard disk and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.739
 Now you ask yourself why the external 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.719
 hard disk with this camera is yes 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.010
 porn zoom lens what you stand out 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.750
 or is the external hard drive without 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.420
 So that the case and became swift 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.840
 magic is counted on data about the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.469
 super body marie claire so bild.de what 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.910
 last meeting with youtube everything and so 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.890
 shit all a lot of you have to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.879
 michael was totally in favor of ried because 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.559
 I've had it here oftener 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.570
 said penultimate week of friday my 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.010
 last day of school and here on saturday like that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.900
 I brought a video from where I am at the beginning 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.760
 That meant six days since the last one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.200
 school day have elapsed and someone the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.060
 she has to think now 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.740
 heck and friday until one week later 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.540
 Saturday will be six days 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.030
 yes that does not fit that does not fit 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.700
 that and eight days but how come 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.610
 but something was said though 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.170
 is not really only just me 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.180
 That's what I did 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.070
 once Mondays and Thursdays videos 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.960
 At least I'm on the forum at least 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 he has been so since the beginning of this channel 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.710
 I worked just fine on Thursday 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.090
 early turned the video and fit yes 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.340
 even the six days of friday 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.810
 Thursday was from Saturday to Saturday 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.570
 thursday my saturday he is the first 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.670
 friday had been cut yes turned 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.020
 Everything finished, I thought 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.939
 horny I'm still good in the time 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.740
 because a mw 1 pm I usually have 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.380
 I have to stop at 4pm 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.630
 roadside haas is everything 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.159
 supertoll oh wait right because the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.090
 chance there just calculated and always so 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.270
 At 80 percent is easy 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.340
 the computer mouse i have been blue screen 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.500
 Do not be shut down just like that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.179
 that I'll find the computer right away 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.340
 once again the project gets started 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.830
 fortunately, caching names 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.080
 again the shit edges lubricated 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.459
 again 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.840
 maybe my notebook is overheating 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.700
 or such a shit I know what 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.069
 I spend my own hour on the screen 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.049
 turned that the bottom part of the notebook 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.080
 stop so outside comes after 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.340
 changed up again where you from 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.470
 really what I do is was 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.940
 already 18 o'clock so I yes and 19 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.060
 Clock does not have to knock out any more video 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.530
 you do it on Friday so easy 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.120
 Then it all worked out well 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.860
 with the race and stands and in 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.329
 lauchheim cut again so i could 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.250
 then it was on youtube oberland 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.290

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.879
 I have video tags the tags and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.739

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.150
 youtube completely uploaded and needs 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.530
 Now until I wait for it 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.840

 Eight the video is public though 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.750
 but not at any box so not at you 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.370
 So there was no one sent online 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.959

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.000
 Also, then again shit was white 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.680

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.540
 I either let her do it now 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.670

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.019
 completely disappears has been turned 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.209
 which nobody actually saw 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.590
 but wayne without me doing it like that 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.970
 I also did it in the end 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.370
 deleted and the next day again 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.470
 uploaded so on saturday and so are 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.260
 delays come every two days because 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.150
 I do not like the universe 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.650
 Keller still has a chair that way 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.630
 Turn it's an office shot a lot 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.290
 Better not sit on the camping chair 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.970
 seats 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.769
 I'm going next time unless 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.139
 a tripod does not like to eat again 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:57.180
 Karin here and then I sit on the 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:59.470
 swivel chair dtm otherwise you prefer drinking 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.400
 does not recognize speak but seriously 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.739
 I'm really interested now 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.560
 Is that alright when I'm here 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.329

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.859

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.360
 I do not own it because I have it 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.769
 no idea how that hardly ever you will be 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.689
 you the worst when the scenery 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.250
 looks like shit too 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.630
 but maybe not 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.349
 I honestly have your opinion 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.579
 in the comments 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.430
 Alright that 's all my whole 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.140
 spontaneous is clearly here of one 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.789
 camping chair leaves but I'm sure 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.919
 that see us soon again and 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.900
 True , in the right way 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.900
 then it's at the table
