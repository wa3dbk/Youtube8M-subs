so now let's go under the hood one of

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.080 
so now let's go under the hood one of
the<00:02:54.800> wheels<00:02:55.040> does<00:02:55.280> have<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.459> scuffing<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.000> on

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the wheels does have a scuffing it on

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.470 
the wheels does have a scuffing it on
the<00:02:56.180> way<00:02:56.300> there<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:57.010> see<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.099> scuff<00:02:58.400> here<00:02:58.700> here
