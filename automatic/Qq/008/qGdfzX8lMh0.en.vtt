00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.110
 Y 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:40.540
 today I am with a model really 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:46.350
 interesting for its price we are 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:51.020
 talking about the prestige multi font 5 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.360
 501 and the truth is that 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.740
 we are talking about a terminal that comes out 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.180
 for free sale for only 125 euros 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.710
 it's a low-end terminal but from the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.740
 first moment in your back 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.400
 we can see that it has a signal of 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.740
 identity have taken care in the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.860
 details 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.909
 if it's true that in the front is 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.979
 quite pretty simple is worth the 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:26.560
 front would still have all the 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:29.130
 appearance of an economic phone is worth 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:35.229
 but in the back they are already appreciated 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.140
 quality details on the back 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.799
 we have 5 main camera 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.580
 megapixel flash led nfc logo 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.890
 because even being very economical 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.319
 incorporates nfc connectivity here 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.289
 we would have the speaker that by the way 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:58.119
 It has very good quality and power sounds 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:00.130
 very very well and we would not have anything else 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.679
 the back then in the part 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.590
 frontal because we have the typical we have 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:09.160
 front camera we have sensors we have 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.400
 headset and then the buttons 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.910
 they would be tactile that they would be outside the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.640
 screen 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.930
 on this side we would have simply 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.380
 the lock button on the top 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.580
 we have microusb port and jack 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.250
 headset and in this other side 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.690
 we would have volume control and in the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.780
 bottom part simply 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.750
 we would have a main microphone and nothing 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.210
 plus 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.390
 despite being in plastic its 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.710
 construction has a metal profile 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.580
 that gives a touch of more quality worth 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.760
 from the whole profile all the singing would be 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:59.400
 metal 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:09.430
 with dimensions of 149 long 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:15.670
 75 wide and 95 millimeters thick is 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:20.140
 a little chubby is worth and weighs 135 grams 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.450
 it's a bit heavy to comment also that 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.470
 in the package of sale comes a cover 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.830
 flip type that the truth that is very very 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.830
 all right 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:40.130
 his screen is quite normal is a 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:46.550
 5 inch tft screen with one 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:50.060
 resolution of 480 x 854 has 16 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:54.130
 millions of colors and the truth is that 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.130
 it's very normal and it's 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.670
 it looks 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.480
 well but it is easily appreciable to have 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.480
 some pixel 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:14.280
 is justito in definition for 5 inches 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:16.980
 comes with android 4.2 and living 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.070
 then what is in operation in 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:25.980
 general brings a dual-core processor to 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:28.139
 1.2 gigahertz and 512 MB RAM the 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.320
 internal storage is only 4 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:36.240
 gigas but we can expand it with 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:39.480
 microsd cards up to 32gb the truth 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.410
 that the operation is correct but 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:48.000
 We can not ask for wonders 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.580
 they notice slowdowns and small lag 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.710
 in some complicated tasks in what 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.250
 we put the truth that we put it on 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.250
 fix 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.590
 and a correct operation let's say 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:05.180
 for the range of phone that is 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:10.010
 which also happens with the camera 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:13.000
 camera that although it offers a performance 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.730
 more or less fine 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.110
 but you can not use it, you can not 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:23.300
 replace it with your camera 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:27.090
 habitual is worth or will go well for 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.780
 send whatsapp or something like that is worth or 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:34.260
 of some twitter something but the 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:39.180
 results are pretty pretty justito 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:45.360
 both the camera and the video 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.919
 things that do have good for example your 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.820
 battery trÃ© a battery of 2000 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:54.780
 milliamperios that yes that holds very very 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.880
 it gives for almost two days 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.610
 complete and the truth is that 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.820
 Surprise surprises a lot for the range 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.910
 of phone we are talking about other 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.759
 thing that also surprises is the care 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.080
 of the prestige brand that has had the 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:16.199
 time to take care of your design in the software 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.690
 despite not wearing a layer of android 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:22.070
 very very loaded as you can see the 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:25.820
 visual aspect is the same as android 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:30.000
 conventional pure and hard but if they have 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.470
 looked for the way to have a stamp 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.780
 indicative of them as for example 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.220
 here we have to find applications 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.389
 the application updates or 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.250
 system ok we have an icon here 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.120
 personalized then we also have a 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.139
 series of applications for example 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.060
 we have ereaders of the own brand 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.590
 we have here an installer also from the 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.979
 own brand to be able to install 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.979
 Applications 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.380
 suggested we have applications like the 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:03.290
 flashlight and here we also have by 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:06.560
 example to make nfc tags or do 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:10.590
 the launch applications 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.689
 with a certain action and also by 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.520
 example as a spectator's watch 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:18.340
 also with one of that pretty design 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:23.020
 pretty smart 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:26.010
 definitely a high phone 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:30.340
 benefits logically but if you want 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:33.010
 invest the minimum in a smartphone the 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.880
 it's really pretty good 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.880
 option
