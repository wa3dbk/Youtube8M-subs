this is the diamond sword yeah and this

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.540 
this is the diamond sword yeah and this

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.180 

think<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.640> pretty<00:00:56.760> nice<00:00:57.239> now<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> that's<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
think it's pretty nice now so that's the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.900 
think it's pretty nice now so that's the
diamond<00:00:59.579> sword<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.510> diamond<00:01:00.690> shovel

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
diamond sword this is the diamond shovel

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.960 
diamond sword this is the diamond shovel
which<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.120> more<00:01:03.300> pouring<00:01:03.719> tea<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
which is more pouring tea now like that

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.690 
which is more pouring tea now like that
pic<00:01:05.970> axis<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.470> X<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.640> gave

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
pic axis right there the X which I gave

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600 
pic axis right there the X which I gave
double<00:01:09.299> blades<00:01:09.590> because<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.400> that's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
double blades because I think that's

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.289 
double blades because I think that's
nicer<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:13.260> whole<00:01:13.500> pretty<00:01:14.010> much<00:01:14.250> no<00:01:14.520> use<00:01:14.820> but

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
nicer the whole pretty much no use but

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.800 
nicer the whole pretty much no use but
I've<00:01:16.170> changed<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.770> anyway<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.330> dimes

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
I've changed it anyway now this is dimes

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.499 
I've changed it anyway now this is dimes
itself<00:01:19.350> I've<00:01:19.799> made<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.159> red<00:01:20.189> because

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
itself I've made it red because

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
itself I've made it red because
otherwise<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.840> won't<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.110> logic<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
otherwise it won't be logic you the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.679 
otherwise it won't be logic you the
tools<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.670> red<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.850> diamond<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.509> should

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
tools will be red and diamond is should

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.130 
tools will be red and diamond is should
like<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.189> fit<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.090> I've<00:01:27.600> made<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
like you so I fit they I've made that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.420 
like you so I fit they I've made that
one<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.590> well<00:01:30.229> yeah<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.470> some<00:01:31.680> few<00:01:32.159> more

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
one as well yeah and some few more

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.450 
one as well yeah and some few more
things<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.880> changed<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.439> gold<00:01:35.130> tools

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
things have changed is the gold tools

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.499 
things have changed is the gold tools
right<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:37.400> yeah<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> made<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> Swart<00:01:39.210> more

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
right here yeah I made the Swart more

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.310 
right here yeah I made the Swart more
sparkly<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.610> nicer<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.390> made<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.079> one

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
sparkly and nicer and made this one

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
sparkly and nicer and made this one
different<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> X<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.880> well<00:01:45.119> because<00:01:45.659> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
different and the X as well because I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.590 
different and the X as well because I
think<00:01:46.530> golden<00:01:47.189> tools<00:01:47.430> serve<00:01:47.939> more<00:01:48.210> credit

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
think golden tools serve more credit

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.660 
think golden tools serve more credit
because<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:49.229> hard<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> get<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> gold<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.579> if

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
because it's hard to get the gold and if

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.730 
because it's hard to get the gold and if
you<00:01:50.820> made<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> tools<00:01:51.450> you're<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.170> yes<00:01:52.409> yes

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
you made the tools you're like yes yes

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.679 
you made the tools you're like yes yes
I've<00:01:52.920> got<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.880> breaks<00:01:54.299> pretty

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
I've got it and then it breaks pretty

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.289 
I've got it and then it breaks pretty
fast<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.320> sucks<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.790> gonna<00:01:56.939> make<00:01:57.180> it

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
fast so that sucks so I'm gonna make it

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.630 
fast so that sucks so I'm gonna make it
way<00:01:57.479> nicer<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> start<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
way nicer and it's just the start of it

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.950 
way nicer and it's just the start of it
yeah<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.540> deserves<00:02:03.659> more

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
yeah because I think it deserves more

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.740 
yeah because I think it deserves more
credit<00:02:04.189> now<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.549> next<00:02:05.729> thing<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.149> live<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.689> the
