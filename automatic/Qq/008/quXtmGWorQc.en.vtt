is on a USB 3 slot

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.490 
is on a USB 3 slot
the<00:02:16.860> file<00:02:17.099> transfer<00:02:17.450> rate<00:02:18.450> depends<00:02:18.989> on

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
the file transfer rate depends on

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.920 
the file transfer rate depends on
various<00:02:20.069> factors<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.909> file<00:02:21.150> size<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> file

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
various factors the file size a file

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.610 
various factors the file size a file
format<00:02:22.409> and<00:02:22.730> stuff<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.909> that<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:25.290> might

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
format and stuff like that so it might

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.580 
format and stuff like that so it might
go<00:02:25.950> up<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.370> down<00:02:26.760> depending<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.689> that<00:02:27.900> so

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
go up and down depending on that so

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.410 
go up and down depending on that so
let's<00:02:28.799> quickly<00:02:29.010> move<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.609> USB<00:02:29.969> 2<00:02:30.120> slot

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
let's quickly move on to the USB 2 slot

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.220 
let's quickly move on to the USB 2 slot
the<00:02:30.750> same<00:02:31.019> file<00:02:31.379> on<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> USB<00:02:31.920> 2<00:02:32.189> slot<00:02:32.689> as<00:02:33.689> you<00:02:34.079> can

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
the same file on a USB 2 slot as you can

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.949 
the same file on a USB 2 slot as you can
see<00:02:34.409> we<00:02:34.620> are<00:02:34.739> getting<00:02:34.980> only<00:02:35.640> 30<00:02:36.299> MB

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
see we are getting only 30 MB

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.390 
see we are getting only 30 MB
approximately<00:02:38.510> per<00:02:39.510> second<00:02:40.159> which<00:02:41.159> is<00:02:41.189> very

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
approximately per second which is very

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.009 
approximately per second which is very
slow<00:02:42.209> on<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.569> USB<00:02:42.959> 2<00:02:43.260> slot<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:45.030> best<00:02:45.420> suited

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
slow on a USB 2 slot so it's best suited

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.289 
slow on a USB 2 slot so it's best suited
I<00:02:46.049> mean<00:02:46.260> it's<00:02:46.469> best<00:02:46.889> to<00:02:47.549> connect<00:02:47.939> the<00:02:48.090> hard

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
I mean it's best to connect the hard

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.940 
I mean it's best to connect the hard

is<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.699> bit<00:03:20.940> shot<00:03:21.799> -<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:24.030> hard<00:03:24.359> drive<00:03:24.569> is

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
