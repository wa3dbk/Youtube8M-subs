00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
very white and I was at a crossroads

very white and I was at a crossroads
with<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.350> wanting<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.980> gone<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:24.000> I

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.570 
wasn't ready to cut it out of my hair
because<00:00:27.800> then<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> would<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.099> been<00:00:29.310> too
