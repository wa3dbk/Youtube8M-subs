00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
so this gives a better viewing

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.990 
so this gives a better viewing

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
loudspeaker so how does it compare with

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.950 
loudspeaker so how does it compare with
its<00:00:22.859> direct<00:00:23.279> rival<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.789> front<00:00:24.150> stereotypical

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
its direct rival in front stereotypical

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.890 
its direct rival in front stereotypical

also has the frontier speakers so the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
also has the frontier speakers so the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
question is which is a better device in

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.790 
question is which is a better device in
terms<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.980> stereo<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.190> stereo<00:00:47.969> audio<00:00:48.059> quality

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
it's not a quiet environment right now

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.090 
it's not a quiet environment right now
but<00:00:51.750> let's<00:00:52.350> give<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> shot

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
but let's give it a shot

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
but let's give it a shot
so<00:00:53.340> let's<00:00:53.699> launch<00:00:53.910> walkman<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.110> two

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
so let's launch walkman so we have two

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.420 
so let's launch walkman so we have two
devices<00:00:55.770> set<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.579> play<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> same<00:00:57.149> audio<00:00:58.109> file

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
devices set to play the same audio file

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.709 
devices set to play the same audio file
and<00:00:59.430> see<00:01:00.329> which<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.890> better<00:01:02.270> so<00:01:03.270> first<00:01:03.600> we

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and see which one is better so first we

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:41.320 
and see which one is better so first we
have<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> Sony<00:01:04.260> Xperia<00:01:04.409> z2

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.790 

and<00:01:42.330> now<00:01:42.450> let's<00:01:42.690> compare<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.080> with<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.320> HTC

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
and now let's compare it with the HTC

00:01:43.800 --> 00:02:21.990 
and now let's compare it with the HTC
One

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.510 

we<00:02:23.000> all<00:02:23.090> really<00:02:23.390> can't<00:02:23.630> tell<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.520> open

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
we all really can't tell in this open

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.540 
we all really can't tell in this open
hall<00:02:25.760> environment<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:27.200> from<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.130> sounds<00:02:28.490> of

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
hall environment but from the sounds of

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.700 
hall environment but from the sounds of
it<00:02:28.700> we<00:02:29.540> think<00:02:29.600> that<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.900> one<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.560> slightly

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
it we think that this one is slightly

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.250 
it we think that this one is slightly
clearer<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:32.240> we<00:02:32.390> won't<00:02:32.600> know<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:32.780> sure<00:02:32.960> until

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
clearer but we won't know for sure until

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.990 
clearer but we won't know for sure until
we<00:02:33.380> get<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.650> proper<00:02:34.130> hands-on<00:02:34.460> review<00:02:34.670> with

we get a proper hands-on review with
both<00:02:35.180> device<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.840> more<00:02:36.050> quiet<00:02:36.320> room<00:02:36.680> so
