00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.050
 moment 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.789
 made new at apple the release of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.529
 two different iphone one iphone 5 is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.529
 and upscale from 700 euros 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.150
 and an iphone 5 it's just high end 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.099
 from 600 euros 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.289
 but for the boys fans present this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.970
 morning in front of the opera apple store he 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.380
 is still only one iphone is 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.340
 come for iphone 5 and iphone 5 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.649
 it's enough for the 5th iphone synthesis 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.500
 5 s iPhone 5 to 25 s worries rather 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.030
 fra fund no compromise I have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.090
 apple customers we want what there is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.650
 better 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 he told me a little less a given a 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.560
 I'm coming, I'm going to say I prefer 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.680
 directly take the high-end and 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.210
 then in complement the 5 cc call the 5 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.489
 May change the color to make 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.410
 what one pouteau than the other for 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.220
 new technologies including the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.140
 fingerprint sensor 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.420
 I still found among the thousand 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.740
 of buyers present the client of 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.390
 the iphone 5 c 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.910
 it's for color you came for 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.090
 buy iphone 5 aces or iphone 5 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:22.600
 that's why 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.119
 what zae year background with the naked think the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.100
 the team scot 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.740
 I think she loved the concept of 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.640
 colors despite the crisis despite prices 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.920
 unattractive 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.200
 apple and his iphone fidelis always 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.100
 as much as its users compared to 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.209
 other phones now under 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.329
 android they are as good 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.780
 why stay true to apple a pledge 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.289
 quality 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.340
 it's still the biggest brand that goes 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.289
 I think all brands copy 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.509
 everything will be flying when apple comes out of 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.069
 beautiful things it's a bit of 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.280
 copy and paste will be good all that is 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.049
 samsung galaxy etc 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.209
 we can not see anything but we are 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.429
 quite decompartmentalize and all that is 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.539
 sure layer also that we are a little 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.459
 lost in the applications of 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.530
 versions and I think that once for 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.479
 I 'm used to it, it's a bit like 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.420
 everything is difficult to get rid of more than 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.160
 again it's not necessarily great and 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.790
 not necessarily better so he's 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.230
 essential 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.940
 so personally I already have some 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.370
 apple material good voila I have an ipad 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.209
 I come home and part of mak 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.000
 when do we have another 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.620
 equipment outside the iphone seen that 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.850
 everything is complementary fast work 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.079
 together actually it's true that 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.970
 it's easier to stay on the apple 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.870
 I think a lot of people like me 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.549
 whose phone is just right for 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.079
 our brains here are the new ones 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.239
 iphone come out today only in a 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.099
 dozens of countries they will be very fast 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.319
 available on the internet at resale 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.090
 especially russia there was a 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.769
 now used a lot of Russian 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.040
 with a nokia in one hand and 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:52.000
 bundles in the other iphone 5s 64 giga 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.340
 north and another at 25 and 64 gig also 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.650
 money is for you it's for me 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.170
 but I will buy them been seen that 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.019
 we succeed that comes out that at the end of 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.019
 the year I sell them a little more expensive 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.340
 for him
