00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.440
 Good all the time of the day my name is 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.790
 Hatuntsev Evgeny I am the owner of the company x 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.440
 but as you see today our with you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.170
 video is about how to 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.490
 put down blood I'll talk right now about 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.650
 vapor barrier 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.359
 super diffusion membrane upper 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.150
 roofing but in this case we have 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.550
 will be natural tile 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.550
 metal tile is exactly the same 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:52.940
 I will try to show on the side that we are here 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:55.980
 see focus we see rafters we see 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.690
 Kunta rail which is bolted to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:06.979
 I rafted you on top of the film 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:11.880
 we see the crate and top coat 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:15.180
 I want a topic like us to make this video 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.500
 very often they make the roof wrong wrong 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.939
 system executed 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.310
 it is very often not use Kant 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.310
 rail than it threatens us 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.460
 this film is a vapor barrier but it is not so 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.549
 it wraps it's just a stand to 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.470
 just didn't understand the vapor barrier attached 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.860
 get off will not work the abyss 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.540
 blame it on our visible aviation turned brown 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:52.380
 bottom for any roof 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.140
 that is, it is already behind him drywall 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.149
 what's inside your dream pair protects 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.009
 fee from getting wet this rafter but 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.610
 I have this stand on me I do not know what to 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.610
 sevens 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.520
 really truss on no 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.780
 may be less than 100 millimeters not 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.520
 what's the best 200 this will be super 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.390
 because exactly 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.400
 rafter thickness determines thickness 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.680
 thermal insulation layer see it then 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.470
 we are almost on a par 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.070
 the question here is 5 dozen 3 as far as I am 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:43.070
 I remember that is vata 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:46.070
 must be the same rafter 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.070
 height 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.780
 top rafters part that's green this 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.959
 super diffusion membrane eurobarrier 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.810
 getting stuffed 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.430
 primanova membrane without any gaps 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.739
 Anyone interested can visit our 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.659
 video related to films and membranes there I 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.019
 I say this, that is, he has a couple 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.980
 bandwidth is very high and 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:20.500
 it allows the evaporation of moisture 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:23.170
 ask lash through the top here and cherries 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:30.430
 draw your attention here it is yes here 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:33.280
 cant rake thats well itâ€™s us 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:38.040
 can track us pant rake us 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:46.209
 gives an air gap between the film 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:49.599
 crate you see learn yes 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:53.680
 clearly seen there and I know about 3 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:57.370
 centimeter what is needed for 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.859
 free air flow in under the roof to us 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.340
 space and accordingly if 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:06.959
 some happen 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:11.049
 water flowing through water 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.480
 flows quietly on the film that is 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.970
 here we form essentially a groove 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:24.400
 between this edge here and this 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:27.460
 what many do not do many right here 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.270
 This crate stuffed campfire sang and 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.250
 thus overlapping 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.960
 moisture free spirit ie they have here 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:42.159
 this gap about which more visible 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.389
 he is gone this is fundamentally wrong this 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:51.030
 fatal error moisture she must 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:55.830
 flow freely over the surface of the film and 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.830
 go outside 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.630
 This is the case when we are with you 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.240
 reviewed the use of super diffusion 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.000
 membrane 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.190
 if we have with you the usual films she 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.750
 looks completely identical even 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.789
 World so for her should be 2 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.090
 groove 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:25.659
 the upper is in this case still under 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.560
 film and between insulation should be 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:32.310
 same minimum 2 centimeter gap 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:37.560
 this is achieved by having 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:40.719
 double them should be two in this case 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.810
 that is, the film is clamped between the slats 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:48.639
 that is, it will be no lower than 1 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:53.860
 she will be right here between 1 and 2 this in 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:57.279
 If we have rafters 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.340
 200 to his then 200 that is if for example 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:02.390
 we have rafters there 200 then 150 i thickness 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.550
 then you don't need 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.670
 brother these two slats what we will have 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:12.880
 so again double the gap 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.880
 between film and between watts 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.729
 Let's take another look at it all 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.729
 affairs 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.550
 get a capri 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:18.830
 in general, everything is here this video was you 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.830
 useful thanks goodbye
