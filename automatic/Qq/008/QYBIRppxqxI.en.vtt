watch<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.210> dislike<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> game<00:01:36.900> i<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.290> do

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
watch I dislike the game i really do

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.350 
watch I dislike the game i really do
actually<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.829> monitor<00:01:38.250> three<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:39.240> it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
actually like monitor three I think it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.760 
actually like monitor three I think it's
a<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.600> good<00:01:39.720> call<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.200> duty<00:01:40.409> one<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
a really good call of duty one of the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740 
a really good call of duty one of the
better<00:01:40.979> ones<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.400> i<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:41.909> black<00:01:42.390> ops<00:01:42.600> has

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
better ones but i do think black ops has

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.420 
better ones but i do think black ops has
been<00:01:42.930> best<00:01:43.110> holiday<00:01:43.560> ever<00:01:43.590> made<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.399> my

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
been best holiday ever made in my

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.719 
been best holiday ever made in my
opinion<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.720> my<00:01:45.869> opinion<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.729> as

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
opinion that is just my opinion and as

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.300 
opinion that is just my opinion and as
of<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.950> kind<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.070> feel<00:01:50.250> like

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
let's call duty elite system I think

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.670

it's complete garbage and I kind of wish

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.199 
it's complete garbage and I kind of wish
you'd<00:03:34.800> go<00:03:35.010> back<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.459> old<00:03:35.489> way<00:03:35.880> just

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
you'd go back to the old way just

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.229 
you'd go back to the old way just
because<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:37.830> know<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.310> rolling<00:03:38.880> out<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
because you know I like rolling out and

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.050 
because you know I like rolling out and
getting<00:03:39.420> my<00:03:39.540> PSN<00:03:40.080> or<00:03:40.350> my<00:03:40.680> microsoft<00:03:41.670> points

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060

comfortable like that and really I think

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.429 
comfortable like that and really I think
elites<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.879> bit<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.180> rip<00:03:47.360> off<00:03:47.540> for<00:03:47.840> myself

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
elites a bit of a rip off for myself

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.229 
elites a bit of a rip off for myself
some<00:03:48.650> people<00:03:48.890> might<00:03:48.980> think<00:03:49.040> it's<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.430> valid<00:03:49.609> you

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
some people might think it's a valid you

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.089 
some people might think it's a valid you
know<00:03:50.359> purchase<00:03:51.109> I<00:03:51.319> don't<00:03:51.590> really<00:03:51.709> think<00:03:51.920> it

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
know purchase I don't really think it

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.619 
know purchase I don't really think it
was<00:03:52.189> worth<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.430> money<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.939> I<00:03:53.000> spent<00:03:53.269> for<00:03:53.540> it

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
was worth the money that I spent for it

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.470 
was worth the money that I spent for it
I<00:03:54.469> don't<00:03:55.430> think<00:03:55.489> elites<00:03:55.909> really<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.269> greatest

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
I don't think elites really the greatest

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.149 
I don't think elites really the greatest

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
all of them are very good but personally

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.529 
all of them are very good but personally
like<00:04:14.510> I<00:04:14.659> was<00:04:14.780> saying<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.950> black<00:04:16.220> ops<00:04:16.459> dlc<00:04:17.120> was

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
like I was saying the black ops dlc was

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.599 
like I was saying the black ops dlc was
pretty<00:04:18.139> decent<00:04:18.530> there's<00:04:18.680> some<00:04:18.889> not-so-great

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
pretty decent there's some not-so-great

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.339 
pretty decent there's some not-so-great
maps<00:04:20.000> in<00:04:20.269> my<00:04:20.419> opinion<00:04:20.690> some<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.079> them<00:04:21.199> weren't

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
maps in my opinion some of them weren't

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:22.990 
maps in my opinion some of them weren't
the<00:04:21.470> greatest<00:04:21.680> discovery<00:04:22.610> wasn't<00:04:22.910> the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
the greatest discovery wasn't the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.020 
the greatest discovery wasn't the
greatest<00:04:23.120> but<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:24.229> just<00:04:25.009> like<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.340> way<00:04:25.370> overall

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
greatest but I just like the way overall

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.749 
greatest but I just like the way overall
data<00:04:26.509> black<00:04:27.500> ops<00:04:27.710> made<00:04:28.009> their<00:04:28.160> math<00:04:28.280> acts<00:04:28.550> as

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
data black ops made their math acts as

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.300 
data black ops made their math acts as
well<00:04:28.970> as<00:04:29.180> model<00:04:29.599> for<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.990> mod<00:04:30.289> for<00:04:30.470> two<00:04:30.620> had<00:04:30.889> the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
well as model for to mod for two had the

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.670 
well as model for to mod for two had the
good<00:04:31.340> deal<00:04:31.669> see<00:04:32.030> as<00:04:32.120> well<00:04:32.360> for<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:33.349> fact<00:04:33.560> that

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
good deal see as well for the fact that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.110 
good deal see as well for the fact that
you<00:04:33.800> could<00:04:33.949> just<00:04:34.130> go<00:04:34.250> out<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.370> buy<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.639> points

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
you could just go out and buy the points

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.029 
you could just go out and buy the points
and<00:04:35.690> one<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.050> reasons<00:04:36.320> i<00:04:36.410> like<00:04:36.560> that<00:04:36.770> is

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
and one of the reasons i like that is

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.790 
and one of the reasons i like that is
that<00:04:37.220> affected<00:04:37.750> both<00:04:38.750> black<00:04:39.080> ops<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.530> model

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
that affected both black ops and model

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.800 
that affected both black ops and model
fair<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.160> put<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.550> right<00:04:40.789> into<00:04:41.120> matchmaking

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
fair to put it right into matchmaking
