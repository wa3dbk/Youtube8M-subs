00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
like the best armor in the game and I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
don't have it enchanted

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.429 
don't have it enchanted
yet<00:00:27.740> but<00:00:28.970> I'm<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> started<00:00:31.199> playing

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
yet but I'm the way I started playing

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.170 
yet but I'm the way I started playing
this<00:00:31.529> game<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> would<00:00:32.189> dual<00:00:32.669> wield<00:00:32.910> I

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
this game was that I would dual wield I

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.389 
this game was that I would dual wield I
mean<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> weapon<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.219> hand

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
mean I would have a weapon in one hand

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
mean I would have a weapon in one hand
and<00:00:35.550> magic<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> other<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and magic in the other and I was in the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.020 
and magic in the other and I was in the
destruction<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.219> thought<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.730> was<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> pretty

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
destruction so I thought it was a pretty

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
destruction so I thought it was a pretty
effective<00:00:39.239> combination<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
effective combination but it it it

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.459 
effective combination but it it it
sometimes<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.480> you're<00:00:42.629> using<00:00:42.660> low-level

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
sometimes is if you're using low-level

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.279 
sometimes is if you're using low-level
spells<00:00:43.739> because<00:00:44.840> you<00:00:45.840> don't<00:00:45.989> waste<00:00:46.140> your

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
spells because you don't waste your

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.229 
spells because you don't waste your
magic<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.890> way<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:47.940> you're<00:00:48.030> using

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
magic it that way but if you're using

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.580 
magic it that way but if you're using
high-level<00:00:48.539> spells<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.320> start

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
high-level spells like when start

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.569 
high-level spells like when start
getting<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.899> depth<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.280> expert<00:00:53.280> then

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
getting up to a depth and expert then

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
getting up to a depth and expert then
you're<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> need<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.899> use<00:00:55.110> more<00:00:55.320> magic

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you're going to need to use more magic

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.189 
you're going to need to use more magic
afore<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> trick<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.360> actually<00:00:58.050> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
afore that but the trick is actually you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.380 
afore that but the trick is actually you
don't<00:00:58.410> want<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.550> don't<00:00:59.699> need<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.180> increase

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
don't want to you don't need to increase

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.639 
don't want to you don't need to increase
your<00:01:00.480> magic<00:01:00.899> --get<00:01:01.020> too<00:01:01.109> much<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.500> not

your magic --get too much that's not

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.410 
your magic --get too much that's not
what<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> trick<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.100> trick<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> actually

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
what the trick is trick is to actually

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.980 
what the trick is trick is to actually
use<00:01:04.610> have<00:01:05.610> enchantments<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.390> armor<00:01:06.750> that

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
have this magic regeneration rating that

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
have this magic regeneration rating that
is<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.290> actually<00:01:10.650> affects<00:01:11.119> how<00:01:12.119> well<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.510> do

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
doesn't really matter just an heal spell

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.830 
doesn't really matter just an heal spell
and<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.490> regenerates<00:02:04.119> really<00:02:04.360> slowly<00:02:04.630> as

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
and and it regenerates really slowly as

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.469 
and and it regenerates really slowly as
you<00:02:04.960> can<00:02:05.110> see<00:02:05.320> there<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.820> when<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:06.970> change<00:02:07.300> my

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
you can see there but when I change my

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:16.220 
you can see there but when I change my
armor<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.080> once<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.860> equip<00:02:09.130> those<00:02:09.369> two<00:02:09.640> things

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.619 

then<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.920> really<00:02:17.310> goes<00:02:17.519> up<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:18.030> really<00:02:18.390> fast

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
then it really goes up like really fast

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.020 
then it really goes up like really fast
and<00:02:19.099> when<00:02:20.099> you're<00:02:20.250> out<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> combat<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.849> goes<00:02:20.940> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and when you're out of combat it goes to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.039 
and when you're out of combat it goes to
the<00:02:21.120> much<00:02:21.360> faster<00:02:21.690> than<00:02:21.810> when<00:02:21.900> you're<00:02:22.019> in

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
the much faster than when you're in

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.170 
the much faster than when you're in
combat<00:02:22.379> but<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.920> still<00:02:23.220> goes<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.700> really

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
combat but it still goes up a really

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.420 
combat but it still goes up a really
decent<00:02:24.930> amount<00:02:25.349> when<00:02:25.530> you're<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.799> combat<00:02:25.980> so

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
decent amount when you're in combat so

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.240 
decent amount when you're in combat so
if<00:02:26.879> you're<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.540> fight<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.349> requires<00:02:29.099> you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
higher armor rating but I prefer dragon

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.539 
higher armor rating but I prefer dragon
armor<00:03:43.410> just<00:03:43.440> because<00:03:43.739> it's<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.099> little<00:03:44.340> lighter

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
armor just because it's a little lighter

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.180 
armor just because it's a little lighter
and<00:03:44.900> it's<00:03:45.900> cooler<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.739> mean<00:03:46.859> I<00:03:46.889> didn't

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
and it's cooler and I mean I didn't

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.280 
and it's cooler and I mean I didn't
spend<00:03:47.370> all<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.459> time<00:03:47.579> slaying<00:03:48.060> dragons

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
spend all that time slaying dragons

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.539 
spend all that time slaying dragons
collecting<00:03:49.290> their<00:03:49.410> skills<00:03:49.680> just<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.220> would

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
collecting their skills just so I would

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.550 
collecting their skills just so I would
you<00:03:50.880> know<00:03:50.970> keep<00:03:51.389> them<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.780> wanted<00:03:52.139> to<00:03:52.260> use<00:03:52.410> them

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
you know keep them I wanted to use them

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.259 
you know keep them I wanted to use them
so<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.739> created<00:03:53.250> this<00:03:53.370> armor<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:53.970> think<00:03:54.150> it's

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
so I created this armor and I think it's

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.099 
so I created this armor and I think it's
really<00:03:54.480> really<00:03:54.690> cool<00:03:55.519> also<00:03:56.519> Dragon<00:03:57.109> Scale

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
really really cool also Dragon Scale

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.900 
really really cool also Dragon Scale
armor<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.680> light<00:03:58.829> armor<00:03:59.129> is<00:03:59.280> actually<00:03:59.669> the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
armor the light armor is actually the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.720 
armor the light armor is actually the
strongest<00:04:00.299> armor<00:04:00.599> in<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.780> game<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.489> it's<00:04:02.489> good

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
strongest armor in the game so it's good

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.509 
strongest armor in the game so it's good
to<00:04:02.879> invest<00:04:03.569> in<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.290> anyway<00:04:04.709> if<00:04:04.739> you're<00:04:05.459> a
