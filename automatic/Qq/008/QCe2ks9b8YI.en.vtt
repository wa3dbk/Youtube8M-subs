alright guys welcome back to another
video<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.550> in<00:00:02.970> this<00:00:03.120> tutorial<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:04.170> going<00:00:04.380> to

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
video and in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.619 
video and in this tutorial I'm going to
be<00:00:04.560> teaching<00:00:04.710> you<00:00:04.950> guys<00:00:05.009> about<00:00:05.460> my<00:00:05.850> favorite

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
be teaching you guys about my favorite

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.720 
be teaching you guys about my favorite
math<00:00:07.319> function<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.830> all<00:00:07.950> time<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.700> a

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
math function of all time and that is a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.000 
math function of all time and that is a
R<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.090> it's<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.809> function<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.230> generates<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
R and it's the function that generates a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.339 
R and it's the function that generates a
random<00:00:11.250> number<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.509> reason<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.960> love<00:00:13.200> this

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
random number and the reason I love this

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.350 
random number and the reason I love this
so<00:00:13.530> much<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.920> because<00:00:14.210> whenever<00:00:15.210> I'm<00:00:15.330> making

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
so much is because whenever I'm making

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.200 
so much is because whenever I'm making
computer<00:00:15.990> games<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.520> piece<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.940> code

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
computer games this is the piece of code

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.410 
computer games this is the piece of code
that<00:00:18.810> makes<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.260> fun<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.800> unpredictable<00:00:20.730> Vout

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
that makes it fun and unpredictable Vout

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420 
that makes it fun and unpredictable Vout

every<00:00:24.330> game<00:00:24.570> would<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:25.019> boring<00:00:25.560> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
every game would be like boring and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.310 
every game would be like boring and
bland<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.939> let<00:00:27.660> me<00:00:27.720> go<00:00:27.840> ahead<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.019> show<00:00:28.260> you

bland so let me go ahead and show you
guys<00:00:28.380> how<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.680> use<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:29.279> I'm<00:00:29.400> going<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
guys how to use it and then I'm going to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.999 
guys how to use it and then I'm going to
show<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.820> guys<00:00:30.000> how<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.539> tweak<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.410> tune<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
show you guys how to tweak it to tune it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.190 
show you guys how to tweak it to tune it
especially<00:00:32.600> specifically<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> game

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
especially specifically to the game

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.220 
especially specifically to the game
you're<00:00:34.410> making<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> I'm<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.020> make<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
you're making so I'm going to make a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
you're making so I'm going to make a
loop<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.829> print<00:00:38.040> out<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> bunch<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.550> random

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
loop to print out a bunch of random

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.610 
loop to print out a bunch of random
numbers<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.989> need<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> counter

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
numbers so for that I need a counter

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.130 
numbers so for that I need a counter
variable<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.370> later<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> show

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
variable and later on I'm going to show

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
variable and later on I'm going to show
you<00:00:43.170> guys<00:00:43.410> how<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.920> get<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> random<00:00:44.610> number<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you guys how to get a random number in a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.139 
you guys how to get a random number in a
custom<00:00:45.600> range<00:00:46.230> such<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.700> making<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
custom range such as if you're making a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.630 
custom range such as if you're making a
dice<00:00:48.390> game<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:49.860> want<00:00:50.039> any<00:00:50.219> random

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
dice game you just don't want any random

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.880 
dice game you just don't want any random
number<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> world<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.660> want<00:00:51.899> specific

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
number in the world you want specific

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.520 
number in the world you want specific
set<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> numbers<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:54.420> case<00:00:54.629> 1<00:00:55.050> 2<00:00:55.260> 6

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
set of numbers in this case 1 2 6

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
set of numbers in this case 1 2 6
because<00:00:55.980> those<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> numbers<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.000> are

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
because those are the numbers that are

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
because those are the numbers that are
on<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.480> dice<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.469> 800<00:00:59.160> so<00:01:00.320> let's<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.500> go

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
on a dice not like 800 so let's just go

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.830 
on a dice not like 800 so let's just go
ahead<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.980> make<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.609> loop<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.629> now

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
ahead and make that for loop right now

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.740 
ahead and make that for loop right now
and<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.850> first<00:01:05.970> thing<00:01:06.180> I'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and the first thing I'm going to do is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.710 
and the first thing I'm going to do is
set<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.110> equal<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> 0<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.189> how<00:01:08.909> many<00:01:09.119> numbers<00:01:09.570> do

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
set a equal to 0 and how many numbers do

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
set a equal to 0 and how many numbers do
1<00:01:09.930> generate<00:01:10.380> doesn't<00:01:10.830> really<00:01:11.189> matter<00:01:11.490> I'll

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
1 generate doesn't really matter I'll

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.890 
1 generate doesn't really matter I'll
just<00:01:11.880> put<00:01:12.030> eyes<00:01:12.210> lesson<00:01:13.430> 24<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:14.600> 20<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:15.720> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
just put eyes lesson 24 now 20 or so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.399 
just put eyes lesson 24 now 20 or so
that<00:01:16.590> would<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.770> good<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:18.720> course<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.140> plus

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
that would be good and of course I plus

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.700 
that would be good and of course I plus
plus<00:01:19.880> now<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.600> first<00:01:21.869> thing<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.110> want<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.470> is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
plus now the first thing I want to do is

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.560 
plus now the first thing I want to do is
just<00:01:22.890> show<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.130> guys<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> looks<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.390> by

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
just show you guys what it looks like by

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.649 
just show you guys what it looks like by
default<00:01:25.140> without<00:01:25.380> any<00:01:25.680> customization<00:01:26.659> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
default without any customization so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
default without any customization so
prints<00:01:28.619> F<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:32.329> course<00:01:33.329> what<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.250> function

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
prints F of course what this function

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.350 
prints F of course what this function
does<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.880> generates<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.479> random<00:01:37.020> integer<00:01:37.439> so

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
does is it generates a random integer so

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.140 
does is it generates a random integer so
just<00:01:39.360> press<00:01:39.570> %<00:01:40.350> D<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.040> might<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:41.909> well<00:01:41.970> bump

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
just press % D and might as well bump

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.609 
just press % D and might as well bump
that<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> new<00:01:42.720> line<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.229> don't<00:01:43.409> it's

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
that to a new line if we don't it's

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.429 
that to a new line if we don't it's
going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> look<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.280> big<00:01:44.490> number<00:01:45.439> now

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
going to look like one big number now

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.850 
going to look like one big number now
the<00:01:46.530> function<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.340> called<00:01:47.579> Rand<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the function is called Rand and if you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.230 
the function is called Rand and if you
don't<00:01:50.040> add<00:01:50.159> anything<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.000> by<00:01:51.180> default

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
don't add anything in there by default

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.749 
don't add anything in there by default
then<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.640> going

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
then what it's going to do is it's going

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.480 
then what it's going to do is it's going
to<00:01:53.820> return<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.149> random<00:01:54.420> integer<00:01:54.869> from<00:01:55.259> zero<00:01:55.740> to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
to return a random integer from zero to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.480 
to return a random integer from zero to
somewhere<00:01:57.299> above<00:01:57.710> 32,000<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.430> it's

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
somewhere above 32,000 I think it's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.969 
somewhere above 32,000 I think it's
32,767<00:02:02.520> by<00:02:02.850> default<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:04.649> reason<00:02:04.950> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
32,767 by default and the reason that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.490 
32,767 by default and the reason that
this<00:02:05.219> sounds<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> weird<00:02:05.969> number<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.659> you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this sounds like a weird number and you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.229 
this sounds like a weird number and you
know<00:02:07.619> kind<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.950> random<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.670> actually

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
know kind of a random one is actually

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.089 
know kind of a random one is actually
it's<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.840> very<00:02:10.020> precise<00:02:10.470> number<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.830> has<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it's a very precise number it has to

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.680 
it's a very precise number it has to
deal<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.489> how<00:02:11.640> your<00:02:11.849> operating<00:02:12.270> system

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
deal with how your operating system

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.380 
deal with how your operating system
still

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
still

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.270 
still
or<00:02:13.510> as<00:02:13.630> bits<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.260> bytes<00:02:14.500> on<00:02:14.740> your<00:02:14.890> computer

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
or as bits and bytes on your computer

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.980 
or as bits and bytes on your computer
for<00:02:15.310> now<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.270> just<00:02:16.420> have<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.660> remember<00:02:16.840> that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
for now you just have to remember that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.740 
for now you just have to remember that
it's<00:02:17.290> somewhere<00:02:17.560> from<00:02:17.800> zero<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.280> 30<00:02:19.030> mm<00:02:19.660> in

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
it's somewhere from zero to 30 mm in

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.840 
it's somewhere from zero to 30 mm in
something<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.950> let<00:02:21.100> me<00:02:21.190> print<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.550> out<00:02:21.730> on

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
something so let me print this out on

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.690 
something so let me print this out on
the<00:02:21.910> screen<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.380> see<00:02:23.410> we<00:02:23.740> get<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.190> bunch<00:02:24.490> of

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
the screen and you see we get a bunch of

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.340 
the screen and you see we get a bunch of
random<00:02:25.390> numbers<00:02:26.430> somewhere<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.730> range

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
random numbers somewhere in that range

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.250 
random numbers somewhere in that range
pretty<00:02:29.350> cool<00:02:29.740> but<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.520> said<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:31.810> typically

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
pretty cool but like I said we typically

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.290 
pretty cool but like I said we typically
just<00:02:32.770> don't<00:02:32.980> want<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.340> bunch<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.910> random

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
just don't want a bunch of random

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.440 
just don't want a bunch of random
numbers<00:02:34.500> what<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.650> want<00:02:35.920> most<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:36.970> time<00:02:37.209> is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
numbers what we want most of the time is

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.560 
numbers what we want most of the time is
just<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:38.770> range<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.310> numbers<00:02:39.610> like<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:40.090> said

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
just on a range of numbers like I said

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.060 
just on a range of numbers like I said
before<00:02:40.720> you're<00:02:41.080> rolling<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.590> dice

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
before you're rolling a dice

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.580 
before you're rolling a dice
whenever<00:02:42.670> you're<00:02:42.819> rolling<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.330> dice<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:44.350> want

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
whenever you're rolling a dice you want

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.670 
whenever you're rolling a dice you want
the<00:02:44.739> numbers<00:02:45.040> one<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:46.090> six<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:47.200> how<00:02:47.380> can<00:02:47.440> we

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the numbers one to six so how can we

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.770 
the numbers one to six so how can we
take<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.070> function<00:02:48.550> which<00:02:49.209> gives<00:02:49.450> us<00:02:49.630> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
take this function which gives us the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.400 
take this function which gives us the
range<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.170> 0<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.820> 32,000<00:02:51.820> something<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.540> make

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
range of 0 to 32,000 something and make

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.130 
range of 0 to 32,000 something and make
it<00:02:53.590> only<00:02:53.800> output<00:02:54.070> 1<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:55.600> 6

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
it only output 1 to 6

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.780 
it only output 1 to 6
well<00:02:56.680> show<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:56.920> guys<00:02:57.040> how<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.220> do<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.400> right

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
well show you guys how to do that right

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.770 
well show you guys how to do that right
now<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.800> take<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:00.940> dice<00:03:01.239> roll<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:03.750> plop<00:03:04.750> it

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
now so take this dice roll and plop it

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.740 
now so take this dice roll and plop it
down<00:03:04.930> there<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:06.100> equation<00:03:06.640> for<00:03:07.150> this<00:03:07.360> is

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
down there and the equation for this is

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.640 
down there and the equation for this is
going<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.410> be<00:03:08.940> parentheses<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.410> in<00:03:11.410> those

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
going to be parentheses and in those

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.360 
going to be parentheses and in those
parentheses<00:03:12.000> type<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.300> function<00:03:13.690> R<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.410> now

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
parentheses type the function R and now

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
parentheses type the function R and now
right<00:03:15.670> after<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.239> hit<00:03:16.870> modulus<00:03:17.590> 6<00:03:18.489> now

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
right after this hit modulus 6 now

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.870 
right after this hit modulus 6 now
remember<00:03:19.840> what<00:03:20.410> modulus<00:03:21.010> does<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.579> it<00:03:21.730> takes

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
remember what modulus does is it takes

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.210 
remember what modulus does is it takes
this<00:03:22.299> number<00:03:22.690> on<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.989> on<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.680> left<00:03:23.920> and

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
this number on the on the left and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.430 
this number on the on the left and
divides<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.239> by<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.420> number<00:03:25.870> on<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.200> right

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
divides it by the number on the right

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.440 
divides it by the number on the right
however<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.430> doesn't<00:03:27.760> give<00:03:27.850> you<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.000> result

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
however it doesn't give you the result

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.949 
however it doesn't give you the result
it<00:03:28.600> gives<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.170> remainder<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.959> so

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
it gives you the remainder of that so

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.289 
it gives you the remainder of that so
whenever<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.860> divide<00:03:32.980> any<00:03:33.370> number<00:03:33.760> by<00:03:33.940> 6

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
whenever you divide any number by 6

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.750 
whenever you divide any number by 6
you're<00:03:34.900> going<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.140> get<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> remainder<00:03:35.739> 0<00:03:36.459> and

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
you're going to get the remainder 0 and

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.150 
you're going to get the remainder 0 and
that's<00:03:37.060> if<00:03:37.360> 6um<00:03:37.959> fit<00:03:38.590> into<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.920> number

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
that's if 6um fit into the number

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.030 
that's if 6um fit into the number
perfectly<00:03:39.700> like<00:03:39.910> 36<00:03:40.900> divided<00:03:41.260> by<00:03:41.290> 6<00:03:41.620> gives<00:03:41.860> you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
perfectly like 36 divided by 6 gives you

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.490 
perfectly like 36 divided by 6 gives you
zero<00:03:42.370> or<00:03:43.209> it's<00:03:43.810> going<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.079> give<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.380> the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
zero or it's going to give you the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.890 
zero or it's going to give you the
number<00:03:44.799> 1<00:03:45.100> through<00:03:45.880> 5<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:47.170> this<00:03:47.380> entire

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
number 1 through 5 so this entire

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.440 
number 1 through 5 so this entire
function<00:03:49.900> is<00:03:50.260> either<00:03:50.410> going<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.739> give<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.100> 0<00:03:51.459> 1

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
function is either going to give you 0 1

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.970 
function is either going to give you 0 1
2<00:03:52.750> 3<00:03:52.780> 4<00:03:53.470> or<00:03:53.680> 5<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:55.000> of<00:03:55.269> course<00:03:55.769> we're<00:03:56.769> pretty

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
2 3 4 or 5 so of course we're pretty

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.949 
2 3 4 or 5 so of course we're pretty
much<00:03:57.130> off<00:03:57.370> by<00:03:57.579> a<00:03:57.610> step<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.120> one<00:03:58.420> because<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
much off by a step of one because the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.280 
much off by a step of one because the
dice<00:03:59.140> is<00:03:59.350> not<00:03:59.709> 0<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.100> 5<00:04:00.310> but<00:04:00.519> 1<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:01.000> 6<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.870> now<00:04:02.079> all

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
dice is not 0 to 5 but 1 to 6 so now all

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.199 
dice is not 0 to 5 but 1 to 6 so now all
we<00:04:02.410> have<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.560> do<00:04:02.799> is<00:04:03.010> take<00:04:03.310> that<00:04:03.340> expression

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
we have to do is take that expression

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.750 
we have to do is take that expression
and<00:04:04.420> add<00:04:05.079> 1<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.860> it<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.870> now<00:04:08.230> dice<00:04:09.220> roll<00:04:09.579> is

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
and add 1 to it so now dice roll is

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.199 
and add 1 to it so now dice roll is
equal<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.600> numbers<00:04:10.870> 1<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.980> 6<00:04:12.250> simple

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
equal to the numbers 1 to 6 simple

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.090 
equal to the numbers 1 to 6 simple
enough<00:04:13.570> so<00:04:13.810> now<00:04:14.380> we<00:04:14.440> can<00:04:14.620> just<00:04:14.650> go<00:04:14.920> ahead<00:04:14.950> and

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
enough so now we can just go ahead and

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.819 
enough so now we can just go ahead and
print<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.549> out<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:16.150> could<00:04:16.479> actually<00:04:16.829> didn't

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
print that out you could actually didn't

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.219 
print that out you could actually didn't
even<00:04:17.950> need<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.280> delete<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.820> earlier<00:04:19.239> but

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
even need to delete that earlier but

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.940 
even need to delete that earlier but
percent<00:04:20.769> D<00:04:20.950> get<00:04:21.880> get<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.030> newline

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
percent D get get to newline

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.060 
percent D get get to newline
and<00:04:24.040> dice<00:04:25.030> roll<00:04:25.360> is<00:04:25.600> what<00:04:26.500> we<00:04:26.620> want<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.890> print

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
and dice roll is what we want to print

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.700 
and dice roll is what we want to print
out<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:28.150> again<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.420> run<00:04:28.630> this<00:04:28.810> bad<00:04:28.990> boy<00:04:29.230> and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
out so again I run this bad boy and

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.270 
out so again I run this bad boy and
check<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.070> out<00:04:31.290> what<00:04:32.290> happens<00:04:32.590> now<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:33.070> it

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
check it out what happens now is it

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.830 
check it out what happens now is it
prints<00:04:33.610> out<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.940> actually<00:04:34.060> do<00:04:34.450> we<00:04:34.540> have<00:04:34.660> no

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
prints out and actually do we have no

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.040 
prints out and actually do we have no
three<00:04:35.200> in<00:04:35.320> here<00:04:36.030> cool<00:04:37.030> oh<00:04:37.240> there's<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.810> couple

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
three in here cool oh there's a couple

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.540 
three in here cool oh there's a couple
how<00:04:38.320> did<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:38.470> miss<00:04:38.530> those<00:04:38.860> right<00:04:39.190> in<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.370> middle

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
how did I miss those right in the middle

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.880 
how did I miss those right in the middle
well<00:04:40.090> basically<00:04:40.240> what<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:40.930> does<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.440> it

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
well basically what this does is it

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.150 
well basically what this does is it
prints<00:04:42.160> out<00:04:42.390> somewhere<00:04:43.390> in<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:44.290> range<00:04:44.470> of<00:04:44.800> one

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
prints out somewhere in the range of one

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.910 
prints out somewhere in the range of one
to<00:04:45.190> six<00:04:45.880> so<00:04:46.570> if<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:46.930> want<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.200> have<00:04:47.380> any<00:04:47.590> kind

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
to six so if you want to have any kind

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.460 
to six so if you want to have any kind
of<00:04:48.100> dice<00:04:48.340> game<00:04:48.670> then<00:04:49.240> this<00:04:49.840> little<00:04:50.080> formula

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
of dice game then this little formula

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.640 
of dice game then this little formula
would<00:04:50.860> be<00:04:51.040> perfect<00:04:51.640> for<00:04:51.700> it<00:04:52.170> so<00:04:53.170> again<00:04:53.470> the

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
would be perfect for it so again the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.560 
would be perfect for it so again the
only<00:04:53.800> other<00:04:54.070> confusing<00:04:54.730> thing<00:04:54.940> might<00:04:55.270> be<00:04:55.390> this

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
only other confusing thing might be this

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.420 
only other confusing thing might be this
right<00:04:55.870> here<00:04:56.080> because<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.650> think<00:04:56.920> it<00:04:57.190> was<00:04:57.280> the

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
right here because I think it was the

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.220 
right here because I think it was the
first<00:04:57.580> time<00:04:57.850> we<00:04:57.970> actually<00:04:58.000> used<00:04:58.600> them<00:04:58.780> modulus

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
first time we actually used them modulus

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.160 
first time we actually used them modulus
operator<00:04:59.410> in<00:04:59.920> a<00:05:00.010> useful<00:05:00.430> function<00:05:00.840> but<00:05:01.840> for

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
operator in a useful function but for

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.730 
operator in a useful function but for
now<00:05:02.680> here's<00:05:03.640> what<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:03.880> want<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.180> guys<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.360> do

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
now here's what I want you guys to do

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.870 
now here's what I want you guys to do
since<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.890> have<00:05:06.010> all<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.430> building<00:05:06.850> blocks

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
since you have all the building blocks

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.780 
since you have all the building blocks
to<00:05:07.330> build<00:05:07.450> a<00:05:07.870> more<00:05:08.110> complex<00:05:08.590> program<00:05:09.130> this<00:05:09.610> is

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
to build a more complex program this is

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.240 
to build a more complex program this is
your<00:05:09.940> next<00:05:10.150> challenge<00:05:10.630> I<00:05:10.840> want<00:05:11.590> you<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:12.010> create

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
your next challenge I want you to create

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.150 
your next challenge I want you to create
a<00:05:12.340> game<00:05:12.580> where<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.360> user<00:05:13.660> rolls<00:05:14.530> three<00:05:14.950> dice

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
a game where the user rolls three dice

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.310 
a game where the user rolls three dice
and<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.760> prints<00:05:16.180> out<00:05:16.270> their<00:05:16.420> total<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:16.930> them<00:05:17.110> on

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
and it prints out their total to them on

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.540 
and it prints out their total to them on
dice<00:05:17.980> a<00:05:18.250> plus<00:05:18.640> B<00:05:19.150> plus<00:05:19.630> dicey<00:05:20.260> so<00:05:21.100> after<00:05:21.430> it

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
dice a plus B plus dicey so after it

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.790 
dice a plus B plus dicey so after it
gets<00:05:21.700> the<00:05:21.880> sum<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.840> users<00:05:23.230> going<00:05:23.410> to<00:05:23.470> look<00:05:23.680> at

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
gets the sum the users going to look at

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.290 
gets the sum the users going to look at
it<00:05:23.920> and<00:05:24.070> it's<00:05:24.280> going<00:05:24.460> to<00:05:24.550> guess<00:05:24.760> if<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.060> next

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
it and it's going to guess if the next

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.630 
it and it's going to guess if the next
roll<00:05:25.480> is<00:05:25.570> going<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.810> be<00:05:25.900> higher<00:05:26.170> and<00:05:26.530> if<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.520> is

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
roll is going to be higher and if it is

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.340 
roll is going to be higher and if it is
they'll<00:05:27.880> just<00:05:28.030> type<00:05:28.240> in<00:05:28.390> H<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:28.750> press<00:05:28.900> Enter

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
they'll just type in H and press Enter

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.910 
they'll just type in H and press Enter
lower<00:05:30.040> in<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.910> press<00:05:31.090> L<00:05:31.300> or<00:05:31.600> the<00:05:31.750> same<00:05:32.050> they'll

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
lower in the press L or the same they'll

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.880 
lower in the press L or the same they'll
press<00:05:33.100> s<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.640> hit<00:05:33.760> enter<00:05:34.030> and<00:05:34.240> then<00:05:35.110> they're

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
press s and hit enter and then they're

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.680 
press s and hit enter and then they're
going<00:05:36.010> to<00:05:36.070> roll<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.400> dice<00:05:36.430> again<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:37.180> if<00:05:37.510> they

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
going to roll the dice again and if they

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.900 
going to roll the dice again and if they
got<00:05:38.080> it<00:05:38.260> right<00:05:38.470> if<00:05:38.740> they<00:05:39.310> guess<00:05:39.520> correctly

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
got it right if they guess correctly

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.060 
got it right if they guess correctly
we'll<00:05:40.630> just<00:05:40.810> like<00:05:40.960> print<00:05:41.230> out<00:05:41.320> good<00:05:41.560> job<00:05:41.590> if

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
we'll just like print out good job if

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.980 
we'll just like print out good job if
they<00:05:42.190> got<00:05:42.340> it<00:05:42.490> wrong<00:05:42.670> print<00:05:43.030> out<00:05:43.120> you<00:05:43.390> suck<00:05:43.750> and

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
they got it wrong print out you suck and

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.330
