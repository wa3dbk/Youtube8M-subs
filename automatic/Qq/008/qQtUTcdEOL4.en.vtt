00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Beef Ho Fun

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.500
[ed: Sorry, dunno what this says]

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:16.800
Today we are going to teach a great dish,
a really popular one,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.900
but is not done well in restaurants, and that's
dry-style beef ho fun

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.900
This beef is cut from [not sure what cut,
I think it could be eye of round]

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.400
We gonna slice dat shit, into thin slices 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.000
[ed: Not sure what he's saying here.]

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.399
Now take a look at this ho fun (rice noodle),
don't just buy any ho fun

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.000
This ho fun is specifically for stir fries

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.700
There's varieties for soups and stir-fries

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.200
If you buy soup ho fun and use it to make
stir fries, it will break up

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:52.500
This is because soup ho fun absorbs water---
a quick boil and then it's done

00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:55.000
These you have to stir fry, they have more
texture, a bit more chewiness 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.100
For the beef, there are lots of advice out there on how to treat it.

00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:01.000
Typically I don't add baking soda to the beef

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.900
I tell everyone not to add baking soda to the beef

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:12.000
It screws up the beef and you go to the restaurants
and they're screwing up the beef, I'm not gonna eat that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.000
About 1/4 soup spoon of salt

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.000
And a 1/4 soup spoon of sugar
Give it a lil sweetness

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.000
We'll give it some light soy sauce

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.000
About a soup spoon's worth

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.000
After that we can add 2 soup spoons of water

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.000
Actually make it 3 soup spoons, because
beef absorbs a lot of water

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.000
If you don't add enough water, the beef has a rougher
texture.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.800
Stir to combine the flavors

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now we're going to pour it on the beef 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.500
We can add a little cooking wine, such as rice wine

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now it's going to absorb water

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.500
As you mix it, it will absorb moisture

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.099
This is because beef absorbs moisture

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.000
In the restaurant, if we add baking soda to it,
a pound of beef can absorb 4 cups of water, it's amazing
[I'm guessing the measurements]

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.010
We won't add that much liquid here, because

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.000
if it absorbs too much it will expand, compromising the flavor

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.900
See, it's kinda dry, right?
* Can't see the water, right? *

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.599
OMG L@@K the water is all absorbed!

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.000
Now we'll add a little starch slurry
Mix it up a bit

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.300
Adding the starch water will coat the beef, making
the texture smoother. Mix it some more.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now we add some oil to it

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.250
About 2 soup spoons to it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
Makes it a bit smoother, so smooooth!

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.600
I always tell people

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If you don't want stuff to stick to the wok,
you gotta make it red hot!

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:16.000
Turn off the heat,
and "rinse" it with oil

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.300
Put some oil in there

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Drain the oil

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.000
Now this is called "oil rinsing"

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.800
Turn the fire back on, get it hot again

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.000
After that, we add some oil

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.500
Drain the beef

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.600
Toss it in there and "draw the oil"
[not sure what is meant by that]

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.200
Quickly now

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.000
OPA! And it's done!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.400
At this point, the beef is only partly done.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.200
DO NOT cook it till it is all the way done.
Doing so will result in a rough texture

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.000
See? It's still reddish, and pink juices seeping out

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Let's set it aside for now 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.200
We reheat the wok till it's super hot
Rinse it with oil again

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.900
Now we add the ho fun to the wok, slowly now

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.900
Let it saute a bit

00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:26.900
This will let it get a bit golden on the bottom for a bit of that caramelized flavor

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.800
Now see, there is a bit of golden color, drying out a bit

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.700
This will make the noodles more flavorful

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Check it! It's not sticking at all! 
Whatever I do, it ain't gonna stick!

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.600
Next we'll add 1.5 soup spoons of soy sauce
[he's specifying a type, but not sure which one it is]

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.500
Next, half a soup spoon of dark soy sauce

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.500
Now we take these bean sprouts, and other veges and add them
[looks like green onion, red bell pepper, and maybe garlic?]

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.399
Crank up the heat! 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.000
Now we stir fry it all together

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.500
Add the beef 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Man that smells good. Dry style ho fun

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Thanks for watching!
