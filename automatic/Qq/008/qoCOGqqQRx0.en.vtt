the way down it pretty much stays in a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
the way down it pretty much stays in a
straight<00:01:16.619> line<00:01:16.650> straight<00:01:17.310> line<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> way

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
straight line straight line all the way

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.950 
straight line straight line all the way
down<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.619> size<00:01:19.619> strip<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.820> you'd<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
down what size strip that you'd like the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
down what size strip that you'd like the
annoying<00:01:22.229> thing<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.070> these<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.610> lot

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
annoying thing is is you get these a lot

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.820 
annoying thing is is you get these a lot
of<00:01:24.720> strings<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.560> keep<00:01:25.680> pulling

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
of strings so you have to keep pulling

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.370 
of strings so you have to keep pulling
strings<00:01:26.130> off<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:26.549> right<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:28.200> was

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
strings off but that's right so this was

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.490 
strings off but that's right so this was
the<00:01:28.500> Queen<00:01:28.979> King<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> also<00:01:30.780> had<00:01:31.170> in

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the Queen King and then I also had in

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.499 
the Queen King and then I also had in
this<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> king<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.700> two<00:01:33.180> sheets

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
this one this is the king so two sheets

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.140 
this one this is the king so two sheets
I<00:01:33.720> had<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.500> specifically<00:01:35.490> thrifted

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I had one and I specifically thrifted

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.200 
I had one and I specifically thrifted
another<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.790> recommended

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
another one so I think it's recommended

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.880 
another one so I think it's recommended
to<00:01:39.240> use<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.960> old<00:01:40.170> sheets<00:01:40.650> because

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
to use like really old sheets because

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
to use like really old sheets because
they're<00:01:41.130> softer<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.700> easier<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.450> work<00:01:42.540> with

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
they're softer and easier to work with

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990 
they're softer and easier to work with
and<00:01:42.899> stuff<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.290> okay<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> rug

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and stuff so okay so this is the rug

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.190 
and stuff so okay so this is the rug
that's<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.079> back<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.680> front<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that's the back this is a front and I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
that's the back this is a front and I
mean<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.740> pretty<00:01:49.979> much<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.060> huge<00:01:51.329> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
mean it pretty much I just that huge I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.730 
mean it pretty much I just that huge I
can<00:01:51.600> hold<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.200> hands<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.590> pretty

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
can hold it in my hands it's pretty

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.149 
can hold it in my hands it's pretty
heavy<00:01:52.890> um<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:54.210> I'll<00:01:54.780> show<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
heavy um but I'll show you this is the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.520 
heavy um but I'll show you this is the
hook<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.520> used<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.380> just

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
hook that I used and this is just

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.310 
hook that I used and this is just
plastic<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.189> they<00:01:59.460> make<00:01:59.719> no<00:02:00.719> know<00:02:00.840> what

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
plastic I think they make no know what

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.240 
plastic I think they make no know what
mines<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:02.119> aluminum<00:02:03.119> ones<00:02:03.270> size<00:02:03.960> Q<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.860> is

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
mines or aluminum ones size Q I think is

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.109 
mines or aluminum ones size Q I think is
the<00:02:05.460> biggest<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.790> at<00:02:06.360> Michael's<00:02:07.069> ransom<00:02:08.119> okay

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the biggest one at Michael's ransom okay

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.110 
the biggest one at Michael's ransom okay
so<00:02:09.259> starting<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.920> pretty<00:02:11.700> much<00:02:11.790> followed

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
so starting here I pretty much followed

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.070 
so starting here I pretty much followed
this

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
this

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.630 
this
pattern<00:02:13.500> I'm<00:02:13.710> making<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.300> gritty<00:02:15.300> square<00:02:16.640> like

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
pattern I'm making a gritty square like

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.820 
pattern I'm making a gritty square like
it<00:02:17.850> it'll<00:02:18.270> take<00:02:18.450> me<00:02:18.600> forever<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.470> pretty

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
it it'll take me forever but I pretty

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.030 
it it'll take me forever but I pretty
much<00:02:19.920> followed<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:21.120> pattern<00:02:21.810> kind<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.560> for

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
much followed this pattern kind of for

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.070 
much followed this pattern kind of for
the<00:02:23.130> beginning<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.820> let's<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.510> good<00:02:24.720> one

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
the beginning so let's be good one

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.780 
the beginning so let's be good one
um<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.450> pretty<00:02:27.630> good<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.320> start<00:02:28.680> with

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
um this is pretty good so you start with

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.040 
um this is pretty good so you start with
Magic<00:02:29.790> Circle<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.450> look<00:02:30.570> up<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.750> video<00:02:30.870> on

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
Magic Circle you can look up a video on

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.300 
Magic Circle you can look up a video on
the<00:02:31.110> Magic<00:02:31.350> Circle<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.770> really<00:02:31.920> easy<00:02:32.070> and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
the Magic Circle it's really easy and

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.570 
the Magic Circle it's really easy and
then<00:02:32.880> 7<00:02:33.450> chain<00:02:33.690> stitches<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.800> then<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.400> close

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
then 7 chain stitches and then you close

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.930 
then 7 chain stitches and then you close
the<00:02:35.610> circle<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:37.040> what<00:02:38.040> did<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.220> do<00:02:38.280> next

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the circle and then what did I do next

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.000 
the circle and then what did I do next
then<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.570> did<00:02:41.990> it's<00:02:42.990> hard<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:43.470> here<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:43.710> at

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
then I did it's hard to see here but at

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.920 
then I did it's hard to see here but at
7<00:02:44.340> chained<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.940> then<00:02:45.030> close<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.300> circle<00:02:45.600> and

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
7 chained and then close the circle and

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.080 
7 chained and then close the circle and
then<00:02:46.350> for<00:02:46.740> these<00:02:49.160> two<00:02:50.160> double<00:02:50.460> crochets<00:02:50.820> a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
then for these two double crochets a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.030 
then for these two double crochets a
single<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.810> middle<00:02:52.020> two<00:02:52.260> double<00:02:52.710> crochets

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
single in the middle two double crochets

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.770 
single in the middle two double crochets
single<00:02:53.460> in<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> middle<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.360> all<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.690> way

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
single in the middle so all the way

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.900 
single in the middle so all the way
around<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.110> circle<00:02:55.640> anything<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:56.850> to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
around the circle anything you have to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.110 
around the circle anything you have to
end<00:02:57.060> up<00:02:57.180> with<00:02:57.270> eight<00:02:57.740> little<00:02:58.740> like<00:02:58.890> petals<00:02:59.370> two

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
end up with eight little like petals two

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.520 
end up with eight little like petals two
three<00:03:00.420> four<00:03:00.720> six<00:03:01.710> seven<00:03:01.860> eight<00:03:02.370> eight<00:03:02.970> petals

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
three four six seven eight eight petals

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.680 
three four six seven eight eight petals
so<00:03:04.530> then<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.950> are<00:03:05.490> done<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.940> white<00:03:06.090> so

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
so then you are done with the white so

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.240 
so then you are done with the white so
then<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.900> switch<00:03:07.110> colors<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:08.010> you're<00:03:08.130> onto

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
then you switch colors and you're onto

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.550 
then you switch colors and you're onto
the<00:03:08.400> brown<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.850> then<00:03:09.390> for<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.720> brown<00:03:09.990> it's

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
the brown and then for the brown it's

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.550 
the brown and then for the brown it's
gonna<00:03:10.680> be<00:03:10.860> easier<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.340> see<00:03:12.260> probably<00:03:13.260> unlike

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
gonna be easier to see probably unlike

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.460 
gonna be easier to see probably unlike
this<00:03:13.770> one<00:03:14.010> okay<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> green<00:03:15.990> would<00:03:16.230> be<00:03:16.320> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
this one okay so the green would be the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.000 
this one okay so the green would be the
brown<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:18.239> two<00:03:18.300> double<00:03:19.260> crochets<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:19.800> switch

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
brown so two double crochets we switch

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:28.760 
brown so two double crochets we switch
colors<00:03:20.340> now<00:03:20.940> we<00:03:21.000> do<00:03:24.230> two<00:03:26.630> two<00:03:27.630> sets<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.350> double

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
colors now we do two two sets of double

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.229 
colors now we do two two sets of double
crochets<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:30.800> between<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:32.550> space<00:03:32.880> where<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
crochets in between the space where the

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.930 
crochets in between the space where the
single<00:03:33.540> crochet<00:03:33.870> was<00:03:34.050> for<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.790> blue<00:03:35.790> which

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
single crochet was for the blue which

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.199 
single crochet was for the blue which
was<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.270> cream<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.459> two<00:03:38.459> sets<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:39.000> double

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
was the cream so two sets of double

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.290 
was the cream so two sets of double
crochet<00:03:39.660> with<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:39.959> single<00:03:40.830> stitch<00:03:41.489> in<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
crochet with the single stitch in the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.620 
crochet with the single stitch in the
middle<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.750> then<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:45.239> middle<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.540> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
middle and then the in the middle of the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.670 
middle and then the in the middle of the
two<00:03:45.780> double<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.290> then<00:03:46.410> when<00:03:46.560> you're

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
two double and then when you're

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.060 
two double and then when you're
switching<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.280> next<00:03:47.489> one<00:03:47.610> it's<00:03:47.820> -<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.239> think

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
switching to the next one it's - I think

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.530 
switching to the next one it's - I think
two<00:03:50.070> singles<00:03:52.610> or<00:03:53.610> two<00:03:53.760> slip<00:03:53.970> stitches<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.390> mean

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
two singles or two slip stitches I mean

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.470 
two singles or two slip stitches I mean
so<00:03:55.470> I'm<00:03:55.860> like<00:03:56.220> are<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.459> confused<00:03:56.880> myself<00:03:57.270> so

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
so I'm like are you confused myself so

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:09.050

slip stitch in the middle so you're

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.950 
slip stitch in the middle so you're

doing seven double crochets to make that
round<00:04:32.150> pedal<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.330> then<00:04:33.419> you're<00:04:33.569> putting<00:04:33.689> a

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
round pedal and then you're putting a

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.749 
round pedal and then you're putting a
single<00:04:34.169> slip<00:04:34.379> stitch<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.770> middle<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:35.430> 7

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
single slip stitch in the middle so 7

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.959 
single slip stitch in the middle so 7
slip<00:04:36.150> 7<00:04:36.719> slip<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.259> that's<00:04:37.860> where<00:04:38.099> I<00:04:38.129> stopped

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:38.969 
slip 7 slip and that's where I stopped

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.330 
slip 7 slip and that's where I stopped
no<00:04:39.599> I<00:04:39.629> didn't<00:04:39.930> I<00:04:40.020> kept<00:04:40.229> going<00:04:40.349> on<00:04:40.620> this<00:04:41.099> pattern

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
no I didn't I kept going on this pattern

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.360 
no I didn't I kept going on this pattern
so<00:04:41.610> then<00:04:42.090> after<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.229> I<00:04:44.360> did<00:04:45.360> -<00:04:45.659> that<00:04:46.249> was<00:04:47.249> the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
so then after that I did - that was the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.839 
so then after that I did - that was the
dog

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
dog

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.420 
dog
I<00:04:48.800> switched<00:04:49.800> colors<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.550> I<00:04:50.759> did<00:04:50.969> two<00:04:51.210> single

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
I switched colors and I did two single

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.540 
I switched colors and I did two single
crochets<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.759> cream<00:04:54.060> so<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:54.930> went<00:04:55.139> around<00:04:55.229> twice

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
crochets of cream so I went around twice

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.249 
crochets of cream so I went around twice
doing<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.639> cream<00:04:56.819> and<00:04:57.180> then<00:04:57.419> I<00:04:57.449> decided<00:04:57.900> I

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
doing the cream and then I decided I

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.869 
doing the cream and then I decided I
didn't<00:04:58.680> want<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:58.919> be<00:04:59.069> square<00:04:59.340> while<00:04:59.490> wrong

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
didn't want it to be square while wrong

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.360 
didn't want it to be square while wrong
I<00:05:00.029> wanted<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.360> be<00:05:00.449> a<00:05:00.479> round<00:05:00.750> rug<00:05:01.439> so<00:05:02.159> then<00:05:02.340> I

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
I wanted to be a round rug so then I

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.550 
I wanted to be a round rug so then I
switched<00:05:02.849> colors<00:05:03.090> again<00:05:03.479> went<00:05:04.080> back<00:05:04.229> to<00:05:04.379> brown

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560
