00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 and that a guys how are I, I am a challenge 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.110
 script word and this is the goal 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.330
 Well guys in this video as well 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.380
 they will have seen it and for that they entered 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:25.580
 this for how to use the control of the xbox 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.439
 one on the pc as a control for your 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.360
 games that you have if you are always 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.509
 one control of the xbox band is another one 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.450
 and the one that will use pc because this is the video 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.520
 to which you are looking also if 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.380
 you have a pc gamer and you do not have 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.390
 an xbox because I do not know do not like the 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:47.390
 consoles and such if they buy a control 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:51.320
 for the xbox one and this one with a cable 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.940
 micro usb with usb output and connect it 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.470
 it serves if they do not need bone force 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.510
 a control of a nexus one is something 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.150
 illogical but good in case they had the doubt 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.489
 I know that some more than one is going to have 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.100
 the age in this case well I am 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.720
 using the cable that came with the kit 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.000
 load and play for xbox control 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.119
 one, before anything, I'm going to leave you the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.270
 link of the major nelson blog in the 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.869
 description and here are the links 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.369
 for good you know for the bits that 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.759
 have your computers in this case the 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.179
 of 86 that is 32 bits and he is 4 64 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.539
 bits are downloaded whatever it is once 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.250
 downloaded they open it to download the 64 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.530
 0 install but to see how it is 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.350
 they will start downloading once 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.909
 downloaded they open they give him run for 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.399
 to see how the installation and already 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.049
 I just uninstalled and we're going to give it in 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.240
 accept the terms of the license 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.179
 let's give it install let's allow 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.189
 that access the program to our pc and 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.310
 once finished installing we are going to 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.069
 give it finish and that would be all 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.140
 it would really be everything now that it continues 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.200
 well you can obviously connect the the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.179
 cable to the computer and most 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.179
 important to the control of empty text 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.020
 when this thing detects this we are going to 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.760
 vibrate I do not know if it was seen began to shine 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.740
 to vibrate sorry I was going to start installing 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.840
 Well, what you are seeing right now is already 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.790
 faster because I saw it was 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.380
 had installed the first time in fact 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.360
 it's going to take too much with one too much 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.280
 if it's going to take like two minutes three 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.500
 macro the truth 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.150
 but well, here it is already 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.840
 working once that disappears 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.459
 you can go to your control panel 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.069
 see devices and printers in 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.290
 hardware and sound and here it appears as 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.060
 discs and it's like devices 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.890
 connected and appears for example the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.340
 microphone that is the heart glass that 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.470
 you are listening to the computer and what 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.700
 which would be the control if you click 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.590
 they create in hardware they appear what the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.290
 ravers that they just installed and 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.510
 Well, that's absolutely everything. 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.760
 to try a game 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.890
 is one more control then it is a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.860
 damn control let's try on the one in 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.720
 jim and jakes quest then with the boys 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.220
 tremendous fail 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.120
 I just realized right now that 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.090
 I was editing the good video so 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.370
 I was watching how it was 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.680
 I remember that it happened to me that there is 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.709
 game in full tray and did not finish it 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.670
 so I already managed to record it here 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.890
 we are again as you see 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.209
 well if I put myself in the game maybe 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.650
 maybe I will do it already options 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.050
 we give you some with this those that 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.540
 control here the left control to a 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.420
 side and then to control with those with the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.540
 keys we the continuous pentur I know 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.540
 I know I have not played much or the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.730
 gentlemen, guys, well, there's good, there's 212 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.170
 sb what's important is what I want them 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.050
 show is that if you are moving with 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:05.050
 this with and then and with x also with ado 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.989
 and a jump and with be player changes 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.260
 changes to jake and you can use the jet 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.310
 project we can be with their with their 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.350
 fists I do not know I prefer to end 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.900
 that would be the whole demo I did the same in 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.810
 the past only to have cut 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.760
 forgive really that does not have it nor 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.870
 I was not even really overlooked 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.650
 was to have to add but then just 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.930
 come out to record that does not record that so 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.480
 It was my fault but good 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.990
 as you see they work to perfection 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.990
 with the pad be with the control of the xbox 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.050

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.840

 I apologize guys so I do not know anymore 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:07.539
 that would be all I do not know with what more games 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:10.919
 really can be used at the moment 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.689
 I want to try with art what I'm going to try 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.340

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.319
