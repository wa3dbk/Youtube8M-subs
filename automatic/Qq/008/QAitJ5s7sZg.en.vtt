the middle and then I'm just going to
take<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.190> bobby<00:00:56.460> pin<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.150> bring<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> through

shows through the other side and then

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.270 
shows through the other side and then
I'm<00:01:02.250> placing<00:01:02.519> another<00:01:03.090> pin<00:01:03.540> crossing<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.769> just

and<00:01:49.080> then<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.580> is<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> five<00:01:51.090> strand<00:01:51.420> braid<00:01:51.720> so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and then this is a five strand braid so

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.780 
and then this is a five strand braid so
three<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> strands<00:01:53.130> are<00:01:53.250> made<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.549> hair

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
three of the strands are made of hair

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.580 
three of the strands are made of hair
and<00:01:54.060> then<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> other<00:01:54.540> two<00:01:54.840> strands<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and then the other two strands are the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.039 
and then the other two strands are the
pieces<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> ribbon<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.390> way<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.570> want<00:01:57.900> to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
pieces of ribbon and the way you want to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.230 
pieces of ribbon and the way you want to
position<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:59.159> want<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.430> piece<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.670> hair<00:02:00.030> on

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
position is you want a piece of hair on

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.530 
position is you want a piece of hair on
top<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> strand<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.100> ribbon<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.729> then

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
top and then a strand of ribbon and then

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.539 
top and then a strand of ribbon and then
the<00:02:03.689> other<00:02:03.869> strand<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.500> ribbon<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.250> two

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the other strand of ribbon and then two

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.600 
the other strand of ribbon and then two
more<00:02:05.729> sections<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.479> hair<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.160> then<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.340> going

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
more sections of hair and then I'm going

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.880 
more sections of hair and then I'm going
to<00:02:08.670> start<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.329> with<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.019> hair<00:02:10.290> that<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.679> on

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
to start this with the hair that is on

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.270 
to start this with the hair that is on
the<00:02:11.280> bottom<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.940> Strand<00:02:12.299> on<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.510> left<00:02:12.870> I'm

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the bottom the Strand on the left I'm

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.130 
the bottom the Strand on the left I'm
bringing<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.430> under<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.180> second<00:02:15.570> strand<00:02:15.870> up

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
bringing it under the second strand up

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.819 
bringing it under the second strand up
and<00:02:16.880> then<00:02:17.880> over<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.690> first<00:02:18.930> round<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.470> ribbon

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
and then over that first round of ribbon

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.850 
and then over that first round of ribbon
and<00:02:20.299> then<00:02:21.299> under<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.989> second<00:02:22.410> strand<00:02:22.470> of

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
and then under the second strand of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.759 
and then under the second strand of
ribbon<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.340> as<00:02:24.299> you're<00:02:24.600> braiding<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.530> want

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
ribbon and as you're braiding you want

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.160 
ribbon and as you're braiding you want
to<00:02:25.920> try<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.220> keep<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.670> ribbon<00:02:27.120> flat<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.900> keep

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
to try to keep this ribbon flat and keep

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.990 
to try to keep this ribbon flat and keep
it<00:02:28.320> from<00:02:28.500> twisting<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.459> braid<00:02:29.640> will<00:02:29.820> turn

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
it from twisting and the braid will turn

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.720 
it from twisting and the braid will turn
out<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> lot<00:02:30.450> better<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.400> first

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
out a lot better so that is the first

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.420 
out a lot better so that is the first
plate<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.900> then<00:02:34.560> now<00:02:34.769> you're<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.310> be

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
plate and then now you're going to be

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.310 
plate and then now you're going to be
starting<00:02:35.880> with<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.209> hair<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.049> the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
starting with this hair that is on the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.830 
starting with this hair that is on the
top<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.340> right<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:39.000> you're<00:02:39.540> going<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
top on the right and you're going to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.509 
top on the right and you're going to
bring<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.170> through<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.500> same<00:02:40.769> way<00:02:41.070> you're

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
bring it through the same way you're

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.260 
bring it through the same way you're
going<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.880> go<00:02:42.000> under<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.980> strand<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.459> hair

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
going to go under the strand of hair

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.630 
going to go under the strand of hair
over<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.510> ribbon<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.170> then<00:02:47.980> under<00:02:48.490> the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
over the ribbon and then under the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.680 
over the ribbon and then under the
ribbon<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:50.410> if<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.740> just<00:02:50.980> repeat<00:02:51.430> under<00:02:51.690> over

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
ribbon so if you just repeat under over

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.230 
ribbon so if you just repeat under over
under<00:02:52.900> all<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:54.010> way<00:02:54.160> down<00:02:54.460> that<00:02:54.910> is<00:02:55.090> what

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
under all the way down that is what

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.400 
under all the way down that is what
you're<00:02:55.360> going<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.660> do<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:55.990> you're<00:02:56.140> switching

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
you're going to do is you're switching

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.800 
you're going to do is you're switching
sides<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.700> starting<00:02:58.210> here<00:02:58.240> again<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
sides so starting here again on the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.060 
sides so starting here again on the
bottom<00:02:59.320> I'm<00:02:59.560> going<00:03:00.460> under<00:03:02.460> over<00:03:03.460> and<00:03:05.070> then

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
bottom I'm going under over and then

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.510 
bottom I'm going under over and then
under<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:07.500> now<00:03:08.500> I'm<00:03:08.650> going<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.950> be<00:03:09.040> working<00:03:09.400> on

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
under and now I'm going to be working on

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.830 
under and now I'm going to be working on
the<00:03:09.610> top<00:03:09.850> again<00:03:10.090> same<00:03:10.810> thing<00:03:11.140> under<00:03:13.350> over<00:03:14.350> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
the top again same thing under over and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.920 
the top again same thing under over and
under<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.470> as<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.640> can<00:03:18.850> see<00:03:19.060> I'm<00:03:19.240> not<00:03:19.420> pulling

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
under and as you can see I'm not pulling

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.110 
under and as you can see I'm not pulling
these<00:03:20.050> strands<00:03:20.440> tight<00:03:20.830> at<00:03:21.130> all<00:03:21.310> I'm<00:03:21.730> leaving

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
these strands tight at all I'm leaving

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.699 
these strands tight at all I'm leaving
them<00:03:22.300> loose<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:22.870> letting<00:03:23.200> them<00:03:23.440> lay

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
them loose and just letting them lay

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.650 
them loose and just letting them lay
flat<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.520> that<00:03:24.640> is<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.910> whole<00:03:25.060> trick<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.510> this

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
flat and that is the whole trick to this

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.110 
flat and that is the whole trick to this
braid<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:27.040> I'll<00:03:27.160> show<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.340> one<00:03:27.640> more<00:03:27.700> time

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
braid so I'll show you one more time

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:42.170 
braid so I'll show you one more time
under<00:03:30.870> over<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:33.780> under<00:03:37.440> under<00:03:38.440> over<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
under over and under under over and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.410 
under over and under under over and
under<00:03:43.770> so<00:03:44.770> I<00:03:44.800> think<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.250> can<00:03:45.430> see<00:03:45.670> why<00:03:45.880> flimsy

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
under so I think you can see why flimsy

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.199 
under so I think you can see why flimsy
ribbon<00:03:46.870> wouldn't<00:03:47.290> be<00:03:47.700> working<00:03:48.700> out<00:03:48.940> as<00:03:49.180> well

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
ribbon wouldn't be working out as well

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.290 
ribbon wouldn't be working out as well
at<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:49.780> point<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:51.370> would<00:03:51.550> be<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.730> lot<00:03:52.000> harder

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
at this point it would be a lot harder

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.630 
at this point it would be a lot harder
to<00:03:52.630> make<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.840> lie<00:03:53.200> flat<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.010> way<00:03:54.130> you<00:03:54.190> want<00:03:54.550> it

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
to make it lie flat the way you want it

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.070 
to make it lie flat the way you want it
to<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:57.580> also<00:03:58.120> if<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.390> get<00:03:58.540> ribbon<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.019> is

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
to and also if you get ribbon that is

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.960 
to and also if you get ribbon that is
too<00:03:59.410> thick<00:03:59.769> it's<00:04:00.160> going<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.519> make<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.850> more

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
too thick it's going to make it more

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:09.950 
too thick it's going to make it more
difficult<00:04:01.180> as<00:04:01.690> well

some bows out of this leftover ribbon
you<00:04:50.210> could<00:04:50.330> definitely<00:04:50.509> do<00:04:51.020> that<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.470> think<00:04:51.590> I'm

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
you could definitely do that I think I'm

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.559 
you could definitely do that I think I'm
just<00:04:52.009> going<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.310> leave<00:04:52.520> ours<00:04:52.819> hanging<00:04:53.300> down

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
just going to leave ours hanging down

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.680 
just going to leave ours hanging down
and<00:04:53.930> this<00:04:54.860> break<00:04:55.190> could<00:04:55.400> also<00:04:55.639> be<00:04:55.970> made<00:04:56.180> into<00:04:56.659> a

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
and this break could also be made into a

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.670 
and this break could also be made into a
French<00:04:57.080> braid

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
French braid

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.969 
French braid
and<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:59.360> way<00:04:59.509> you<00:04:59.569> would<00:04:59.840> do<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.050> every<00:05:00.740> time

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
and the way you would do that every time

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.770 
and the way you would do that every time
you<00:05:01.130> bring<00:05:01.340> in<00:05:01.490> this<00:05:01.610> outside<00:05:02.150> strand<00:05:02.569> you

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
you bring in this outside strand you

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.330 
you bring in this outside strand you
would<00:05:02.930> just<00:05:03.080> bring<00:05:03.259> a<00:05:03.440> tiny<00:05:03.680> piece<00:05:03.949> of<00:05:04.130> hair

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
would just bring a tiny piece of hair

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.850 
would just bring a tiny piece of hair
with<00:05:04.610> you<00:05:04.909> I<00:05:05.150> think<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.050> can<00:05:06.229> probably<00:05:06.380> figure

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
with you I think you can probably figure

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.010 
with you I think you can probably figure
it<00:05:06.919> out<00:05:07.130> but<00:05:07.400> if<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.940> would<00:05:08.120> like<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:08.330> video<00:05:08.599> on

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
that leave a comment and if there's

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.790 
that leave a comment and if there's
enough<00:05:10.970> interest<00:05:11.150> we<00:05:11.599> can<00:05:11.780> try<00:05:12.259> and<00:05:12.409> put<00:05:12.650> one

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
enough interest we can try and put one

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.499 
enough interest we can try and put one
up<00:05:12.949> to<00:05:13.190> show<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.550> French<00:05:13.759> braiding<00:05:14.060> version
