second up use land detailed textures
which<00:03:20.670> makes<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.060> more<00:03:21.359> realistic<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:23.510> if<00:03:24.510> you

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
which makes it more realistic and if you

which makes it more realistic and if you
want<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.019> pause<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.410> video<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.950> look<00:03:26.519> at

you can put it to 43% in leisure boats
38%<00:04:04.609> so<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:06.170> know<00:04:07.170> we're<00:04:07.410> hearing<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.739> aircraft

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
38% so I know we're hearing the aircraft

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.759 
38% so I know we're hearing the aircraft
labels<00:04:08.579> you<00:04:09.389> can<00:04:09.420> see<00:04:09.810> your<00:04:09.930> aircraft<00:04:10.500> type

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
labels you can see your aircraft type

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.430 
labels you can see your aircraft type
the<00:04:11.069> manufacturer<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.030> etc<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:13.410> make

the manufacturer and etc to make

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.949 
the manufacturer and etc to make
realistic<00:04:13.889> just<00:04:14.340> switch<00:04:15.090> off<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.569> assault

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
realistic just switch off the assault

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.270 
realistic just switch off the assault
craft<00:04:16.229> labels<00:04:16.440> over<00:04:16.979> here<00:04:18.349> or<00:04:19.349> switch<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.099> back

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
craft labels over here or switch it back

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.740 
craft labels over here or switch it back
on<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.380> zero<00:04:22.650> aircraft<00:04:22.800> registration

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
on and to zero aircraft registration

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.610 
on and to zero aircraft registration
just<00:04:24.140> a<00:04:24.290> quick<00:04:25.240> pigtail<00:04:26.240> number<00:04:26.660> but<00:04:27.140> I<00:04:27.410> don't

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
just a quick pigtail number but I don't

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.000 
just a quick pigtail number but I don't
use<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:31.640> you<00:04:31.700> can<00:04:31.970> go<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:33.470> can<00:04:33.650> also<00:04:33.770> go

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
use it so you can go to you can also go

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:43.420 
use it so you can go to you can also go
to<00:04:34.040> customize<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:42.530> yeah<00:04:42.890> that's<00:04:43.190> pretty<00:04:43.310> much

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
to customize so yeah that's pretty much

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:52.650 
to customize so yeah that's pretty much
it<00:04:46.510> for<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.660> UH<00:04:47.690> graphics<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:50.450> make<00:04:50.480> your

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
it for the UH graphics to make your

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.290 
it for the UH graphics to make your
simulator<00:04:53.660> more<00:04:54.020> realistic<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:55.210> here<00:04:56.210> you

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
simulator more realistic and here you

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:13.000 
simulator more realistic and here you
can<00:04:56.419> be<00:04:56.540> set<00:04:56.720> to<00:04:56.840> defaults<00:04:57.440> as<00:04:57.590> you<00:04:57.950> can<00:04:58.130> see<00:05:12.010> so

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
can be set to defaults as you can see so

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.190 
can be set to defaults as you can see so
yeah<00:05:13.370> that's<00:05:13.790> those<00:05:14.270> are<00:05:14.480> your<00:05:14.630> graphics<00:05:15.050> I

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
yeah that's those are your graphics I

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.640 
yeah that's those are your graphics I
recommend<00:05:19.450> let<00:05:20.450> me<00:05:20.570> just<00:05:20.780> show<00:05:21.200> you<00:05:21.230> a<00:05:21.380> little

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
recommend let me just show you a little

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.650 
recommend let me just show you a little
demonstration<00:05:21.980> on<00:05:22.610> what<00:05:22.640> I'm<00:05:23.000> talking<00:05:23.390> about

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
demonstration on what I'm talking about

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:36.150 
demonstration on what I'm talking about
so<00:05:31.780> let's<00:05:32.780> here<00:05:33.200> in<00:05:34.010> San<00:05:34.280> Jose<00:05:34.550> Costa<00:05:34.729> Rica

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
so let's here in San Jose Costa Rica

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.590 
so let's here in San Jose Costa Rica
let's<00:05:37.160> see<00:05:37.370> if<00:05:37.490> fly<00:05:37.640> now<00:05:37.820> doesn't<00:05:38.270> matter<00:05:38.330> if

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
let's see if fly now doesn't matter if

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:50.429 
let's see if fly now doesn't matter if
it's<00:05:38.750> day<00:05:39.050> or<00:05:39.080> night<00:05:39.290> pad

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:50.439 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:58.980 

so<00:05:51.439> it's<00:05:51.589> a<00:05:51.849> 99%<00:05:54.909> and<00:05:55.909> as<00:05:56.719> you<00:05:56.809> can<00:05:56.960> see<00:05:57.139> guys

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
so it's a 99% and as you can see guys

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:06.489 
so it's a 99% and as you can see guys
I'm<00:05:59.990> on<00:06:00.139> my<00:06:00.319> aircraft<00:06:00.589> now<00:06:04.779> send<00:06:05.779> air<00:06:06.050> creation

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:06.499 
I'm on my aircraft now send air creation

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.480 
I'm on my aircraft now send air creation
try<00:06:06.770> ultra<00:06:07.249> light<00:06:07.430> and<00:06:07.729> the<00:06:07.939> graphics<00:06:08.389> I<00:06:09.490> don't

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
try ultra light and the graphics I don't

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.969 
try ultra light and the graphics I don't
have<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:11.080> buildings<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:12.349> stuff<00:06:12.559> like<00:06:12.770> that

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
have the buildings and stuff like that

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:16.359 
have the buildings and stuff like that
cos<00:06:13.839> it<00:06:14.839> uses<00:06:15.199> frames<00:06:15.589> per<00:06:15.770> second<00:06:16.099> so<00:06:16.129> you<00:06:16.219> can

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:16.369 
cos it uses frames per second so you can

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:21.189 
cos it uses frames per second so you can
see<00:06:16.520> over<00:06:16.550> here<00:06:17.229> 25<00:06:18.229> point<00:06:18.680> or<00:06:19.159> 30s<00:06:20.199> changing

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 
see over here 25 point or 30s changing

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.540 
see over here 25 point or 30s changing
constantly<00:06:23.710> but<00:06:24.710> you<00:06:24.800> have<00:06:24.919> you<00:06:25.009> 3<00:06:25.189> 2<00:06:25.309> frames

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
constantly but you have you 3 2 frames

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.670 
constantly but you have you 3 2 frames
per<00:06:25.849> per<00:06:26.749> second<00:06:29.199> so<00:06:30.199> we're<00:06:30.379> going<00:06:30.529> to<00:06:30.589> learn

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
per per second so we're going to learn

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.059 
per per second so we're going to learn
the<00:06:30.830> flight<00:06:31.479> holistic<00:06:32.479> um<00:06:34.180> stay<00:06:35.180> tuned<00:06:35.419> up<00:06:36.069> in

the flight holistic um stay tuned up in

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.309
