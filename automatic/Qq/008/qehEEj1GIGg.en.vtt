that the low F key really makes the

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.930 
that the low F key really makes the
throw<00:02:31.480> b-flat<00:02:31.930> inferior<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.579> I<00:02:33.610> finally

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
throw b-flat inferior so I finally

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.690 
throw b-flat inferior so I finally
dropped<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.659> and<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:36.040> fingering<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.489> use

they play throw b-flat they they really
don't<00:03:28.540> let<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.930> thumb<00:03:29.169> up<00:03:29.379> completely<00:03:29.889> so

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
don't let the thumb up completely so

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.849 
don't let the thumb up completely so
that<00:03:30.699> the<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.690> completely<00:03:32.109> clears<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.620> thumb

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
that the it completely clears the thumb

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.119 
that the it completely clears the thumb
ring<00:03:33.099> if<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.910> doesn't<00:03:34.060> clear<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.480> thumb<00:03:34.750> ring

ring if it doesn't clear the thumb ring

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.430 
ring if it doesn't clear the thumb ring
then<00:03:36.129> it's<00:03:36.940> going<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.299> drop<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.230> pitch

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
then it's going to drop the pitch

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.099 
then it's going to drop the pitch
somewhat<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.190> fuzz<00:03:39.400> up<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:39.760> note<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.109> also

the thumb ring not being completely

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.580 
the thumb ring not being completely
cleared<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:43.359> it's<00:03:43.510> partially<00:03:43.930> depressed<00:03:44.379> it's

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
cleared if it's partially depressed it's

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.949 
cleared if it's partially depressed it's
going<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:44.889> depress<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.790> pad<00:03:46.000> under<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.449> a<00:03:46.480> key

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
going to depress the pad under the a key

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.770 
going to depress the pad under the a key
and<00:03:47.169> that<00:03:47.230> can<00:03:48.220> mess<00:03:48.400> stuff<00:03:48.639> up<00:03:48.879> so<00:03:49.180> it's<00:03:49.629> a

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
and that can mess stuff up so it's a

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.500 
and that can mess stuff up so it's a
really<00:03:49.989> good<00:03:50.079> thing<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.470> learn<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:50.980> practice

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
really good thing to learn to practice

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.069 
really good thing to learn to practice

do to help further clarify the note
besides<00:04:02.650> using<00:04:02.859> those<00:04:03.159> resonance<00:04:03.699> fingerings

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
besides using those resonance fingerings

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.970 
besides using those resonance fingerings
and<00:04:04.510> besides<00:04:04.870> making<00:04:05.079> sure<00:04:05.409> that<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.769> thumb

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
and besides making sure that the thumb

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
is clear first of all make sure the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.409 
is clear first of all make sure the
register<00:04:08.199> tube<00:04:08.799> is<00:04:09.040> clean<00:04:09.400> because<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.120> lot<00:04:10.389> of

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
register tube is clean because a lot of

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.360 
register tube is clean because a lot of
times<00:04:10.720> it<00:04:10.930> collects<00:04:11.349> debris<00:04:11.530> from<00:04:11.979> swabbing

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
times it collects debris from swabbing

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.399 
times it collects debris from swabbing
so<00:04:13.090> pull<00:04:13.359> that<00:04:13.540> register<00:04:14.019> key<00:04:14.199> off

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
so pull that register key off

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.370 
so pull that register key off
periodically<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.729> go<00:04:15.879> in<00:04:16.030> there<00:04:16.209> with<00:04:16.570> some

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
periodically and go in there with some

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.449 
periodically and go in there with some
some<00:04:18.659> pipe<00:04:19.659> cleaner<00:04:19.989> make<00:04:20.739> sure<00:04:20.919> that<00:04:21.130> all<00:04:21.159> the

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
some pipe cleaner make sure that all the

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.219 
some pipe cleaner make sure that all the
debris<00:04:21.760> is<00:04:21.970> out<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.330> register<00:04:22.810> key<00:04:22.990> that

get a court pad and that will make the

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
drop your air back or and you don't

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.340 
drop your air back or and you don't
increase<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:11.419> embouchure<00:05:11.780> pressure<00:05:12.169> you

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
increase the embouchure pressure you

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.650 
increase the embouchure pressure you
don't<00:05:12.530> start<00:05:12.830> biting<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.460> lot<00:05:13.700> of<00:05:13.820> people<00:05:14.120> when

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
don't start biting a lot of people when

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.180 
don't start biting a lot of people when
they<00:05:14.780> play<00:05:14.960> that<00:05:14.990> stuff<00:05:15.410> you<00:05:15.530> throat<00:05:15.770> B<00:05:15.950> flat

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
they play that stuff you throat B flat

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.680 
they play that stuff you throat B flat
they<00:05:16.460> drop<00:05:16.700> their<00:05:16.880> air<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:19.510> they<00:05:20.510> also

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
they drop their air and they also

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.810 
they drop their air and they also
increase<00:05:21.110> embouchure<00:05:21.590> pressure<00:05:21.950> well<00:05:22.280> all

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
increase embouchure pressure well all

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.170 
increase embouchure pressure well all
that<00:05:23.120> does<00:05:23.360> is<00:05:23.390> increase<00:05:23.960> resistance<00:05:24.380> and

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
that does is increase resistance and

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.320 
that does is increase resistance and
that<00:05:26.180> makes<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.570> throat<00:05:26.840> even<00:05:27.080> worse<00:05:28.330> finally

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
that makes the throat even worse finally

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.090 
that makes the throat even worse finally
another<00:05:29.810> equipment<00:05:30.470> thing<00:05:30.590> that<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:30.830> can<00:05:30.950> do

another equipment thing that you can do

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.440 
another equipment thing that you can do
is<00:05:31.280> to<00:05:31.400> make<00:05:31.610> sure<00:05:31.640> that<00:05:32.090> you're<00:05:32.210> playing

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
is to make sure that you're playing

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.570 
is to make sure that you're playing

note imbalance in a read will make it

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.159 
note imbalance in a read will make it
worse<00:05:40.280> it'll<00:05:40.640> amplify<00:05:41.000> it<00:05:41.270> so<00:05:41.600> if<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:41.870> notes<00:05:42.050> a
