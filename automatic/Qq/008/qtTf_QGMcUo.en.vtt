00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:54.040 
and I think we should add a fence the
fences<00:03:40.040> just<00:03:40.400> click<00:03:40.700> together

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.309

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
shelter for Chester the chicken on this

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:29.000

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.490 
Chester the chicken on top
I<00:04:44.389> think<00:04:45.389> jester<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> chicken<00:04:46.200> is<00:04:46.320> pretty

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
I think jester the chicken is pretty

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:54.440 
I think jester the chicken is pretty
happy<00:04:46.979> up<00:04:47.100> there<00:04:52.610> maybe<00:04:53.610> just<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:54.150> chicken

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
happy up there maybe just a chicken

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.290 
happy up there maybe just a chicken
would<00:04:54.600> like<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.930> yellow<00:04:55.169> flower<00:04:58.820> on<00:04:59.820> that

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
would like the yellow flower on that

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.820 
would like the yellow flower on that
side<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.910> farm<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.510> really<00:05:03.720> coming<00:05:04.229> along

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:19.120 
I think the farmer wants to go for a
spin<00:05:16.070> here<00:05:17.070> he<00:05:17.190> comes
