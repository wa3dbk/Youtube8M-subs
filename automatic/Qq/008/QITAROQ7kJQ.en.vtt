00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
valuable as Roy so isn't our best pull

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.630 
valuable as Roy so isn't our best pull
of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> series<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.799> far<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> best

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
