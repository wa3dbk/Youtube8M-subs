00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
trying to say was shielding yourself

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.999 
trying to say was shielding yourself
from<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.540> fish<00:01:58.780> when<00:01:59.410> you<00:01:59.530> come<00:01:59.710> up<00:01:59.860> on

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
from the fish when you come up on

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.520 
from the fish when you come up on
pockets<00:02:00.490> or<00:02:00.640> reads<00:02:00.820> like<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.330> it's<00:02:02.320> awesome

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
pockets or reads like this it's awesome

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
to fish the front side of those reeds in

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.210 
to fish the front side of those reeds in
other<00:02:05.020> words<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.740> part<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.130> you're

other words the part that you're
actually<00:02:06.369> facing<00:02:06.790> but<00:02:07.180> what<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.930> can<00:02:08.140> do<00:02:08.259> is

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
actually facing but what you can do is

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.930 
actually facing but what you can do is
when<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.679> get<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.070> edges<00:02:09.489> of<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.670> reeds

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
when you get to the edges of the reeds

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.420 
when you get to the edges of the reeds
you<00:02:10.600> can<00:02:10.780> actually<00:02:11.040> fling<00:02:12.040> your<00:02:12.190> lure

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
you can actually fling your lure

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.130 
you can actually fling your lure
whatever<00:02:13.150> bait<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.600> you're<00:02:13.720> flipping<00:02:14.050> her

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
whatever bait that you're flipping her

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.540 
whatever bait that you're flipping her
pitch<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.650> actually<00:02:14.800> pendulum<00:02:15.430> it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
pitch and you can actually pendulum it

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.280 
pitch and you can actually pendulum it
around<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.030> edge<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.930> what<00:02:17.110> you're<00:02:17.260> doing

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
around the edge and so what you're doing

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.699 
around the edge and so what you're doing
you<00:02:18.010> know<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.550> almost<00:02:19.420> it's<00:02:20.290> almost<00:02:20.440> a

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
you know this is a almost it's almost a

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.949 
you know this is a almost it's almost a
free<00:02:20.830> pounder<00:02:21.280> it's<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:21.670> heavy<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:22.330> can't

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
free pounder it's so heavy I can't

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.600 
free pounder it's so heavy I can't
really<00:02:23.080> believe<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.440> but<00:02:29.040> what<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.190> can<00:02:30.370> do<00:02:30.489> is

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
really believe it but what you can do is

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.250 
really believe it but what you can do is
pendulum<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.209> lure<00:02:31.420> around<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.900> edge<00:02:32.019> and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
pendulum that lure around the edge and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.870 
pendulum that lure around the edge and
so<00:02:32.410> what<00:02:32.709> you're<00:02:32.830> doing<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:33.070> you're<00:02:33.220> attacking

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
so what you're doing is you're attacking

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.880 
so what you're doing is you're attacking
fish<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.690> have<00:02:34.900> no<00:02:35.110> clue<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.380> you're<00:02:35.680> even

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
fish that have no clue that you're even

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.160 
fish that have no clue that you're even
in<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.100> area<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:37.630> know<00:02:37.690> turning<00:02:37.959> off<00:02:38.140> your

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
things can help when you're attacking

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.430 
things can help when you're attacking
pre-spawn<00:02:45.459> fish<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.120> obviously<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.290> know

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
bug and it's still going strong I've

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.830 
bug and it's still going strong I've
never<00:03:40.300> had<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.960> creature<00:03:41.740> bait<00:03:42.010> last<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.550> long

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
never had a creature bait last that long

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.940 
never had a creature bait last that long
you<00:03:43.840> know<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.080> in<00:03:44.290> your<00:03:44.410> hands<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.710> doesn't

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
you know just in your hands it doesn't

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.320 
you know just in your hands it doesn't
feel<00:03:45.070> any<00:03:45.280> different<00:03:45.310> than<00:03:45.670> any<00:03:45.850> other<00:03:45.910> soft

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
feel any different than any other soft

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.070 
feel any different than any other soft
plastic<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:48.060> mean<00:03:49.060> it's<00:03:49.210> definitely<00:03:49.420> ripping

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
plastic I mean it's definitely ripping

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.320 
plastic I mean it's definitely ripping
but<00:03:50.380> it's<00:03:51.160> ripping<00:03:51.430> down<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.730> seam<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.300> the

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
but it's ripping down the seam of the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.840 
but it's ripping down the seam of the
bait<00:03:52.540> where<00:03:53.380> most<00:03:53.560> most<00:03:54.100> of<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.280> hook<00:03:54.460> points

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
bait where most most of the hook points

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.660 
bait where most most of the hook points
you<00:03:55.360> know<00:03:55.480> are<00:03:55.570> inserted<00:03:56.050> at<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:56.580> what<00:03:57.580> I'm

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
you know are inserted at and so what I'm

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.250 
you know are inserted at and so what I'm
doing<00:03:57.700> is<00:03:57.970> I'm<00:03:58.090> just<00:03:58.270> continually<00:03:58.930> bearing

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
doing is I'm just continually bearing

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.340 
doing is I'm just continually bearing
the<00:03:59.410> hook<00:03:59.620> farther<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:00.610> farther<00:04:00.880> down<00:04:01.180> but<00:04:01.540> it

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
the hook farther and farther down but it

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.740 
the hook farther and farther down but it
seems<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.620> be<00:04:02.710> doing<00:04:02.920> alright<00:04:03.100> so<00:04:03.750> that's

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
seems to be doing alright so that's

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.390 
seems to be doing alright so that's
that's<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.440> really<00:04:05.680> cool<00:04:05.890> thing<00:04:06.160> right<00:04:06.370> now

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.280 
that's a really cool thing right now
that<00:04:06.790> I'm<00:04:07.090> not<00:04:07.330> wasting<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:07.840> lot<00:04:07.959> of<00:04:08.020> soft

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
that I'm not wasting a lot of soft

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.560 
that I'm not wasting a lot of soft
plastic<00:04:08.860> so<00:04:09.130> I'll<00:04:09.580> keep<00:04:09.790> an<00:04:09.940> eye<00:04:10.060> on<00:04:10.090> that<00:04:10.390> and

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
plastic so I'll keep an eye on that and

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.229 
plastic so I'll keep an eye on that and

really see if you know if this is a lot

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.400 
really see if you know if this is a lot
more<00:04:13.420> durable<00:04:13.840> than<00:04:13.900> some<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.290> my<00:04:14.320> other

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
more durable than some of my other

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.550 
more durable than some of my other
