00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.030
 ah 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.590
 very good to all friends I am me and 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.410
 good today I bring you a news that 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.439
 it has to do with ps3 as it says 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.949
 title they are and start to ban 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.050
 ps3 with a custom firmware that is to say with 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.000
 pirated software like software 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.250
 of the pirated system 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.560
 it was back to the load and has started to 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.900
 ban consoles with custom firmware that 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.090
 they make use of playstation network was of 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.730
 hope that then the company 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.760
 counterattack in this way since a 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.350
 level of security in the firmware of the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.440
 system because you have nothing to do 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.559
 since it is completely broken the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.239
 security of ps3 what not in the past 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.460
 firmware is that is the new one can be 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.650
 hack the latest firmware I hope the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.730
 ps3 that are already pirates were already 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.770
 pirated as the 3.55 custom framework 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.900
 Well, you can 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.360
 you can install a higher cost 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.180
 no problems no and this allows you 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.640
 and access the playstation network and 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.140
 logically being able to play online and how it is 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.990
 the form what is the form of 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.410
 counterattack sonny then in varying 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.880
 the consoles basically for this already 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.820
 a few days ago I had sent a 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.340
 Special announcements are and warning 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.960
 then to the users that have 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.050
 unauthorized software for 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.680
 playstation3 warning what they could 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.990
 to be banned from playstation 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.080
 network which is the way that baneo 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.410
 are doing right now what are 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.430
 basically doing two ways 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.820
 varying by playstation account 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.740
 network is to say varying the account and 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.560
 in some cases it has also been reported 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.600
 who have banned the address of the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.080
 cohesion is to say the direction of the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.229
 network card that you then have each 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.229
 ps3 not every ps3 has its own mac that 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.720
 it differentiates them from others 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.269
 and well basically that's what the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.840
 colors have already been put to work 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.390
 sorry to create applications that 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.530
 help fight the voucher or even now 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.780
 I think it has come out of some other 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.120
 application that allows to unseat the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.040
 console and well this is going to be like the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.680
 game of cat and mouse not 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.680
 sn against sony sony with 3 n 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.049
 counterattacking in that way and then that 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.790
 going to counterattack they're going to take out some 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.700
 applications that allow to plan 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.920
 then they are and will re- ban and so 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.110
 good will continue to happen will continue to happen 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.290
 the same we will not see in what it ends 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.560
 all this but the main news is 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.870
 in which they are and has already put 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.060
 moved tab not and is already counterattacking 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.230
 with this to the users that we have 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.810
 a ps3 with custom firmware installed and 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.370
 so little more the creative if you want 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.440
 you can leave your doubts 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.299
