00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.550
 Hello dear 1000 ps fans I am today 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.320
 with the honda forza 3 100 on the way 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.990
 basically very smart scooter because 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.730
 moving in the middle luxury segment 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.100
 in my opinion the golden mean 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.320
 golden middle especially because of the engine 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.810
 is not a small 125cc engine 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.869
 the vaarts may afford at most 510 ps 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.820
 gives just 25 under 25 ps 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.400
 On the back wheel is not synonymous therefore 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.859
 as powerful as one of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.360
 honda in sw t600 he of course also his 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.620
 Above all, however, land has advantages over land 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.610
 in total these are 300 400 euro for 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 me the golden middle 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.640
 It's easy in the city as well 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.640
 Bring a lot over the country 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.730
 Before that , 300 makes a lot of me 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.350
 manoeuvrable impression but that may also be true 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.820
 this low disk are you 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.039
 feels like on a naked bike or 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.750
 in the from a ticket roller the 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.409
 Windbreak is now not quite 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.740
 optimal 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.810
 but about 300 anyway not so good 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.340
 as that would be noticeable 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.740
 that's all right on the highway 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.509
 long until he gets close to his 140th 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.909
 but rises so highway speed 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.240
 Goes well and then accelerates too 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.240
 pretty good 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.150
 the chassis of the front 2 300 is not 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.940
 his strength is his strength, too 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.350
 not his weakness, probably 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.850
 a lot of people at his scooter very much 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.140
 it will be important that he 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.460
 comfortable springs and he does too 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.770
 athletic outbursts do not necessarily like 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.479
 as seen in fast-driven turns 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.520
 it's pretty spongy 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.800
 the chassis is bad it is 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.320
 but certainly not 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.270
 the brake of before 2 300 performed 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.950
 Your service is also faultless 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.229
 see here combined abs 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.790
 which means front and rear wheel are 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.560
 combined together 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.620
 but that itself works perfectly 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.420
 on wet well and certainly one 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.010
 Safety feature is the brake itself 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.330
 decelerates before 2 300 but also 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.010
 very good so she is not 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.720
 undersized she is now too 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.490
 certainly not extremely sporty but you 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.550
 does her service without any problems 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.350
 the fittings that forza are mine 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.620
 opinion after the gem of the 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.750
 rollers because they are typically under extreme 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.080
 high-quality look like in a car the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.840
 Round instruments also relatively high quality 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.300
 the switches to open the bench 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.610
 and to open the tank where the 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.410
 plastic could be a bit better 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.340
 but okay he should be relatively 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.900
 be cheap 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.360
 that was probably too expensive mattrick 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.610
 on it is relatively strict but it 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.740
 works and the sitting position 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.250
 really succeeded so the 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.650
 saddle 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.720
 sitting with this trough times extremely comfortable 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.850
 actually like on a much bigger one 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.720
 Scooter just out of the real 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.920
 luxusklasse 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.220
 the luggage compartment of the ford is a must 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.880
 already say it is very rugged 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.010
 Rear space for an integral helmet 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.840
 a jet helmet could fit in the front 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.820
 Anyway, it's totally downhill 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.920
 if you put something in the kitchen completely 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.350
 definitely down the helmet stays now 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.739
 once lie and you can then to 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.940
 office windows have to do then stop it 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.380
 but knock even if the helmet is not 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.440
 because one has to be the profess on it 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.080
 knock those are just so small say 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.270
 once comfort weaken it 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.739
 works and it fit in brightly 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.810
 after all, there is a role in which so 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.959
 a helmet does not fit at all 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.430
 is the honda forza 301 relatively 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.630
 the scooter is grown up 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.420
 Of course not with the big ones 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.870
 take good with great wind protection 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.560
 but can for the small 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.560
 Lengths beats when it comes to country roads 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.849
 Speed and country sections but goes 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.849
 just in the urban jungle 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.489
 reasonably well it comes through relatively 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.930
 wide okay but that does not bother me that way 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.430
 very and he is pretty windy the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.250
 conspiracy so that actually fits 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.120
 Everything the design of the pre 2 300 is like 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.880
 always a matter of taste 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.490
 It reminds me more of this 125cc 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.010
 pcx also apart from each other but date 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.810
 also like it very much 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.560
 futuristic lines in total 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.080
 fits that the tail is maybe too 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.199
 taste thing maybe plump advised 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.830
 but I also like that with these 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.850
 the bulky shine a bit 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.560
 mediate status symbol he sees 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.560
 little bit like his spd a big one
