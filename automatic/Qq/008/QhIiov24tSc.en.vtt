 the character you are very lightly 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.259
 To dream is not to marry him, okay? 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.839
 I also did not think that this video will 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.340
 being aware and prepared because 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.400
 if not that

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.890
 that we like the same thing 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.079
 Taking out of nowhere began to be urgent. 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.390
 the better if people just because 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.789
 this one arrives more against each other 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.879
 or just because you know you think you know or 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.489
 knows I know but still others and there 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.420
 It began that thing put clothes

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.780
 Kumbh arrives so I did first let's go 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.609
 think of the origin of the word is in the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.530
 japan come back with the used car to 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.240
 add anyone who to the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.439
 anything 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.380
 that is, if the gym returned to 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.400
 girl realizes if conquest is a 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.259
 otaku of this thing is fixed in r is a 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960
 obstacle 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.500
 Only when he came to Brazil. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.900
 or better near America he came with 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.890
 a different meaning perhaps because it is a 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.770
 Japanese term was better known 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.930
 In Japan, they used to come back 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.050
 for people who like to laugh is that 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.070
 You do not have to use public target stuff. 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.930
 people like him very firm is 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.520
 much easier to rob 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.830
 it is the same as a person who is the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.670
 What is a rock person? 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.700
 glam equals zero with the hypothesis that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.300
 likes harry potter is because it's a 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.670
 term used in people who like to 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.190
 put compensate people who like br 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.369
 half wanted to set how many 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.350
 those I like how she should see how 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.140
 until it behaves as it should interact 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.950
 with rich does not like what the real 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.769
 kusa 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.489
 or the cacusso all those people 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.300
 that likes you fits in that 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.430
 profile 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.780
 Of course, Brazilians have that thing. 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:33.709
 Wonderful 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:35.660
 You look good, you fucking internet. 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.790
 It's true that in Japan it 's one thing. 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.500
 pejorative but it's because he does not think 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:46.579
 the staff of a single 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:50.030
 thing her whole life she worked everything 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:53.239
 and start flying everyone says more 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.420
 It's all good because a year of 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.420
 far 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.720
 if you started to speak the name but they are 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.720
 half and 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.290
 for example I like gym 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.239
 I accept on 21 more people here 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.950
 I got in her entire line in a 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.989
 academy for some criticism I know of 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.390
 but I do not go there from the personal blog that 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.900
 run her because she stays in the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.799
 I did not like it and I did not like the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.680
 two colors 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.310
 so if you do not like the car 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.459
 It is the federation and was the one who said he did not 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.650
 and drawing is a place that is not drawing is 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.900
 aline is just you do not look for it 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.549
 it's an interesting thing that 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.220
 people came to tell me that I needed 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.890
 search for the right audience or search for 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.660
 public or get out of that thing 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.540
 easy to aim nick amin tato leather and r 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.090
 silly my audience 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.319
 are people who like to care or 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:02.440
 I'm sure nobody hates you 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.060
 line that comes and subscribes to the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.160
 served because if the person did not 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.019
 imagine that I came here 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.440
 who also comes this whole discussion 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.750
 About your good, it's good, we 're 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.410
 that I was a stereotype that the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.410
 that see her hair 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.650
 in contrast, when people live 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.720
 In place is your son. 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.240
 to what they would never have imagined that I liked 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.620
 he because one of you who likes these 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.640
 things 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.200
 now something to marry anyone who likes 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.150
 of these things 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.140
 what's the exterior that someone who 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.630
 arrive 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.920
 I think it would be a person who 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.860
 smell 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.340
 I can not understand why you 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:53.860
 stay rocky for everything because the 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.860
 girl has colored hair and a kitchen 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:09.130
 attacked him 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:11.270
 It was only then that many people call 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.890
 superintendent this was developed 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:23.750
 but I was looking for a taco channel 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:25.910
 for who is the flu because the person practices 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:38.000
 The month starts to curse us back. 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:39.760
 reason then I think you do not like 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.250
 thing 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.410
 new people are now costing themselves out 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.680
 behind you do not have the same 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.270
 positive information has not passed 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.960
 knights of the zodiac at the time he did not 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.590
 was football that passes the vernay track 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:07.560
 but the person has personal betting on the site 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:15.280
 because it gets knee silva're there to 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:17.320
 Guys are going to have more head in Shanghai has been 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.810
 in the garden for you to buy what is 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.540
 much better for everyone does not arrive 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.880
 It's cute and thinking there are people. 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.220
 who does not have the moral to talk about the club 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.050
 or think you're in bad weather and I 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.620
 I do not like this kind of video to felipe 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.720
 Snows cursing everyone helps everything 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.480
 world right 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.300
 I can not take any more rich people who 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.920
 likes the same thing because at the end of 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.530
 positions at the forefront of the 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.280
 shell or liking miralles and excel 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.820
 word 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.540
 We are all attacks and as my 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.400
 mom 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.400
 each with his Sukita pupil
