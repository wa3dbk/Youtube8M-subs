00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.060
 And then folks, it's okay, we'll be there. 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.280
 here quickly analyzing anatomy of the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.580
 digestive system with this software I 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.769
 I bought it here so it 's passing the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.049
 hi to him all right but I'll take 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.710
 here's the skin for us to see 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:26.430
 the gut wedge a good idea 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:32.300
 proposal and see also I can make a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.780
 Illegal layout to rotate by other other 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.230
 visions 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:46.170
 Well, that's cool, let's put it here. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:50.309
 Side Saddle digestive system 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 obviously the mouth up here in a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.620
 tube the pharynx and select the mouth 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.360
 of rosinha and later the flour and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.609
 realize that the family and she have here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 a connection with the mouth and the pits 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.539
 nasal 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.390
 then it is part of both the 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.229
 digestive system such as the respiratory 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.260
 Larger Larger 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.210
 We can put here the gland 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.590
 an accessory parotid because this is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.810
 a salivary gland 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.409
 I will choose the others the parish is a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:32.670
 mandibular salivary gland and here it was 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:37.860
 equal to equal here beauty 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:48.140
 show and now going further back 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:48.140
 People find behind rosinha 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:02:04.049
 he will put the oni then follow the path 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.210
 digestive 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.959
 We are now in the stomach. 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.420
 later the food passes and goes 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.900
 passing the onset of the small intestine 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.620
 is a warm region will call from the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.900
 palm 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.450
 here you can not see the Adrian because the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.920
 intestine in front of the one I 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.650
 I'm going to put rosinha 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.300
 I know that the large intestine is in the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.920
 in front of dem am 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.800
 so the government is actually going through 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.220
 here behind it and it will end 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.959
 Aquino jejunum fasting in the second part 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.360
 of the small intestine 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.530
 I put it here pink after we 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.830
 will have here 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.140
 ig that the third party after having 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.080
 been a lawyer the food will move 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.980
 here in the seventeenth century in the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.959
 large intestine 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.049
 we see the attention here then 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.910
 large intestine seko colam ascending 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.130
 because food goes up here 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.890
 transverse glue the food passes through 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.819
 this part and transversally which is a 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.480
 descending sigmoid colon straight there 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:14.410
 underneath has a certain channel also highlighted 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.709
 the liver to clean here we see the 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.410
 panga and also gallbladder 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.980
 gallbladder and pancreas 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:28.180
 they have two double right which the Duke 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.549
 is the coconut that empties into the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.260
 duodenum that is here and the double 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.720
 pancreatic cancer that also 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.790
 inside of which the first one 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.549
 part of the small intestine is important 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.359
 because it receives secretion from the pancreas and 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.329
 son 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.760
 So, let's talk quickly now, what? 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.280
 happens in every part of that here 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.650
 well then in the mouth we have the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.070
 release of saliva from the glands 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.959
 salivary sure to happen 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.100
 digestion of carbohydrates by an enzyme 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.950
 call there are miracles to take a ph 7 o 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.890
 food 10 by the esophagus pharynx 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.319
 The last involuntary movement recalls that 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.930
 The digestive tract is formed by 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.480
 a smooth muscle and here in the stomach 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.209
 food will undergo digestion a 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.489
 called pepsin actually the stomach 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.789
 produces gastric juice in the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.440
 pool and hydrochloric acid and pool 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:27.250
 will be acting on the proteins 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.640
 and running on ph 2 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.820
 nor later in the year than the 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.880
 first part of the small intestine that 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.380
 will happen he will receive secretion 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.030
 of the pancreas 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.740
 here is liver and have billy going 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.410
 decreasing the size of the ashes in 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.300
 fat molecules to facilitate the 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.830
 management by the enzymes that are 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.420
 in the pancreas 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.510
 then the panda releases the pancreatic juice 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.030
 with sodium bicarbonate which will 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.400
 increase the ph of the food that came from 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.100
 stomach recalls that it was very acidic 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.840
 and also the enzymes that are the 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.540
 enzymes they have in the pancreas in juice 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.280
 pancreatic has trypsin that 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.390
 continue pool work 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.250
 stomach 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.980
 then it will break the peptides that 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.740
 come from the stomach will form of 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.350
 peptides that are in fact the union of 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.690
 two amino acids in the pancreas also has 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.830
 pancreatic amylase that continues or 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.110
 work of the threat to take 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.260
 break fear in maltose xvii and 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.940
 glycogen in maltose here in the swamp 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.910
 pancreatic cancer also has lipase 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.800
 pancreatic that is breaking 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.900
 lipids in alcohol and fatty acid and here 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.850
 also have nuclease that will break if 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.030
 Nuclear nucleus shots 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.520
 following June, we'll go 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.460
 find here another juice called 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.350
 enteric juice and an inner dream to people 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.050
 find more enzymes because here the 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.280
 final part of management 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.840
 which are the same ones that we find 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.630
 here we find an enzyme 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.240
 called a btt that it continues the 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.270
 work of pancreatic enzymes or 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.600
 be warned and will break peptide 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.760
 in two amino acids and will be ready 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.160
 for the population to take into account 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.100
 also has to clean base lipase that the 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.350
 enteric lipase that will break the 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.360
 lipids in alcohol and brÃ¡s 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.010
 here we find three enzymes 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:30.850
 old sacchar calls that are phase mal 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:33.520
 who will break maltose in 2011 sucrose 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.510
 which will break sucrose fructose glucose 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.390
 and lactase that will break the lactose 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.080
 lactose and, last but not least, 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.849
 call on 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.060
 the base team that will break the 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:47.110
 nucleotides in fantozzi base phosphate 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.319
 nitrogen 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.389
 and here on the knee will happen to 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.599
 absorption of all these 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:56.879
 nutrients that have been 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:59.349
 processed along the digestive tract 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:02.610
 so this is important for absorption 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:06.610
 of carbohydrates in the case of monosaccharides 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:09.520
 amino acids to the fatty acid that came 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.949
 of the base phosphate cleansing base 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.419
 nitrogen nucleus times 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.789
 and here in the large intestine we go 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:18.129
 have the absorption of mineral salts and 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:20.409
 formation of the fecal cake that will 

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:22.539
 then here in our beloved canal 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:24.219
 Okay, so I hope you liked it. 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.020
 of the new path 

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:28.300
 I'll do my next with the others. 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.699
 Good week systems 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.379
 good studies and focus for the week that 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:34.379
 A hug comes
