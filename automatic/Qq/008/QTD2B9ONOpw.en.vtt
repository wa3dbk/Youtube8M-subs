northeast corner of the building with
the<00:00:17.910> occupants<00:00:18.540> evacuating<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> structure

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
the occupants evacuating the structure

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.250 
the occupants evacuating the structure
upon<00:00:20.940> further<00:00:21.180> investigation<00:00:21.390> they<00:00:22.080> found

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
upon further investigation they found

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.470 
upon further investigation they found

that the fire was located an underground
electrical<00:00:25.020> vault<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.950> northeast<00:00:26.370> corner

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
electrical vault on the northeast corner

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.060 
electrical vault on the northeast corner
of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.970> structure<00:00:27.420> those<00:00:28.290> create<00:00:28.800> quite<00:00:29.010> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
of the structure those create quite a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.670 
of the structure those create quite a
hazardous<00:00:29.640> situation<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.930> our<00:00:31.020> firefighters

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
hazardous situation for our firefighters

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.799 
hazardous situation for our firefighters
we<00:00:32.279> don't<00:00:32.429> put<00:00:32.579> firefighters<00:00:33.300> down<00:00:33.420> inside

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
we don't put firefighters down inside

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.569 
we don't put firefighters down inside
the<00:00:33.960> vault<00:00:34.199> so<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.190> ended<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.519> doing

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the vault so what they ended up doing

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.400 
the vault so what they ended up doing
with<00:00:35.969> setup<00:00:36.329> using<00:00:36.449> water<00:00:36.839> on<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.260> use

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
with setup using water on it we use

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.899 
with setup using water on it we use
what's<00:00:37.649> called<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.920> dry<00:00:38.129> powder<00:00:38.370> or<00:00:38.699> dry

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:38.909 
what's called a dry powder or dry

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.060 
what's called a dry powder or dry
chemical<00:00:39.359> extinguisher<00:00:39.589> we<00:00:40.589> use<00:00:40.739> several

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
chemical extinguisher we use several

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.160 
chemical extinguisher we use several
blows<00:00:41.429> to<00:00:41.489> knock<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.059> flames<00:00:42.359> down<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.929> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
blows to knock the flames down in the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.809 
blows to knock the flames down in the
vault<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:44.100> we're<00:00:44.519> in<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.640> holding

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:44.819 
vault and then we're in a holding

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:46.610 
vault and then we're in a holding
pattern<00:00:44.999> until<00:00:45.449> a<00:00:45.659> Vista<00:00:46.050> gets<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.409> to<00:00:46.499> shut

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
pattern until a Vista gets here to shut

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.649 
pattern until a Vista gets here to shut
power<00:00:46.859> off<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.339> the<00:00:47.429> ball<00:00:47.609> which<00:00:48.179> they<00:00:48.239> did<00:00:48.539> at

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
power off to the ball which they did at

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.110 
power off to the ball which they did at
the<00:00:48.749> transformer<00:00:49.499> a<00:00:49.530> Vista<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.399> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the transformer a Vista was here just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.669 
the transformer a Vista was here just
after<00:00:51.269> I<00:00:51.479> got<00:00:51.749> here<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.260> had<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.409> crew

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:52.679 
after I got here so they had a crew

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.040 
after I got here so they had a crew
right<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.129> scene<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.839> key

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
right on scene it's just really the key

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410 
right on scene it's just really the key
for<00:00:55.289> us<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.949> working<00:00:56.609> by<00:00:56.729> firelight<00:00:56.999> shows

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
for us and working by firelight shows

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
for us and working by firelight shows
any<00:00:57.899> hotel<00:00:58.199> tell<00:00:58.589> us<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:58.889> an<00:00:58.979> electrical

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
any hotel tell us what an electrical

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.610 
any hotel tell us what an electrical
vault<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.789> or<00:01:00.269> how<00:01:00.659> the<00:01:00.719> position<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.379> cute

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
vault is or how the position of cute

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.039 
vault is or how the position of cute
it's<00:01:01.769> just<00:01:01.920> an<00:01:02.010> accumulation<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:03.049> electrical

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
it's just an accumulation of electrical

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.209 
it's just an accumulation of electrical
wires<00:01:04.229> wires<00:01:04.710> circuitry<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.979> what<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.070> does

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
wires wires circuitry and what it does

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.609 
wires wires circuitry and what it does
is<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.460> feeds<00:01:09.060> electrical<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.320> vault

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
is it feeds electrical from that vault

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.560 
is it feeds electrical from that vault
into<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.130> different<00:01:11.460> structures<00:01:11.939> it's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
into the different structures it's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.080 
into the different structures it's
basically<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.259> is<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.640> I'd<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.969> say

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
basically what it is and I'd like to say

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.819 
basically what it is and I'd like to say
we<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.810> those<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.229> often<00:01:16.469> that's

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
we don't have those very often that's

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.620 
we don't have those very often that's
the<00:01:16.979> first<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.310> I've<00:01:17.460> seen<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.939> dealt<00:01:18.509> with

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the first one I've seen and dealt with

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.789 
the first one I've seen and dealt with
in<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.289> about<00:01:19.469> 35<00:01:19.950> years<00:01:20.750> but<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.560> went

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
in just about 35 years but it all went

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
in just about 35 years but it all went
to<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:23.850> supposed<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.899> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to just like it was supposed to with the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.270 
to just like it was supposed to with the
Vista<00:01:25.289> getting<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:25.860> away<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
Vista getting here right away and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.590 
Vista getting here right away and
getting<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.490> power<00:01:26.610> shut<00:01:26.939> off<00:01:26.969> to<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
getting the power shut off to it and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.469 
getting the power shut off to it and
with<00:01:28.469> our<00:01:28.619> crews<00:01:28.859> using<00:01:29.189> dry<00:01:29.340> chemicals<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.969> so

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
with our crews using dry chemicals on so

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.029 
with our crews using dry chemicals on so
in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> holding<00:01:31.020> pattern<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.500> mean<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.890> this

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
in the holding pattern I mean of this

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.999 
in the holding pattern I mean of this
showing<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.939> as<00:01:33.060> fast<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:33.719> did<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.229> mean
