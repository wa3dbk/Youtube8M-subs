more I mean your designs are completely
fine<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.729> are<00:01:38.759> screen<00:01:39.210> printers<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
fine we are screen printers and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.550 
fine we are screen printers and
designing<00:01:40.079> things<00:01:40.740> comes<00:01:41.040> naturally<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> us

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
