00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.340
 I said addicts in turkey the field we opened 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.740
 here and today taking advantage of a little bit 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.549
 this climate of expectations the euro was 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.460
 of 4 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.150
 I'll talk a little about what I think it is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.269
 of air vehicles in general and what I 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.769
 I think of dog fights in the third quarter as 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.289
 First, I'll talk a little bit here. 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.980
 about it from here fight that I over 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.170
 they 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.750
 it's so easy it 's something that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.660
 popularized a lot after a while 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.450
 The beginning, nobody's cool for this. 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 and nowadays there are people who only stay 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 training hurts fight, right? 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.350
 I do not really like to train 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.870
 dog fight I like to play more 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.329
 all the ways that I can can 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.399
 so turkey field so you know 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.739
 that the tank game is already today 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.020
 helicopter already the dj jorge infantry 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.719
 I play with everything practically right 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.570
 and this is a game show, of course 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.489
 I really like piloting jets, huh? 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.090
 It is obvious that he did not start flying well. 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.799
 But now I quit a little but it's dog. 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.689
 fight is not not something I have 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.090
 very well trained 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.439
 and also simply because I think it hurts 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.360
 band in neighborhood c3 well and realistic is 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.299
 Of course there are people who like it, I can not. 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.200
 to say nothing is the way one likes 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.840
 to play nÃ© doing dogfight cx1 ee 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.340
 that workout is all right and talking about 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.049
 was one of 4 things that I 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.500
 I would like them to do it 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.970
 would be is jets and air vehicles more 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.070
 realistic not 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.270
 so we would have of what makes the most 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.130
 realistic 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.560
 everyone would gain even more 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.659
 who likes dog fights right? 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.610
 in November was 2 certainly under 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.759
 were more realistic 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.460
 especially because the game physics all 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.770
 was much more realistic. 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.710
 not arriving at it simulator is obvious but 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.780
 It was a lot harder for you to drive. 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.700
 I have not found the way to 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.610
 piloting number was 2 up because I 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.649
 I do not play but it is much more difficult and not 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.500
 I want to escape three that I also wanted 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.710
 comment that the physical number was 3 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.960
 It's really easy, right? 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.330
 at least the aerial vehicles are well 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.580
 easy to drive what I meant 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.240
 and also love fight in turkey escape two 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.720
 It is not said that the pilot had to be 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.820
 more creative then not saying that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.190
 number was 3 you do not have to be 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.130
 creative in a doc obvious fight you 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.390
 No, no, no, you ask but I do not want 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.750
 a son of two businessmen and more 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.370
 creative approach is in their maneuvers and another 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.860
 Also, I would like them to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.060
 they did number was 4 is that they would 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.090
 would feed 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.000
 the number of ammunition of vehicles or 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.640
 just as it was in turkey to escape two is with 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.420
 certainty that is more realistic so 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.970
 example a jet will not have roque pottes 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.980
 infinite to destroy the tank is it 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.680
 will destroy a tank will return to the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.200
 quickie base is more structure here 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.420
 I think it would be much more realistic and 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.459
 also more balanced we can say 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.220
 well, not wanting to say that already 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.290
 cooperate was 3 are to have power but 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.500
 so you would have to have a control 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.440
 best of your resources, and the presence 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.380
 You are a helicopter. 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.720
 You will not be able to and soon after this and 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.910
 destroyed stain was you would have to 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.220
 back at the base pick up ammo and laide 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.760
 Air newcomer without counting so 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.320
 influence will be greater in the team, right? 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.570
 so you can not always be 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.950
 helping them so this will require 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.170
 more tactic you will have to have is the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.030
 times to attack to help the 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.390
 team and everything else then that basically 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.860
 force that the team has more 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.320
 coordination in the one thing that also 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.310
 can improve number was 4 would be the 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.010
 Ceiling of your ne Some maps have ceilings is 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.860
 higher and others lower right 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.530
 I think it's like leaving the ceiling higher 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.730
 would do no harm and of course this 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.850
 is to force the projects did not leave the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.519
 Battlefield, but I do not think it has 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.340
 that being as extreme as some 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.770
 maps like some maps you do not 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.290
 manages to leave 500 meters in height 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.320
 we can 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.720
 thus following the same direction and 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.910
 can also increase the speed of 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.650
 jets, for those who do not already know that in 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.790
 real life is can reach and up to 1900 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.670
 kilometers per hour, right? 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:47.260
 the number was 3 you only get to some 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:50.500
 400 knots is the mile per hour meme 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.870
 like to know why not act does not say but 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.290
 Aviation we talk about is not that the 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.880
 unit of speed and basically 300 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:03.010
 we for example would be 500 and something 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.290
 miles per hour which is already well 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.990
 quick but clear it could be more 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.790
 quick to see the son so I do not know 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.420
 Can you reach the most places? 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.070
 fast and last thing is something that I 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.460
 I really want them here they put a 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.130
 delay to edit right with you know 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.700
 when people are disabled in the 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.200
 jet just one place from here to the guy who 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.910
 disabled 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.090
 so I think if they did 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:35.110
 some kind of animation is not need to be 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.540
 It's so slow too, not too fast, but to 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.000
 at least so the guy in the 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.940
 instantly exiting the jet is in the 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.300
 last second does not already hold 1% it goes 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.550
 there and still gets out alive and I think 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.190
 that if they increase regulation 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.180
 not if they put a delay on 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.400
 To edit 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.980
 I think it would be more realistic and right 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.980
 reminding staff that I'm not good 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.530
 in the fight I spoke of easy touch but 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.140
 I do not handle the dog does like I said 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.300
 I 'm not practicing the fight oil alone 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.160
 now in these last days that I am 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.410
 training a little bit but I'm good 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.140
 bad even occupy most people 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.820
 I do not haiti because I do not practice that 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.460
 I do not really like you 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.340
 but this is it and a message very quickly 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.870
 staff is today at 6 pm I 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.480
 I think it will stream online streaming on 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.450
 then stay connected then this 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.150
 It was my opinion what I expect is from 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.970
 bank was 4 of the top fight's and 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.490
 of the neighborhood was 4 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.240
 I hope it is more realistic, but such 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.770
 that's it 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.680
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.500
 video us 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.800
 they are lic and favorite and follow me on 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.199
 twitter of course is because here on youtube 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.900
 if you are enrolled you are not receiving 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.990
 cool son of the video so blind the twitter 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.090
 positioned you will like it and also 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.430
 check out my latest videos if you 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.360

 channel 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.350

 leave until the next 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.680
 Hi m
