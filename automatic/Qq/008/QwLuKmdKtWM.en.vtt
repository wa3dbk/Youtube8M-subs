haunting but it's kind of cool it's not

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.720 
haunting but it's kind of cool it's not
necessarily<00:02:21.720> musical<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:22.440> I'm<00:02:22.620> sure<00:02:22.730> here

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
necessarily musical as I'm sure here

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.930

to<00:02:29.549> playing<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.970> game<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.380> think<00:02:31.860> that's

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
to playing this game but I think that's

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.370 
to playing this game but I think that's
a<00:02:32.519> good<00:02:32.700> thing<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.750> feels<00:02:34.049> like<00:02:34.200> a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
a good thing that this this feels like a

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.170 
a good thing that this this feels like a
title<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.010> that's<00:02:35.250> meant<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.549> be<00:02:35.610> explored

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
title that that's meant to be explored

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.479 
title that that's meant to be explored
slowly<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.620> hard<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> understand

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
slowly and that is hard to understand

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.809 
slowly and that is hard to understand
there's<00:02:38.790> no<00:02:39.170> real<00:02:40.170> tutorial<00:02:40.920> or<00:02:41.190> gameplay
