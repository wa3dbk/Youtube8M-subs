00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.420
 good afternoon mikhail somehow went with a friend 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.310
 Armenian to pizzeria pizza was just 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.070
 great friend here did not like 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.230
 He said that the Armenian pizza tastier all 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.270
 please tell me nothing 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.330
 what kind of pizza is this artyom brewers 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.340
 Biysk city 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.980
 Artem I honestly thought that pizza 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.370
 this is an Italian invention 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.030
 but if your friend says she ’s forgotten 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.379
 armenia 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.379
 then we are already there 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.690
 in 1946 the Soviet government 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:19.020
 adopts repatriation order 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.780
 Armenians I will not tell how 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.289
 what happened is that there are few Armenians 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.220
 very much in armenia for 46 years from all countries 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.729
 flowed 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.950
 Armenians who lived around the world and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.190
 each of the new arrivals on 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.619
 something brought his historic homeland 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.229
 his from what he saw where he is 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.880
 lived those who came from the arab world from 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.569
 Iran from Iraq and Syria 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.819
 brought something from there like coffee 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:53.100
 those who came from america and europe 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:56.280
 parts of france brought something of their own 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.280
 what you see these street cafes 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.030
 they appeared in the middle of the last century in 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:07.110
 Armenia and this tradition is still very 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.660
 beautiful nice and cozy here in Yerevan 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:15.260
 Now with regard to this the Armenian pizza 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.720
 She has many analogues and Italian pizza 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.209
 his all the Arab world is also a shawarma 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.519
 frames in general is open 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.510
 Pie with meat plays here is also very 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:32.489
 popular in armenia is what we are talking about 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.859
 came here from Syria but brought from 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.109
 series here 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.010
 Armenians who are back in forty-six 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.269
 year 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.220
 Armenians are very talented people are those who 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.950
 came here decorated 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.210
 their state is the one who stayed behind 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.030
 abroad glorified abroad 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.380
 take I don’t know Aram Khachaturian or 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:02.330
 take sher sher charles aznavour 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.790
 from tennis player agassi I do not know Petrosyan 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.770
 of course we take naturally I have 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.550
 because of Tigran Petrosian world champions 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.510
 chess 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:15.170
 what do you think the word that came 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.780
 from abroad here won first 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.910
 Armenia and then conquers the whole world 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.910
 because Armenian pizza is 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.060
 so here's a pizza it's called lamoda 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.940
 which in Arabic means meat 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.100
 with a pastry dish it consists of bread 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.040
 cakes on which the minced meat is laid out 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.190
 lamb composition also includes onion garlic 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.260
 parsley hot pepper to taste and salt 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:56.000
 and here this stuffing girls laid out 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:59.500
 scream everyone says sorry I'm just not 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.940
 I can on two fronts ordered two teas 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:10.550
 fall rides and rides on the Armenian orise 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.780
 left and that's what we did see 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:19.100
 How beautifully stuffed this stuffing on a cake 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.769
 in principle, you can hang it on the wall and 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.380
 admire this impressionistic 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.040
 pictures but we won't do it we 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.990
 We send it all the same to the top 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.990
 people who drink a lot of tea 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.750
 then there is someone who will accept these 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:42.540
 cakes with these pizzas and will bake them in 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.389
 oven dough well you see that this dough 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.120
 the simplest water is salt and flour 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.310
 the same dough is used for what 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.090
 for Armenian lavash 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.389
 this is what makes this pizza from equestrian 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.410
 Armenian but look like from the ancients 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.570
 in Armenia it is baked pita 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.010
 sacrament is fire worship 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.380
 this is a mystery that ultimately 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.310
 ends with such flat cakes 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.699
 so 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.889
 anywhere in the world you will not meet such 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:17.220
 diet pizza because 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:19.260
 yeast-free light dough and mince this 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.990
 you can eat pizza and lose weight 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.160
 if you want to lose weight eat 40 of these pizzas 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.160
 nobody will recognize you 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:42.530
 and here's a unique result 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.439
 beautiful fragrant absolutely not 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.949
 high-calorie Armenian pizza 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:51.499
 In general, everything Armenian can be the most 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.930
 delicious but at least the most ancient 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:57.159
 because the country you already understand what 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:01.699
 here ararat beat his pens see 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:03.319
 Ararat is heavenly paradise now 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.259
 pleasure to make you taste better 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:09.639
 oldest dance in human history 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.639
 go share code 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.540
 and 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:36.159
 but
