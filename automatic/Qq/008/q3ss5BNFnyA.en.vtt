 people who do not know how to communicate the rom 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.500
 they always ask me then for better treatment 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.660

 on your device well let's go now where 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.920
 says and such if we address our 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.390
 microsd memory exactly in the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.430
 folders where we downloaded the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.380

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.620
 now below as everyone knows 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.650
 that at the start of each download what 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.569
 it's been the break it will take from 5 to 6 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.340
 minutes if you spend 10 minutes then 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.920
 all you have to do is take out the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.200

 device and will correctly load a 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.959
 Once we have confirmed what is the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.049
 break we will not find with your typical 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.239
 launcher what are also what the 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.950
 google services what what is more 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.659
 they also use some applications of 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.370
 hanoi the mod let's go into what they are 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.109

 version that has been mode can 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.489
 work to conquer now I imagine 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.819

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.409

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.560
