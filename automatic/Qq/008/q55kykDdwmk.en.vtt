something<00:00:14.280> maybe<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.730> can<00:00:14.910> use<00:00:15.269> with<00:00:15.570> half

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
something maybe you can use with half

this half slide first uncovered man

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.650 
this half slide first uncovered man
starts<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.310> turn<00:00:20.490> if<00:00:20.970> there's<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.300> better<00:00:21.449> way

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
starts to turn if there's a better way

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.720 
starts to turn if there's a better way
to<00:00:21.720> teach<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.020> all<00:00:22.710> right<00:00:22.920> then<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.519> know<00:00:23.640> I'm

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
to teach it all right then you know I'm

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.580 
to teach it all right then you know I'm
always<00:00:23.910> willing<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.420> learn<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.019> might<00:00:25.470> be

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
always willing to learn what might be

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.529 
always willing to learn what might be
better<00:00:25.800> i<00:00:26.070> think<00:00:26.310> that's<00:00:26.789> stood<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> test<00:00:27.210> of

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
better i think that's stood the test of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.120 
better i think that's stood the test of
time<00:00:27.599> against<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.199> bunch<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.500> different<00:00:28.619> fronts

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
time against a bunch of different fronts

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250

starts<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> turn<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.489> could<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.880> three-man

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
starts to turn it could be a three-man

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.600 
starts to turn it could be a three-man
turn<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.930> man<00:00:34.110> turn<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.950> showed<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> double

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
turn for man turn we showed the double

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.130 
turn for man turn we showed the double
eagle<00:00:35.700> front<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.149> was<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> no<00:00:36.480> man<00:00:36.719> term<00:00:36.960> that

all<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.550> keep<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.480> mind<00:00:48.719> how<00:00:48.930> many<00:00:48.989> times

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
all right keep in mind how many times

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.529 
all right keep in mind how many times
you<00:00:49.710> throw<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.340> throw<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.760> 30<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.239> 40

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
you throw it if you throw it 30 to 40

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.270 
you throw it if you throw it 30 to 40
times<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.260> better<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:52.980> bit<00:00:53.070> more

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280

times<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.910> probably<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.629> your

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
times this is probably right up your

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.580 
times this is probably right up your
alley<00:00:57.989> ok<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.879> throw<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.329> 30<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> 35<00:01:01.230> times

to seven drop back concepts if you throw
it<00:01:09.180> 12<00:01:09.450> times<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:10.049> wouldn't<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.710> crazy<00:01:11.040> with

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it 12 times I wouldn't get crazy with

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
it 12 times I wouldn't get crazy with
your<00:01:11.400> choice<00:01:11.670> routes<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.210> wouldn't<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:12.930> crazy

with<00:01:13.530> seven<00:01:14.310> or<00:01:14.549> six<00:01:14.840> concepts<00:01:15.840> i<00:01:16.020> would<00:01:16.170> carry

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
with seven or six concepts i would carry

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620 
with seven or six concepts i would carry
three<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.310> drop<00:01:17.610> back<00:01:17.820> concepts<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
three good drop back concepts that you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
three good drop back concepts that you
like<00:01:18.840> against<00:01:19.170> multiple<00:01:19.500> coverages<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.189> i

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
like against multiple coverages and i

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
like against multiple coverages and i
would<00:01:20.820> live<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.290> nature

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
would live that way because the nature

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
would live that way because the nature
of<00:01:22.710> your<00:01:22.860> play<00:01:23.250> calling<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.270> doesn't

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
of your play calling all right doesn't

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
of your play calling all right doesn't
merit<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.159> time<00:01:26.460> spent<00:01:26.939> practicing<00:01:28.040> 12<00:01:29.040> drop

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
merit the time spent practicing 12 drop

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
merit the time spent practicing 12 drop
back<00:01:29.520> passage<00:01:29.970> doesn't<00:01:30.329> merit<00:01:30.509> carrying

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
back passage doesn't merit carrying

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.760 
back passage doesn't merit carrying
seven<00:01:31.560> drop<00:01:31.770> back<00:01:31.979> schemes<00:01:32.810> ok<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.320> cost

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
seven drop back schemes ok it's not cost

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.770 
seven drop back schemes ok it's not cost
efficient<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.670> always<00:01:35.880> keep<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.360> mind<00:01:36.570> with

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
efficient so always keep in mind with

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.050 
efficient so always keep in mind with
your<00:01:36.930> philosophy<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.829> how<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> run

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
your philosophy and how you like to run

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.270 
your philosophy and how you like to run
things<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.630> Cole<00:01:39.900> things<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.320> offense<00:01:40.350> make

things and Cole things on offense make

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.550 
things and Cole things on offense make
it<00:01:41.490> time<00:01:41.759> efficient<00:01:42.329> cost<00:01:42.600> efficient<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.530> that
