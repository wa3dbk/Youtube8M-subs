00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.440
 Facebook 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.549
 so you can not integrate it here 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.330
 advertising you can not put it 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.859
 in published a status put a pub there 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.400

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.270
 advertising in html javascript etc 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.730

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:49.410

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 install it on which you 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:30.900

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.280
 set up so there you tick it's 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.950
 to display a share button 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.750

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.479
 that you will then create here you 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.500
 you find in the source section 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.290
 so he has you will be able to integrate 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.930
 any source code 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.720
 so you're going to look for an advertisement 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.830
 I opened a program that I have 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:12.430

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.850
 7 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.800
 so maybe advertising does not 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.800
 no suites appear 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:26.670
