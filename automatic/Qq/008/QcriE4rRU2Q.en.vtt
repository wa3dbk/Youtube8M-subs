00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
next one I could fret the fifth fret and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.830 
next one I could fret the fifth fret and
get<00:00:40.140> an<00:00:40.230> approximation<00:00:41.270> what<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> next<00:00:42.570> note

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
get an approximation what the next note

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.260 
get an approximation what the next note
should<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.200> now<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.550> next<00:00:44.910> note<00:00:45.090> in

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
should be now to get the next note in

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.190 
should be now to get the next note in
this<00:00:45.390> tuning<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.840> go<00:00:45.989> up<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.379> 7th<00:00:46.800> fret<00:00:46.969> and

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
this tuning I go up to the 7th fret and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
this tuning I go up to the 7th fret and
so<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.030> forth

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
so it's so and it's so on and so forth

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.520 
so it's so and it's so on and so forth
ah<00:00:51.920> fifth<00:00:52.920> fret<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.789> will<00:00:53.940> fourth<00:00:54.239> fret

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
ah fifth fret now that will fourth fret

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.049 
ah fifth fret now that will fourth fret
and<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.030> believe<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> third<00:00:57.329> trip<00:00:57.600> um

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
and now the believe a third trip um

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.250 
and now the believe a third trip um
nobody's<00:01:00.059> doing<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.420> anymore<00:01:00.690> everybody

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
nobody's doing this anymore everybody

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.030 
nobody's doing this anymore everybody
uses<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.010> tutor<00:01:02.789> um<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> good<00:01:04.439> tuner<00:01:04.710> but

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
uses a tutor um this is a good tuner but

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.460 
uses a tutor um this is a good tuner but
it's<00:01:05.189> not<00:01:05.400> chromatic<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.360> only<00:01:06.689> has<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.260> major

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it's not chromatic it only has the major

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.520 
it's not chromatic it only has the major
notes<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.040> doesn't<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:09.170> some<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> notes

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
notes it doesn't have some of the notes

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
notes it doesn't have some of the notes
i'm<00:01:10.740> needing<00:01:11.159> even<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.760> tuning<00:01:12.150> here

Geno so I can tune that limb to if
you're<00:01:43.130> going<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.460> go<00:01:43.580> out<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.850> buy<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:43.970> tuner

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
let's take one out of two and I'll show

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.430 
let's take one out of two and I'll show
you<00:02:27.510> what<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.900> hear<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.320> an

you what I be you can hear it it's an

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.020 
you what I be you can hear it it's an
opportunity<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:32.010> makes<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.250> nice<00:02:32.400> open<00:02:35.030> an

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.330

doesn't work that low on a dobro that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.490 
doesn't work that low on a dobro that
this<00:02:44.610> gives<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> certain<00:02:45.510> note<00:02:45.960> that<00:02:46.290> you

this gives you a certain note that you
then<00:02:46.710> have<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:46.980> buy<00:02:47.790> here<00:02:48.240> match<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> string

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
then have to buy here match to a string

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
this end by tuning so we stick with the

this end by tuning so we stick with the
tuner<00:02:58.230> hey<00:02:58.650> basically<00:02:59.550> any<00:02:59.790> tutor<00:03:00.240> will<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.630> so

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
tuner hey basically any tutor will be so

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.600 
tuner hey basically any tutor will be so
much<00:03:01.110> better<00:03:01.410> than<00:03:02.630> using<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.780> pitch<00:03:03.990> pipe<00:03:04.230> oh

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
much better than using a pitch pipe oh

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.740 
much better than using a pitch pipe oh
and<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.670> also<00:03:05.820> allows<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.420> play<00:03:06.600> along

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
and it also allows you to play along

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.440 
and it also allows you to play along
with<00:03:07.110> records<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.070> if<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.340> record<00:03:08.730> you'll<00:03:09.270> be

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
with records and if you record you'll be

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.980 
with records and if you record you'll be
attuned<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:09.960> other<00:03:10.170> people<00:03:10.560> later<00:03:10.740> on
