00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 in 1987 in new mexico usa 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.460
 paleontologist ferry mcdonald discovered 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.380
 a wide variety of footprints 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.719
 fossilized of various species 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.660
 different from animals and birds that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.369
 they found in a stratum of Permian 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.650
 between the various fossilized footprints 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.680
 They were clear traces of a foot 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.810
 human however the strata of 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.930
 Permian has been given between two hundred 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.539
 ninety to 248 million years 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.050
 millions of years before the animals 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.820
 the birds the dinosaurs and if man 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 supposedly there are then how to 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.480
 can explain these impressions in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.520
 July 1992 smithsonian magazine 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.760
 published an article on these topics 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 called petri 7 footprint apuz link for 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.190
 of offerman beatz petrified footprints 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.539
 a bewildering parade of beasts of 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.160
 Permian magazine recognized the mystery 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.489
 recognizing what paleontologists 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.870
 like to call problematic described what 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.360
 that seemed to be great 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.850
 of mammals and birds that evolved 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.760
 long after the Permian period without 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.310
 However, these clues are clearly 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.680
 Permian, although it is commendable that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 mcdonald and smithsonian recognize 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.910
 clearly the existence of these 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.070
 traces in a stratum that contradicts 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.350
 theory of current evolution is of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.810
 highlight that only the engravings stand out 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.230
 of birds and mammals and do not mention the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.910
 human footprint found with them 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.700
 curiously since these tracks have 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.260
 been discovered the evolutionists not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.650
 have tried to argue their 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.390
 authenticity or discredit them either 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.880
 have tried to argue that the footprint 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.070
 it's not from a human they many times 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.340
 they say it's an impression of 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.280
 that only looks like a human footprint its 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.740
 same silence is deafening this is 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.840
 the white raven theory all that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.060
 we have to do to show that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.910
 all the crows are black is to find 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.950
 just a white crow in the same way 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.420
 everything we have to do to 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.209
 prove that the history of man 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.560
 modern or possibly we know the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.010
 strata is 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.989
 a fossil like this however the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.810
 scientists just put it on a 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.300
 shelf labeling it as problematic 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.620
 and they continue in their rigid beliefs 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.500
 because the reality is too much 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.500
 inconvenience that is your good science
