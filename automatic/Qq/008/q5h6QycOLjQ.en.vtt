like 95 degrees it's not doing anything
oh<00:01:16.539> yeah

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:31.480 

you<00:01:22.760> know<00:01:22.910> what

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.060 

um

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.929 

well<00:01:36.110> I'm<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.290> entirely<00:01:37.649> how<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.399> sure<00:01:38.820> how

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
well I'm not entirely how for sure how

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.899 
well I'm not entirely how for sure how
long<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> takes<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.600> cook<00:01:39.810> an<00:01:39.960> egg<00:01:40.640> but<00:01:41.640> I'm

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
long it takes to cook an egg but I'm

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
long it takes to cook an egg but I'm
assuming<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.539> by<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.320> doing

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
assuming if by now it's not doing

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.389 
assuming if by now it's not doing
anything<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.990> probably<00:01:46.500> isn't<00:01:46.799> planning<00:01:47.159> on

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
anything it probably isn't planning on

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.560 
anything it probably isn't planning on
it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.050 

so<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:53.430> live<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.670> New<00:01:53.850> York<00:01:55.370> and<00:01:56.370> it's<00:01:56.550> 95

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so if you live in New York and it's 95

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.710 
so if you live in New York and it's 95
degrees<00:01:58.940> current<00:01:59.940> when<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.150> can't<00:02:00.360> fry<00:02:00.600> an

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
degrees current when you can't fry an

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.500 
degrees current when you can't fry an
egg<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.080> sidewalk<00:02:01.520> but<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:03.240> you're
