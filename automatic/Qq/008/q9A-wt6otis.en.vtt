00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.710 
might need to just have a look at the
temperature<00:02:49.220> just<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.820> fraction<00:02:50.180> lower<00:02:50.420> if

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
temperature just a fraction lower if

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.270 
temperature just a fraction lower if
you're<00:02:50.870> using<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.170> paper<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.070> make<00:02:52.250> a

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
you're using the paper so we make a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.740 
you're using the paper so we make a
couple<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:52.730> slashes<00:02:53.120> through<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.420> thickest

part<00:02:53.990> of<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.350> flesh<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.580> just<00:02:55.760> allows

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
part of the flesh and that just allows

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.820 
part of the flesh and that just allows
the<00:02:56.330> heat<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:57.230> little<00:02:57.410> bit<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.590> extra

the heat and a little bit of extra

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.390 
the heat and a little bit of extra
flavor<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:59.000> get<00:02:59.150> into<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.660> flesh<00:03:00.190> we'll<00:03:01.190> do<00:03:01.310> it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
flavor to get into the flesh we'll do it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.640 
flavor to get into the flesh we'll do it
on<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.520> other<00:03:01.610> side<00:03:02.000> as<00:03:02.210> well<00:03:02.390> what<00:03:03.320> you<00:03:03.440> can

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
on the other side as well what you can

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.940 
on the other side as well what you can
do<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.220> put<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:05.060> little<00:03:05.090> bit<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.570> your<00:03:05.950> flavoring

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
actually into those cuts so it actually

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.520 
actually into those cuts so it actually
gets<00:03:09.200> writing<00:03:09.740> down<00:03:09.980> with<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.250> flesh<00:03:10.459> is

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
couple of kaffir lime leaves so I just

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.199 
couple of kaffir lime leaves so I just
take<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.260> spine<00:03:42.620> out<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:43.820> like<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.060> little

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
take the spine out and I like a little

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.540 
take the spine out and I like a little
bit<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.540> ginger<00:03:44.830> because<00:03:45.830> I'm<00:03:46.130> only<00:03:46.280> going<00:03:46.520> to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
bit of ginger because I'm only going to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.550 
bit of ginger because I'm only going to
just<00:03:46.730> roll<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.150> up<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.570> leaves<00:03:48.140> shouldn't

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
just roll it up the leaves shouldn't

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.830 
just roll it up the leaves shouldn't
crack<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:49.940> might<00:03:50.090> just<00:03:50.269> put<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.450> little<00:03:50.660> bit

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
crack and I might just put a little bit

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.870 
crack and I might just put a little bit
of<00:03:51.080> oil<00:03:51.530> on<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.340> tail

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
of oil on the tail

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.500 
of oil on the tail
now<00:03:53.300> that's<00:03:53.510> preheated<00:03:54.320> on<00:03:54.590> 8<00:03:55.489> so<00:03:56.090> it's<00:03:56.300> about

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
now that's preheated on 8 so it's about

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.150 
now that's preheated on 8 so it's about
a<00:03:56.570> moderate<00:03:57.019> you<00:03:57.290> might<00:03:57.500> need<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.800> turn<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.070> up

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
a moderate you might need to turn it up

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.740 
a moderate you might need to turn it up
or<00:03:58.340> down<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.519> little<00:03:58.730> bit<00:03:58.880> depending<00:03:59.300> on<00:03:59.480> the

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
or down a little bit depending on the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.060 
or down a little bit depending on the
size<00:03:59.959> of<00:04:00.080> your<00:04:00.110> fish<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.590> thicker<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:00.860> is<00:04:01.010> the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
size of your fish the thicker it is the

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.190 
size of your fish the thicker it is the
lower<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.850> temperature<00:04:01.880> we're<00:04:02.870> going<00:04:02.989> to<00:04:03.050> put

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
lower the temperature we're going to put

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.750 
lower the temperature we're going to put
it<00:04:03.290> in<00:04:03.410> there<00:04:03.620> because<00:04:03.890> I've<00:04:04.190> put<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.519> banana

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
it in there because I've put the banana

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.670 
it in there because I've put the banana
leaves<00:04:05.000> around<00:04:05.330> twice<00:04:05.750> it's<00:04:06.230> probably<00:04:06.560> going

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
leaves around twice it's probably going

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.410 
leaves around twice it's probably going
to<00:04:06.739> take<00:04:06.890> about<00:04:06.920> five<00:04:07.160> or<00:04:07.489> six<00:04:07.640> minutes<00:04:07.850> to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
to take about five or six minutes to

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.089 
to take about five or six minutes to
cook<00:04:08.570> each<00:04:08.750> side

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
cook each side

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.920 
cook each side
because<00:04:10.879> it's<00:04:11.030> got<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.209> double<00:04:11.359> wrapping<00:04:11.719> of

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
because it's got a double wrapping of

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.420 
because it's got a double wrapping of
banana<00:04:12.200> leaves<00:04:12.409> can<00:04:12.799> take<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:12.980> bit<00:04:13.159> longer<00:04:13.340> for

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
banana leaves can take a bit longer for

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.369 
banana leaves can take a bit longer for
the<00:04:13.609> heat<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.879> get<00:04:13.999> through<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:14.359> okay<00:04:14.540> we'll

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
the heat to get through it okay we'll

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.020 
the heat to get through it okay we'll
leave<00:04:15.469> that<00:04:15.620> there<00:04:15.680> what<00:04:16.370> we<00:04:16.459> might<00:04:16.579> do<00:04:16.789> is<00:04:16.880> do

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
leave that there what we might do is do

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.229 
leave that there what we might do is do
a<00:04:17.060> couple<00:04:17.449> of<00:04:18.039> extra<00:04:19.039> garnishes<00:04:19.669> not

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
a couple of extra garnishes not

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.890 
a couple of extra garnishes not
everybody<00:04:20.690> likes<00:04:20.959> chili<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:22.570> we<00:04:23.570> might<00:04:23.750> just

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
everybody likes chili so we might just

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.110 
everybody likes chili so we might just
do<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.080> little<00:04:24.380> bit<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:25.160> benefits<00:04:25.610> of<00:04:25.729> using<00:04:25.880> a

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
do a little bit the benefits of using a

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.029 
do a little bit the benefits of using a
red<00:04:26.330> chili<00:04:26.599> is<00:04:26.900> two<00:04:27.410> things<00:04:27.650> that<00:04:27.830> if<00:04:27.919> you're

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
red chili is two things that if you're

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.379 
red chili is two things that if you're
cooking<00:04:28.370> with<00:04:28.460> red<00:04:28.639> chilies<00:04:29.000> they'll<00:04:29.180> hold

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
cooking with red chilies they'll hold

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.939 
cooking with red chilies they'll hold
their<00:04:29.539> color<00:04:29.840> but<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.590> other<00:04:30.710> really

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
their color but the other really

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.499 
their color but the other really
important<00:04:31.370> thing<00:04:31.400> is<00:04:31.639> the<00:04:31.789> chilies<00:04:32.090> ripened

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
important thing is the chilies ripened

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:33.999 
important thing is the chilies ripened
up<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:32.930> it's<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.110> little<00:04:33.289> bit<00:04:33.380> sweeter<00:04:33.680> we'll

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
up so it's a little bit sweeter we'll

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.270 
up so it's a little bit sweeter we'll
just<00:04:34.190> do<00:04:34.370> some<00:04:35.300> really<00:04:35.599> thin<00:04:36.110> little<00:04:36.289> slivers

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
just do some really thin little slivers

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.640 
just do some really thin little slivers
of<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:39.289> kaffir<00:04:39.590> lime<00:04:41.139> open<00:04:42.139> up<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.349> banana

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
of the kaffir lime open up the banana

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.999 
of the kaffir lime open up the banana
leaves<00:04:42.949> and<00:04:43.960> then<00:04:44.960> we<00:04:45.110> can<00:04:45.259> get<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.530> tip<00:04:45.770> of

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
leaves and then we can get the tip of

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.550 
leaves and then we can get the tip of
the<00:04:46.340> knife<00:04:46.490> sharp<00:04:47.120> knife<00:04:47.210> or<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:47.750> can<00:04:47.900> use<00:04:48.199> end
