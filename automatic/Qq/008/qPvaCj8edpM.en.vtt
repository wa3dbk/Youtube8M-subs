00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
carrots I don't know I got an idea that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.869 
carrots I don't know I got an idea that
I<00:00:45.719> wanted<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.200> carrot<00:00:46.590> socks<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.280> they

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
I wanted to make carrot socks so they

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.250 
I wanted to make carrot socks so they
have<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> little<00:00:48.270> bit<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.510> green<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> top

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
have a little bit of green at the top

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.889 
have a little bit of green at the top
and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.890> switched<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> orange<00:00:51.329> which<00:00:51.690> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
and then I switched to orange which is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.790 
and then I switched to orange which is
actually<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.430> colorway<00:00:54.090> carrot<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:55.020> nitpick

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
actually the colorway carrot in nitpick

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
actually the colorway carrot in nitpick
swish<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.480> green<00:00:57.690> is

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
swish and I think that the green is

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.470 
swish and I think that the green is

tomato<00:01:39.360> heel<00:01:40.020> which<00:01:40.590> seems<00:01:40.890> kind<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
tomato heel which seems kind of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.109 
tomato heel which seems kind of
appropriate<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:42.180> these<00:01:42.299> carrot<00:01:43.200> socks<00:01:43.470> I

appropriate for these carrot socks I

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.999

and<00:01:47.780> if<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.960> don't<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.350> I'll<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and if I don't do that I'll just do a

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.609 
and if I don't do that I'll just do a
standard<00:01:50.310> short<00:01:50.729> row<00:01:50.939> heel<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:54.470> maybe<00:01:55.470> I'll

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
standard short row heel and maybe I'll

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.520 
standard short row heel and maybe I'll
do<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> video<00:01:56.430> showing<00:01:57.299> how<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> managed<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.320> get

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
do a video showing how I managed to get

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.000 
do a video showing how I managed to get
through<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.799> heel<00:02:01.280> so

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
through the heel so
