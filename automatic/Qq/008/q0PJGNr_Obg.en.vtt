00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
primarily I bought this exhaust for the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.290 
primarily I bought this exhaust for the
look<00:02:51.400> because<00:02:52.400> i<00:02:52.610> think<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.030> three

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
look because i think that the three

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.910 
look because i think that the three
holes<00:02:53.540> in<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> standard<00:02:54.230> exhaust<00:02:54.500> just<00:02:54.710> looks

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
holes in the standard exhaust just looks

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:06.740 
holes in the standard exhaust just looks
shocking

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.180 

so<00:03:07.750> yeah<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.230> pretty<00:03:08.380> much<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.590> video<00:03:08.920> me
