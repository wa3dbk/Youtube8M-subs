today<00:00:04.900> I'm<00:00:05.050> gonna<00:00:05.200> show<00:00:05.590> you<00:00:05.620> how<00:00:05.830> to<00:00:05.890> tie<00:00:06.189> a

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.220 
today I'm gonna show you how to tie a

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.129 
today I'm gonna show you how to tie a
bowline<00:00:06.640> now<00:00:07.120> I<00:00:07.149> don't<00:00:07.240> jump<00:00:07.599> up<00:00:07.750> and<00:00:07.990> leave

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
bowline now I don't jump up and leave

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.980 
bowline now I don't jump up and leave
the<00:00:08.349> room<00:00:08.530> we're<00:00:08.710> gonna<00:00:08.830> get<00:00:09.070> through<00:00:09.340> this

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
the room we're gonna get through this

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.770 
the room we're gonna get through this
bowline<00:00:10.990> is<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:12.160> most<00:00:12.370> important<00:00:13.000> knot<00:00:13.450> in

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
bowline is the most important knot in

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.439 
bowline is the most important knot in
boating<00:00:14.350> and<00:00:14.680> probably<00:00:15.519> in<00:00:15.790> the<00:00:15.850> rest<00:00:16.240> of<00:00:16.359> the

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
boating and probably in the rest of the

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.009 
boating and probably in the rest of the
world<00:00:16.630> too<00:00:16.960> it's<00:00:17.859> not<00:00:18.039> that<00:00:18.250> hard<00:00:18.519> to<00:00:18.609> tie<00:00:19.019> but

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
world too it's not that hard to tie but

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.480 
world too it's not that hard to tie but
you<00:00:20.169> have<00:00:20.349> to<00:00:20.499> remember<00:00:20.679> a<00:00:20.859> couple<00:00:21.189> of<00:00:21.249> things

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
you have to remember a couple of things

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.169 
you have to remember a couple of things
about<00:00:21.669> it<00:00:22.589> the<00:00:23.589> bowline<00:00:24.009> only<00:00:24.279> has<00:00:24.489> one<00:00:24.820> job

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:25.179 
about it the bowline only has one job

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.809 
about it the bowline only has one job
and<00:00:25.539> that<00:00:25.810> is<00:00:25.989> to<00:00:26.019> make<00:00:26.349> a<00:00:26.380> fixed<00:00:26.890> loop<00:00:27.130> with<00:00:27.789> a

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:27.819 
and that is to make a fixed loop with a

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.569 
and that is to make a fixed loop with a
knot<00:00:28.119> that's<00:00:28.329> easy<00:00:28.659> to<00:00:28.869> untie<00:00:29.069> you<00:00:30.069> can<00:00:30.249> put<00:00:30.460> it

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
knot that's easy to untie you can put it

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.020 
knot that's easy to untie you can put it
over<00:00:30.819> a<00:00:31.300> cleat<00:00:31.720> or<00:00:31.899> over<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.320> piling<00:00:32.950> where<00:00:33.820> you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
over a cleat or over a piling where you

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.619 
over a cleat or over a piling where you
can<00:00:34.210> tie<00:00:34.480> it<00:00:34.540> through<00:00:35.170> something<00:00:35.680> like<00:00:36.399> a<00:00:36.699> ring

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
can tie it through something like a ring

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.720 
can tie it through something like a ring
on<00:00:37.899> a<00:00:37.930> on<00:00:38.320> a<00:00:38.350> dinghy<00:00:38.710> or<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:39.000> bow<00:00:40.000> eye<00:00:41.609> when<00:00:42.609> you

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
on a on a dinghy or a bow eye when you

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.729 
on a on a dinghy or a bow eye when you
tie<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.030> bowline<00:00:43.390> it's<00:00:43.809> important<00:00:44.379> to<00:00:44.440> remember

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
tie a bowline it's important to remember

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.090 
tie a bowline it's important to remember
that<00:00:44.920> there<00:00:45.280> are<00:00:45.309> two<00:00:45.579> loops<00:00:45.850> involved

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
that there are two loops involved

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.880 
that there are two loops involved
there's<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.370> working<00:00:48.609> loop<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:50.469> you<00:00:50.649> want

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
there's the working loop that you want

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.919 
there's the working loop that you want
to<00:00:51.010> do<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.519> job<00:00:51.789> and<00:00:52.089> then<00:00:52.329> there's<00:00:52.539> the<00:00:52.719> knot

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
to do the job and then there's the knot

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.889 
to do the job and then there's the knot
loop<00:00:53.579> keep<00:00:54.579> those<00:00:54.879> things<00:00:55.120> separate<00:00:55.600> in<00:00:55.749> your

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
loop keep those things separate in your

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.619 
loop keep those things separate in your
mind<00:00:56.140> now<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.160> tie<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.460> knot<00:00:57.730> you<00:00:58.059> pass<00:00:58.300> the

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
mind now to tie the knot you pass the

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.279 
mind now to tie the knot you pass the
working<00:00:59.469> end<00:00:59.649> up<00:00:59.859> through<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.429> knot<00:01:00.609> loop<00:01:01.289> go

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
working end up through the knot loop go

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.950 
working end up through the knot loop go
around<00:01:02.679> the<00:01:03.399> back<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.909> standing<00:01:04.360> part<00:01:04.600> and

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
around the back of the standing part and

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.800 
around the back of the standing part and
then<00:01:05.770> back<00:01:06.100> straight<00:01:06.909> through<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.300> loop<00:01:07.510> that

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
then back straight through the loop that

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.010 
then back straight through the loop that
it<00:01:08.020> came<00:01:08.230> out<00:01:08.470> of<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:10.270> is<00:01:10.420> your<00:01:10.600> knot<00:01:10.780> loop

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
it came out of this is your knot loop

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.600 
it came out of this is your knot loop
that's<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.070> job<00:01:12.340> loop<00:01:13.620> when<00:01:14.620> you<00:01:14.710> tie<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.010> you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
that's the job loop when you tie it you

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.980 
that's the job loop when you tie it you
want<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.970> working<00:01:16.420> end<00:01:16.620> inside<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.970> loop<00:01:19.180> if

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
want the working end inside the loop if

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.040 
want the working end inside the loop if
it's<00:01:20.620> possible<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.220> tie<00:01:21.550> it<00:01:21.610> by<00:01:22.240> going<00:01:22.690> the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
it's possible to tie it by going the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.890 
it's possible to tie it by going the
other<00:01:23.380> way<00:01:23.760> around<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:25.000> standing<00:01:25.450> part<00:01:25.630> and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
other way around the standing part and

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.900 
other way around the standing part and
having<00:01:26.230> the<00:01:26.350> working<00:01:26.710> end<00:01:26.860> on<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.130> outside<00:01:27.640> of

having the working end on the outside of

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.910 
having the working end on the outside of
the<00:01:28.000> loop<00:01:28.150> but<00:01:28.840> that's<00:01:29.080> not<00:01:29.380> quite<00:01:29.620> as

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
the loop but that's not quite as

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.240 
the loop but that's not quite as
mechanically<00:01:30.670> strong<00:01:31.590> there's<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.680> faster<00:01:33.220> way

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
mechanically strong there's a faster way

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.760 
mechanically strong there's a faster way
to<00:01:33.400> tie<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.730> bowline<00:01:34.110> take<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.290> working<00:01:35.650> end

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
to tie the bowline take the working end

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.490 
to tie the bowline take the working end
point<00:01:36.190> it<00:01:36.310> towards<00:01:36.640> yourself<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:37.390> top<00:01:38.260> of<00:01:38.410> the

point it towards yourself on top of the
standing<00:01:38.950> part<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.400> then<00:01:39.760> flip<00:01:40.210> your<00:01:40.450> hand

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
standing part and then flip your hand

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.590 
standing part and then flip your hand
working<00:01:41.800> in<00:01:42.070> comes<00:01:42.550> up<00:01:42.730> automatically

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
working in comes up automatically

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.530 
working in comes up automatically
through<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.830> knot<00:01:45.040> loop<00:01:45.310> put<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.240> bitter<00:01:46.450> end

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
through the knot loop put the bitter end

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.210 
through the knot loop put the bitter end
back<00:01:46.930> through<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.730> fully<00:01:48.730> not<00:01:49.030> tight<00:01:50.220> even

back through it fully not tight even

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.280 
back through it fully not tight even
after<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.610> bowline<00:01:52.360> has<00:01:52.540> been<00:01:52.810> put<00:01:53.140> under

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
after a bowline has been put under

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.100 
after a bowline has been put under
tremendous<00:01:53.710> tension<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.420> knot<00:01:55.630> under<00:01:56.080> a

tremendous tension and the knot under a
lot<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.410> pressure<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.670> always<00:01:58.090> easy<00:01:58.300> to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
lot of pressure it's always easy to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.610 
lot of pressure it's always easy to
untie<00:01:58.630> flip<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.710> over<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.190> break<00:02:01.060> its<00:02:01.270> back

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
untie flip it over and break its back

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.640 
untie flip it over and break its back
and<00:02:02.620> then<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:03.280> all<00:02:03.460> comes<00:02:03.490> apart<00:02:03.880> easily<00:02:04.650> with

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
and then it all comes apart easily with

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.800 
and then it all comes apart easily with
a<00:02:05.680> little<00:02:06.010> practice<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.940> bowline<00:02:07.390> becomes

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
a little practice the bowline becomes

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.889 
a little practice the bowline becomes
instinctive<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:09.099> you'll<00:02:09.849> find<00:02:10.209> that<00:02:10.479> it's

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
instinctive and you'll find that it's

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.630
