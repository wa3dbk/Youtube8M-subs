00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.259
 hello everyone today we are going to show a 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.259
 fast and effective way to peel about 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.180
 roasted peppers good today we're going to 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.789
 teach a very effective method for stripping 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.489
 no hassle the roasted peppers is a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.320
 very simple and fast method we 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.480
 we just have here arranged three 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.170
 red peppers you see how splendid 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.650
 are today we will put some 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.650
 olive oil 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.219
 now 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.580
 let's move using the peduncle 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.170
 about the olive oil itself so that 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.570
 I take it well and do not make an expense 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.890
 excessive and with this tray we're going to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.519
 go to the oven 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.260
 during 25 minutes at 190 degrees 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.420
 after 12 or 13 minutes what 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.760
 we will do will turn them around so that 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.740
 is a homogeneous roast then once 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.660
 let's take them out of the oven what we're going to 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.970
 do is going to be wrapping them with paper 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.530
 film and in this way what is going to 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.740
 produce is that the skin will sweat 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.030
 very much then it is going to generate a 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.790
 kind of gap between what is the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.250
 that is to say, it is going to hollow out and 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.280
 that is not going to allow the retired the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.840
 skin removal is very fast and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.170
 Well let the oven and now you 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.170
 we teach 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.860
 good look, we just took the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.480
 peppers right now 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.300
 then what we will do to 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.310
 pass them to this tray that we have 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.840
 because if we put here the film paper 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.340
 obviously with the temperature that has 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.340
 I have accumulated throughout the process 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.540
 baked it would break us the paper and if 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.870
 it would not make much sense then 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.210
 we just had them 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.940
 to this tray 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.780
 and now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.780
 cover read hermetically 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.480
 that is to say that there is no type of 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.840
 slot that allows the output 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.790
 the heat that has the peppers of this 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.970
 way what what is going to produce goes 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.970
 to do 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.830
 that little by little the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.360
 skin of the flesh 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.360
 we just plug in well 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.370
 and now let's let this cool down 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.020
 I'm putting that warm during a 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.460
 hour or an hour and a half and then not 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.950
 have any kind of problem that we 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.100
 let's stay and that the hollowing process 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.350
 so he leaves with his hand then 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.630
 nothing we will leave for a space 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.450
 hour hour and quarter hour and a half and now 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.190
 we show you the good result already 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.290
 it's been an hour and a half and here 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.840
 we have the peppers that we have roasted what 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.300
 let's remove the paper you have released 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.610
 pretty juice and what I told you 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.650
 skin is completely totally hollow 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.720
 we are going to 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.260
 to start with 2 with 2 with 1 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.250
 so you can see what comes out 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.250
 frankly fine 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.370
 this is a way as I said before 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.170
 very fast and effective to peel the 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.080
 peppers roasted many times at home 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.780
 we start making the peppers and 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.960
 then it is not practically impossible 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.430
 removing the skin fixes here 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.870
 that the leather strips come out 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.120
 practically alone because of that to that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.750
 having sweated the pepper and 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.690
 have cooled 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.790
 in an airtight place with what it produces 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.860
 is that it goes hollowing out 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.000
 the skin of the flesh and leave 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.000
 with this facility 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.500
 if at home you do not have plastic film or 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.780
 you think that maybe it 's an expense 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.780
 unnecessary you could do it too 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.680
 putting it in a tupper is to say to saiz 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.040
 the pepper as I told you 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.870
 we have set it to 190 degrees 25 minutes 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.670
 and once the roasting process is over, 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.650
 what you do is directly put them in 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.160
 in a tupper that is hermetically rooted 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.920
 and in that way then he 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.900
 the process is going to be the same good you see 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:32.229
 here we would have our pepper 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.740
 after we cut it, you will feel like 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.740
 what if we do 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.920
 and here we would also have the second 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.420
 pepper 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.400
 totally peeled 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.340
 we simply remove the nuggets that 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.340
 accumulates in its interior its seed 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.630
 well let's introduce you here in 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.670
 our blackboard so there is also a 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.660
 little contrast 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.130
 of color and nothing this technique 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.110
 you could also apply it 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.969
 perfectly to the yellow pepper or 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.370
 Red pepper 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:18.979
 without any problem 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.870
 another very effective way to do it would be 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.790
 directly to the fire if we have a 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.190
 grill we put the peppers to the fire 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.050
 until they get scorched 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.240
 completely is to say that they acquire a 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.240
 totally black look and then 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.590
 directly in water we would scrape a 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.889
 little of all that skin and it would also come out 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.690
 easily us prefer 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.750
 do it in this way among other things 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.430
 because we do not have direct fire and over 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.040
 all because like this way we 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.199
 we avoid having to have to 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.389
 clean them in water because you want them not to 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:53.330
 the water what it does is also remove the 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.880
 taste you have to have good pepper 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.919
 this would be a way as he said very 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.280
 effective and quick to peel some peppers 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.280
 roasted
