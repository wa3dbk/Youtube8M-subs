 Hello everyone today, we are preparing a compote of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.830
 cherry plums and zucchini 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.039
 which many call compote pineapples 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.359
 because zucchini after conservation 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.109
 very reminiscent of his taste palych 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.260
 carefully wash and lay banks 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.330
 cans of cysts and their sterilization is not necessary 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.110
 because we will sterilize itself 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.880
 compote pour about a third 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.340
 cans of berries and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.989
 and cut into rings thick 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.039
 about 1 centimeter 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:53.010
 squeeze the seeds using cork here 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.020
 we get a ring like pineapple 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.949
 and throw in the can of our cherry plum 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:05.010
 about 5-6 slices if zucchini 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.680
 too big you can make half rings 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.390
 just cut with the help you need cheese 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 telema 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:17.130
 also looks very beautiful in each 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.070
 jar we added a cup of sugar can 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 more can be less the same to taste and in 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 dependencies 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:30.360
 sour or sweet you have cherry plum 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.390
 we lom banks in the water already hot that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.759
 less time to sterilize and that can 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.920
 not burst put on metal 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.759
 the surface and the inside put a knife 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.380
 which too 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:48.899
 takes heat and set to sterilize on 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:55.159
 15-20 minutes so it came to light 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.159
 and roll up the banks 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.010
 shake well to sugar 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.820
 broke up 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.970
 and leave to cool for our 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.780
 comfort was cooling down slowly wrapping it up 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.780
 bedspreads 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.300
