00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.830
 the tam plane crashed into the company building here in Congonhas 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.830
 had a defect in the reverse of the right turbine since the 13th Friday 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.450
 the problem had been detected by the electronic 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.670
 aircraft but the TAM plane continued to fly on the following days with 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.650
 the right reverser off I talked over the phone with the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.599
 president of the brand of the year bologna and with the technical vice president ruy 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.340
 confirmed this information and stated that the 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.070
 manufacturer of the airplane there in their maintenance manuals for cases such as 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.950
 this recommends that a review of the device be made up to ten days 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.930
 after the defect has been presented and that it considers that this 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.090
 problem is not a flight impediment that the a320 airplane can operate normally 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.990
 until the problem is verified within ten days 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.179
 but the national newspaper found 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.600
 that the plane of the prefix pmi of chicago destroyed in this tragedy of 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.330
 Congonhas 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.360
 had trouble landing here in Congonhas the day before 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.070
 as the national newspaper reported yesterday flying 3 2 1 5 data patrick for the purpose of 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.890
 SÃ£o Paulo on the 16th 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.360
 Monday at 13 hours and 48 minutes 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.830
 had difficulties to brake that only stopped with the limit of the runway of congonhas 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.230
 according to the national newspaper, sought the commander of the aircraft in which he returned 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.580
 he would have told the actor and the track was very slippery he did not do any 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.370
 mention of the technical problem 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.860
 according to our sources this commander's comment was recorded by the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.960
 official bodies 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.650
 the Tamil Vice-President said that he was unaware of this 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.680
 Monday he said that in the aircraft logbook that records any 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.910
 problem presented during a flight there was no record of any 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.610
 serious on the 16th 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.659
 So I asked him, so there's no record of pane on Monday. 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.480
 and he said no, it's not that 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.210
 what I said is that there is no record of serious panic on the 16th 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.090
 the confirmation that the airplane prefix pt oid car destroyed in the tragedy of 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.990
 Tuesday 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.120
 was the same that almost crashed the day before reinforces the hypothesis that the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.219
 accident was a consequence of mechanical failure 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.719
 authorities will now have to investigate whether 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.159
 maintenance of the forest's stalls are correct and if in fact the airplane could 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.589
 have continued to fly even with the defect they were in a hurry
