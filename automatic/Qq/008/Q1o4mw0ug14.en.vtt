00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.260 

let's<00:01:15.689> go

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.969 

I<00:01:21.859> made<00:01:22.859> the<00:01:23.509> controller<00:01:24.509> by<00:01:25.170> mounting<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
I made the controller by mounting a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.399 
I made the controller by mounting a
servo<00:01:26.250> inside<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> steel<00:01:27.270> bracket<00:01:27.810> made<00:01:28.079> from<00:01:28.289> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
servo inside a steel bracket made from a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.149 
servo inside a steel bracket made from a
power<00:01:29.390> supply<00:01:30.390> from<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.869> computer<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
power supply from a computer to the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.980 
power supply from a computer to the
bottom<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.640> attached<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.210> battery<00:01:33.659> I've

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
bottom of that I attached a battery I've

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.139 
bottom of that I attached a battery I've
got<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> green<00:01:34.770> sugru<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.399> to<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.969> rid<00:01:36.119> of

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
got the green sugru there to get rid of

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.600 
got the green sugru there to get rid of
scratches<00:01:36.740> there's<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> radio<00:01:38.219> control
