00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
who are new to it is we start a new book

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.270 
who are new to it is we start a new book
on<00:00:11.880> every<00:00:12.179> new<00:00:12.389> moon<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.440> sometimes<00:00:13.950> it's

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
on every new moon so sometimes it's

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.010 
on every new moon so sometimes it's
mostly<00:00:14.790> one<00:00:14.969> month<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.299> sometimes<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.750> bleeds

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
mostly one month and sometimes it bleeds

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.420 
mostly one month and sometimes it bleeds
from<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.379> month<00:00:16.529> into<00:00:16.710> another<00:00:17.010> because

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
from one month into another because

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.070 
from one month into another because
that's<00:00:17.910> kind<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.359> moon<00:00:18.539> cycles<00:00:18.930> roll

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
that's kind of how the moon cycles roll

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320 
that's kind of how the moon cycles roll
and<00:00:19.460> last<00:00:20.460> month<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.300> just

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
and last month the one that we just

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.000 
and last month the one that we just
finished<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.199> new<00:00:22.320> moon<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.680> actually

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
finished on the new moon and actually

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.259 
finished on the new moon and actually
have<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.189> finished<00:00:23.400> yet<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> still<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.090> bad

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
have not finished yet I still have bad

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.040 
have not finished yet I still have bad
100<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.189> pages<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.730> go<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:27.840> called

larger studies things like that together
to<00:00:41.370> explain<00:00:41.790> certain<00:00:42.059> phenomena<00:00:42.960> that

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
to explain certain phenomena that

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.330 
to explain certain phenomena that
happened<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.530> our<00:00:43.649> universe<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.160> aren't

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
happened in our universe that aren't

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.500 
happened in our universe that aren't
really<00:00:44.430> explained<00:00:45.000> by<00:00:45.210> our<00:00:45.239> current

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
really explained by our current

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.720 
really explained by our current
scientific<00:00:45.780> model<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.219> written<00:00:47.489> in

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
scientific model and it is written in

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.880 
scientific model and it is written in
textbook<00:00:48.180> style<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.230> still<00:00:49.530> found<00:00:49.710> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
textbook style but I still found it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.970 
textbook style but I still found it
pretty<00:00:50.100> easy<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> read<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:51.449> excerpt<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.800> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
pretty easy to read one excerpt that I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
pretty easy to read one excerpt that I
was<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.670> reading<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.059> morning<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.629> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
was just reading this morning that I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.790 
was just reading this morning that I
thought<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.870> would<00:00:54.960> share<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.379> guys<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
thought I would share with you guys is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.970 
thought I would share with you guys is
about<00:00:56.000> chaos<00:00:57.000> because<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.739> pulled<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
about chaos because I just pulled a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.410 
about chaos because I just pulled a
tarot<00:00:59.190> card<00:00:59.430> today<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.789> was<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> hanged<00:01:00.270> man

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
tarot card today that was the hanged man

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
tarot card today that was the hanged man
which<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> kind<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.230> finding<00:01:01.649> peace<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> chaos

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
which is kind of finding peace and chaos

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.640 
which is kind of finding peace and chaos
waiting<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.210> pass<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.379> knowing<00:01:04.530> that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
waiting for it to pass and knowing that

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.190 
waiting for it to pass and knowing that
you<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.890> your<00:01:05.010> strength<00:01:05.309> more<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.729> way<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
you get your strength more that way and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.359 
you get your strength more that way and
about<00:01:07.200> an<00:01:07.290> hour<00:01:07.409> before<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.979> had<00:01:08.189> read

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
about an hour before that I had read

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.730 
about an hour before that I had read
this<00:01:08.760> excerpt<00:01:09.210> from<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.630> book<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.229> says

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
this excerpt from the book and it says

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.270 
this excerpt from the book and it says
in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> past<00:01:12.390> decade<00:01:13.010> science<00:01:14.010> has

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
in the past decade science has

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
in the past decade science has
discovered<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.880> many<00:01:15.180> chaotic<00:01:15.630> phenomena

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
discovered that many chaotic phenomena

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.530 
discovered that many chaotic phenomena
and<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.909> electronic<00:01:17.909> fluctuations

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and that's like electronic fluctuations

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.890 
and that's like electronic fluctuations
during<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.140> seizure<00:01:19.409> or<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:21.119> weather<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
during a seizure or the weather when a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
during a seizure or the weather when a
hot<00:01:22.320> front<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.890> cold<00:01:23.100> front<00:01:23.340> collide<00:01:23.700> or

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hot front and a cold front collide or

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.580 
hot front and a cold front collide or
the<00:01:24.330> water<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> bottom<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.290> waterfall

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the water at the bottom of a waterfall

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.030 
the water at the bottom of a waterfall
that<00:01:25.710> kind<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> thing<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:27.530> many<00:01:28.530> chaotic

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
that kind of thing so many chaotic

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
that kind of thing so many chaotic
phenomena<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.180> disordered<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.930> they

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
phenomena are not as disordered as they

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.080 
phenomena are not as disordered as they
seem<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> often<00:01:32.189> contain<00:01:32.369> hidden<00:01:32.759> patterns

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
seem and often contain hidden patterns

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.649 
seem and often contain hidden patterns
and<00:01:33.329> regularities<00:01:35.360> scientists<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.479> also

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and regularities scientists have also

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.630 
and regularities scientists have also
discovered<00:01:37.259> mathematical<00:01:37.979> ways<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.340> finding

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
discovered mathematical ways of finding

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.760 
discovered mathematical ways of finding
some<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> regularities<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.320> lie<00:01:40.560> hidden

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
some of the regularities that lie hidden

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.300 
some of the regularities that lie hidden
in<00:01:41.040> chaotic<00:01:41.369> phenomena<00:01:42.290> then<00:01:43.290> later<00:01:43.829> they<00:01:44.100> say

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
in chaotic phenomena then later they say

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
in chaotic phenomena then later they say
that<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.149> meant<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.689> study<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.079> they<00:01:46.259> showed

this meant that although the

this meant that although the

kaleidoscopic changes taking place in

kaleidoscopic changes taking place in
the<00:01:50.130> energy<00:01:50.280> field<00:01:50.640> appeared<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.390> random

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
the energy field appeared to be random

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.530 
the energy field appeared to be random
they<00:01:52.770> were<00:01:52.829> actually<00:01:53.310> very<00:01:53.579> high<00:01:53.939> ordered<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
they were actually very high ordered and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.819 
they were actually very high ordered and
rich<00:01:54.720> with<00:01:54.899> patterns<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.530> what<00:01:55.680> they're

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
rich with patterns so what they're

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.980 
rich with patterns so what they're
saying<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.790> something<00:01:57.149> seems<00:01:57.360> chaotic<00:01:57.630> all

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
saying is if something seems chaotic all

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.270 
saying is if something seems chaotic all
you<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.439> zoom<00:01:58.469> out<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.040> still

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you have to do is zoom out and it still

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.679 
you have to do is zoom out and it still
belongs<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.640> pattern<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.450> really

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
belongs to pattern it's just a really

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.389 
belongs to pattern it's just a really
big<00:02:00.930> pattern<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:01.920> you're<00:02:02.040> sitting<00:02:02.250> there

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
big pattern so if you're sitting there

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.740 
big pattern so if you're sitting there
in<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> center<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> pattern<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> can't

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
in the center of the pattern you can't

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.630 
in the center of the pattern you can't
really<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> because<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.100> lines<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.549> run

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
really see it because the lines that run

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.069 
really see it because the lines that run
are<00:02:05.790> much<00:02:05.909> bigger<00:02:06.090> than<00:02:06.240> where<00:02:06.540> your<00:02:06.689> view<00:02:06.930> can

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
are much bigger than where your view can

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.930 
are much bigger than where your view can
get<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.590> find<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.520> SuperDuper

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
get you I find that to be SuperDuper

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
get you I find that to be SuperDuper
