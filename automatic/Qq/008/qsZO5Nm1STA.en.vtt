00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
and it started to do the problem so it's

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.320 
and it started to do the problem so it's
set<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.099> 22<00:00:08.460> Auto<00:00:09.620> on<00:00:10.620> both<00:00:11.099> which<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.030> what<00:00:12.210> we

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
set to 22 Auto on both which is what we

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.720 
set to 22 Auto on both which is what we
normally<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.519> the<00:00:14.519> current

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
normally have it on and the current

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.240 
normally have it on and the current
ambient<00:00:15.360> temperature<00:00:15.719> outside<00:00:16.160> according<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
ambient temperature outside according to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.800 
ambient temperature outside according to
the<00:00:17.340> car<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:18.020> 13.5<00:00:19.020> degrees<00:00:20.449> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.570> see

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the car is 13.5 degrees you can see

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.349 
the car is 13.5 degrees you can see
there<00:00:22.220> now<00:00:23.220> I've<00:00:23.400> got<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> temperature<00:00:24.090> probe

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
there now I've got a temperature probe

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.800 
there now I've got a temperature probe
here<00:00:25.550> it's<00:00:26.550> basically<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.449> standard

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
here it's basically just a standard

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.870 
here it's basically just a standard
little<00:00:27.869> probe<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.619> saying<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.279> cabin

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
little probe it's saying that the cabin

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.620 
little probe it's saying that the cabin
temperature<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.359> 20<00:00:30.890> 27<00:00:31.890> degrees<00:00:32.340> okay<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.600> I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
temperature is 20 27 degrees okay so I

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.510 
temperature is 20 27 degrees okay so I
put<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> sin<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.530> n<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.280> see

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
put this on the sin of n as you can see

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.750 
put this on the sin of n as you can see
just<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> there's<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> sin<00:00:38.520> event

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
just like that so there's the sin event

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.279 
just like that so there's the sin event
right<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:43.219> it'll<00:00:44.219> basically<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.660> scent

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
right and it'll basically this scent

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.479 
right and it'll basically this scent
events<00:00:46.620> working<00:00:46.890> flat<00:00:47.399> out<00:00:47.430> now<00:00:49.489> absolutely

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
events working flat out now absolutely

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.110 
events working flat out now absolutely
flat<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.449> try<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> down<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.320> 22<00:00:53.120> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
flat out to try and get it down to 22 so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.330 
flat out to try and get it down to 22 so
there<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.329> go

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
there we go

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.639 
there we go

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.160 
but that's cold air air conditioners
flat<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.930> okay<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.710> put<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> probe<00:01:02.399> over<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
flat out okay now put the probe over to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.890 
flat out okay now put the probe over to
