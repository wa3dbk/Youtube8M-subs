removal and replacing of one of the hob
elements<00:00:14.389> ceramic<00:00:15.389> hob<00:00:15.599> elements<00:00:16.109> are

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
elements ceramic hob elements are

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.990 
elements ceramic hob elements are
generally<00:00:16.680> very<00:00:16.859> similar<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.430> appearance<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
generally very similar in appearance and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.689 
generally very similar in appearance and
how<00:00:18.119> they<00:00:18.330> fit<00:00:18.570> onto<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> hob<00:00:19.230> itself<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.550> in

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
how they fit onto the hob itself so in

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.429 
how they fit onto the hob itself so in
this<00:00:20.820> respect<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> video<00:00:21.750> could<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.170> related

screws under the fascia panel you'll

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.590 
screws under the fascia panel you'll
need<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> remove<00:00:59.460> two<00:00:59.640> control<00:01:00.059> knobs<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
need to remove two control knobs on the

clock buttons these knobs come off
easily<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.570> leave<00:01:03.750> them<00:01:03.960> off<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.860> go

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
easily if you leave them off so they go

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.800 
easily if you leave them off so they go
back<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.489> correct<00:01:05.640> control<00:01:06.210> place<00:01:06.630> them

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
back on the correct control place them

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.270 
back on the correct control place them
on<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> piece<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.350> wood<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.619> something<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.159> the

on a piece of wood or something in the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.850 
on a piece of wood or something in the
order<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:08.670> were<00:01:08.700> removed<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:10.350> way<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.619> can

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
order they were removed this way you can

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.770 
order they were removed this way you can
put<00:01:11.040> them<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.400> side<00:01:11.460> until<00:01:12.060> needed<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
put them to one side until needed to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.010 
put them to one side until needed to
refit<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.790> buttons<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> same<00:01:15.780> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
refit the buttons are all the same so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.899 
refit the buttons are all the same so
there's<00:01:16.170> no<00:01:16.290> need<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> segregate<00:01:16.799> them<00:01:17.189> just

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
there's no need to segregate them just

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.219 
there's no need to segregate them just
pull<00:01:18.150> them<00:01:18.270> off<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.659> put<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
pull them off and put them in a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
pull them off and put them in a
container<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.770> keep<00:01:19.979> them<00:01:20.130> safe

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.850 

under<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.420> fire<00:01:25.660> of<00:01:25.840> two<00:01:26.080> screws<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:26.650> hold

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
under the fire of two screws that hold

under the fire of two screws that hold
on<00:01:27.070> when<00:01:28.000> those<00:01:28.150> have<00:01:28.330> been<00:01:28.450> removed<00:01:28.750> slide<00:01:29.110> it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
on when those have been removed slide it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.810 
on when those have been removed slide it
to<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.650> left<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.160> will<00:01:30.220> unhook<00:01:30.520> from<00:01:30.610> a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
to the left and it will unhook from a

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.630 
to the left and it will unhook from a
couple<00:01:31.120> of<00:01:31.210> brackets<00:01:31.600> on<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.780> cabinet<00:01:32.640> be

couple of brackets on the cabinet be
careful<00:01:34.120> how<00:01:34.210> you<00:01:34.270> remove<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.900> fire<00:01:35.110> because

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
careful how you remove the fire because

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.680 
careful how you remove the fire because
there<00:01:35.860> are<00:01:35.979> two<00:01:36.220> neons<00:01:36.640> attached<00:01:37.120> and<00:01:37.450> if

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
there are two neons attached and if

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.210 
there are two neons attached and if
you're<00:01:37.810> too<00:01:37.960> heavy-handed<00:01:38.260> you<00:01:38.770> could<00:01:38.979> break

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
you're too heavy-handed you could break

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.469 
you're too heavy-handed you could break
either<00:01:39.460> or<00:01:39.729> both<00:01:39.910> of<00:01:39.970> them

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
either or both of them

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.120 
either or both of them
I've<00:01:41.170> been<00:01:41.320> said<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.560> they're<00:01:41.860> not<00:01:42.010> the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
I've been said that they're not the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.650 
I've been said that they're not the
easiest<00:01:42.160> things<00:01:42.729> in<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:42.970> world<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.300> remove

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
easiest things in the world to remove

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
but they do need to come off or you'll

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.280

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
as I said earlier these terminal blocks

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.020 
as I said earlier these terminal blocks
can't<00:04:53.440> be<00:04:53.560> fitted<00:04:53.860> wrongly<00:04:54.100> because<00:04:54.820> there's

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
can't be fitted wrongly because there's

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.580 
can't be fitted wrongly because there's
a<00:04:55.090> male<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.600> female<00:04:55.630> connection<00:04:56.290> on<00:04:56.500> the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
a male and a female connection on the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.890 
a male and a female connection on the
hob<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.100> same<00:04:57.310> on<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.520> trucker

hob and the same on the trucker

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.210 
hob and the same on the trucker
therefore<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.050> mound<00:04:59.260> on<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.560> hob<00:04:59.740> fits<00:05:00.070> the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
therefore the mound on the hob fits the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.220 
therefore the mound on the hob fits the
female<00:05:00.610> on<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.850> Tucker<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.450> vice<00:05:01.630> versa

even<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.100> ping<00:05:03.310> connections<00:05:03.880> are<00:05:04.030> shaped<00:05:04.270> so

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
even the ping connections are shaped so

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:13.000 
even the ping connections are shaped so
they're<00:05:04.960> only<00:05:05.080> fit<00:05:05.410> in<00:05:05.440> one<00:05:05.680> position

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
at the beginning of this video I

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.030 
at the beginning of this video I
mentioned<00:05:14.780> that<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.260> need<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.560> watch<00:05:15.710> out<00:05:16.010> for

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
mentioned that you need to watch out for
