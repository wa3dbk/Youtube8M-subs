going to do this is the tune-up and then
we'll<00:01:54.579> do<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.729> bring<00:01:54.909> something<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:56.069> I'm<00:01:57.069> at

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
we'll do the bring something that I'm at

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.710 
we'll do the bring something that I'm at
that<00:01:57.909> is<00:01:58.119> flying<00:01:58.390> up<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.780> away<00:02:03.420> alright<00:02:04.420> first

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
that is flying up and away alright first

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.760 
that is flying up and away alright first
thing<00:02:04.990> we're<00:02:05.110> going<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.259> do<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.679> air

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
thing we're going to do is the air

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.419 
thing we're going to do is the air
filter<00:02:06.159> so<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:06.939> these<00:02:07.929> three<00:02:08.470> bolts

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
filter so you have these three bolts

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.059 
filter so you have these three bolts
that<00:02:09.759> hold<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.179> one<00:02:10.869> goes<00:02:11.049> in<00:02:11.170> here<00:02:11.410> smaller

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
that hold on one goes in here smaller

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.410 
that hold on one goes in here smaller
one<00:02:12.340> goes<00:02:12.459> in<00:02:12.580> there<00:02:12.670> Leland<00:02:12.970> goes<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.239> there

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
one goes in there Leland goes in there

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.990 
one goes in there Leland goes in there
and<00:02:13.780> your<00:02:14.349> air<00:02:14.470> filter<00:02:14.830> sits<00:02:15.069> right<00:02:15.610> inside<00:02:15.790> of

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
and your air filter sits right inside of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.039 
and your air filter sits right inside of
this<00:02:16.269> okay

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
this okay

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.050 
this okay
so<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.530> way<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.769> works<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.190> XA<00:02:18.489> under<00:02:18.760> here

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
so the way it works is XA under here

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.300 
so the way it works is XA under here
goes<00:02:19.810> through<00:02:20.080> here<00:02:20.290> passes<00:02:20.799> your<00:02:20.950> oxygen

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
goes through here passes your oxygen

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.100 
goes through here passes your oxygen
sensor<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.910> boom<00:02:22.060> endo<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.569> throttle<00:02:22.870> bodies

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
sensor and boom endo the throttle bodies

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.130 
sensor and boom endo the throttle bodies
in<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.319> B<00:02:23.440> engine<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.489> can<00:02:24.640> tell<00:02:25.140> it's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
in the B engine and you can tell it's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.930 
in the B engine and you can tell it's
definitely<00:02:26.349> been<00:02:26.709> working<00:02:26.890> it's<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.640> lot<00:02:27.790> of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
definitely been working it's a lot of

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.680 
definitely been working it's a lot of
dirt<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.150> there

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
dirt in there

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.569 
dirt in there
good<00:02:29.500> luck<00:02:29.590> over<00:02:29.859> here<00:02:30.070> there's<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> old<00:02:30.670> one
