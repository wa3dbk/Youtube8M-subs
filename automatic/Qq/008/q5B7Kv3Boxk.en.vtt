00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 bought myself a new camcorder and of course 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.210
 now I will tell them because everything 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.670
 subsequent videos well, not all right from 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.860
 line 3m today but in 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.799
 I will continue to shoot it and bought it in 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.199
 Russia is not in China but it is paper to anyone 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.640
 not interesting and accessories too, of course 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.140
 same main question for many viewers 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.580
 it will be why not in China because 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.039
 the chinese don't make a normal camera 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.640
 I'll go to China make sure of it 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.580
 see if the battery is correct 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.570
 50 tsiferka here this how many here 72 hours 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.489
 will be little 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.570
 I have already ordered several tonight 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.360
 such batteries 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 different capacity in china therefore 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.610
 sure to test Chinese 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.200
 batteries in order with index 100 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.719
 a battery in Russia costs five 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.320
 half a thousand in china i bought such a well 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.570
 in stated that exactly the same for oh no 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.800
 I remember how much for 18 dollars or something 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.610
 there is roughly 600 rubles 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.070
 Okay, Iâ€™ll not need anything 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.070
 fig you now break it while taking 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.200
 optical balance choice was due 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.790
 two no three reasons first 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.140
 Now here is this camera that shoots off 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.780
 me sony camera 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.270
 well, five years old truth in the second 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.759
 for this bow for this camera release 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.619
 The Chinese are very many fake battery 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.030
 You are real, too, that is, the choice of batteries 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.650
 huge and that is the camera which 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.430
 FIG batteries find if you find something by 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.900
 mad price and so what is it sonic a 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.939
 is that it is very cool here 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.329
 image stabilizer and 30x 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.229
 groups now I'll show it to you 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.299
 it is clear that at home I am good 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.799
 I can not demonstrate so now 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.259
 Now go to the street to take pictures of their 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.259
 the first frames you very much and turn on 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.520
 okay while it loads diesel on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.840
 some operation 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.259
 no sim card the camera works on zeppe 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.350
 board memory stick something else here than 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.960
 more speed of writing to the card 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.149
 better because it is declared in my opinion to 26 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 megabyte per second she writes 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.799
 maximum flow is very cool 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.610
 detailing awesome well unusual 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.540
 after my old she is so 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.710
 how guides approximation is different from 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.660
 my old operas she is 5 years younger 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.650
 secondly here is a larger matrix 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.600
 then with him in the dark better shoots 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.570
 what else can mpeg-4 immediately and not only 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.150
 In mts write but this not fundamentally this 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.950
 what it is easy to write on sd cards 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.990
 here it which I remove now writes on 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.380
 winchester why still me winchester on 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.320
 this camera began to pop very hard 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.720
 broke the cord here it is not a video 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.290
 look for shorter screen broken cord 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.770
 not what they were in half of the cases it is not 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.600
 it turns on and generally it is hard to drive 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.160
 traveling with her is not convenient but another thing 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.750
 This camera is not wide 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.300
 lens more contributions will be eraser 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.610
 ok, nothing interesting here 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.500
 box telling something shows 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.810
 what the fuck is this anyway 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.100
 crap he has the feeling that here is the game 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.140
 supports all sorts of devices to it 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.600
 You can include first yusb lace 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.080
 always with him he's hiding here 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.549
 Secondly, this is what I do not even know what 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.260
 it is necessary to read this on the website 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.239
 description of this camera ok let's go to 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.269
 the city let's see how she takes off 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.430
 30x zoom and awesome now 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.230
 I will show here I can not restrain effective 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.180
 Optical stabilizer see if 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.810
 turning her see how he hangs 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.650
 than cool more than once did not see 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.820
 all-seeing eye watching you 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.760
 Macro let's wall here for this 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.890
 penny cool function in the camera is 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.480
 watch object click on objects 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.720
 he keeps on watching him always 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.790
 focus suggesting where poked cool 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.709
 oven resistive screen in order to 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.510
 it was possible both in winter and summer than in 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.500
 him poke just back from 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.760
 cities filmed 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.650
 quite a lot of material checking the zoom 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.200
 Stabilization night shooting to be honest 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.610
 I'm surprised I did not know that for 20,000 it is not 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.049
 professional camera and not 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.820
 semi professional is pure 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.370
 amateur camera costs 20,000 slightly 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.840
 less than 20,000 but on function i'm 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.650
 thrilled especially when compared to my 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.750
 old slonim camera like i already 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.090
 at five years ago let's 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.370
 here did not gasp did not breathe and did not speak 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.710
 what a cool camera i just show 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.509
 as she removes stabilizes and jeon and 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.080
 there are a lot of us at night and you decide for yourself 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:35.930
 whether you like it or not can shoot 50 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.900
 frames per second internet singles or 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.750
 stella beach like this but sense either 50 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.580
 full frames or 50 half want 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.990
 driving someone to the main thing so that 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.990
 The picture was beautiful looking 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.010
 a little bit you can't focus because 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.150
 the fact that his hands were shaking in the wind chamber 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.150
 preset happens 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.400
 possibly 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:30.139
 Interesting points you can see and I them 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:30.139
 I see here that KrAZ capacious understand
