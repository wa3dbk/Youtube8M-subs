00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
our grass scene and since the play-doh

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.840 
our grass scene and since the play-doh
is<00:01:16.050> so<00:01:16.260> thick<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.770> stands<00:01:17.130> up<00:01:17.220> pretty<00:01:17.490> well<00:01:17.580> on

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
think we really don't need a support

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.969 
think we really don't need a support
system<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> make<00:01:25.440> it<00:01:25.560> look<00:01:25.770> more
