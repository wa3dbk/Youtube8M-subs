00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.890 

that's<00:03:30.879> it<00:03:31.060> it's<00:03:31.450> done

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
that's it it's done

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.990 
that's it it's done
wow<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:34.239> was<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:35.170> wasn't<00:03:35.470> timing<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:35.980> maybe<00:03:36.159> 30

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
wow that was I wasn't timing it maybe 30

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.990 
wow that was I wasn't timing it maybe 30
seconds<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.290> think<00:03:38.409> it<00:03:38.650> went<00:03:38.799> from<00:03:39.000> high

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
seconds so I think it went from high

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.210 
seconds so I think it went from high
speed<00:03:40.390> or<00:03:40.840> low<00:03:41.110> speed<00:03:41.409> to<00:03:41.500> high<00:03:41.650> speed<00:03:41.950> really

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
speed or low speed to high speed really

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.089 
speed or low speed to high speed really
fast<00:03:42.629> ran<00:03:43.629> and<00:03:44.019> then<00:03:44.230> went<00:03:44.439> down<00:03:44.500> below<00:03:44.890> and

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
fast ran and then went down below and

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.280 
fast ran and then went down below and
then<00:03:45.220> turned<00:03:45.430> off<00:03:45.609> automatically<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.569> got<00:03:47.170> to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
then turned off automatically I got to

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.080 
then turned off automatically I got to
send<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.560> couple<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.829> text<00:03:48.040> messages<00:03:48.519> didn't

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
send a couple of text messages didn't

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.119 
send a couple of text messages didn't
have<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.269> look<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:50.439> probably<00:03:50.859> could<00:03:51.099> have

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
have to look I probably could have

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.069 
have to look I probably could have
