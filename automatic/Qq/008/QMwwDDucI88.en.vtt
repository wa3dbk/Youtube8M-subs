Callie's abilities so pretty much her

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.080 
Callie's abilities so pretty much her
passive<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.100> called<00:00:59.309> twin<00:00:59.520> disciplines

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
passive is called twin disciplines

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.540 
passive is called twin disciplines
meaning<00:01:00.449> there's<00:01:00.629> two<00:01:01.100> disciplines<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.370> her

meaning there's two disciplines in her

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
meaning there's two disciplines in her
passive<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.359> our<00:01:03.480> first<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.049> upon

why<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> made<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.210> guys<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.720> 10<00:01:28.140> flat<00:01:28.590> ad<00:01:28.860> inner

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
why I made you guys get 10 flat ad inner

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.600 
why I made you guys get 10 flat ad inner
wounds<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.119> trigger<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.189> that<00:01:32.189> bonus

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
wounds so you trigger that on that bonus

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.640 
wounds so you trigger that on that bonus
passive<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.540> off<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.810> bat<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.079> level<00:01:34.320> 1<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
passive right off the bat at level 1 and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.170 
passive right off the bat at level 1 and
they're<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> buy<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.460> amplifying<00:01:35.909> toe

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
they're going to buy the amplifying toe

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
they're going to buy the amplifying toe
my<00:01:36.329> level<00:01:36.600> 1<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> trigger<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> first

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
my level 1 so you trigger that first

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.370 
my level 1 so you trigger that first
part<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> passive<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.600> therefore<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.229> get

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
part of the passive so therefore you get

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.230 
part of the passive so therefore you get
your<00:01:40.560> full<00:01:40.829> passive<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.640> level<00:01:41.909> 1<00:01:42.060> which<00:01:42.210> is

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
your full passive at level 1 which is

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.890 
your full passive at level 1 which is
just<00:01:42.420> ridiculous

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.170 

so<00:01:49.900> Callie's<00:01:50.350> first<00:01:50.590> ability<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:51.100> called<00:01:51.250> mark

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
so Callie's first ability is called mark

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.460 
so Callie's first ability is called mark
of<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.390> assassin<00:01:52.900> basically<00:01:53.260> it's<00:01:53.380> that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
of the assassin basically it's that

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.960 
of the assassin basically it's that

again to launch it off a deal's a bonus
magic<00:02:00.369> damage<00:02:00.550> which<00:02:01.030> is<00:02:01.150> pretty<00:02:01.300> solid<00:02:01.950> akali

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
so it's pretty much at a we circle that

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.950 
so it's pretty much at a we circle that
you<00:02:06.130> always<00:02:06.220> see<00:02:06.430> a<00:02:06.460> cali<00:02:06.729> go<00:02:06.940> inside<00:02:07.300> as<00:02:07.479> long

you always see a cali go inside as long
as<00:02:07.990> she's<00:02:08.229> inside<00:02:08.500> she<00:02:08.649> will<00:02:08.739> be<00:02:08.860> stealth<00:02:09.100> i

as she's inside she will be stealth i

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.760 
as she's inside she will be stealth i
once<00:02:09.610> she<00:02:09.700> exits<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.149> circles<00:02:10.630> 4.5<00:02:11.410> seconds

she'll<00:02:11.890> be<00:02:12.010> stealth<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.400> then<00:02:12.819> basically<00:02:13.120> she

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
she'll be stealth and then basically she

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.120 
she'll be stealth and then basically she
unstuff<00:02:13.750> afterwards<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.620> she<00:02:14.709> can<00:02:14.860> go<00:02:14.950> back

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130

was a terrible idea but in my head it
was<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.010> great<00:03:36.220> idea<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:36.909> basically<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.239> use

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
was a great idea so basically I use

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
useless therefore it's important to

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.779

with<00:05:55.980> another<00:05:56.190> hextech<00:05:56.700> gunblade<00:05:56.730> like<00:05:57.150> i

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
with another hextech gunblade like i

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.470 
with another hextech gunblade like i
said<00:05:57.860> it's<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:59.040> very<00:05:59.070> solid<00:05:59.910> build<00:06:00.150> if<00:06:00.390> you

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
said it's a very solid build if you

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.670 
said it's a very solid build if you
don't<00:06:00.690> like<00:06:00.810> it<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:00.990> can<00:06:01.170> obviously<00:06:01.410> change

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
don't like it you can obviously change

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.400 
don't like it you can obviously change
things<00:06:02.190> but<00:06:02.430> I<00:06:02.610> strongly<00:06:03.090> believe<00:06:03.240> it<00:06:03.690> is<00:06:03.930> very

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
things but I strongly believe it is very

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:10.640 
things but I strongly believe it is very
great<00:06:08.420> so<00:06:09.420> like<00:06:09.660> I<00:06:09.780> always<00:06:09.900> say<00:06:10.260> where<00:06:10.530> does

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
great so like I always say where does

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.040 
great so like I always say where does
the<00:06:10.740> cali<00:06:10.950> stand<00:06:11.340> I<00:06:11.580> think<00:06:12.180> she's<00:06:12.450> maybe<00:06:12.720> more

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
the cali stand I think she's maybe more

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.440 
the cali stand I think she's maybe more
on<00:06:13.260> the<00:06:13.500> overpowered<00:06:14.370> side<00:06:14.670> just<00:06:15.000> simply

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
on the overpowered side just simply

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.630 
on the overpowered side just simply
because<00:06:15.690> her<00:06:15.810> passive<00:06:16.620> seems<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:16.980> little<00:06:17.130> Opie

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
because her passive seems a little Opie

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.420 
because her passive seems a little Opie
um<00:06:18.300> maybe<00:06:19.260> just<00:06:19.560> nerve<00:06:19.740> that<00:06:19.890> a<00:06:19.950> little<00:06:20.280> bit

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
um maybe just nerve that a little bit

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.240 
um maybe just nerve that a little bit
and<00:06:20.640> her<00:06:21.120> ultimate<00:06:22.080> I<00:06:22.290> think<00:06:22.620> it<00:06:22.770> may<00:06:23.220> be

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
and her ultimate I think it may be

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.580 
and her ultimate I think it may be
should<00:06:23.430> be<00:06:23.610> like<00:06:24.180> three<00:06:24.540> stacks<00:06:24.870> or<00:06:25.230> instead

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
should be like three stacks or instead

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.410 
should be like three stacks or instead
of<00:06:25.650> two<00:06:25.920> stacks<00:06:26.220> or<00:06:26.340> maybe<00:06:26.520> make<00:06:26.760> it<00:06:26.880> three

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
of two stacks or maybe make it three

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.390 
of two stacks or maybe make it three
stacks<00:06:27.690> at<00:06:27.840> level<00:06:28.050> three<00:06:28.410> but<00:06:28.680> only<00:06:28.950> like<00:06:29.190> two

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
stacks at level three but only like two

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.980 
stacks at level three but only like two
stacks<00:06:29.670> at<00:06:29.790> level<00:06:30.000> two<00:06:30.150> because<00:06:30.750> that's

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
stacks at level two because that's

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.840 
stacks at level two because that's
really<00:06:31.260> what<00:06:31.470> gives<00:06:31.710> a<00:06:31.980> cali<00:06:32.250> such<00:06:32.550> a<00:06:32.580> big

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
really what gives a cali such a big

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.000 
really what gives a cali such a big
boost<00:06:33.150> into<00:06:33.450> some<00:06:33.660> hard<00:06:34.110> to<00:06:34.290> escape<00:06:34.500> from<00:06:34.800> her

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
boost into some hard to escape from her

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.130 
boost into some hard to escape from her
but<00:06:35.550> like<00:06:36.030> I<00:06:36.180> like<00:06:36.540> I<00:06:36.600> always<00:06:36.720> said<00:06:36.960> like

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
but like I like I always said like

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.320 
but like I like I always said like
there's<00:06:37.350> many<00:06:37.890> ways<00:06:38.040> to<00:06:38.100> counter<00:06:38.610> a<00:06:38.640> champion

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
there's many ways to counter a champion

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.210 
there's many ways to counter a champion
