went<00:00:06.800> a<00:00:06.830> little<00:00:06.920> bit<00:00:07.130> smoother<00:00:07.490> but<00:00:07.580> that<00:00:07.759> one

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
went a little bit smoother but that one

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.000 
went a little bit smoother but that one
wasn't<00:00:08.059> bad<00:00:08.210> and<00:00:08.930> you<00:00:09.139> know<00:00:09.320> even<00:00:09.799> though

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
wasn't bad and you know even though

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.189 
wasn't bad and you know even though
these<00:00:10.219> things<00:00:10.539> hopefully<00:00:11.539> look<00:00:11.719> beefy<00:00:12.080> and

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:12.199 
these things hopefully look beefy and

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.180 
these things hopefully look beefy and
monsterous<00:00:12.709> and<00:00:12.860> all<00:00:12.949> that<00:00:13.190> I<00:00:14.180> don't<00:00:15.190> they're

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.710 
monsterous and all that I don't they're
they<00:00:16.400> really<00:00:16.430> don't<00:00:16.760> weigh<00:00:16.940> that<00:00:16.970> much<00:00:17.240> I<00:00:17.570> mean

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
they really don't weigh that much I mean

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.450 
they really don't weigh that much I mean
although<00:00:18.230> they<00:00:18.470> look<00:00:18.619> badass<00:00:18.859> there's<00:00:19.280> just

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
although they look badass there's just

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.310 
although they look badass there's just
not<00:00:19.700> that<00:00:19.760> much<00:00:20.150> metal<00:00:20.510> there<00:00:20.690> like<00:00:20.870> I<00:00:20.990> got<00:00:21.170> the

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
not that much metal there like I got the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.960 
not that much metal there like I got the
front<00:00:21.470> one<00:00:21.710> from<00:00:21.890> this<00:00:22.040> table<00:00:22.460> out<00:00:22.580> into<00:00:22.880> the

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
front one from this table out into the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.550 
front one from this table out into the
yard<00:00:23.090> where<00:00:23.360> I<00:00:23.390> painted<00:00:23.750> it<00:00:23.870> single-handedly

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
yard where I painted it single-handedly

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.460 
yard where I painted it single-handedly
and<00:00:25.420> so<00:00:26.420> we<00:00:26.630> just<00:00:26.780> have<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:27.050> start<00:00:27.260> welding

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
and so we just have to start welding

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.490

you<00:02:07.159> guys<00:02:07.310> saw<00:02:07.609> I<00:02:07.639> built<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.209> back<00:02:08.390> ones

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
you guys saw I built the back ones

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.870 
you guys saw I built the back ones
straight<00:02:08.959> across<00:02:09.229> not<00:02:09.709> angling<00:02:10.160> up<00:02:10.399> like<00:02:10.640> that

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
straight across not angling up like that

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.330 
straight across not angling up like that
simply<00:02:11.870> because<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.320> back<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.800> truck<00:02:13.100> is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
simply because the back of the truck is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.460 
simply because the back of the truck is
straight<00:02:13.730> frickin<00:02:14.240> across<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:15.230> one's

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
straight frickin across this one's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.340 
straight frickin across this one's
curved

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
curved

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.840 
curved
the<00:02:16.410> dangles<00:02:16.800> up<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.160> built<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.490> bumper<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
the dangles up so I built the bumper to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.450 
the dangles up so I built the bumper to
match<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.810> back<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.410> flat<00:02:20.040> as<00:02:20.280> can

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
match that the back is just flat as can

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.640 
match that the back is just flat as can
