military<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.730> interesting<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.270> didn't

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
military and it's interesting I didn't

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.810 
military and it's interesting I didn't
know<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.840> if<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.260> don't<00:00:22.529> actually

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
know this if you don't actually

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.089 
know this if you don't actually
participate<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.850> combat<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:25.320> as<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> woman<00:00:25.980> are

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
participate in combat you as a woman are

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.070 
participate in combat you as a woman are
not<00:00:26.130> able<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.670> move<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> ranks<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
not able to move up the ranks in the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.890 
not able to move up the ranks in the
military<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.220> lose<00:00:30.000> certain<00:00:30.269> benefits

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
military so you lose certain benefits

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.810 
military so you lose certain benefits
you<00:00:31.050> don't<00:00:31.199> make<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.470> much<00:00:31.619> money<00:00:31.679> right<00:00:32.579> we're

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
you don't make as much money right we're

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.000 
you don't make as much money right we're
I<00:00:33.180> don't<00:00:33.450> think<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.710> in

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
I don't think that you have to be in

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.490 
I don't think that you have to be in
combat<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.910> way<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.300> we're<00:00:36.510> talking<00:00:37.230> about

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
combat the way that we're talking about

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.770 
combat the way that we're talking about
it<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.250> combat<00:00:38.700> because<00:00:39.149> obviously<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.629> have

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
it in combat because obviously we have

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.690 
it in combat because obviously we have
women<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> highest<00:00:40.860> levels<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
women at the highest levels of the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.690 
women at the highest levels of the
military<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.660> some<00:00:43.050> degree<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.489> combat<00:00:44.489> or

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
military so but some degree of combat or

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
military so but some degree of combat or
field<00:00:45.180> about<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.690> battlefield<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
field about that battlefield of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.119 
field about that battlefield of
operations

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
operations

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.790 
operations
my<00:00:47.520> guess<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.239> depends<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.410> area

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
my guess is that it depends on what area

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.069 
my guess is that it depends on what area
you're<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> rules<00:00:51.840> get

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you're in and and so the rules get

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
you're in and and so the rules get
really<00:00:52.620> murky<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.489> I've<00:00:53.610> read<00:00:53.789> into<00:00:54.090> this

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
really murky so I've read into this

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.439 
really murky so I've read into this
right<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.129> first<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:56.969> when

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
right and so you know first of all when

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.660 
right and so you know first of all when
you're<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> battlefield<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:59.280> does<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you're on the battlefield what does the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.150 
you're on the battlefield what does the
frontline<00:01:00.149> mean<00:01:00.420> right<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.050> Iraq<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.800> you're

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
frontline mean right in Iraq if you're

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.210

are in place and I don't think they

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.009

why<00:03:17.640> wouldn't<00:03:17.909> she<00:03:18.030> be<00:03:18.150> allowed<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.480> be<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:18.750> the

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
why wouldn't she be allowed to be in the

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.800 
why wouldn't she be allowed to be in the
front<00:03:19.110> lines<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:20.220> think<00:03:20.670> we've<00:03:21.239> got<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.510> apply

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
front lines I I think we've got to apply

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.050 
front lines I I think we've got to apply
and<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.980> know<00:03:23.069> what<00:03:23.250> my<00:03:23.550> hunch<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.879> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
and I you know what my hunch is the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.600 
and I you know what my hunch is the
military<00:03:24.450> which<00:03:24.659> is<00:03:24.690> not<00:03:24.989> as<00:03:25.260> susceptible<00:03:26.250> to

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
military which is not as susceptible to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.910 
military which is not as susceptible to
that<00:03:27.120> kind<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.510> pressure<00:03:27.750> as<00:03:28.080> many<00:03:28.709> other

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
that kind of pressure as many other

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.309 
that kind of pressure as many other
things<00:03:29.220> are<00:03:29.489> right<00:03:29.909> I<00:03:30.150> mean<00:03:30.750> they<00:03:30.989> can't<00:03:31.200> be

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
things are right I mean they can't be

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.320 
things are right I mean they can't be
sued<00:03:31.530> they<00:03:31.980> get<00:03:32.129> to<00:03:32.250> do<00:03:32.370> what<00:03:32.400> they<00:03:32.549> want<00:03:32.879> right

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
sued they get to do what they want right

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.380 
sued they get to do what they want right
so<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.709> have<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> reasonable<00:03:35.250> test<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.239> make

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
so just have a reasonable test and make

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.759 
so just have a reasonable test and make
sure<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.930> things<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.290> have<00:03:37.470> are

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
sure that the things you have are

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.259 
sure that the things you have are
reasonable<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.430> right<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.730> it's<00:03:38.849> not<00:03:39.060> like

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
reasonable and right and it's not like

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.270 
reasonable and right and it's not like
that<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.690> lift<00:03:39.870> 350<00:03:40.620> pounds<00:03:41.010> because

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
that you can lift 350 pounds because

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.160 
that you can lift 350 pounds because
that's<00:03:41.459> probably<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.209> know<00:03:42.299> but<00:03:42.720> they'll<00:03:43.019> be

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
that's probably you know but they'll be

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.759 
that's probably you know but they'll be
reasonable<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.830> whoever<00:03:44.610> passes<00:03:44.849> it<00:03:45.590> gets<00:03:46.590> it

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
reasonable and whoever passes it gets it

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.890 
reasonable and whoever passes it gets it
that's<00:03:47.069> all<00:03:47.190> there<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.730> look<00:03:48.420> trust<00:03:48.780> me

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.789 
that's all there is to it look trust me
