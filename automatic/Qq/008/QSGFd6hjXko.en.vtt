assume that traveling to Liverpool this

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.690 
assume that traveling to Liverpool this
weekend<00:02:10.050> will<00:02:10.349> prove<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.830> even<00:02:10.979> more<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.700 
weekend will prove to be even more of a
struggle<00:02:11.910> for<00:02:12.090> them<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.989> game<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.349> level

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
struggle for them it's a game that level

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.260 
struggle for them it's a game that level
it<00:02:13.740> should<00:02:13.980> dominate<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.610> comfortably<00:02:15.030> win

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
it should dominate and comfortably win

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.030 
it should dominate and comfortably win
and<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.200> Henderson<00:02:16.650> getting<00:02:16.860> more

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and I can see Henderson getting more

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.220 
and I can see Henderson getting more
involved<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.580> attacks<00:02:18.020> another<00:02:19.020> thing

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
involved in the attacks another thing

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.720 
involved in the attacks another thing
that<00:02:19.260> should<00:02:19.530> help<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.340> mentioned<00:02:20.460> before

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that should help like I mentioned before

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.240 
that should help like I mentioned before
is<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.990> lightly<00:02:22.320> move<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> 433

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
is that the lightly move to the 433

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.430 
is that the lightly move to the 433
formation<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:24.510> ended<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.020> Stoke<00:02:25.230> game

starts<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.260> time<00:02:28.410> around<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.280> would

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
starts this time around and that would

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.740 
starts this time around and that would
afford<00:02:29.640> Henderson<00:02:30.180> more<00:02:30.360> room<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.720> move

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
afford Henderson more room to move

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.660 
afford Henderson more room to move
forward<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.680> can't<00:02:31.950> see<00:02:32.100> him<00:02:32.250> coming<00:02:32.490> away

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
the game against Southampton and looked

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.670 
the game against Southampton and looked
more<00:04:12.420> up<00:04:12.570> for<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.840> than<00:04:12.960> they<00:04:13.050> did<00:04:13.200> towards<00:04:13.590> the

that<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.690> think<00:04:15.870> Swansea<00:04:16.290> will<00:04:16.410> dominate<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:16.950> I

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
that I think Swansea will dominate and I

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.860 
that I think Swansea will dominate and I
should<00:04:17.430> be<00:04:17.549> able<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:17.850> come<00:04:17.970> away<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.390> win<00:04:18.450> I

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
potential doubt at the moment which

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.880 
potential doubt at the moment which

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
could see cork replace him if he's not

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.080 
could see cork replace him if he's not
available<00:04:26.100> but<00:04:26.880> the

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
not such a bad time to consider a little

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.870 
not such a bad time to consider a little
poor<00:05:19.470> defender<00:05:19.919> and<00:05:20.070> if<00:05:20.400> you're<00:05:20.520> looking<00:05:20.789> to

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
poor defender and if you're looking to

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.850 
poor defender and if you're looking to
replace<00:05:21.120> one<00:05:21.389> of<00:05:21.419> your<00:05:21.539> defenders<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.200> don't

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
replace one of your defenders and don't

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.890 
replace one of your defenders and don't
have<00:05:23.039> much<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.460> spend<00:05:23.729> it<00:05:24.419> might<00:05:24.630> be<00:05:24.750> worth

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
have much to spend it might be worth

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.510 
have much to spend it might be worth
jumping<00:05:25.289> on<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.470> bandwagon<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.010> bringing

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
jumping on the bandwagon and bringing

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.580 
jumping on the bandwagon and bringing
gomez<00:05:26.850> in<00:05:27.030> especially<00:05:27.960> with<00:05:27.990> him<00:05:28.169> costing

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
gomez in especially with him costing

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.129 
gomez in especially with him costing
just<00:05:28.710> 4.5<00:05:29.310> million<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.910> can't<00:05:30.449> see<00:05:30.630> him<00:05:30.780> keeping

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
just 4.5 million I can't see him keeping

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.480 
just 4.5 million I can't see him keeping
the<00:05:31.200> left-back<00:05:31.560> spot<00:05:31.830> for<00:05:31.979> the<00:05:32.039> game<00:05:32.190> against

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
the left-back spot for the game against

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.400 
the left-back spot for the game against
Bournemouth<00:05:32.910> and<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.539> seems<00:05:33.810> like<00:05:33.930> Moreno<00:05:34.229> is

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
Bournemouth and it seems like Moreno is

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.560 
Bournemouth and it seems like Moreno is
out<00:05:34.680> of<00:05:34.830> favour<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.430> may<00:05:35.940> well<00:05:36.180> be<00:05:36.330> on<00:05:36.419> his<00:05:36.539> way

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
out of favour and may well be on his way

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.659 
out of favour and may well be on his way
away<00:05:37.380> from<00:05:37.410> Liverpool<00:05:37.979> before<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.430> end<00:05:38.580> of

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
away from Liverpool before the end of

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.760 
away from Liverpool before the end of
the<00:05:38.760> transfer<00:05:39.060> window<00:05:39.360> so<00:05:40.050> while<00:05:40.260> Gomez<00:05:40.560> may

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
the transfer window so while Gomez may

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.500 
the transfer window so while Gomez may
only<00:05:40.919> be<00:05:41.070> a<00:05:41.220> relatively<00:05:41.760> short<00:05:41.880> term<00:05:42.330> option

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
only be a relatively short term option

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.390 
only be a relatively short term option
you<00:05:43.050> could<00:05:43.200> well<00:05:43.410> be<00:05:43.530> worth<00:05:43.650> picking<00:05:43.889> up<00:05:44.130> ahead

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
you could well be worth picking up ahead

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.770 
you could well be worth picking up ahead
of<00:05:44.700> Liverpool's<00:05:45.060> home<00:05:45.270> game<00:05:45.419> against

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
of Liverpool's home game against

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.360 
of Liverpool's home game against
Bournemouth<00:05:46.169> and<00:05:46.380> I<00:05:46.680> can<00:05:46.860> see<00:05:46.979> a<00:05:47.010> little<00:05:47.160> pool

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
Bournemouth and I can see a little pool

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.310 
Bournemouth and I can see a little pool
coming<00:05:47.610> away<00:05:47.729> with<00:05:47.760> another<00:05:47.940> clean<00:05:48.330> sheet<00:05:48.360> so

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
coming away with another clean sheet so

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.839 
coming away with another clean sheet so
now<00:05:49.440> let's<00:05:49.620> move<00:05:49.770> on<00:05:49.950> to<00:05:49.979> the<00:05:50.190> changes<00:05:50.610> to<00:05:50.729> my
