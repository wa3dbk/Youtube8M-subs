00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.240
 well this in our dining room one of 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.120
 our dining rooms we have another one that 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.309
 is that they are reserved above 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.680
 well you see those are the letters 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.430
 letter we make it daily 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.750
 and we put the date and we do all 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.540
 the winds that we totally depend 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.270
 of the market if at a certain time 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.220
 the market and there are no anchovies or not 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.010
 there are squid or there is not so not what 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.910
 we put and that 's it and nothing happens but it 's 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.850
 essential in genre the freshest 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.250
 possible to me the peas that touches me and 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.890
 that they brought me at 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.620
 They are caught at 8 and now at one o'clock 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.989
 they are in my pot, because those are the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.530
 small differences and times each 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.000
 thing in its time essential that here 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.329
 same we put it to know well 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.510
 our kitchen is essential that 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.960
 ask for the tasting menu so a 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.759
 multi- course menu in which we put 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 what at that moment for us is 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:13.860
 what our author's cuisine shows 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.979
 we put the price of the price but this 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.590
 what we use most normally good 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.409
 you know that tablecloths are made of yarn 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.009
 but it 's nice and the texture is 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.830
 important dishes that is finite the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.759
 glasses are finite the cutlery 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.380
 that also that whatever it is all going 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.990
 in balance 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.509
 with what is food and pleasure 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.149
 always to the food because we should never 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.990
 to put nothing at all this I will repeat 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.710
 several times that to the product and to the plate 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.710
 hurt you
