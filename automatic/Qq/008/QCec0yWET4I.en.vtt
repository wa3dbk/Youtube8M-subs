00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.720 
what I do is I put on top of the rag
like<00:01:51.469> this<00:01:51.679> you<00:01:51.920> don't<00:01:52.070> cut<00:01:52.280> into<00:01:52.399> your<00:01:52.520> table

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:06.550 

there's<00:01:58.730> always<00:02:04.900> this<00:02:05.900> is<00:02:06.200> where<00:02:06.380> the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
there's always this is where the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.800 
there's always this is where the
sandpaper<00:02:07.250> comes<00:02:07.820> in<00:02:08.060> you'll<00:02:08.270> have<00:02:08.300> just<00:02:08.450> a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
sandpaper comes in you'll have just a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.740 
sandpaper comes in you'll have just a
slightly<00:02:09.110> jagged<00:02:09.680> cut<00:02:09.890> here<00:02:10.360> what<00:02:11.360> I'll<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:11.630> is

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
slightly jagged cut here what I'll do is

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.670 
slightly jagged cut here what I'll do is
I'll<00:02:11.900> take<00:02:11.930> just<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.440> few<00:02:14.020> be<00:02:15.020> careful<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.500> hold

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
I'll take just a few be careful to hold

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.840 
I'll take just a few be careful to hold
the<00:02:15.830> sand<00:02:16.190> block<00:02:16.430> nice<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.910> flat<00:02:18.580> kiss<00:02:19.580> that

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
the sand block nice and flat kiss that

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.270 
the sand block nice and flat kiss that
off<00:02:20.030> nice<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.570> flat<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.740> you'll<00:02:21.830> see<00:02:22.040> if<00:02:22.130> your

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
off nice and flat and you'll see if your

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.120 
off nice and flat and you'll see if your
label<00:02:22.640> got<00:02:23.230> buzzed<00:02:24.230> up<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.590> little<00:02:24.740> bit<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.010> can

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
label got buzzed up a little bit you can

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.540 
label got buzzed up a little bit you can
just<00:02:26.080> take<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.230> outside<00:02:27.710> edge<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:28.250> sort

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
just take the outside edge and just sort

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.480 
just take the outside edge and just sort
of<00:02:29.050> lightly<00:02:30.050> take<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.740> little<00:02:31.190> bit<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.400> an

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
of lightly take that a little bit of an

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.820 
of lightly take that a little bit of an
edge<00:02:31.670> off<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.470> it's<00:02:33.470> much<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.959> next<00:02:36.230> step<00:02:36.620> is

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
edge off so it's much the next step is

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.440 
edge off so it's much the next step is
you<00:02:37.010> always<00:02:37.220> want<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.430> rough<00:02:37.610> up<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.910> inside

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
you always want to rough up the inside

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.780 
you always want to rough up the inside
of<00:02:38.660> your<00:02:38.720> shaft<00:02:39.100> because<00:02:40.100> these<00:02:40.310> shafts<00:02:40.580> are

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
of your shaft because these shafts are

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.480 
of your shaft because these shafts are
made<00:02:40.940> on<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.120> mandrel<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.890> mandrel<00:02:43.340> has<00:02:43.459> a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
made on a mandrel the mandrel has a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.030 
made on a mandrel the mandrel has a
release<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.900> pull<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.260> carbon<00:02:45.590> off<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.920> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
release to pull the carbon off of the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.330 
release to pull the carbon off of the
mandrel<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:47.060> male<00:02:47.300> mold<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:48.950> always<00:02:49.130> want

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
mandrel the male mold so you always want

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.570 
mandrel the male mold so you always want
to<00:02:49.370> rough<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.820> up<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.600> get<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> good

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
to rough that up so you get a good

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.250 
to rough that up so you get a good
mechanical<00:02:52.580> bond<00:02:52.820> we<00:02:53.420> recommend<00:02:53.870> bonding

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
mechanical bond we recommend bonding

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.970 
mechanical bond we recommend bonding
with<00:02:54.380> epoxy<00:02:55.090> if<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.240> want<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.570> use<00:02:56.750> hot<00:02:57.709> melt

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
with epoxy if you want to use hot melt

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.790 
with epoxy if you want to use hot melt
glue<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.670> can<00:02:59.320> so<00:03:00.320> now<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.500> got<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.650> nice

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
glue you can so now you got a nice

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.890 
glue you can so now you got a nice
45-degree<00:03:01.550> cut<00:03:01.610> let's<00:03:01.970> see<00:03:02.150> how<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:02.360> matches

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
45-degree cut let's see how that matches

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.150 
45-degree cut let's see how that matches
up<00:03:03.050> with<00:03:03.170> our<00:03:03.350> blade<00:03:04.750> we've<00:03:05.750> got<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.019> v9<00:03:06.860> t1

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
up with our blade we've got a v9 t1

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.020 
up with our blade we've got a v9 t1
blade<00:03:07.459> here<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:10.489> we<00:03:10.610> slide<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.180> together

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
blade here and we slide that together

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.300 
blade here and we slide that together
and<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.090> can<00:03:14.750> see<00:03:14.780> now<00:03:15.470> when<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.830> sight<00:03:16.100> down

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
and you can see now when you sight down

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.870 
and you can see now when you sight down
your<00:03:16.550> handle<00:03:17.410> you're<00:03:18.410> perfectly<00:03:18.950> Square<00:03:19.340> to

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
your handle you're perfectly Square to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.949 
your handle you're perfectly Square to
the<00:03:20.170> blade<00:03:21.430> if<00:03:22.430> you're<00:03:22.880> not<00:03:23.090> per<00:03:23.450> se<00:03:23.690> for

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
the blade if you're not per se for

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.050 
the blade if you're not per se for
example<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:24.769> looks<00:03:24.980> like<00:03:25.280> you're<00:03:25.459> just<00:03:25.670> a

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
example it looks like you're just a

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.990 
example it looks like you're just a
teeny<00:03:26.300> bit<00:03:26.420> crooked<00:03:26.780> if<00:03:27.530> you're<00:03:28.280> crooked<00:03:28.519> this

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
teeny bit crooked if you're crooked this

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.509 
teeny bit crooked if you're crooked this
way<00:03:29.330> for<00:03:30.080> example<00:03:30.140> your<00:03:30.709> handle<00:03:31.070> seems<00:03:31.340> like

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
way for example your handle seems like

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.580 
way for example your handle seems like
it's<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.760> cockeyed<00:03:32.150> clockwise<00:03:33.080> because<00:03:33.470> you

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
it's a cockeyed clockwise because you

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.380 
it's a cockeyed clockwise because you
didn't<00:03:33.769> make<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.920> perfect<00:03:34.370> cut<00:03:34.550> it<00:03:35.120> means<00:03:35.330> you

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
didn't make a perfect cut it means you

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.670 
didn't make a perfect cut it means you
need<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.630> take<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.840> little<00:03:35.989> material<00:03:36.500> off<00:03:36.650> of

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
need to take a little material off of

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.060 
need to take a little material off of
this<00:03:36.980> side<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.480> if<00:03:38.600> that<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.050> case<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.830> can

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
this side so if that is the case you can

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.840 
this side so if that is the case you can
come<00:03:40.340> back<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.700> do<00:03:40.880> that<00:03:42.459> but<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:43.519> carefully

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
come back and do that but I carefully

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.430 
come back and do that but I carefully
know<00:03:44.180> which<00:03:44.540> side<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:45.019> need<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.260> take

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
know which side you need to take

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.380 
know which side you need to take
material<00:03:45.890> off<00:03:46.040> but<00:03:46.280> say<00:03:46.489> I<00:03:46.519> needed<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.030> rotate

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
material off but say I needed to rotate

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.600 
material off but say I needed to rotate
it<00:03:47.510> slightly<00:03:47.630> what<00:03:48.620> I<00:03:48.739> do<00:03:48.830> is<00:03:49.040> I'd<00:03:49.130> be<00:03:49.250> taking<00:03:49.549> a

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
it slightly what I do is I'd be taking a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.430 
it slightly what I do is I'd be taking a
little<00:03:49.850> bit<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.060> material<00:03:50.330> off<00:03:50.630> this<00:03:50.900> side<00:03:51.200> and

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
little bit of material off this side and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.710 
little bit of material off this side and
you<00:03:51.560> all<00:03:51.739> it<00:03:51.860> takes<00:03:52.070> is<00:03:52.250> just<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.820> slight<00:03:53.510> angle

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
you all it takes is just a slight angle

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.280 
you all it takes is just a slight angle
to<00:03:53.930> see

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
to see

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.699 
to see
paper<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:56.299> you<00:03:56.420> can<00:03:56.599> just<00:03:56.840> kiss<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.140> little<00:03:57.500> bit

paper and you can just kiss a little bit

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.679 
paper and you can just kiss a little bit
off<00:03:57.829> one<00:03:58.099> side<00:04:00.189> yeah<00:04:01.269> you're<00:04:02.269> not<00:04:02.390> in<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.540> big

rush just do a little bit at a time you
can<00:04:04.340> always<00:04:04.579> stand<00:04:04.790> more<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:06.280> if<00:04:07.280> your<00:04:07.489> handle

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
can always stand more and if your handle

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.309 
can always stand more and if your handle
isn't<00:04:07.969> good<00:04:08.359> and<00:04:08.450> that's<00:04:08.569> true<00:04:08.900> because<00:04:09.049> you

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
isn't good and that's true because you

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.860 
isn't good and that's true because you
didn't<00:04:09.500> make<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.650> perfect<00:04:10.129> cut<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:11.450> can<00:04:11.629> still

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
didn't make a perfect cut you can still

didn't make a perfect cut you can still
get<00:04:12.049> it<00:04:13.480> actually<00:04:14.480> rotated<00:04:14.900> my<00:04:14.989> handle<00:04:15.319> out<00:04:15.470> of

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
get it actually rotated my handle out of

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.469 
get it actually rotated my handle out of
position<00:04:16.039> slightly<00:04:16.400> because<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:17.120> was<00:04:17.269> in

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
position slightly because it was in

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.900 
position slightly because it was in
position<00:04:17.989> in<00:04:18.109> first<00:04:18.590> place<00:04:18.829> because<00:04:19.459> I<00:04:19.699> caught

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
position in first place because I caught

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.819 
position in first place because I caught
it

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
it

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.140 
it
but<00:04:21.829> that's<00:04:22.039> all<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.340> need<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.550> do<00:04:22.699> then<00:04:22.910> once

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
but that's all you need to do then once

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.540 
but that's all you need to do then once
you're<00:04:23.330> ready<00:04:23.449> to<00:04:23.539> bond<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:25.340> should

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
you're ready to bond and this should

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.120 
you're ready to bond and this should
already<00:04:25.850> be<00:04:26.000> roughed<00:04:26.389> up<00:04:26.570> for<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:27.020> if<00:04:27.919> it's<00:04:28.070> a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
already be roughed up for you if it's a

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.189 
already be roughed up for you if it's a
little<00:04:28.370> snug<00:04:28.639> fit<00:04:29.060> like<00:04:29.449> that<00:04:29.479> one<00:04:29.840> maybe<00:04:29.990> was

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
little snug fit like that one maybe was

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.749 
little snug fit like that one maybe was
a<00:04:30.229> touch<00:04:30.530> snug<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:32.000> can<00:04:32.210> just<00:04:33.460> slightly<00:04:34.460> rough

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
a touch snug you can just slightly rough

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.980 
a touch snug you can just slightly rough
that<00:04:35.240> up<00:04:35.449> too<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:36.050> get<00:04:36.139> a<00:04:36.169> nice<00:04:36.410> slide<00:04:36.800> fit

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
that up too so you get a nice slide fit

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.879 
that up too so you get a nice slide fit
there<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.080> go<00:04:39.199> see<00:04:39.380> how<00:04:39.440> that<00:04:39.590> went<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:39.770> a
