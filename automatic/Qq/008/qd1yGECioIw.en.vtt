sixty-six<00:02:14.280> percent<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.880> their<00:02:15.030> calories

that's<00:02:15.690> right<00:02:15.900> sixty-six<00:02:16.680> percent<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.100> their

be<00:02:37.800> at<00:02:37.920> 37%<00:02:38.580> fructose<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.830> joke<00:02:41.130> you

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030
