00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.970
 it does an additional function he does the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.630
 when she takes out steam then irons 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.630
 it nice and easy 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.109
 the specifications of this miele 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.789
 heat pump dryer from energy label a plus 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.340
 that means 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.410
 10% more economical after that has one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.399
 drying capacity from one to 8 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.430
 kilos 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.910
 furthermore, he has that fragrance box 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.640
 has a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.719
 softcare drum and man of this machine 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.719
 is he has steamfinish 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.460
 then why a heat pump dryer from 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.079
 miele after a heat pump dryers actually 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.590
 a normal dryer but then a bit 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.239
 smarter 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.520
 the hot air becomes optimal 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.570
 use and this saves you extreme 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.820
 on the energy bill 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.229
 but now how much you save it 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.560
 we just calculated based on 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.080
 dry five times in the neighborhood the normal 7 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.369
 kilos dry compared to this miele 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.110
 Dryer 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.150
 the normal standard dryer that 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.290
 consumed per drying 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.899
 the 4.14 kilowatt times 22 euro cents because 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.780
 that costs a lot of energy is 91 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:31.070
 eurocent times 5 times a week times 52 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.229
 weeks is 236 euros per year after 60 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.380
 this miele heat pump dryer that 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.960
 consumed 1.65 kilos per drying cycle 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.050
 times that 22 euro cent what a kilo it 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.869
 so that costs 36 euro cents that times 5 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.740
 times a week times 52 weeks that is 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.070
 but 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.479
 94 euros and 38 cents 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.090
 after this calculation 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.439
 withdraw this means saving per 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.479
 year of up to 142 euros 22 out of 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.229
 energy bill compared to one 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.900
 ordinary 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.030
 condensation dryer this miele is therefore extreme 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.299
 economical and therefore earns itself 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.299
 back 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.340
 this is the miele softcare drum for the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.680
 dryers a special honeycomb 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.300
 structure which minimizes that 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.010
 has wear on your clothes and also 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.010
 even once discord ASAP 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.930
 The new tumble dryer was good 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.090
 and lifters 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.470
 as you can see here the two of them are 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.080
 in this is metal 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.879
 because there are all sensors in it 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.620
 who can measure exactly what for 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.110
 humidity that he has 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.019
 never runs for too long so at the moment you 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.849
 say ironically also exact 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.950
 iron dry I say cupboard is dry you 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.200
 exact cussler 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.000
 and by that the perfect turning system 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.470
 then never runs between the dryer 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.390
 long and of course it saves again 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.500
 in a wear on your clothes and 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.500
 naturally in energy consumption 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.370
 of course we all want you if you 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.500
 finish washing and drying that you 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.150
 clothes smell nice and this is common 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.020
 why we softener to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.880
 add wash 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.860
 only that nice scent that goes the way 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.690
 you were to do well in drier 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.860
 stopped and millais from that good again 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.000
 thought about it 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.580
 because they have the solution there 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.990
 namely for the frequency box and this 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.330
 capsule can give you different odors 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.760
 get it being the total of five that 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.950
 capsule that place here in the filter 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.870
 do you put the lip up the capsule 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.150
 in it and then you can also do it yourself 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.840
 adjust how much you want that scent 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.310
 gives 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.860
 to the right, you see it here 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.150
 lip above it is a bit stronger and 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.830
 you want to decrease 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.900
 the do this way and therefore under the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.610
 at a 50 dry runs 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.320
 and if you do so you dry well out of the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.000
 you get drier than it touches least 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.000
 nice and fresh for 3 weeks 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.490
 this miele also has steam finn 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.250
 is then we just take the program 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.140
 steam smoothly do just after drying 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.700
 then see some steam blowing through you 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.590
 dry well and then send 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.270
 nice and easy for both ironing and 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.490
 what you can of course do is for 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.560
 the shirt that is not really dirty but 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.830
 need a little freshening up 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.720
 has 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.320
 do you put it in we all the way to 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.320
 the little man 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.940
 This machine has a clear one 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.320
 One-button operation is only required 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.880
 to give what for 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.800
 dry well and put it in for the rest 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.540
 so this machine everything by itself 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.210
 you would therefore also use this machine yourself 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.850

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.920

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.600
 need more if you use 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.520

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.200
