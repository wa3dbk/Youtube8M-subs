00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello you love out there we had 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.950
 showed up in the last video as we do 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.290
 a silicone without silicone impression of 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.790
 have made a robot space and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.769
 Now we just want to do it like that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.599
 make a concrete block where else 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 actually that emphasizes that rhubarb 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.310
 space for used that's all 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.080
 a bit of oil, I'm back 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.800
 so darl drunter makes it so 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.529
 bit forward has a small 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.900
 dish or something you have now but one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.430
 bit of foil was over it was 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.140
 a silicone mold is not in 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.989
 being affected is so doll 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.280
 although yes concrete book occurs comes there must 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.390
 first of all, his concrete mix 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.290
 touch 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.510
 I 'm like this to our own 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.710
 Do not allow sheet of concrete to form 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.320
 we now have to us a concrete mix 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.210
 make sure we take the cement mortar 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.829
 I already have a bucket here but you 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.539
 can equal this cement mortar also 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.120
 so it does not always color like that 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.370
 gray concrete color has existed so 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.559
 to buy color pigments so in kilos 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.360
 packs or 500 grams pack 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.220
 I 'm just green now 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.900
 ordered black and red and with it one 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.960
 to try a few things 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.340
 and because the place is green, it's easy 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.619
 a bit green with it 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.070
 quantities in the concrete mixture should 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.560
 actually only two percent of this 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.750
 pigments and these pigments with pure 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.909
 how many there are now two percent of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.060
 a concrete bucket I'm doing now 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.310
 a little something in and so done 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
 see the color pigments then looks like 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.210
 such a powder that you just have to 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.210
 in such a concrete mixture becomes pure 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 for this 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.560
 2 percent how much is now from me 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.240
 can be the greens 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.390
 So I'm going to do a little bit 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.830
 in and then we show you the same 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.260
 back to her looks like this now 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.790
 I touched the mixture with the 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.140
 Of course, you can see green training 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.150
 that's a beautiful green concrete 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.240
 I've got one now 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.280
 wide mass as you can for the leaves 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.120
 needs and then you can easily 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.260
 now also be 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.010
 Distribute silicone sheet and then from it 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.050
 make his concrete again and this 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.790
 silicone mold but then sure hope 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:42.840
 I use it more often when scrolling 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:44.640
 unrestricted and massively beautiful 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.010
 disperse and do not plop 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.710
 Forget the trachea for this 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.510
 turn it on to let the air out here 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.510
 the air gets lost here in the house kump 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.300
 thing compacted has leaf man 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.060
 same green flat and I need 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.970
 only afterwards to paint on spray 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.510
 to mine wherever you have the same 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.520
 two birds with one stone beaten 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.400
 since here also no stockings or 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:31.430
 Immediately more in it you can the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:31.430
 Set up mixture so 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.190
 then you can dry the whole thing 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.690
 leave as I said in the green he will 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.860
 rather say five days you have to 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.330
 always a bit after weather cake 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.190
 after the temperature 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.600
 when it gets light again then you can 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.600
 make the leaf up again 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.310
 so now we have our sheet three days 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.830
 let it dry and now we try 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.390
 Just accept it because of this 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.580
 Do not plate so thick here now that you 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.709
 always have to look how thick and what is 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.860
 I know about the drying times 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.050
 rauszukriegen 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.340
 Here we have been waiting for three days 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:23.140
 and I have mine here now 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:24.940
 silicone mold underneath with cast in times 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.330
 standing upstairs may be without 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.440
 bad the bean simply has to 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.780
 but not in the dry yet 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.640
 dry and is now a green leaf 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.640
 let's see it completely green 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.330
 that users then go upstairs if you can 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.919
 the silicone mold used here like 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.060
 you can then use again and again 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.640
 Do you always have your sheet lying? 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.479
 Just try nablus rating 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.740
 silicone that have gone down and this 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:01.510
 plate space finished that was now 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.700
 negative form so with sheet was now 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.860
 practically the negative in front of you 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:11.550
 Well, then we'll leave it 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.550
 dry a few days
