there's<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.539> lot<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.840> different<00:00:28.140> ways<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.349> do

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
there's a lot of different ways to do

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.019 
there's a lot of different ways to do
artificial<00:00:29.490> rock

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
artificial rock

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.759 
artificial rock
there's<00:00:30.390> several<00:00:30.750> manufacturers<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.710> make

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
there's several manufacturers that make

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.400 
there's several manufacturers that make
premade<00:00:32.669> stone<00:00:33.210> panels<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.260> in

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
premade stone panels and then to get in

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.400 
premade stone panels and then to get in
here<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.829> walls<00:00:35.070> we're<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.180> Michigan<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.170> we're

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
here to walls we're in Michigan so we're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.260 
here to walls we're in Michigan so we're
building<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.340> deal<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.820> weather<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
building in to deal with the weather the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
building in to deal with the weather the
freeze-thaw<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.190> we've<00:00:41.489> sort<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
freeze-thaw and so we have we've sort of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
freeze-thaw and so we have we've sort of
created<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> style<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.440> works<00:00:43.649> best<00:00:43.860> for

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
created this style and it works best for

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
created this style and it works best for
us<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.309> our<00:00:44.399> environment<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.390> start<00:00:45.660> by

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
us in our environment we start by

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.180 
us in our environment we start by
creating<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> structure<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:46.950> what

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
creating the structure and that's what

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
creating the structure and that's what
we're<00:00:47.340> seeing<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.730> here<00:00:47.760> using<00:00:48.360> metal<00:00:48.690> lath

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we're seeing up here using metal lath

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.439 
we're seeing up here using metal lath
and<00:00:48.840> cement<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.680> rebar<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.850> create<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> rough

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and cement and rebar we create the rough

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.569 
and cement and rebar we create the rough
shape<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.320> looking<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.949> which<00:00:53.550> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
shape that we are looking for which is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.389 
shape that we are looking for which is
what<00:00:53.910> would<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.239> under<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.920> once<00:00:55.920> that's<00:00:56.190> all

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
what would be under here once that's all

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.830 
what would be under here once that's all
set<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.000> hard<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:58.140> use<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.699> richer<00:01:00.480> mix<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
set up and hard we use a richer mix of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
set up and hard we use a richer mix of
concrete<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.829> call<00:01:02.190> our<00:01:02.340> carving<00:01:02.730> coat

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
concrete that we call our carving coat

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.700 
concrete that we call our carving coat
and<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.719> apply<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.880> applied

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
and we apply it so now this is applied

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.070 
and we apply it so now this is applied
let<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.860> start<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> set<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.600> at

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
let that start to set up and then we at

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
let that start to set up and then we at
first<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.650> use<00:01:10.830> our<00:01:11.010> hands<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.430> literally

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
first just use our hands and literally

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.730 
first just use our hands and literally
start<00:01:12.150> smoothing<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.960> rough<00:01:13.140> edges<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
start smoothing out the rough edges and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770 
start smoothing out the rough edges and
taking<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.970> high<00:01:15.150> points<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
taking all these the high points in the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.039 
taking all these the high points in the
pops<00:01:16.020> out<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.619> creating<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:18.930> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
pops out and creating it to get kind of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.310 
pops out and creating it to get kind of
a<00:01:19.110> smooth<00:01:19.530> finish<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:21.720> once<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
a smooth finish and once we have a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
a smooth finish and once we have a
smooth<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.040> basic<00:01:23.490> smooth<00:01:23.729> finish<00:01:24.090> right

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
smooth that basic smooth finish right

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.820 
smooth that basic smooth finish right
there<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.720> we'll<00:01:24.900> start<00:01:25.140> carving<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
there then we'll start carving and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.149 
there then we'll start carving and
putting<00:01:27.110> cracks<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.380> things<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
putting cracks and things in and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
putting cracks and things in and
following<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.700> natural<00:01:29.850> shape<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> stone

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
following the natural shape of the stone

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
following the natural shape of the stone
we're<00:01:31.259> nice<00:01:31.380> waterfall<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.250> point<00:01:32.520> we've

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
we're nice waterfall to this point we've

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.719 
we're nice waterfall to this point we've
hand<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.630> mix<00:01:33.869> about<00:01:34.650> 18<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.070> 20<00:01:35.130> yards<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
hand a mix about 18 to 20 yards of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.810 
hand a mix about 18 to 20 yards of
cement<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.659> into<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> structure<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
cement that go into the structure and

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.219 
cement that go into the structure and
once<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> shape<00:01:39.720> we're<00:01:39.930> looking

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
once we get all the shape we're looking

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.929 
once we get all the shape we're looking
for<00:01:40.439> we'll<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.920> these<00:01:41.159> final<00:01:41.549> carving

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
for we'll do these these final carving

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
for we'll do these these final carving
coats<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.360> go<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.439> only<00:01:43.560> takes

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
coats that go on here there only takes

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.030 
coats that go on here there only takes
two<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.369> three<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.880> four<00:01:44.909> hours<00:01:45.450> per<00:01:45.750> rock<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
two to three to four hours per rock to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.830 
two to three to four hours per rock to
carve<00:01:47.340> again<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.759> exactly<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
carve again it exactly as we like it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.720 
carve again it exactly as we like it
this<00:01:48.960> process<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
this process and

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.940 
this process and
we<00:01:51.210> learned<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.660> guy<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.080> had<00:01:52.260> done<00:01:52.470> a

we learned from a guy that had done a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460 
we learned from a guy that had done a
lot<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.280> work<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.060> Universal<00:01:54.870> Studios<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.440> a

with<00:02:00.420> he<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.780> original<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.470> we

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
with he was the original one that we

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.710 
with he was the original one that we
worked<00:02:01.980> with<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.520> he<00:02:02.640> taught<00:02:02.880> us<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> process

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
worked with and he taught us the process

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.450 
worked with and he taught us the process
and<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:04.470> from<00:02:04.710> there<00:02:04.890> we've<00:02:05.100> sort<00:02:05.370> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and then from there we've sort of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.390 
and then from there we've sort of
changed<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.210> Malda<00:02:06.570> move<00:02:06.870> it<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.170> our<00:02:07.440> style

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
changed in Malda move it to our style

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.490 
changed in Malda move it to our style
literally<00:02:09.240> than<00:02:09.450> our<00:02:09.570> hands<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.380> of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
