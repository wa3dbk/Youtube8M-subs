00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.630 
of chords at least G B minor DNA the
picking<00:01:42.110> pattern<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.470> I'm<00:01:42.590> using<00:01:42.770> T<00:01:43.340> stands

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
picking pattern that I'm using T stands

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.340 
picking pattern that I'm using T stands
for<00:01:43.759> thumb<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:45.070> 2<00:01:46.070> would<00:01:46.670> be<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.869> middle<00:01:48.170> finger

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
for thumb I 2 would be the middle finger

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.070 
for thumb I 2 would be the middle finger
and<00:01:48.619> one<00:01:49.280> would<00:01:49.550> be<00:01:49.700> your<00:01:49.970> pointer<00:01:50.630> finger
