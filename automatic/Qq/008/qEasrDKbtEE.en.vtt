00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.219
 hello in this video I want to share 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.910
 your experience and tell how to extend 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.779
 the work of your ios device using 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.380
 forced reboot 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.860
 and also I'll touch on the topic of optimizing ios 7 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.520
 for maximum results in 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.700
 General went to start you need 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.270
 fully discharge the device to 0 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.989
 percent then connect the device to 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.690
 exercise 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.320
 after the device has charged up 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.809
 100 percent are you doing a hard reboot then 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.069
 there is a forced reboot 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.710
 This is done as follows: press 

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:55.789
 simultaneously on the off button and 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.819
 home button 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.089
 you should have a black screen when 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:04.820
 that you should not let sandwiched 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.740
 button after black appears 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.950
 bullseye on a white background 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.610
 you have to let go of all pressed buttons 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.540
 and so now move on more difficult 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.880
 ios 7 settings first if you 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.580
 use dynamic wallpaper 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.060
 then they need to be changed to static 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.820
 picture as they consume 3 times 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.790
 more resources than static 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.050
 images go to settings 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.410
 wallpaper brightness pictures and select 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.590
 image and standard gallery either 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.960
 go to the photo album and choose 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.590
 the image that you have to 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.950
 second soul we need to disable 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.280
 the so-called parallax effect is kind 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.300
 business card ios 7 looks of course 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.750
 very beautiful but apart from devouring energy 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.360
 this opportunity is no good 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.110
 so go to the basic settings 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.379
 universal access and see item 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.209
 decrease movement here we move 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.220
 lever 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.379
 the third is geolocation 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.160
 can say one of the most important 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.670
 energy burning features iphone go 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.670
 in settings 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:32.190
 privacy geolocation service here 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.610
 disable the function in those applications where 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.459
 that is not necessarily well, and the last 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.959
 the fourth point is probably the most obvious 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.090
 but still it does lower the brightness level 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.640
 device it can be done either in 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.190
 control center by moving the slider 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.569
 100 position which will be comfortable 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.870
 for your eyes 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.959
 either go to wallpaper settings 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.110
 brightness and set lower 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.700
 figure at the end of the video I want to give you 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.310
 one more trick 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.970
 it is not related to charge holding 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.030
 batteries 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.239
 but still to your ayos 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.420
 the device was charging faster than usual 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.080
 you need to transfer the phone in airplane mode 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.140
 for this we go to the control center and 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.319
 click on the airplane or go to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.950
 airplane mode settings and move 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.220
 runner 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.370
 and on this all write in the comments what 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.859
 way more effective for you 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.250
 the next video will be about making money up 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.250
