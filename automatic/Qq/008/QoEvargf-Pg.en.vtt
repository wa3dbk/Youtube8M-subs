roughly about a hundred dollars to to
repair<00:00:40.399> I<00:00:41.399> went<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.480> eBay<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.079> found<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.190> one

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
repair I went on eBay I found this one

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.880 
repair I went on eBay I found this one
for<00:00:44.789> one<00:00:45.329> hundred<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.660> thirty<00:00:45.870> five<00:00:46.410> dollars

for one hundred and thirty five dollars
so<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:47.879> thirty<00:00:48.090> five<00:00:48.270> dollars<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:49.920> know

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
so for thirty five dollars you know

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.170 
so for thirty five dollars you know
compared<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:51.239> hundred<00:00:51.480> dollars<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.770> fix

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
compared to one hundred dollars to fix

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.209 
compared to one hundred dollars to fix
or<00:00:54.180> thirty<00:00:54.420> five<00:00:54.600> dollars<00:00:54.899> more<00:00:55.050> rather<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
or thirty five dollars more rather I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.549 
or thirty five dollars more rather I
might<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:56.850> well<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.210> buy<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.230> buy<00:00:59.010> a<00:01:00.379> buy<00:01:01.379> one

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
might as well just buy one buy a buy one

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
might as well just buy one buy a buy one
in<00:01:01.680> decent<00:01:01.859> condition<00:01:02.180> put<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> back<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.539> my

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
in decent condition put it back on my

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.780 
in decent condition put it back on my
bike<00:01:03.870> rather<00:01:04.409> than<00:01:04.650> having<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.430> welded

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
bike rather than having it welded

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.030 
bike rather than having it welded
because<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.600> cost-effective<00:01:07.040> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
because it's just not cost-effective and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.600 
because it's just not cost-effective and
it<00:01:08.909> turns<00:01:09.119> out<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.390> swing<00:01:09.630> arm<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.080> in

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
it turns out this swing arm is in

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.370 
it turns out this swing arm is in
excellent<00:01:11.610> shape<00:01:12.979> I'm<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.189> sure<00:01:14.400> how<00:01:14.760> many

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
excellent shape I'm not sure how many

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.410 
excellent shape I'm not sure how many
kilometers<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.820> bike<00:01:18.060> had<00:01:18.560> but<00:01:19.850> either<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
kilometers this bike had but either it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.070 
kilometers this bike had but either it
just<00:01:21.450> came<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.229> showroom<00:01:22.530> floor<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:24.080> it

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
just came off the showroom floor or it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.920 
just came off the showroom floor or it
was<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> very<00:01:25.680> very<00:01:26.070> low<00:01:26.340> mileage<00:01:27.110> bike<00:01:29.930> I'm

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
was a very very low mileage bike I'm

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.179 
was a very very low mileage bike I'm
looking<00:01:31.290> at<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.680> chain<00:01:32.520> guide<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
looking at the chain guide here and

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
looking at the chain guide here and
there's<00:01:35.189> one<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> bottom<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.939> well<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
there's one on the bottom as well and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.210 
there's one on the bottom as well and
it's<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:38.009> worn<00:01:38.400> at<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:39.030> or<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.320> barely<00:01:40.829> been

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
it's not worn at all or it's barely been

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.730 
it's not worn at all or it's barely been
touched<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.350> seems<00:01:44.540> I'm<00:01:45.540> also<00:01:45.810> looking<00:01:46.140> at

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
touched so it seems I'm also looking at

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.289 
touched so it seems I'm also looking at
the<00:01:46.950> side<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:48.290> there's<00:01:49.290> very<00:01:50.159> few<00:01:50.299> markings

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the side and there's very few markings

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.830 
the side and there's very few markings
on<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.630> which<00:01:52.229> means<00:01:52.970> even<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.420> bolts<00:01:54.750> here

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
on it which means even the bolts here

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.280 
on it which means even the bolts here
never<00:01:55.350> been<00:01:55.560> touched<00:01:55.770> which<00:01:55.979> means<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
never been touched which means the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.420 
never been touched which means the
adjusters<00:01:58.290> haven't<00:01:58.680> been<00:01:58.799> adjusted<00:01:59.280> so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
adjusters haven't been adjusted so

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.399 
adjusters haven't been adjusted so
that's<00:02:00.030> another<00:02:00.240> sign<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.810> low<00:02:00.930> mileage

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409

is<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:46.239> got<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.390> take<00:02:46.599> this<00:02:46.780> castle<00:02:47.380> nut

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
is to you got to take this castle nut

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.720 
is to you got to take this castle nut
off<00:02:47.860> but<00:02:48.310> don't<00:02:49.120> understood<00:02:49.599> from<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:51.069> base

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
off but don't understood from the base

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.530 
off but don't understood from the base
that<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.769> because<00:02:53.769> this<00:02:54.810> fits<00:02:55.810> in<00:02:56.170> here

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
that it's in because this fits in here

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.750 
that it's in because this fits in here
it<00:02:58.540> also<00:02:58.660> doesn't<00:02:58.959> hurt<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.799> put<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.400> little<00:03:00.610> bit

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
it also doesn't hurt to put a little bit

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.170 
it also doesn't hurt to put a little bit
of<00:03:00.879> grease<00:03:01.209> around<00:03:01.450> here<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.319> lubricates<00:03:02.890> D

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
of grease around here so it lubricates D

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.430 
of grease around here so it lubricates D
the<00:03:04.180> do<00:03:04.840> ring<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.379> it<00:03:05.470> sits<00:03:05.709> in<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:08.170> I'm<00:03:08.260> going

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
the do ring that it sits in so I'm going

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.190 
the do ring that it sits in so I'm going
to<00:03:08.470> go<00:03:08.590> ahead<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:09.239> do<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.450> up<00:03:10.569> all<00:03:10.870> I'm<00:03:11.019> using

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
to go ahead and do it up all I'm using

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.129 
to go ahead and do it up all I'm using
is<00:03:14.040> general<00:03:15.040> purpose<00:03:15.190> grease<00:03:15.930> parent<00:03:16.930> grease

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
is general purpose grease parent grease

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.470 
is general purpose grease parent grease
or<00:03:17.650> whatever

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
or whatever

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:41.040 
or whatever
anything<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.600> fine

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.530 

it<00:03:41.710> would<00:03:41.830> probably<00:03:42.070> be<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.610> good<00:03:42.820> idea<00:03:42.880> as<00:03:43.480> well

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
it would probably be a good idea as well

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.880 
it would probably be a good idea as well
clean<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.500> inside<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.420> then<00:03:46.780> it's<00:03:47.560> free

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
clean the inside and this then it's free

00:03:47.890 --> 00:04:11.619 
clean the inside and this then it's free
of<00:03:48.040> dirt

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.559 

as<00:04:12.629> this<00:04:13.019> axial<00:04:13.709> boom

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
as this axial boom

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.629 
as this axial boom
tightening<00:04:15.569> up<00:04:15.749> when<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.829> start<00:04:17.130> turning<00:04:17.519> it

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
tightening up when you start turning it

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:32.860 
tightening up when you start turning it
and<00:04:18.090> start<00:04:18.560> tightening<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.739> up<00:04:19.799> with<00:04:20.009> the<00:04:20.220> hat

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.589 

so<00:04:33.870> now<00:04:34.020> I'm<00:04:34.259> going<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.470> use<00:04:34.530> via<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:36.060> hex<00:04:36.270> and

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
so now I'm going to use via the hex and

00:04:36.599 --> 00:05:02.659 
so now I'm going to use via the hex and
tighten<00:04:37.139> up<00:04:37.259> the<00:04:59.300> okay<00:05:00.300> so<00:05:00.509> it<00:05:00.630> turns<00:05:00.660> out<00:05:01.669> what

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
tighten up the okay so it turns out what

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:08.830 
tighten up the okay so it turns out what
I<00:05:02.699> found<00:05:02.970> in<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.560> service<00:05:04.560> manual<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:06.650> the

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
I found in the service manual that the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.620 
I found in the service manual that the
castle<00:05:09.840> nut<00:05:10.169> is<00:05:10.669> actually<00:05:11.669> used<00:05:11.909> to<00:05:12.060> adjust

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
castle nut is actually used to adjust

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.960 
castle nut is actually used to adjust
the<00:05:13.190> swing<00:05:14.190> arm<00:05:14.370> play<00:05:15.210> from<00:05:16.110> side<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.590> side<00:05:16.970> so

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
the swing arm play from side to side so

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.529 
the swing arm play from side to side so
if<00:05:18.330> there<00:05:19.110> is<00:05:19.139> play<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:20.520> will<00:05:20.849> actually<00:05:21.330> have

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
if there is play you will actually have

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.600 
if there is play you will actually have
to<00:05:21.570> loosen<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:24.419> castle<00:05:25.139> nut<00:05:25.259> and<00:05:25.610> adjust

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
to loosen the the castle nut and adjust

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.870 
to loosen the the castle nut and adjust
it<00:05:26.820> so<00:05:27.180> your<00:05:27.750> swing<00:05:28.050> arm<00:05:28.259> does<00:05:28.860> not<00:05:29.039> move<00:05:29.430> from

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
it so your swing arm does not move from

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.700 
it so your swing arm does not move from
side<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.150> side<00:05:30.889> in<00:05:31.889> my<00:05:32.400> case<00:05:32.669> here<00:05:33.080> that's<00:05:34.080> it's

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
side to side in my case here that's it's

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.540 
side to side in my case here that's it's
there's<00:05:34.979> no<00:05:35.130> problem<00:05:36.889> we<00:05:37.889> can<00:05:38.070> go<00:05:38.220> ahead<00:05:38.340> and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
there's no problem we can go ahead and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:06:30.650 
there's no problem we can go ahead and
then<00:05:39.320> install<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:41.389> pivot<00:05:42.389> nut

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.570 

and<00:06:31.660> that's<00:06:32.050> it<00:06:32.260> for<00:06:32.560> the<00:06:32.860> swingarm

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
and that's it for the swingarm

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.650 
and that's it for the swingarm
part<00:06:33.970> of<00:06:34.090> things<00:06:34.320> the<00:06:35.910> or<00:06:36.910> the<00:06:37.030> pivot<00:06:37.240> part

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
part of things the or the pivot part

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.680 
part of things the or the pivot part
rather<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.940> then<00:06:40.060> just<00:06:40.210> make<00:06:40.390> sure<00:06:40.540> that

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
rather and then just make sure that

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.860 
rather and then just make sure that
there's<00:06:40.960> no<00:06:41.140> side-to-side<00:06:41.530> play<00:06:42.420> and<00:06:43.420> you're

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
there's no side-to-side play and you're

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.890 
there's no side-to-side play and you're
good<00:06:44.050> to<00:06:44.170> go<00:06:44.200> for<00:06:44.350> the<00:06:44.650> next<00:06:44.770> step
