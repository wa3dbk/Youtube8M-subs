both those guys you know have big legs
scoring<00:00:40.860> potential<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.480> why<00:00:42.510> Seattle

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
scoring potential I can see why Seattle

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
scoring potential I can see why Seattle
would<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> favorite<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.370> i<00:00:44.399> guess<00:00:44.760> i

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
would be the favorite here so i guess i

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
would be the favorite here so i guess i
might<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.180> leaning<00:00:45.510> towards<00:00:45.750> seattle<00:00:45.870> minus

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
might be leaning towards seattle minus

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
might be leaning towards seattle minus
one<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.770> half<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.219> what<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.399> like

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
really cut it at they if their first

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.899 
really cut it at they if their first
year<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.559> know<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> program<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.729> really

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
year you know in the program they really

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.219 
year you know in the program they really
haven't<00:01:06.030> spent<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.360> whole<00:01:06.479> lot<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.689> time<00:01:06.990> there

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
haven't spent a whole lot of time there

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.550 
haven't spent a whole lot of time there
and<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.640> can't<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.570> being<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.049> fluid

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and I just can't see it being that fluid

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
and I just can't see it being that fluid
even<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.700> extended<00:01:12.180> playing

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
even if they do get extended playing

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.179 
even if they do get extended playing
time<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> offense<00:01:13.500> an<00:01:13.680> offense<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
time with that offense an offense that

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.330 
time with that offense an offense that
isn't<00:01:14.700> necessarily<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.930> deep<00:01:16.310> right<00:01:17.310> now

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
isn't necessarily really deep right now

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.300 
isn't necessarily really deep right now
so<00:01:17.970> i<00:01:18.270> don't<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.840> i<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.470> home<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.979> think

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
so i don't know i think at home I think

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.039 
so i don't know i think at home I think
it's<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.729> little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:21.000> more<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.930> I'm

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
it's a little bit more so I think I'm

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
it's a little bit more so I think I'm
leaning<00:01:22.409> towards<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.159> Denver<00:01:23.490> Broncos<00:01:23.520> on

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
leaning towards the Denver Broncos on

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.310 
leaning towards the Denver Broncos on
this<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
this one just because I think of the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560 
this one just because I think of the
moneyline<00:01:25.650> value<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.790> betting

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
moneyline value but you know you betting

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510 
moneyline value but you know you betting
on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> Seahawks<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.369> where

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
on the Seahawks is I can see where

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
on the Seahawks is I can see where
you're<00:01:29.549> coming<00:01:29.670> from<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.240> Pete<00:01:30.659> Carroll

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you're coming from because Pete Carroll

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.749 
you're coming from because Pete Carroll

preseason<00:01:45.869> right<00:01:46.170> yeah<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.549> really<00:01:47.700> doesn't

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
preseason right yeah it really doesn't

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.760 
preseason right yeah it really doesn't
you're<00:01:48.270> right<00:01:48.420> i<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.229> i<00:01:49.259> don't<00:01:49.560> worry

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
you're right i can see i don't worry

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.710 
you're right i can see i don't worry
where<00:01:50.579> he<00:01:50.700> would<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> seattle<00:01:51.600> seahawks

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
where he would like the seattle seahawks

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.740 
where he would like the seattle seahawks
here<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.380> again<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.119> i<00:01:54.390> think

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
here but again I I think that i think

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.510 
here but again I I think that i think
that<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.320> broncos<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.159> bit<00:01:56.340> more

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that the broncos have a little bit more

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.770 
that the broncos have a little bit more
of<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.640> value<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.240> people<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.630> looking

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
of a value that what people are looking

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.109 
of a value that what people are looking
at<00:01:58.049> here<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.590> seattle<00:01:59.159> even<00:01:59.759> though<00:01:59.880> i<00:01:59.909> do

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
at here the seattle even though i do

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.319 
at here the seattle even though i do
like<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.350> i<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.530> think<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
like that you know i do think that the

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.130 
like that you know i do think that the
home-field<00:02:03.329> advantage<00:02:03.689> doesn't<00:02:03.899> have

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
home-field advantage doesn't have

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.020 
home-field advantage doesn't have
anything<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.590> play<00:02:04.770> into<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.100> seattle<00:02:05.939> is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
anything to play into this seattle is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.700 
anything to play into this seattle is
just<00:02:06.270> down<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.719> many<00:02:06.899> players<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.500> so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
just down so many players they have so

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.020 
just down so many players they have so
many<00:02:07.770> new<00:02:08.129> players<00:02:08.369> i<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.849> they're<00:02:08.940> going

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
many new players i think they're going

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.729 
many new players i think they're going
to<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.509> little<00:02:09.539> bit<00:02:09.780> more<00:02:10.020> focused<00:02:10.590> on

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
to be just a little bit more focused on

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.470 
to be just a little bit more focused on
player<00:02:11.069> evaluation<00:02:11.819> rather

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
player evaluation rather

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.119 
player evaluation rather
winning<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.050> game<00:02:13.409> and<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:13.860> we<00:02:13.950> might

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
winning this game and I think we might

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.619 
winning this game and I think we might
be<00:02:14.159> in<00:02:14.340> tune<00:02:14.550> for<00:02:14.760> Pete<00:02:14.940> Carroll's<00:02:15.239> first<00:02:15.420> week
