them without looking away from the road
in<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.580> box

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
in the box

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.570 
in the box
you'll<00:00:27.210> actually<00:00:27.449> get<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.170> plastic<00:00:28.830> reflector

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
you'll actually get a plastic reflector

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
you'll actually get a plastic reflector
shield<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.539> reflective<00:00:30.990> film<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.679> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
shield and a reflective film that you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.709 
shield and a reflective film that you
can<00:00:31.920> choose<00:00:32.130> from<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:33.030> reflect<00:00:33.540> these

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
can choose from to reflect these

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.240 
can choose from to reflect these
directions<00:00:34.200> off<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.829> they<00:00:34.920> kind<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.130> look

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
directions off of so they kind of look

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.680 
directions off of so they kind of look
like<00:00:35.280> little<00:00:35.430> Holograms<00:00:36.090> floating<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.570> front

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
like little Holograms floating in front

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.970 
like little Holograms floating in front
of<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.960> now<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.510> reflective

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
of you now this is the reflective

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.760 
of you now this is the reflective
plastic<00:00:40.980> lens<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:43.739> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
plastic lens and it actually with a

little bit of difficulty snaps on and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410 
little bit of difficulty snaps on and
when<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:46.980> view<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> directions<00:00:47.969> through<00:00:48.270> the

when you view the directions through the
shield<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:48.989> actually<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
shield you can actually see the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.279 
shield you can actually see the
directions<00:00:50.340> right<00:00:51.000> side<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> floating

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
directions right side up and floating

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.840 
directions right side up and floating
sort<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.800> mid-air<00:00:53.070> right<00:00:53.460> before<00:00:53.730> your

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
sort of in mid-air right before your

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
sort of in mid-air right before your
eyes<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> way<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> Garmin<00:00:55.260> would

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
eyes now the way the Garmin would

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.900 
eyes now the way the Garmin would
actually<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> experience<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.730> hood

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
actually like you to experience the hood

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
actually like you to experience the hood
is<00:00:57.030> through<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.360> transparent<00:00:58.109> plastic<00:00:58.350> film

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
is through this transparent plastic film

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.680 
is through this transparent plastic film
that<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.219> include<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> box<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.510> you'll

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that they include in the box that you'll

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650 
that they include in the box that you'll
actually<00:01:00.980> attach<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.309> windshield<00:01:02.660> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
actually attach to your windshield to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.910 
actually attach to your windshield to
project<00:01:04.049> those<00:01:04.199> turn-by-turn<00:01:04.589> directions

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
project those turn-by-turn directions

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070 
project those turn-by-turn directions
upon<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.119> only<00:01:06.240> put<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.720> these<00:01:06.840> in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
upon now they only put one of these in

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
upon now they only put one of these in
the<00:01:07.170> box<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.830> little<00:01:07.979> tricky<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the box and it's a little tricky to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.620 
the box and it's a little tricky to
install<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.060> you're<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> get

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
install so you're going to have to get

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.390 
install so you're going to have to get
it<00:01:09.750> right<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.140> first<00:01:10.320> time<00:01:10.650> you're<00:01:11.189> first

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it right the first time you're first

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.310 
it right the first time you're first
going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> figure<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.270> where<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
going to want to figure out where on the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
going to want to figure out where on the
windshield<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.040> want<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.509> next

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
windshield you want it to be the next

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.850 
windshield you want it to be the next
thing<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.409> with<00:01:16.530> wet<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
thing you're going to do with wet the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.649 
thing you're going to do with wet the
windshield<00:01:17.280> down<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.729> good<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.600> we

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
windshield down really good so that we

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.969 
windshield down really good so that we
can<00:01:18.780> move<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.049> around<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:19.830> we

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
can move it around a little bit as we

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
can move it around a little bit as we
install<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:21.060> next<00:01:21.360> step<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> actually

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
install the next step is to actually

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.780 
install the next step is to actually
peel<00:01:22.259> off<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> backing<00:01:22.799> mark<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> white

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
peel off the backing mark with a white

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.940 
peel off the backing mark with a white
flag<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.509> kind<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.720> peel<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.080> off<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.500> then

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
flag just kind of peel that off and then

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.350 
flag just kind of peel that off and then
start<00:01:26.340> applying<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.909> HUD<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.210> your

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
start applying the HUD to your

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.890 
start applying the HUD to your
windshield

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
windshield

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.160 
windshield
now<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> windshields<00:01:30.360> wet<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.659> still

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
now when the windshields wet you still

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.270 
now when the windshields wet you still
get<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> little<00:01:31.500> bit<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.770> leeway<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
get a little bit of leeway and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.039 
get a little bit of leeway and
repositioning<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.270> here's<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.720> time<00:01:33.900> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
repositioning it so here's your time to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
repositioning it so here's your time to
kind<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.290> figure<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.590> where<00:01:35.159> exactly<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
kind of figure out where exactly you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.819 
kind of figure out where exactly you
want<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.299> once<00:01:37.170> you've<00:01:37.350> got<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.530> lined

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
want it to be once you've got it lined

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.990 
want it to be once you've got it lined
up<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.549> take<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> credit

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
up you're going to want to take a credit

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.370 
up you're going to want to take a credit
card<00:01:39.150> or<00:01:39.299> something<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:40.110> sort<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
card or something and actually sort of

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.560 
card or something and actually sort of
squeegee<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> bubbles<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.909> from<00:01:42.270> under

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
squeegee all the bubbles out from under

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.319 
squeegee all the bubbles out from under
it<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.799> perfectly<00:01:44.250> flat<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
it so that it's perfectly flat to the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.359 
it so that it's perfectly flat to the
windshield<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> last<00:01:46.890> step<00:01:47.189> is

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
windshield and then the last step is

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.760 
windshield and then the last step is
just<00:01:47.399> grab<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> green<00:01:48.180> tab<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.810> pull<00:01:49.200> off<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
just grab the green tab and pull off the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.219 
just grab the green tab and pull off the
front<00:01:50.159> protective<00:01:50.729> film<00:01:51.000> now<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> last<00:01:51.960> bits

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
front protective film now the last bits

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.530 
front protective film now the last bits
actually<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.680> easiest<00:01:52.950> part<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.640> peel<00:01:54.329> off

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
actually the easiest part just peel off

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
actually the easiest part just peel off
the<00:01:54.750> protective<00:01:54.840> backing<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.649> expose<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the protective backing to expose the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.450 
the protective backing to expose the
sticky<00:01:56.960> back<00:01:57.960> panel<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.619> hood<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.009> then

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
sticky back panel on the hood and then

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.069 
sticky back panel on the hood and then
you<00:01:59.579> take<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.689> put<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.020> on

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
you take it and actually just put it on

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
you take it and actually just put it on
your<00:02:01.200> dashboard<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.640> numbers

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
your dashboard so that the numbers

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.900 
your dashboard so that the numbers
reflect<00:02:03.719> up<00:02:04.579> through<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.990> thing<00:02:07.849> now<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
reflect up through the thing now the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.850 
reflect up through the thing now the
hoods<00:02:09.179> base<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:09.720> has<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.259> little<00:02:10.709> bit<00:02:10.800> of

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
hoods base actually has a little bit of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.050 
hoods base actually has a little bit of
swivel<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
swivel and a

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.089 
swivel and a
little<00:02:12.270> bit<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.450> twist<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:13.680> give<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.950> some

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
little bit of twist to give you some

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.130 
little bit of twist to give you some
flexibility<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.760> mounting<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.480> flexible

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
flexibility to mounting this flexible

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.229 
flexibility to mounting this flexible
pad<00:02:16.349> also<00:02:16.590> bends<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.130> little<00:02:17.340> bit<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:18.060> better

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
pad also bends a little bit to better

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.660 
pad also bends a little bit to better
contour<00:02:18.750> around<00:02:19.140> your<00:02:19.349> dashboard<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.400> that'll

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
contour around your dashboard so that'll

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.250 
contour around your dashboard so that'll
actually<00:02:20.760> help<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.150> get<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.420> good<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.660> secure

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
actually help you get it good and secure

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.050 
actually help you get it good and secure
so<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> doesn't<00:02:22.980> go<00:02:23.040> flying<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.760> actually

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
so it doesn't go flying if you actually

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.540 
so it doesn't go flying if you actually
actually<00:02:24.180> make<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> quick<00:02:25.020> turn<00:02:25.340> now<00:02:26.340> on<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
actually make a quick turn now on the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.949 
actually make a quick turn now on the
unit<00:02:26.790> itself<00:02:26.849> you've<00:02:27.270> actually<00:02:27.420> got<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> power

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
unit itself you've actually got a power

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.259 
unit itself you've actually got a power
cable<00:02:28.230> right<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:29.250> plugs<00:02:29.519> into<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.940> 12

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
cable right here that plugs into the 12

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.780 
cable right here that plugs into the 12
volt<00:02:30.480> adapter<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:31.470> adapter<00:02:31.950> has<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.130> built-in

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
volt adapter that adapter has a built-in

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.430

USB<00:02:33.269> port<00:02:33.569> on<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.690> back<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.319> can

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
USB port on the back of it so you can

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.990 
USB port on the back of it so you can
keep<00:02:34.530> your<00:02:34.680> smartphone<00:02:35.130> charge<00:02:35.459> while<00:02:35.849> you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
keep your smartphone charge while you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.420 
keep your smartphone charge while you
navigate<00:02:36.420> over<00:02:36.769> on<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.890> other<00:02:37.920> side<00:02:38.099> you've

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
navigate over on the other side you've

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.250 
navigate over on the other side you've
got<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.610> small<00:02:38.910> power<00:02:39.150> button<00:02:39.569> which<00:02:39.930> probably

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
got a small power button which probably

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.390 
got a small power button which probably
won't<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.590> worry<00:02:40.769> about<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.190> much

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
won't have to worry about that much

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.670 
won't have to worry about that much
because<00:02:41.880> when<00:02:42.690> your<00:02:42.810> vehicle<00:02:43.080> turns<00:02:43.260> on<00:02:43.500> and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
because when your vehicle turns on and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.630 
because when your vehicle turns on and
off<00:02:43.739> when<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.160> plugged<00:02:44.340> into<00:02:44.549> your

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
off when it's plugged into your

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.430 
off when it's plugged into your
cigarette<00:02:45.120> lighter<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:46.080> hood<00:02:46.260> should

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
cigarette lighter the hood should

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.900 
cigarette lighter the hood should
actually<00:02:46.620> turn<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.250> off<00:02:47.340> with<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.730> so

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
actually turn on and off with it so

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.490 
actually turn on and off with it so
generally<00:02:48.330> speaking<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:49.049> don't<00:02:49.230> really<00:02:49.319> have

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
generally speaking you don't really have

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.990 
generally speaking you don't really have
to<00:02:49.650> futz<00:02:49.860> with<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.190> much<00:02:50.400> after<00:02:50.610> you've<00:02:50.880> got

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
to futz with this much after you've got

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000 
to futz with this much after you've got
it<00:02:51.120> set<00:02:51.269> up<00:02:51.330> now<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.440> front<00:02:52.590> you've<00:02:52.860> got<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
it set up now on the front you've got a

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.320 
it set up now on the front you've got a
photocell<00:02:53.400> right<00:02:53.850> here<00:02:54.000> it's<00:02:54.120> going<00:02:54.239> to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
photocell right here it's going to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.420 
photocell right here it's going to
measure<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.959> amount<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.260> ambient<00:02:55.799> light<00:02:55.830> so

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
measure the amount of ambient light so

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.490 
measure the amount of ambient light so
that<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.940> display<00:02:57.569> doesn't<00:02:57.900> get<00:02:58.019> blown<00:02:58.319> out

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
that the display doesn't get blown out

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.650 
that the display doesn't get blown out
during<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.890> daytime<00:02:59.250> but<00:02:59.849> it<00:02:59.940> doesn't<00:03:00.209> dazzle

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
during the daytime but it doesn't dazzle

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.729 
during the daytime but it doesn't dazzle
you<00:03:00.810> during<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.290> night<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.650> will

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
you during the night it will

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.470 
you during the night it will
automatically<00:03:02.280> adjust<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.849> brightness<00:03:03.150> as

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
automatically adjust this brightness as

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.020 
automatically adjust this brightness as
needed<00:03:03.900> now<00:03:04.890> what<00:03:05.040> sort<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.340> information<00:03:05.700> will

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
needed now what sort of information will

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.539 
needed now what sort of information will
you<00:03:06.150> see<00:03:06.390> you'll<00:03:07.230> actually<00:03:07.470> see<00:03:07.980> an<00:03:08.190> arrow

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
you see you'll actually see an arrow
