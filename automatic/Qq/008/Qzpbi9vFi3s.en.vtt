 a large jury will determine the 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.480
 winner of this first edition of 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.460

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.829
 lilou double world champion solo 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.270
 triple world champion we are you 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.899

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.600
 2 Algeria with Brazilian bboy 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.930
 know this sila it's called by boeing 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.390
 already to understand these good bboy b 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.980
 nice break and a boy a sport as much 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.050
 duck so for me I call it a 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.000
 cultural sport because it's before 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.230
 all dollars but it requires 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.390
 athletic skills 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.250
 so that's why the sports side 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.260
 it appears a lot today we're going 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.629
 to see the 16 best Algerians we have 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.890
 chosen yesterday we saw a crazy level and 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.939
 I think today it's going to be 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.939
 even worse 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.960
 to the point that I'm going to look 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.580
 today it's going to be the quality of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.470
 movement and especially his charisma his 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.440
 attitude because for me when 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.030
 is in battle as here in the bbc one 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.190
 50% these movements 50 for that it's 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.190
 the attitude of gua personalities 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.680
 and 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.680
 already we give the personality the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.659
 personality you have to know that every 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.030
 dancer to a personality that's when 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.560
 we dress as we speak we will judge 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.110
 to the musicality what she means to say to 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.720
 what follows the pace the originality is 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.210
 what he has his own style 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.380
 three just have the technique is already 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.600
 ready a lot of things 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.119
 moving the presence the game the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.920
 show because it's still sporty 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.869
 and cultural at the same time artistic 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.170
 rather and the dancers are here to 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.170
 to do the show 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.730

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.650
 baby boy compete in battle of five 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.340
 minutes so that in the end it will remain 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.340
 one 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.969
 the dancers ignites the room 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.590
 the tension rises in the end the decision 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.099
 juries are becoming more and more 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.099
