mode<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:04.250> still<00:05:04.550> you<00:05:05.480> notice<00:05:05.900> it<00:05:06.050> just

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
mode but still you notice it just

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.070 
mode but still you notice it just
because<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:08.150> black<00:05:08.330> bars<00:05:08.600> on<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.050> top

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
because the the black bars on the top

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.570 
because the the black bars on the top
and<00:05:09.350> bottom<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.710> screen<00:05:09.890> to<00:05:10.190> make<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.430> wide

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
and bottom of the screen to make it wide

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.340 
and bottom of the screen to make it wide
screen<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:11.060> disappears<00:05:11.570> like<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:11.960> takes<00:05:12.170> up

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
screen it disappears like it takes up

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.710 
screen it disappears like it takes up
the<00:05:12.440> whole<00:05:12.470> screen<00:05:12.860> so<00:05:13.580> i<00:05:13.910> personally<00:05:14.630> think

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
the whole screen so i personally think

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.330 
the whole screen so i personally think
it's<00:05:14.900> worth<00:05:15.050> it<00:05:15.170> and<00:05:15.350> to<00:05:15.620> top<00:05:15.740> things<00:05:15.920> off<00:05:16.070> it

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
it's worth it and to top things off it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.730 
it's worth it and to top things off it
was<00:05:16.490> filmed<00:05:16.790> in<00:05:17.000> imax<00:05:17.450> cameras<00:05:18.290> which<00:05:18.500> means

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
was filmed in imax cameras which means

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.550 
was filmed in imax cameras which means
the<00:05:18.920> resolution<00:05:19.520> of<00:05:19.670> the<00:05:20.090> picture<00:05:20.480> is<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:21.230> lot

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
the resolution of the picture is a lot

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.220 
the resolution of the picture is a lot
better<00:05:21.740> it<00:05:22.100> just<00:05:22.550> looks<00:05:22.880> more<00:05:23.300> clear<00:05:23.660> even

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
better it just looks more clear even

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.430 
better it just looks more clear even
blu-ray<00:05:24.890> looks<00:05:25.430> clear<00:05:25.730> but<00:05:26.030> it's<00:05:26.180> still<00:05:26.780> kind

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
blu-ray looks clear but it's still kind

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.350 
blu-ray looks clear but it's still kind
of<00:05:27.590> grainy<00:05:27.860> right<00:05:28.700> there's<00:05:28.910> a<00:05:28.970> little<00:05:29.120> bit<00:05:29.300> of

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
of grainy right there's a little bit of

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.200 
of grainy right there's a little bit of
grain<00:05:29.630> on<00:05:29.780> there<00:05:29.960> if<00:05:30.140> you<00:05:30.290> notice<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.860> but<00:05:31.490> the

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
grain on there if you notice it but the

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.600 
grain on there if you notice it but the
the<00:05:32.750> imax<00:05:33.170> sequences<00:05:33.710> are<00:05:33.830> just<00:05:34.070> crystal

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
the imax sequences are just crystal

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.460 
the imax sequences are just crystal
clear<00:05:34.880> so<00:05:35.180> i<00:05:35.390> personally<00:05:36.020> think<00:05:36.140> it's<00:05:36.320> worth

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
clear so i personally think it's worth

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.310 
clear so i personally think it's worth
it<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.860> is<00:05:37.100> a<00:05:37.130> u.s.<00:05:37.520> walmart<00:05:38.060> exclusive<00:05:38.300> so<00:05:39.230> if

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
it it is a u.s. walmart exclusive so if

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.810
