00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.580
 very good friends of youtube today we are going to 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.580
 make a new tutorial the only one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.320
 that is going to be about how to connect 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.170
 normal hearing aids like those that have 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.640
 the classic headphones to the playstation3 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:23.509
 perfect the only thing we will need is 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.020
 this rsa adapter this is the one from 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.509
 sound 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.570
 of normal background claudy may cost 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.379
 it is not easy to depend on where they live 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:38.300
 billion rupees and Indians and yen 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.739
 in 20 bolivars or two euros they are quite 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.470
 cheap and they're pretty easy to find 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.269
 the other is obviously for our 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.519
 console not only for playstation3 it serves 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.930
 for xbox 360 and today eye and the rsa in the 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.969
 Component cables that come to us 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.199
 all if you buy it second 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.110
 hand in the store you have to buy 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.300
 support because yes 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.020
 now we will leave you on how to connect them 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.630
 quite easy 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.790
 we make a video already connected from our 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.980
 rc to what we have to do is 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.980
 connect this in its proper color 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.450
 it's that easy 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.370
 then when we have our hearing aids 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.190
 cornets in which we have 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.550
 example in our case a hearing aid that 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.380
 we have quite the hand this 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.380
 typical bad hearing aids the jackpots 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.470
 anyone serves 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.310
 what now the step we would have to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.310
 do is 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.310
 3 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.520
 being in our playstation 3 what 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.690
 The only thing we have to do is go to 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.770
 settings is here sound settings that 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.250
 is at the end 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.250
 this same 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.220
 and we give a lot of audio if what 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.780
 you have not, they leave it like that and we go 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.450
 now to audio settings and outputs 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.799
 we go down to audio input connector 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.090
 multi card x 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.600
 and ready and now you will hear 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.060
 perfectly by our hearing aids with 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.060
