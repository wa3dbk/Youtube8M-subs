newest<00:02:43.470> one<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.890> think<00:02:44.280> also<00:02:44.760> oh<00:02:45.330> yeah<00:02:46.230> if<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:47.010> can

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
newest one I think also oh yeah if I can

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.500 
newest one I think also oh yeah if I can
hear<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.880> same<00:02:48.090> thing<00:02:48.270> as<00:02:48.390> before

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
hear it going the same thing as before

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.660 
hear it going the same thing as before
so<00:02:48.930> just<00:02:49.470> an<00:02:49.560> intro<00:02:49.860> boy<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.070> thought<00:02:50.340> none<00:02:50.580> of

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
so just an intro boy you thought none of

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.490 
so just an intro boy you thought none of
these<00:02:50.760> would<00:02:50.940> break<00:02:51.150> now<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.570> thought<00:02:51.930> -<00:02:52.290> would

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
these would break now I thought - would

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.800 
these would break now I thought - would
break<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.010> three<00:02:53.850> growth<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.480> it's<00:02:54.600> even

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
break and three growth so it's even

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.080 
break and three growth so it's even
worse<00:02:55.020> how<00:02:55.380> many<00:02:55.530> survived<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.430> 15-foot

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
worse how many survived the 15-foot

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.400 
worse how many survived the 15-foot
iPhone<00:02:57.540> drama<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.900> don't<00:02:57.930> know<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.200> got<00:02:58.290> to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
iPhone drama I don't know you got to

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.880 
iPhone drama I don't know you got to
watch<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.680> episode

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.880 

so<00:03:04.970> why<00:03:05.970> do<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.210> have<00:03:06.420> liquid<00:03:06.750> nitrogen<00:03:06.780> air<00:03:07.230> we

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
so why do we have liquid nitrogen air we

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.490 
so why do we have liquid nitrogen air we
anticipated<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.090> s5<00:03:09.660> would<00:03:10.140> make<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.410> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
anticipated that the s5 would make it to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.630 
anticipated that the s5 would make it to
the<00:03:10.590> final<00:03:10.980> test

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
the final test

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.730 
the final test
just<00:03:11.850> water<00:03:12.030> proof<00:03:12.360> s5<00:03:13.170> got<00:03:13.410> knocked<00:03:13.590> out

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
just water proof s5 got knocked out

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.890 
just water proof s5 got knocked out
second<00:03:14.310> round<00:03:14.490> so<00:03:14.940> now<00:03:15.210> our<00:03:15.240> older

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
second round so now our older

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.770 
second round so now our older
non-waterproof<00:03:16.770> galaxy's<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.940> mean<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.630> got

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
non-waterproof galaxy's I mean we got

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.100 
non-waterproof galaxy's I mean we got
the<00:03:18.810> liquid<00:03:19.110> nitrogen<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.530> let's<00:03:20.280> do<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.550> roll
