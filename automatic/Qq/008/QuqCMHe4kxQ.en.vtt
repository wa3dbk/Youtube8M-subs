he stands on the dark side this rock he

feels the earth Kilauea no his feet and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.900 
feels the earth Kilauea no his feet and
he<00:02:23.660> sees<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.290> silver<00:02:24.680> arch<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.340> as<00:02:25.430> his<00:02:25.610> mind

he sees the silver arch and as his mind

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.690 
he sees the silver arch and as his mind
turns<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.480> earth<00:02:26.690> invisible<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.740> arch<00:02:27.950> forms

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
turns the earth invisible the arch forms

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.540 
turns the earth invisible the arch forms
a<00:02:28.820> halo<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.990> he<00:02:30.140> feels<00:02:30.410> himself<00:02:30.650> within<00:02:31.430> the

a halo and he feels himself within the

disk of the Milky Way a trillion stars
or<00:02:34.520> so<00:02:34.700> he<00:02:35.390> sees<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.810> local<00:02:36.170> nebula<00:02:36.590> barely
