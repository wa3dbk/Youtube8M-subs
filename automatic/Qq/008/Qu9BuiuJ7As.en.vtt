if some characters only had a few legs
for<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> whole<00:03:24.700> movie<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.359> really<00:03:25.660> felt

like<00:03:25.930> there<00:03:26.109> were<00:03:26.200> all<00:03:26.349> very<00:03:26.680> important

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
like there were all very important

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.009 
like there were all very important
pieces<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.849> family<00:03:28.269> if<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.690> were<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.900> go

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
pieces to the family if I were to go

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.110 
pieces to the family if I were to go
into<00:03:29.200> every<00:03:29.500> single<00:03:30.160> important<00:03:30.700> character

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
into every single important character

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.789 
into every single important character
then<00:03:31.269> this<00:03:31.420> review<00:03:31.840> would<00:03:31.930> go<00:03:32.109> on<00:03:32.260> for<00:03:32.500> way<00:03:32.739> too

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
then this review would go on for way too

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.680 
then this review would go on for way too
long<00:03:33.069> so<00:03:33.819> I'll<00:03:34.060> go<00:03:34.180> into<00:03:34.359> some<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.599> the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
long so I'll go into some of the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.940 
long so I'll go into some of the
characters<00:03:35.109> that<00:03:35.139> I<00:03:35.260> felt<00:03:35.620> were<00:03:35.769> most

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
characters that I felt were most

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.979 
characters that I felt were most
important<00:03:36.639> starting<00:03:37.209> with<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.450> grandmother

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
important starting with the grandmother

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.770 
important starting with the grandmother

there<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.130> could<00:03:54.609> say<00:03:54.849> Kazuma<00:03:55.389> akazawa<00:03:55.840> was

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
there you could say Kazuma akazawa was

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:57.960 
there you could say Kazuma akazawa was
more<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.560> main<00:03:56.739> character<00:03:56.980> than<00:03:57.370> her<00:03:57.459> actual

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
main character he definitely has more of

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.559 
main character he definitely has more of
an<00:03:59.829> important<00:04:00.489> rule<00:04:00.700> than<00:04:00.940> Kenji

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
an important rule than Kenji

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.849

characters<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.639> go<00:04:27.789> through<00:04:28.060> so<00:04:28.479> just<00:04:28.510> take<00:04:28.930> my

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
characters to go through so just take my

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.580

word

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
word

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.529 
word
pretty<00:04:30.280> much<00:04:30.430> every<00:04:30.940> character<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.449> the

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
pretty much every character in the

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.450 
pretty much every character in the
family<00:04:31.930> is<00:04:32.080> very<00:04:32.110> well<00:04:32.650> written<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.130> all<00:04:33.310> the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
family is very well written and all the

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.370 
family is very well written and all the
character<00:04:33.820> designs<00:04:34.150> are<00:04:34.360> very<00:04:34.389> unique<00:04:34.930> they

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
character designs are very unique they

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.020 
character designs are very unique they
obviously<00:04:35.500> spent<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.070> lot<00:04:36.280> of<00:04:36.310> time<00:04:36.610> making<00:04:36.789> the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
obviously spent a lot of time making the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.820 
obviously spent a lot of time making the
family<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.389> main<00:04:37.750> focus<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.470> turned<00:04:38.680> out

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
family a main focus and it turned out

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.440 
family a main focus and it turned out
brilliantly<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.940> characters<00:04:40.330> are

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
brilliantly the characters are

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.330 
brilliantly the characters are
definitely<00:04:40.810> one<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.200> best<00:04:41.440> attributes<00:04:41.770> to

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
definitely one of the best attributes to

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.159 
definitely one of the best attributes to
summer<00:04:42.550> Wars

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.600 

so<00:04:47.169> I'm<00:04:47.319> going<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.620> divide<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.100> animation

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
so I'm going to divide the animation

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.850 
so I'm going to divide the animation
into<00:04:48.880> two<00:04:49.090> different<00:04:49.360> sections<00:04:49.780> one<00:04:50.590> for<00:04:50.620> the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
into two different sections one for the

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.740 
into two different sections one for the
real<00:04:51.039> world<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.520> one<00:04:51.819> for<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.090> world<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.509> odds

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
real world and one for the world of odds

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.420 
real world and one for the world of odds
the<00:04:53.319> arch<00:04:53.500> stunts<00:04:53.770> were<00:04:53.889> both<00:04:54.039> are<00:04:54.250> completely

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
the arch stunts were both are completely

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.490 
the arch stunts were both are completely
different<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.569> it<00:04:55.660> would<00:04:55.750> be<00:04:55.870> stupid<00:04:56.139> to<00:04:56.289> put

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500
