 young dunes and nothing but half 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.910
 the sixth morning the beer left the winner 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.040
 the last stage of francisco lopez 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.870
 the depre series has gone to the heels of the track and 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.150
 Chileans very soon sat on the tail 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.780
 Well, closer to the middle of the distance the company 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.209
 the frenchman made the bar up to the side 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.950
 better to crawl in the demon better to get around the dune 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.350
 but the decision of the racers about this 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.030
 diverged in the end ahead turned out 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.520
 the most experienced too 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.319
 zealous lost precious time disk 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.330

 Three minutes mat fish 3 Cyril yes pro 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.120
 today arranged a place in the top ten 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.120
 federal standings have changed dramatically 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.230
 from his third starting position mark 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.629

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.910
 yesterday's leaders plastic water and he 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.900
 Argentinean dunes here native to him 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.940
 clothes are strangers and they are for the house itself 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.979
 this is a local couple first kilometer per 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.229

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.410
 a workshop and chileans to salt 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.120
 let's see how it will be first chili and all 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.040

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.040
 the sand is doing well 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.470
 how motivated are these ambitions 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.150
 show time show race results 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.610

 spit flax almost 9 there from mafia 2 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.550
 couriers did not get the general credit 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.550

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.630
 huge dune at 75 except for 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.520
 high-speed section become stone 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.510
 stumbling blocks for many bikers 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.370
 puzzled 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.130
 and submit with other race categories 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.410
 including Carlos Sainz the Spaniard 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.480
 lost a move here as well and his 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.850
 partner polina sir pancakes i 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.280
 the middle of the top of the race led by the ladies 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.850
 trances will be the closest pursuit 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.570
 turned up 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.530

 Stefan Peter antenna during 2:35 and 38 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.580
 conscience seconds lost on top about 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.610
 20 minutes for them to look at and 5 with the base 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.610
 1 to the team in nine and a half minutes 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.360
 on the eve of last year's winner of Dakar 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.919
 Zherar de Roi did not get carried away 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.410
 tactical games and immediately rushed to 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.000
 hell for 13 kilometers was hardly possible 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.190
 seriously break away from partners 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.270
 team i rivals however century leaders 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.270
 did not linger 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.390
 his teammate han staci got 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:21.500
 in an accident on the wheels of a truck set for 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.300
 25 minutes but time was lost but by 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.130
 yesterday's backlog in price 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.170
 Nikolaev stacy of others is so much 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.330
 miserable by the standards of a super marathon and 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.100
 class racing heavyweight that i don't 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.230
 worth the discussion in this sense was important 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.230
 unless the order of start for today 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.000
 on a valuable speed plot 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.770
 I need to come to check in 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.830
 a high-speed section of the song 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.530
 long and sing it better with a conductor better 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.620
 stop them running our team so 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.300
 that he and the wand as they say in hand 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.620
 I have no doubt that KAMAZ has its own 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.840
 strategy for all eight and a half 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.300
 thousand kilometers there and tactics on 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.810
 every single day and that's how he is 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.040
 evolved for our crews today 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.140
 Nikolaev well race in third position 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.600
 need to understand the line of sight were 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.720
 leaders but closer to the finish 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.280
 edward lost about 20 minutes shorter 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.650
 today he is 5 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.450
 unfortunately andrew karginov at last 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.150
 Information confronted with technical 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:22.290
 problems let the clutch mend 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:25.730
 not yet succeed and victory ahead of the dunes 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:28.280
 did we again have a hero 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:32.510
 Edward Nikolaev is now in fifth position 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.510
 airat mardeev 9 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.139
 right 

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.830
 we drove up 

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:50.380
 small through bosphorus all 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.710
 by the way you look like on camera 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.890
 of life 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.890
