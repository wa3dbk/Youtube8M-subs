00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
be a good idea for you to wear the
contacts<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.530> even<00:02:05.009> though<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.460> have

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
contacts because even though you do have

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.419 
contacts because even though you do have
seen<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.630> scene<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> water<00:02:08.069> rolling

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
seen the scene but the water rolling

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
seen the scene but the water rolling
down<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.879> your<00:02:09.030> face<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.539> maybe<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:09.959> odds

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
down in your face and maybe in your odds

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.490 
down in your face and maybe in your odds
may<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.860> little<00:02:11.069> irritating<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.930> those<00:02:13.260> are

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
may be a little irritating but those are

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.880 
may be a little irritating but those are
minor<00:02:13.709> discomforts<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.879> as<00:02:15.569> i<00:02:15.810> said<00:02:15.870> i<00:02:16.500> would

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
minor discomforts and as i said i would

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.880 
minor discomforts and as i said i would
definitely<00:02:17.489> on<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.480> scale<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.780> one<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.440> ten

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
definitely on the scale of one to ten

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.979 
definitely on the scale of one to ten
rate<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.790> would<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.540> give<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.870> at

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
rate this I would have to give it at

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.530 
rate this I would have to give it at
least<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.290> nine<00:02:22.530> right<00:02:22.920> now<00:02:22.950> because<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:24.000> is

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
least a nine right now because this is

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.410 
least a nine right now because this is
really<00:02:24.750> my<00:02:25.050> first<00:02:25.260> time<00:02:25.530> using<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.610> see

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
really my first time using it but I see

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.250 
really my first time using it but I see
it<00:02:27.450> being<00:02:27.750> as<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> positive<00:02:28.379> 10<00:02:28.980> because<00:02:30.260> it's

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
it being as a positive 10 because it's

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.259 
it being as a positive 10 because it's
you<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:31.890> putting<00:02:32.340> five<00:02:32.670> times<00:02:33.000> more

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
you know putting five times more

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.270 
you know putting five times more
moisture<00:02:33.720> back<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.019> my<00:02:34.170> hair<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.040> can

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
moisture back in my hair that you can

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.030 
moisture back in my hair that you can
hear<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.879> stopped<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:37.080> I'm<00:02:37.769> going<00:02:37.830> to
