 cuts and keep sports statistics 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.039
 tracker equipped with a simple LED 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.789
 screen which should save charge 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.399
 battery 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.750
 besides on one of the faces of the case 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.610
 can see additional 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.869
 LED strip which will 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.689
 shine in different colors depending 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.849
 on the intensity of training can 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.480
 assume the enclosure is protected from 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:13.190
 water ingress 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.900
 scientists have long been working on an alternative 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.640
 familiar to us flat screen 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.769
 stereoscopic technology 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.950
 images of course gives these depths 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.630
 pictures but in essence itâ€™s just an illusion 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.160
 small team of japanese scientists 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.959
 demonstrated peculiar 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.959
 three-dimensional display based on 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.360
 acoustic levitation technology given 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.549
 a device called pixie dust is capable 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.670
 keep particles in the air creating 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.139
 them given three-dimensional image 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.030
 the distance between the particles is not 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.650
 less than four millimeters and accuracy 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.410
 positioning reaches half 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.239
 millimeter worth noting that role 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.510
 pixels can play not only solid 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.769
 objects but also droplets of liquid 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.340
 modified version of pixie dust 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.799
 scientists intend to show in August on 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.750
 India's go-go site successfully passes 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.569
 to raise funds for the serial production of the product 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.069
 under the name easy cube and Victory can 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.389
 characterize as a prefix 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.280
 connected to the TV and 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.720
 providing synchronization and 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.920
 play a variety 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.480
 multimedia materials 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.190
 feature multimedia 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.720
 the hub is open 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.239
 modular architecture allowing 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.010
 increase functionality interesting 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.500
 modularity design 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.329
 individual modules are stacked and 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.000
 interconnected without cables 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.950
 directly connectors main 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.859
 the task of this storage organization module 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.269
 and sharing of materials 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.370
 downloadable from mobile devices then 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.959
 there is essentially this miniature computer in 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.970
 universal player roles 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.859
 able not only to demonstrate 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.019
 photos and videos on TV but 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.240
 also organize streaming in 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.290
 device address with ios or 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.340
 its back as windows or mac with 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.020
 connecting additional modules 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.090
 can increase disk space 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.120
 or add to the optical configuration 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.770
 blu-ray drive 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.690
 the presence of a built-in emulator allows 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.260
 run games for nintendo sega game 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.590
 boy 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.450
 if you manage to collect more than 125 thousand 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.730
 dollars the developer intends to release 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.650
 easy game module providing 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.270
 possibility of using cartridges for 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.640
 nintendo and sega gaming consoles in this 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.730
 year of the legendary game Tetris turned 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.660
 30 years on his own noted round date 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.180

 Tetris T-shirt 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.150
 built on a microcontroller which 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.800
 controls the screen on 128 LEDs 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.600
 after losing the game running line 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.580
 show the level to which it was possible 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.380
 Reach the player and the number of dialed

 june 1984 the day when the game 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.180
 invented by a soviet programmer 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.140
 Alexey pazhitnovym was the first 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.730
 represented to the public on this all
