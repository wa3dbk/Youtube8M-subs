legally<00:04:47.439> in<00:04:47.590> China<00:04:47.919> now<00:04:48.189> so<00:04:48.879> what's<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.300> point

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
legally in China now so what's the point

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.499

of<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:49.960> Wii<00:04:50.229> I<00:04:50.590> could<00:04:51.039> see<00:04:51.310> if<00:04:51.580> game<00:04:51.909> consoles

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
of the Wii I could see if game consoles

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.689 
of the Wii I could see if game consoles
were<00:04:52.659> still<00:04:52.960> illegal<00:04:53.349> in<00:04:53.650> China<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:54.310> you

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
were still illegal in China and you

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.339 
were still illegal in China and you
couldn't<00:04:55.029> get<00:04:55.210> one<00:04:55.389> there<00:04:55.539> okay<00:04:55.689> so<00:04:55.900> people

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
couldn't get one there okay so people

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.170 
couldn't get one there okay so people
would<00:04:56.469> want<00:04:56.710> this<00:04:56.860> knockoff<00:04:57.370> because<00:04:57.759> it

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
would want this knockoff because it

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.510 
would want this knockoff because it
looks<00:04:58.449> like<00:04:58.629> a<00:04:58.659> PlayStation<00:04:59.439> 4<00:04:59.710> and<00:05:00.039> they

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
looks like a PlayStation 4 and they

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.730 
looks like a PlayStation 4 and they
could<00:05:00.699> have<00:05:00.879> their<00:05:01.120> own<00:05:01.180> kind<00:05:01.900> of<00:05:02.050> PlayStation

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
could have their own kind of PlayStation

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.700 
could have their own kind of PlayStation
4<00:05:03.009> in<00:05:03.129> their<00:05:03.279> home<00:05:03.520> but<00:05:04.330> there's<00:05:04.990> no<00:05:05.199> purpose

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
4 in their home but there's no purpose

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.830 
4 in their home but there's no purpose
to<00:05:05.740> this<00:05:06.069> it<00:05:06.729> just<00:05:06.789> doesn't<00:05:07.300> make<00:05:07.479> any<00:05:07.539> sense

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
to this it just doesn't make any sense

to<00:05:08.379> make<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.860> know<00:05:09.400> I<00:05:09.550> mean<00:05:09.849> I'm<00:05:10.090> sure<00:05:10.150> it's

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
to make I know I mean I'm sure it's

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.390 
to make I know I mean I'm sure it's
going<00:05:10.659> to<00:05:10.719> be<00:05:10.900> a<00:05:10.930> lot<00:05:11.229> cheaper<00:05:11.590> than<00:05:12.009> a

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
going to be a lot cheaper than a

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.899 
going to be a lot cheaper than a
PlayStation<00:05:13.180> 4<00:05:13.419> Xbox<00:05:13.449> one<00:05:14.289> but<00:05:15.099> it's<00:05:15.580> just

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
PlayStation 4 Xbox one but it's just

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.629 
PlayStation 4 Xbox one but it's just
another<00:05:16.599> Android<00:05:17.229> game<00:05:17.590> console<00:05:18.279> man<00:05:18.460> we

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
another Android game console man we

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.760 
another Android game console man we
don't<00:05:18.879> there's<00:05:19.330> so<00:05:19.629> many<00:05:19.870> of<00:05:20.139> those<00:05:20.289> it's<00:05:20.560> just

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
don't there's so many of those it's just

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.740 
don't there's so many of those it's just
they<00:05:21.159> need<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.550> stop<00:05:21.789> making<00:05:22.210> more<00:05:22.449> of<00:05:22.599> them

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
they need to stop making more of them

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.379 
they need to stop making more of them
they're<00:05:22.990> all<00:05:23.099> redundant<00:05:24.099> to<00:05:24.250> begin<00:05:24.639> with<00:05:24.849> we

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
they're all redundant to begin with we

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.480 
they're all redundant to begin with we
really<00:05:25.779> need<00:05:25.990> another<00:05:26.289> one<00:05:26.499> and<00:05:26.770> just<00:05:26.800> because

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
really need another one and just because

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.610 
really need another one and just because
it's<00:05:27.639> shaped<00:05:27.909> like<00:05:28.029> a<00:05:28.120> PlayStation<00:05:28.810> 4<00:05:29.080> this

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620

it's shaped like a PlayStation 4 this
company<00:05:30.129> seems<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.550> think<00:05:30.699> it's<00:05:30.879> necessary<00:05:31.509> I

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
company seems to think it's necessary I

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.170 
company seems to think it's necessary I
don't<00:05:32.620> know<00:05:32.800> I<00:05:32.830> just<00:05:33.069> if<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.819> know<00:05:34.120> you

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
don't know I just if you know you

China<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.509> would<00:05:37.900> understand<00:05:38.409> a<00:05:38.560> little<00:05:38.770> bit

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
China I would understand a little bit

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:39.959 
China I would understand a little bit
because<00:05:39.099> they're<00:05:39.250> trying<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.520> make<00:05:39.610> money<00:05:39.819> off

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
because they're trying to make money off

because they're trying to make money off
how<00:05:40.240> it<00:05:40.389> looks<00:05:40.599> but<00:05:41.259> this<00:05:41.409> is<00:05:41.620> just<00:05:41.889> really<00:05:42.219> a

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
how it looks but this is just really a

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.089 
how it looks but this is just really a
stupid<00:05:43.060> pointless<00:05:43.659> product<00:05:44.439> that<00:05:44.589> is<00:05:44.740> not

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
stupid pointless product that is not

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.920 
stupid pointless product that is not
going<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.399> sell<00:05:45.610> well<00:05:45.819> I<00:05:46.000> mean<00:05:46.240> I<00:05:46.300> guess<00:05:46.689> I

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
going to sell well I mean I guess I

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.510 
going to sell well I mean I guess I
could<00:05:47.110> see<00:05:47.349> if<00:05:47.500> you<00:05:47.529> know<00:05:47.830> there's<00:05:48.039> a<00:05:48.099> Chinese
