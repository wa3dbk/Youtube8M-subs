it<00:01:54.110> was<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.469> was<00:01:54.649> invaluable<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.549> know

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
it was it was invaluable you know

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:58.179 
it was it was invaluable you know
building<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.990> fire<00:01:57.259> in<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:57.530> north<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.920> not<00:01:58.069> an

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
building a fire in the north is not an

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.410 
building a fire in the north is not an

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
easy thing to do

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.300 
easy thing to do

those are the whole nightmares yeah and
after<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:11.299> build<00:02:11.540> up<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.810> fairly

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
after you do build up a fairly

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.530
