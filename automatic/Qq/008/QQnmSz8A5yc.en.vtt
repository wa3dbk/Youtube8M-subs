hi my name is Emma Holland head of the
class<00:00:13.139> very<00:00:13.410> much<00:00:13.530> up<00:00:13.740> here<00:00:13.769> at<00:00:14.299> chemistry

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
class very much up here at chemistry

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.160 
class very much up here at chemistry
department<00:00:15.780> at<00:00:16.130> Southampton<00:00:17.130> University<00:00:17.460> and

department at Southampton University and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
department at Southampton University and
we<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.740> lot<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.220> scientific<00:00:20.609> glassware<00:00:21.180> of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
we do a lot of scientific glassware of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.590 
we do a lot of scientific glassware of
which<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:22.350> not<00:00:22.769> commercially<00:00:23.250> available<00:00:23.600> for

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
which is not commercially available for

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.080 
which is not commercially available for
the<00:00:25.439> chemistry<00:00:25.859> department<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.550> many<00:00:26.910> other

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the chemistry department have many other

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.269 
the chemistry department have many other
departments<00:00:27.570> around<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> university<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.639 

this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> large<00:00:33.360> coil<00:00:33.780> condenser<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.500> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
this is a large coil condenser as you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.240 
this is a large coil condenser as you
can<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:34.980> you've<00:00:35.219> got<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:36.110> coil<00:00:37.110> inside<00:00:37.950> another

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
can see you've got a coil inside another

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.690 
can see you've got a coil inside another
coil<00:00:38.690> so<00:00:39.690> obviously<00:00:39.960> quite<00:00:40.140> tricky<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
coil so obviously quite tricky to do and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.869 
coil so obviously quite tricky to do and
all<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> attachments<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> bottom<00:00:43.879> this

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
all the attachments at the bottom this

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.540 
all the attachments at the bottom this
is<00:00:45.090> our<00:00:45.350> largest<00:00:46.350> lathe<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.070> talked<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> see

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
is our largest lathe that talked to see

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.000 
is our largest lathe that talked to see
the<00:00:47.640> use<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.450> large<00:00:48.660> scale<00:00:49.020> jobs

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the use for all the large scale jobs

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.000 
the use for all the large scale jobs
that<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.989> large<00:00:51.989> diameter<00:00:52.530> tubing<00:00:52.739> up

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that we do and large diameter tubing up

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.090 
that we do and large diameter tubing up
to<00:00:53.039> about<00:00:53.340> 150<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.789> some<00:00:57.570> sort<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
to about 150 and this is some sort of

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.439 
to about 150 and this is some sort of
double<00:00:59.100> condenser<00:00:59.789> which<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.030> don't<00:01:00.210> actually

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
double condenser which I don't actually

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.520 
double condenser which I don't actually
know<00:01:01.100> what<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.250> does<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.149> but

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
know what it does or what it's for but

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.780 
know what it does or what it's for but
if<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.860> draw<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.339> bring<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> us

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
if you can draw it and bring it to us

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.620 
if you can draw it and bring it to us
then<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.720> make<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> our<00:01:09.560> branders

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
then we can make it this is our branders

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
then we can make it this is our branders
drill<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.720> also<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.799> obviously<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
drill and also we can do obviously the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.130 
drill and also we can do obviously the

this cell is designed to have a sample

this cell is designed to have a sample

introduced through this port here bottom

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.400 
introduced through this port here bottom
then<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.940> sample<00:03:04.330> is<00:03:04.450> brought<00:03:04.690> up<00:03:04.990> through

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
then the sample is brought up through

this optical window the cell has double

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.490 
this optical window the cell has double
walls<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.600> that<00:03:13.630> we<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.080> control<00:03:14.380> the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
walls so that we can control the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.750 
walls so that we can control the
temperature<00:03:15.300> inside<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.360> solution<00:03:17.110> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
temperature inside the solution and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.490 
temperature inside the solution and
external<00:03:18.760> ports<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.450> be<00:03:19.600> able<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.870> bubble<00:03:20.260> gas

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
external ports to be able to bubble gas

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.520 
external ports to be able to bubble gas
in<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.459> solution<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:22.150> all<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.810> solution<00:03:23.380> so

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
in the solution of all the solution so

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.550 
in the solution of all the solution so
as<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.800> create<00:03:23.950> one<00:03:24.400> here<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.850> oxygen

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
as to create one here to oxygen

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.870 
as to create one here to oxygen
we've<00:03:27.560> got<00:03:27.890> additional

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.510 

orders<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:32.120> put<00:03:32.300> electrons<00:03:33.260> here<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.830> then<00:03:34.400> of

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
orders to put electrons here and then of

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:46.140 
orders to put electrons here and then of
course<00:03:34.550> we<00:03:35.240> have<00:03:35.570> moles<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:37.450> circulate<00:03:38.740> water

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.550 

so<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:49.510> work<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.630> art<00:03:50.810> as<00:03:51.080> far<00:03:51.320> as

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
so this is a work of art as far as

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.400 
so this is a work of art as far as
glassblowing<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.460> concerned<00:03:52.970> because<00:03:53.410> being

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
glassblowing is concerned because being

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.930 
glassblowing is concerned because being
able<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:55.010> construct<00:03:55.850> these<00:03:56.620> many<00:03:57.620> many<00:03:58.370> ports

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
able to construct these many many ports

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:13.230 
able to construct these many many ports
through<00:03:59.330> a<00:03:59.630> mobile<00:04:00.050> jacket<00:04:01.990> really
