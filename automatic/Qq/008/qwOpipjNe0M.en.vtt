00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Good day to all with you Oleg in 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.280
 This video I will tell you about the bearings 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.980
 and balls used by wheels 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.710
 bike how many of them and what 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.350
 diameter I was on the market and bought different 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.310
 bearings black bearings this for 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.070
 carriages 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.070
 the rest are all for bicycle wheels 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.429
 here is the camp 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.710
 Happy seven balls define them 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.800
 as follows in overseas 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.780
 manufacturers balls diameter 630 5 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.750
 seven millimeters in a bearing 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.420
 bulk 9 pieces 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.110
 if you look at the wheel if you have 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.480
 the good 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.520
 expensive sleeve or at least she 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.320
 looks fine in this case 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.250
 fastest you will have balls 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 diameter 630 5 millimeters in Soviet 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.870
 options are balls diameter 6 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 millimeters in bulk 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.540
 there are 10 of them maybe 9 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.949
 I will not argue I met them only 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.580
 on 10 pieces 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.550
 in bulk in Soviet and foreign 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.720
 options are balls with a diameter 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.030
 476 millimeters of us and drank them 10 pieces in 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.830
 bearing them 6 pieces such balls 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.250
 mounted in the front wheel 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.250
 bicycle 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.580
 and now about the bearings in my hands 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.610
 three kinds of 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.290
 f 1 more bearing separator 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.560
 carriage bearings 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.780
 they have balls with a diameter of 630 5 millimeters 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.910
 they can be used for the wheel 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.670
 Bike here is a troop for a carriage 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.250
 the next bearing can have balls 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.520
 diameter of 6 millimeters can also 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.300
 have 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.040
 balls with a diameter of 630 5 millimeters of them 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.270
 very easy to confuse the last 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.550
 bearings have balls with a diameter of 4, 76 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.280
 millimeters visually balls 6 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.520
 millimeters and 635 millimeters very 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.679
 it looks like you can have a diameter of balls 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.380
 learn only by measuring 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.780
 but if you do not even have a home 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.110
 calliper then there is one way 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.180
 how to find out what is your ball diameter 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.270
 let's say you went to the market and bought 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.140
 bearings with balls 6 35 millimeters 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.140
 and took 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.060
 the ball is another one of their bike them 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.540
 need to put side by side on a flat 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.370
 surface top attach another one 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.070
 even thing in this case I 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.550
 used ruler as you can see if one 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.980
 ball 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.790
 less and the second more then you 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 will turn out 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.640
 that the line is on and left 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.010
 sides there will be a big gap between 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.050
 let's say ruler and chair like mine 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.870
 the right side of the lumen is practically not 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.810
 will it mean that next to two costs 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.910
 balls of different diameters but if the ruler 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.390
 will stand exactly mean you 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.280
 balls of 2 identical diameters now i 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.500
 put it hard and see for yourself what 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.140
 one ball is more visible 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.430
 in this way you can determine which 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.269
 balls are you who are familiar with 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.230
 a caliper that can look 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.850
 which measurements did balls 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.450
 caliper I measured the first ball 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.910
 which was 6 millimeters in size 4 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.980
 dozens see for yourself on calipers 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.850
 Something compass collected a little ball 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.000
 should be 635 mm 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.000
 ram 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.780
 the next ball that I measured and 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.780
 the world is exactly 6 millimeters 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.580
 the third ball that burned has a size 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.780
 4 millimeters and 8 dozen but in reality 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.390
 the ball should be 476 millimeters I can 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.120
 learn to take advantage of what england 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.100
 compass if you're interested in order 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.040
 to find out how many balls 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.530
 worth you you just need them 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.250
 set them to count more balls 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.889
 will not fit balls with a diameter of 630 5 and 6 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.040
 millimeters confused they will not need 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.720
 heavily wear out raceway 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.450
 balls on the sleeve 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.970
 and on a radius or a cone I was asked 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.419
 the question is what better to use bearings 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.320
 with a separator in which there are seven 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.220
 balls or 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.229
 loose balls where they were 9 or 10 here 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.860
 it's very easy to use 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.270
 balloons 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.850
 loose why because balls loose 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.200
 able to withstand about 25-30 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.810
 percent 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.570
 stronger blow that is you call in 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.690
 curb or jump from curbs just 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.610
 bulk balls will withstand a stronger blow than 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.919
 balls in the cage us bearings 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.190
 that is, if you strike the sleeve will stand 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:17.630
 bounce if you have balls 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.850
 bulk nanocad it does not affect 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.800
 Thank you all for your attention to someone video 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.950
 like it like subscribe
