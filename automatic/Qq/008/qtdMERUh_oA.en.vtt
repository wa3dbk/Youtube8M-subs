hi<00:00:01.230> I'm<00:00:01.440> fiddler<00:00:01.800> man<00:00:01.980> and<00:00:02.190> I'm<00:00:02.280> here<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.580> talk

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:02.729 
hi I'm fiddler man and I'm here to talk

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:05.660 
hi I'm fiddler man and I'm here to talk
to<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.030> about<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.840> IX<00:00:04.350> strings<00:00:05.130> made<00:00:05.490> by

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
to you about is IX strings made by

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.910 
to you about is IX strings made by
daddario<00:00:06.180> now<00:00:06.630> I've<00:00:06.870> been<00:00:07.170> experimenting<00:00:07.680> a

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
daddario now I've been experimenting a

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.770 
daddario now I've been experimenting a
lot<00:00:08.069> with<00:00:08.130> strings<00:00:08.759> because<00:00:08.969> I<00:00:09.330> want<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.690> be

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
lot with strings because I want to be

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.480 
lot with strings because I want to be
able<00:00:09.839> to<00:00:09.959> give<00:00:10.080> better<00:00:10.349> advice<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.070> members

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
able to give better advice to my members

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.489 
able to give better advice to my members
on<00:00:11.610> fiddler<00:00:11.820> mancom<00:00:12.539> there's<00:00:12.959> so<00:00:13.230> many

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:13.499 
on fiddler mancom there's so many

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.890 
on fiddler mancom there's so many
discussions<00:00:14.280> going<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:14.759> which<00:00:15.599> type<00:00:15.869> of

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
discussions going on about which type of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.470 
discussions going on about which type of
strings<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.379> use<00:00:16.650> now<00:00:17.340> basically<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.300> have

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
strings to use now basically you have

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.300 
strings to use now basically you have
three<00:00:19.019> types<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.470> strings<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:19.980> your

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
three types of strings you have your

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.939 
three types of strings you have your
steel<00:00:20.880> core<00:00:21.269> strings<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.140> then<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.740> have

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
steel core strings and then you have

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.519 
steel core strings and then you have
your<00:00:23.279> synthetic<00:00:24.269> core<00:00:24.509> strings<00:00:24.900> made<00:00:25.230> out<00:00:25.410> of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
your synthetic core strings made out of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.950 
your synthetic core strings made out of
composite<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.519> plastic<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.300> forth<00:00:27.720> pearl

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
composite and plastic and so forth pearl

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.620 
composite and plastic and so forth pearl
on<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.349> then<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.859> your<00:00:29.160> steel<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:30.119> gut

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
on and then you have your steel your gut

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.049 
on and then you have your steel your gut
strings<00:00:30.990> gut<00:00:31.259> core<00:00:31.529> strings<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:32.160> gut<00:00:32.759> core

the<00:00:39.989> gut<00:00:40.289> strings<00:00:40.829> sound<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:42.030> they<00:00:42.660> don't

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the gut strings sound but they don't

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.470 
the gut strings sound but they don't
have<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> disadvantages<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.579> gut<00:00:45.120> like

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
have the disadvantages of gut like

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.920 
have the disadvantages of gut like
playing<00:00:45.960> time<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.480> deterioration<00:00:48.480> with

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
playing time and deterioration with

playing time and deterioration with
overtime<00:00:49.859> as<00:00:50.100> quickly<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:51.000> gut<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.420> they

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
overtime as quickly as with gut and they

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.840 
overtime as quickly as with gut and they
actually<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.260> more<00:00:52.440> power<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> may<00:00:53.789> be

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
actually have more power now the may be

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.119 
actually have more power now the may be
the<00:00:53.910> most<00:00:54.239> power<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.109> of<00:00:55.230> steel<00:00:55.800> core

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the most power you get out of steel core

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.939 
the most power you get out of steel core
strings<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:57.510> steel<00:00:58.109> core<00:00:58.410> strings<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
strings but steel core strings have a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.310 
strings but steel core strings have a
slightly<00:00:59.670> metallic<00:00:59.910> sound<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.079> could<00:01:01.230> be

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
slightly metallic sound that could be

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.889 
slightly metallic sound that could be
good<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.980> some<00:01:02.190> types<00:01:02.519> of<00:01:02.699> music<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.449> not

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
good with some types of music but not

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
good with some types of music but not
everything<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.009> get<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> something<00:01:05.729> in

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
everything if you get a something in

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.109 
everything if you get a something in
between<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.509> purl<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.950> zai<00:01:08.580> X<00:01:08.790> as

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
between you get a purl on or a zai X as

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.969 
between you get a purl on or a zai X as
I'm<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.600> talk<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I'm going to talk about now then you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
I'm going to talk about now then you
have<00:01:11.130> something<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.580> gives<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
have something that gives you that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.690 
have something that gives you that
strength<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.950> almost<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
strength that you almost get with a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.200 
strength that you almost get with a
steel<00:01:14.970> string<00:01:15.330> without<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.290> whiney<00:01:17.210> metallic

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
steel string without the whiney metallic

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.660 
steel string without the whiney metallic
sound<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.689> also<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:20.040> steel<00:01:20.400> strings

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
sound and also with steel strings

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.490 
sound and also with steel strings
they're<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.119> stiff<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.290> this

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
they're so stiff they don't have this

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770 
they're so stiff they don't have this
dis<00:01:23.009> flexibility<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.180> play<00:01:24.390> really

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
dis flexibility so if you play really

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
dis flexibility so if you play really
hard<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> lower<00:01:25.409> strings<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.280> actually

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
hard on the lower strings you actually

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
hard on the lower strings you actually
it's<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.210> tuning<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> string<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.350> while

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it's like tuning the string up while

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.289 
it's like tuning the string up while
you're<00:01:28.770> pressing<00:01:29.250> hard<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.790> boat<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you're pressing hard with that boat and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
you're pressing hard with that boat and
you<00:01:30.390> actually<00:01:30.509> bring<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> intonation<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.649> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you actually bring the intonation up so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
you actually bring the intonation up so
it's<00:01:31.920> harder<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> play<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.579> tune<00:01:32.820> okay<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.899> out

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it's harder to play in tune okay so out

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.580 
it's harder to play in tune okay so out
of<00:01:34.290> those<00:01:34.560> three<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.210> have<00:01:36.210> been<00:01:36.479> using<00:01:36.720> Perl<00:01:37.439> on

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
of those three I have been using Perl on

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.770 
of those three I have been using Perl on
I've<00:01:37.920> been<00:01:38.070> using<00:01:38.220> dominance<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:38.970> obbligato

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
I've been using dominance and obbligato

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.319 
I've been using dominance and obbligato
s--<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.740> haven't<00:01:40.950> been<00:01:41.189> 100%<00:01:41.759> happy<00:01:42.299> with

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
s-- but I haven't been 100% happy with

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.209 
s-- but I haven't been 100% happy with
those<00:01:42.570> strings<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.649> dominance<00:01:44.130> for

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
those strings because the dominance for

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.520 
those strings because the dominance for
example<00:01:44.610> after<00:01:44.909> five<00:01:45.119> six<00:01:45.450> weeks<00:01:45.719> I<00:01:45.960> felt<00:01:46.409> like

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
example after five six weeks I felt like

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.170 
example after five six weeks I felt like
I<00:01:46.649> had<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.890> change<00:01:47.250> them<00:01:47.549> they<00:01:47.729> didn't<00:01:47.969> last

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I had to change them they didn't last

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.920 
I had to change them they didn't last
very<00:01:48.360> long<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.880> they<00:01:50.880> would<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> if

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
very long and it they would have a if

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.569 
very long and it they would have a if
you<00:01:52.110> play<00:01:52.290> fifths<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:52.920> would<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.189> kind<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
you play fifths they would have kind of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.700 
you play fifths they would have kind of
a<00:01:53.640> fall<00:01:53.909> sound<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.869> sound<00:01:55.140> was<00:01:55.320> never<00:01:55.560> as

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
a fall sound and the sound was never as

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.590 
a fall sound and the sound was never as
good<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.159> first<00:01:56.490> week<00:01:56.789> on<00:01:57.030> any<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.479> those

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
good as the first week on any of those

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
good as the first week on any of those
strings<00:01:58.200> right<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.799> first<00:01:59.070> week<00:01:59.310> would<00:01:59.460> give

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
strings right the first week would give

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.480 
strings right the first week would give
me<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> top<00:02:00.390> sound<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.310> other

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
me the top sound and then the other

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.760 
me the top sound and then the other
problem<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:03.060> those<00:02:03.270> strings<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.869> me<00:02:04.079> was

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
problem with those strings for me was

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.920 
problem with those strings for me was
that<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.250> had<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> stronger<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.539> string

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
that I had to have a stronger a string

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.090 
that I had to have a stronger a string
because<00:02:07.079> when<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.289> went<00:02:07.439> from<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> D<00:02:07.799> string<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
because when I went from the D string to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.920 
because when I went from the D string to
the<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> string<00:02:08.850> there<00:02:09.180> was<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> big<00:02:09.540> difference

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
the a string there was a big difference

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.840 
the a string there was a big difference
in<00:02:10.050> sound<00:02:10.380> so<00:02:10.980> I<00:02:11.010> could<00:02:11.370> never<00:02:11.490> use<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
in sound so I could never use the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.790 
in sound so I could never use the
dominant<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.080> obbligato

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
dominant a or the obbligato

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.580 
dominant a or the obbligato
I<00:02:13.830> ended<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.400> using<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.940> steel<00:02:15.240> core<00:02:15.570> Piron<00:02:16.320> ito

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
I ended up using a steel core Piron ito

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.620 
I ended up using a steel core Piron ito
a<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.220> be<00:02:17.310> able<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.490> match<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.030> sound<00:02:18.300> between

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
a to be able to match the sound between

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.690 
a to be able to match the sound between
the<00:02:18.720> E<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.310> D<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the E and the a and the a and the D and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.030 
the E and the a and the a and the D and
then<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> E<00:02:21.450> string<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.080> didn't<00:02:22.350> use<00:02:22.470> either<00:02:22.770> I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
then the E string I didn't use either I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.150 
then the E string I didn't use either I
would<00:02:23.250> use<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.670> gold<00:02:24.540> label<00:02:24.990> east<00:02:25.200> ring<00:02:25.620> made<00:02:26.010> by

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
would use a gold label east ring made by

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.850 
would use a gold label east ring made by
Peter<00:02:26.970> Ostrow<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.440> haven't<00:02:28.680> missed

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
Peter Ostrow so I haven't missed

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.580 
Peter Ostrow so I haven't missed
mix-match<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.150> set<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.720> make<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.080> work<00:02:31.290> for<00:02:31.320> me

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
mix-match the set to make it work for me

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.240 
mix-match the set to make it work for me
and<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.910> would<00:02:33.060> be<00:02:33.150> good<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.510> first<00:02:33.750> week<00:02:34.250> but

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
and it would be good the first week but

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.010 
and it would be good the first week but
it<00:02:35.550> wouldn't<00:02:35.820> be<00:02:35.940> quite<00:02:36.150> as<00:02:36.180> good<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.810> weeks

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
it wouldn't be quite as good the weeks

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.990 
it wouldn't be quite as good the weeks
following<00:02:37.230> weeks<00:02:37.800> alright<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.760> things

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
following weeks alright so the things

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.400 
following weeks alright so the things
that<00:02:39.120> are<00:02:39.210> important<00:02:39.570> for<00:02:39.660> me<00:02:39.780> are<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
that are important for me are that the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.680 
that are important for me are that the
strings<00:02:40.770> have<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.010> nice<00:02:41.220> even<00:02:41.700> sound<00:02:41.940> from<00:02:42.480> one

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
strings have a nice even sound from one

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:56.440 
strings have a nice even sound from one
string<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.050> another

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.009 

and<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:58.739> they<00:02:59.489> have<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.639> nice<00:02:59.790> warm<00:03:00.269> sound<00:03:00.689> as

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
and that they have a nice warm sound as

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:08.589 
and that they have a nice warm sound as
these<00:03:01.230> does

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:17.490 

and<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:10.340> they<00:03:10.459> have<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> fast<00:03:11.030> action<00:03:11.299> time

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.670 

anyway<00:03:18.310> these<00:03:18.970> strings<00:03:19.390> are<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:20.440> best

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
anyway these strings are the best

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.710 
anyway these strings are the best
strings<00:03:20.980> I've<00:03:21.130> discovered<00:03:21.460> in<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:22.000> long<00:03:22.300> long

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
strings I've discovered in a long long

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.170 
strings I've discovered in a long long
time<00:03:22.830> they<00:03:23.830> are<00:03:23.890> less<00:03:24.220> expensive<00:03:24.250> than<00:03:24.850> the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
time they are less expensive than the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.570 
time they are less expensive than the
strings<00:03:25.450> I've<00:03:25.600> been<00:03:25.840> using<00:03:26.170> they<00:03:27.040> break<00:03:27.340> in

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
strings I've been using they break in

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.540 
strings I've been using they break in
faster<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:28.680> after<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.710> month<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.160> haven't

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
faster and after a month I haven't

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.120 
faster and after a month I haven't
noticed<00:03:30.670> any<00:03:31.000> decline<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.410> give<00:03:32.920> these

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
noticed any decline so I give these

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.630 
noticed any decline so I give these
strings<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.850> big<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.630> plus<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.680> highly
