 translated and voiced Oleg and for the community 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.850
 artists wearing 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.200
 meet the video I will tell about one of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.590
 The most important principles of working in Photoshop 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.509
 this mixing of paints and the way that i 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.619
 I use relies on one combination 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.810
 keyboard shortcuts 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.689
 I told about him in the past video about 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.390
 brushes is use of the alt key for 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 Call tool pipette here we have 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.610
 finished example this is a lit ball we 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.960
 see as illuminated areas gradually 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.370
 becomes darkened 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.989
 and between a light dark tone 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.920
 there are many other 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.920
 intermediate tones 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.360
 for drawing you will need to learn 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.780
 smoothly move from one color to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.640
 different and create intermediate tones 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.470
 using a brush and this process 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.470
 called mixing colors on the screen 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.010
 in fact, the stages of this process are very 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.530
 are simple 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.510
 but you still need to get used to them 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.070
 during drawing you will constantly 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.470
 resort to this technique 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.860
 so it's worth practicing and so 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:17.450
 the steps are as follows and so we have color a 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.950
 on the left and color b on the right for a start we 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.000
 draw some color 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.790
 in the middle you need to make sure that 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.840
 pressure brush characteristic set to 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.840
 50 percent so your masks will be 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.940
 apply less paint 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:43.260
 then you need to choose a color by 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:45.390
 and draw over the dark blue area and in 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.760
 two colors get a lot of other 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.290
 tones i will choose intermediate tones 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.340
 which looks like a mix 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.250
 dark blue 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.840
 and turquoise i will choose it holding alt and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.870
 put it on the plot 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.480
 now we have quite a bit of color 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.730
 so I will choose color a and put it 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.740
 over here we have already 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:10.350
 more or less in between tons though 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.490
 should add a little by light 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.730
 and so here I began to color a 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.310
 and color both and found intermediate tons 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.920
 without even opening the color selection panel i 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.650
 just used the alt key and the eyedropper 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.680
 chose color swatches and then painted 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.870
 new selected color artists 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.670
 paint with oil paints before 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.650
 work first conducts 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.540
 pre-mixing colors on 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.520
 the usual palette but since you work 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.380
 in photoshop you don't need to be afraid of what 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.930
 the paint is dry prior 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.060
 mixing you don't need but i find that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.880
 quite useful before starting to create 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.459
 drawing try to mix photoshop 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.950
 the colors you will use 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.040
 when i work i very often create 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.650
 so-called mini palettes in this 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.140
 case this palette is on layers 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.850
 which i can hide or move 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.400
 on canvas whichever is over 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.080
 what kind of site do i work as a matter of fact 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.600
 same palette as in oil 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.120
 painting and so now you know about 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.340
 mixing process on the screen and 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.320
 about using a pipette for sure you 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.600
 noticed that this is a very useful type 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.600
 the palette can be placed in the corner of the screen 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.390
 and while working I just need to hold 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.340
 alt and move the brush to the desired color on 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.960
 this palette is all I need for work 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.230
 colors 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.030
 so I save a lot of time for myself 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.610
 you need to open the selection panel every time 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.200
 colors choose color and then press 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.960
 ok one more extra bonus of this 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.150
 technology is that as a result of color on your 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.220
 drawing more homogeneous using 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.350
 palette with the same colors you 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.810
 much more likely to create a smooth pleasant 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.150
 color scheme than random 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.580
 a chaotic search for colors of the color panel and 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.800
 as you work the image itself 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.610
 will become a palette and you will be able to 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.010
 choose colors from it in each of 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.860
 previous lessons i show you review 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.810
 who helped to learn new concepts about 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.610
 which I told during classes 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.470
 this review may be familiar to you 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.750
 if you ever went to 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.700
 art school 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.050
 mixing color swatches is one of 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.500
 basic exercises when learning 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.450
 mixing paints and therefore on the top 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:35.580
 layer i will give you an example and quite the rest 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:37.919
 you yourself will understand him 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.289
 then only with squares and essay they 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.300
 are at the top of the rest then it is you 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.340
 need to mix yourself and during everything 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.139
 exercises you do not need to open 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.060
 color panel do not forget 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.669
 adjust stylus pressure by 50 percent 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.620
 and also use a hard round 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:57.289
 brush and so the first step try 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.580
 create copy color both 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.580
 intermediate volume between hey essay 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.840
 first i take this sample then draw 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.870
 over it si until lightness 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.700
 and the tone will not look like your sample 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.970
 may not work out absolutely accurate 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.010
 copy but skills come with practice so 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.060
 in the future it will be much easier to create 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.060
 real drawings 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.020
 so when you finish knocked you will 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.479
 need to work on two more tones 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.509
 will need to find an intermediate tone 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:36.270
 between fish 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:40.190
 draw this intermediate tone he 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.190
 should be like the example above 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:54.570
 then you need to find an intermediate tone 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:57.690
 between by issey as you can see i don't take 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.660
 samples from ready-made examples only from 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.930
 tones and hasth and mixing which I myself 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.930
 created 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.490
 how are you 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.400
 I work not very clean and neat but 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.870
 at the very end I will make the edges even to me 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.130
 enough to take a sample 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:27.090
 gray with a background hold down shift and 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.090
 it will restrict to rectangular frames 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.239
 so download 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.789
 work exercises and try it 

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:39.509
 perform in each example you will start with 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.509
 colors and 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.920
 ce to create by and intermediate then 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.440
 it is between a and b &amp; b 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.210
 essay doing the exercise several times you 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.680
 notice how your skill improves 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.680
 mixing good luck
