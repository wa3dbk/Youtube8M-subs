 The update came in yesterday morning . 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.859
 I'm too busy these days and I have a hard time recording the experiment . 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.449

 Now, first of Enchantment This spell called doejyo 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.640
 You can combine these in a combination of tables on the workbench. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.690
 I can put it on the floor. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.360
 If you look at the lower draft, 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.690
 Well 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.420
 This way, the combination is stunningly out of my mind. 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:07.640
 It will drink next to the first panoramic patent right 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.150

 A lot do anyway 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:53.140
 3 4- player game I think the number of books to play is definitely increased a lot. 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.600
 It's up to four. 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.430
 Cool and here. 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.610

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.690

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.900

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.239
 Nees were not awkward . 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:29.290
 If you release your hand, the 01 item of the item does not move together with the item. 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:31.010

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:41.989
 The social scene is a good place to try it. 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:45.890
 The knife is floating. 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:51.379

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:55.040
 No doubt I think I'm something awkward terminology candy 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:58.910
 Anyway, I'm standing a little bit like a handicapped person . 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:03.260
 You can now put the following block in the clean state and it's possible to install it. 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.760

 There is no street. 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:24.109

 5 Okay, you see the remains. 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.220
 I do not think there 's anything in there. 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.840
 It's not a machine with a watershed . 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.680

 Other than that, there's nothing we can do. 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.770
 Several bugs have been fixed and are not close to the distance estimates. 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.919

 Anyway, just the way you really did fix a lot of board measures a few ten second 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.639
