let's say on a 24 kill streak one away
from<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.750> MOAB<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.710> really<00:00:32.130> pumped<00:00:32.550> you're

from a MOAB you really pumped you're
rushing<00:00:33.000> every<00:00:33.329> place<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> sudden

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
rushing every place and all of a sudden

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
rushing every place and all of a sudden
you<00:00:34.800> cross<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> corner<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.420> comes

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
you cross the corner and here comes

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.250 
you cross the corner and here comes
along<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.140> new<00:00:38.120> gently<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.360> slowly<00:00:39.840> he

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
along this new gently and slowly he

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860 
along this new gently and slowly he
takes<00:00:40.530> out<00:00:40.710> his<00:00:40.860> knife<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.399> bam<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.450> kills<00:00:42.690> you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.679 
actually the panic knifing system could
be<00:01:49.079> used<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:50.250> sort<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.610> reflection<00:01:51.540> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
be used as some sort of reflection of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.130

the damage you put and yeah all this
crazy<00:01:55.380> stuff<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.950> basically<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:56.850> wings<00:01:57.149> was

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
crazy stuff but basically what wings was

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.899 
crazy stuff but basically what wings was
saying<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.469> let's<00:01:59.009> say<00:01:59.159> you're<00:01:59.460> crossing

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
saying is that let's say you're crossing

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.880 
saying is that let's say you're crossing
the<00:01:59.939> corner<00:02:00.360> there's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> panic<00:02:01.020> lifer<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the corner there's a panic lifer on the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.910 
the corner there's a panic lifer on the
other<00:02:02.040> side<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.659> deal<00:02:03.930> 50<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> 100

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
other side and you deal 50 out of 100

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.080 
other side and you deal 50 out of 100
points<00:02:05.549> towards<00:02:06.030> his<00:02:06.210> life<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.110> he<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.759> panic

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
points towards his life so he the panic

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.210 
points towards his life so he the panic
knife<00:02:09.239> fork<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.780> knife<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.410> back

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
knife fork and knife you back

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.950 
knife fork and knife you back
50<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> hundred<00:02:12.480> points<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
50 out of the hundred points that you

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.020 
50 out of the hundred points that you
down<00:02:13.320> towards<00:02:13.680> him<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.400> kind<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.640> reflects

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
down towards him so it kind of reflects

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.240 
down towards him so it kind of reflects
the<00:02:15.150> damage<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:16.680> makes<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.920> impossible

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the damage and that makes it impossible

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.450 
the damage and that makes it impossible
