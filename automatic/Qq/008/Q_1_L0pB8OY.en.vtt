00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.909
 this video that shows the correct handling and installation procedures and 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:28.729
 removal of the intel processor in the box on the delivery package 7 7 5 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:34.059
 performing any of these procedures which must be followed by the 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.059
 standard rse practices 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.790
 you can run the processor installation with the fashion where you are 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.920
 installed at 1 and formula 1 if this sea follows the practices and resides in both 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 cases it is recommended to wear gloves 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.270
 place the plate on a flat, secure surface for the sp so that it is 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.270
 leveraged cardoso ratifying left operator 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.170
 the lever by pushing it with your thumb and 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.240
 pressing down and out by hook to release ducati fix action 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.880
 givens lever fully up to the open position of about 135 cases 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.050
 I would say load plate to fully open position 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.050
 of about 100 degrees 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.410
 pressing the indicator to the front of the cover, remove the tam- 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.690
 fit small country pmdb 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.890
 by doing this we can not count stosur that until the cover is checked 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 damaged 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.120
 do a visual inspection of the array of accounts you want harbor cinema 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.650
 seeing from various angles observing changes in human patterns 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.870
 a change in standards 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.970
 indicates damaged contacts 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.830
 also look for materials 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.700
 If mechanical damage or foreign matter is detected we refuse from the port 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.490
 to install the processor remove the packet in votes holding the protectors 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.230
 with 13 of the toucans 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
 check if google has a certain golden 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.599
 remove the protective cap with the other hand pressing the defense are majority 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.689
 removing the processor package 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.129
 if after the processor has been removed from the south kurt reinsert the protective cover 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.149
 to protect the gilded sensitive supports 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.709
 make sure that the gold supports of the processor of foreign materials or 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.809
 are damaged and in this case refuse the processor 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.110
 to insert the processor is a shame 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.850
 orient the package so that the integrated heat sink is 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.249
 face up 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.279
 properly orient the end of the world and the fittings in turn the substrate 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.169
 in the yellow triangle indicates the location of the pin the peace carefully our processor 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.730
 objective aligning pilot on processor with hot sun holding processor 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:06.359
 with two fingers down vertically maintains a plane and is level when being 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.359
 aligned on the socket so as not to damage your opinion 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.309
 with the package seated sliding charge plate for the heatsink 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:15.539
 integrated 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:19.779
 load lever to learn the idea of ​​the load plate by pressing 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.159
 the plate lightly down 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.159
 forty loads of cargo goes up the kia of fixation 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.429
 1 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.829
 remove from the processor package a4 fan heat sink 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.289
 variable speed 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:42.279
 and be careful not to damage the inter-thermal material to 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.190
 applied 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.440
 do not apply any other material of which the technical 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.519
 such as that of the bubble installed in the ground 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.319
 fan in fashion and Buddhism any orientation 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.319
 the line of predators in the holes of fashion change 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.680
 before actuating the fixing caps 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.650
 make sure that the positions of forces have not been arrested for days 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.699
 somehow 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.189
 the operation of the predator 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.059
 Also check that isolating fixings are pointing straight out. 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.689
 heatsink 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.400
 button to activate the four steps down 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.919
 fingers when applying pressure alertness to prevent it from understanding 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.789
 It is not necessary to generate the corridors during installation. 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.909
 scene seemed pretty predators 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.150
 are flush with good fashion 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.790
 in addition to the future spa two new four-way heat spa volley 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.850
 watching the right orientation on the radio 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.729
 finally 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.529
 do not let any additional loads interfere with the operation of the heatsink 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.529
 of heat 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.409
 Disassembly begins Disconnecting heat sink cable gives a truce 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:05.620
 slang four fictional covers are 90 degrees with the left 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.330
 with a score screwdriver 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.500
 loose by the grass 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.860
 whose up 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.860
 to undock hours 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.460
 agr 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.210
 with a particular movement those of the heat sink retreat 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.419
 your heat sink is used in another processor place the sellers 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.590
 removing the covers 90 degrees 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.590
 in the opposite direction of the serta at the top of the table 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.809
 if necessary to contact Intel's customer support for 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.809
 a backup between was a spare question 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.580
 open the door and charge lever pick up the processor with a suction phrase 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.900
 place your index finger on the hinged side of the 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.919
 processor 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.860
 and the thumb on the side of the loading lever 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.860
 he must repeat 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.820
 in spite of the method applied to remove it processor from the model today 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.069
 immediately place the protective cover on the processor to prevent 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.979
 contamination for this 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.400
 hold the cpu by the corners 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.319
 do not touch the golden supports 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.509
 box and one of defense are great but it gave in to nothing at all 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.399
 press the second is that the defense are great by securing access 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:41.389
 to reassemble apmp on the load side place on the back of the plate 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:46.229
 this time it's up to fully sit down after closing vacancies 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.589
 load and wrap wash case of your team
