00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
they're decent side well organised unit

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.890 
they're decent side well organised unit
so<00:02:41.640> we've<00:02:42.120> done<00:02:42.329> a<00:02:42.360> little<00:02:42.540> bit<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.750> homework

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
so we've done a little bit of homework

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.360 
so we've done a little bit of homework
on<00:02:43.230> them<00:02:43.350> yeah<00:02:43.560> we're<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.220> there

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
on them yeah we're not going in there

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:57.430 
on them yeah we're not going in there
blind<00:02:44.549> we<00:02:44.850> need<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.090> know<00:02:45.209> we're<00:02:45.390> up<00:02:45.480> against

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.160 

you

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.470 

then<00:03:05.170> there<00:03:05.950> were<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.099> really<00:03:06.519> direct<00:03:06.819> type<00:03:07.300> of

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
then there were a really direct type of

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.830 
then there were a really direct type of
team<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.440> they've<00:03:08.769> got<00:03:08.879> three<00:03:09.879> main<00:03:10.239> targets

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
team so they've got three main targets

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.160 
team so they've got three main targets
up<00:03:10.989> from<00:03:11.940> Monty<00:03:13.230> Adele<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.970> reso<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.780> look

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
up from Monty Adele and reso so look

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.680 
up from Monty Adele and reso so look
that<00:03:17.590> look<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.830> play<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.160> counter<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:18.819> I

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
that look to play on the counter and I

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.300 
that look to play on the counter and I
think<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.290> no<00:03:20.410> one's<00:03:20.620> will<00:03:20.739> need<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.980> be<00:03:21.069> aware

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
think so no one's will need to be aware

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.369 
think so no one's will need to be aware
don't<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:23.410> be<00:03:23.950> quite<00:03:24.160> physical<00:03:24.580> up<00:03:24.670> front<00:03:24.940> and

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
don't and be quite physical up front and

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.559 
don't and be quite physical up front and
not<00:03:26.379> have<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.680> obviously<00:03:27.090> consider<00:03:28.090> how

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
not have to obviously consider how

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.240 
not have to obviously consider how
they're<00:03:28.780> going<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:28.989> try<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.560> stop<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.040> balls

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
they're going to try and stop the balls

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.580 
they're going to try and stop the balls
being<00:03:30.610> delivered<00:03:31.000> from<00:03:31.150> from<00:03:31.870> deep<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.349> the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
being delivered from from deep in the

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:58.550 
being delivered from from deep in the
defensive<00:03:33.190> half

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.470 

yeah<00:03:59.560> we've<00:03:59.770> got<00:03:59.890> it<00:04:00.100> from<00:04:00.760> from<00:04:01.209> what<00:04:01.390> I've

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
yeah we've got it from from what I've

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.280 
yeah we've got it from from what I've
seen<00:04:01.510> how<00:04:01.990> am<00:04:02.110> I<00:04:02.230> gonna<00:04:02.850> defend<00:04:03.850> quite<00:04:04.300> deep<00:04:04.540> so

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
seen how am I gonna defend quite deep so

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.600 
seen how am I gonna defend quite deep so
it's<00:04:05.380> going<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.560> be<00:04:05.650> an<00:04:05.740> advantage<00:04:05.950> first<00:04:06.340> in

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
it's going to be an advantage first in

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.460 
it's going to be an advantage first in
oven<00:04:06.880> science<00:04:07.209> in<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.750> way<00:04:07.900> that<00:04:08.050> they<00:04:08.230> look

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
oven science in the way that they look

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.580 
oven science in the way that they look
to<00:04:08.709> play<00:04:08.890> so<00:04:09.870> combination<00:04:10.870> play<00:04:11.020> in<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.230> final

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
to play so combination play in the final

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.479 
to play so combination play in the final
third<00:04:12.690> shouldn't<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.780> an<00:04:13.870> issue<00:04:13.959> for<00:04:14.380> for<00:04:15.340> son

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
third shouldn't be an issue for for son

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.150 
third shouldn't be an issue for for son
organs<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.109> hopefully<00:04:17.109> hopefully<00:04:17.709> they<00:04:18.100> can

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
organs and hopefully hopefully they can

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.680 
organs and hopefully hopefully they can
capitalize<00:04:18.700> on<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.910> space<00:04:19.150> it's<00:04:19.390> given<00:04:19.660> to

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
capitalize on the space it's given to

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.850 
capitalize on the space it's given to
them<00:04:19.980> but<00:04:20.980> that<00:04:21.280> deep<00:04:21.640> defensive<00:04:21.880> block

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
them but that deep defensive block

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.060 
them but that deep defensive block
probably<00:04:23.860> will<00:04:24.070> allow<00:04:24.340> them<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.760> really

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
probably will allow them to really

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.370 
probably will allow them to really
utilize<00:04:27.070> why<00:04:27.550> there<00:04:27.760> as<00:04:27.880> well<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:28.330> it's<00:04:29.140> going

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
utilize why there as well so it's going

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.350 
utilize why there as well so it's going
to<00:04:29.440> be<00:04:29.500> an<00:04:29.650> area<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:29.950> they'll<00:04:30.669> need<00:04:30.700> to<00:04:30.880> own

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
to be an area that they'll need to own

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:43.490 
to be an area that they'll need to own
it<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.690> Tron<00:04:34.710> take<00:04:35.710> swings<00:04:36.460> in<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:36.910> it's<00:04:37.210> 31

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.160 

I<00:04:43.560> up<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.520> post<00:04:47.300> well<00:04:48.300> obviously<00:04:48.600> we<00:04:48.780> know<00:04:48.900> the

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
I up the post well obviously we know the

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.200 
I up the post well obviously we know the
strength<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.680> st.<00:04:49.890> Albans<00:04:50.190> from<00:04:50.970> set-pieces

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
strength to st. Albans from set-pieces

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.600 
strength to st. Albans from set-pieces
so<00:04:51.840> it's<00:04:52.440> something<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:52.890> they<00:04:53.070> will

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
so it's something that they will

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.630 
so it's something that they will
hopefully<00:04:53.850> be<00:04:54.570> able<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:55.040> take<00:04:56.040> advantage<00:04:56.070> of

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
hopefully be able to take advantage of

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.140 
hopefully be able to take advantage of
we've<00:04:57.510> seen<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:58.560> paramedic<00:04:59.250> keeper<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.760> back

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
we've seen the paramedic keeper and back

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.900 
we've seen the paramedic keeper and back
for<00:05:00.480> being<00:05:00.810> quite<00:05:01.050> susceptible<00:05:01.430> so<00:05:02.430> it's

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
for being quite susceptible so it's

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.460 
for being quite susceptible so it's
something<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.360> hopefully<00:05:03.720> they<00:05:04.260> won't

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
something that hopefully they won't

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.190 
something that hopefully they won't
require<00:05:05.150> but<00:05:06.150> something<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:06.900> they<00:05:06.990> might

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
require but something that they might

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.830 
require but something that they might
need<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.590> obviously<00:05:07.920> keep<00:05:08.850> it<00:05:08.970> at<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.120> pocket

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.510
