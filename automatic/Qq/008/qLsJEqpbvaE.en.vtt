00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.960
 hello very good to everyone and 44 what a 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.269
 you are welcome to a new video 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.580
 new gameplay here in each video the 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.580
 letters and one of these games that to me 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.630
 in these games that I seem to be 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.519
 in a slaughterhouse here running I respond to 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.830
 the pigs well I'm leaving the subject 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.689
 is a great game is worth here in what 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.880
 they were playing with my great friend 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.859
 We were playing, I think 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.830
 we went to find a game I think 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.090
 there was one that is a 24 7 and points 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.370
 doubles therefore we seek never is 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.160
 nor did this great demolition game come out in 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.640
 what is I love and good that would be 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.350
 what would it be like to wait as he says 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.290
 consumer capped eyes covered 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.220
 covered eyes 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.980
 ok now you can see a small 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.700
 camping and tactics that arose that the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.040
 I have veins and good that it would be that 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.260
 it would be my games if not 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.690
 there was something very strange or a great 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.250
 story behind in this case this 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.980
 this game is not far behind there is a 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.900
 great story behind 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.790
 It is one of these games that you enter 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.800
 ok and there are two sides two teams 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.820
 faced two Spanish two teams of 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.820
 Spaniards with the micro there 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.780
 Doubts 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.490
 what is good but it is what usually 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.070
 have two sides faced by micro 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.840
 Spaniards insulting themselves by insulting each other 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.840
 yes and there they go and it touched us 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.479
 get used to making friends with 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.850
 our teammates from our team 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.310
 who played as you see the other team is the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.659
 clan crazy and he was really very 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.069
 crazy they kept screaming the bastards 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:48.039
 but it touched us against them and it touched us 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.299
 with this equipment it seems to me if badly 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.090
 I remember that our team were 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.039
 Galician is worth if I remember correctly and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.009
 we make friends with him from them 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.340
 make some colleagues devise tactics and 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.819
 good these people are worth the team our 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.039
 he was going to win and he's just going to win them 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.060
 they saw the bomb and we said go one 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.459
 covering this site 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.940
 another covering as well as if it were the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.819
 war not like it was so good very 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.120
 motivated and good they were going to win 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.099
 We were going okay and I would therefore like 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.109
 always says that someone is going to pass the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.700
 free long for the comments and we're going to 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.739
 make us low we were not going to play in 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.459
 team not much less and we're going to kill 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.859
 get gusts and well that's not to kill 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.540
 like crazy I am more team player 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.700
 they were going I know I wanted to win the 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.550
 departure as it was but later I do not 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.720
 I am one of those who says 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:45.500
 to start placing to place no no 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.460
 I do not prefer to wait for it because I do not know 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.020
 about 30 seconds to place I'm that 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.880
 but well my team played a team 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.910
 competitive is very choppy with the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.060
 others and decided they can place and win 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.319
 and ensure at least the game does not 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.709
 they blame them they wanted to win and point 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 apart worth this game was a massacre 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.709
 it's worth the streaks you're going to see are 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.909
 just from iván and mía that is not going to 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.950
 have nothing else in the air is going to have 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.549
 vtol 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.520
 what of stars helicopters and little else not 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.240
 it's going to be the only thing that's going to be 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.800
 and exceeded exceeded 100 casualties and very 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.320
 Attentive please I ask you to be 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.300
 very attentive at the end of the game 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.540
 because of course here you see right now 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.880
 host this game is won is not 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.800
 it's an abuse is loosing here what's 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.740
 is going to do more than 100 casualties 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.570
 this is won because do not believe you're worth 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.520
 I do not want to break the end but it's going to 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.610
 it's very difficult to win the game you go 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.460
 to be very beautiful such is going to be dancing 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.080
 the game will be very difficult but 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.700
 well here I keep taking here asked for a 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.350
 lots of fi I tell him that I'm excited that 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.390
 I get excited but I did not kill anyone I did not kill 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.290
 anyone 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.490
 and good helicopters by the air madness 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.350
 in addition there was very good connection that is not 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.910
 I could complain about the connection I killed 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.190
 of good that usually kill 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.550
 three shots was not very well the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.400
 connection at least on my part not 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.500
 that was host but it was very good and good 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.299
 while our team out there there's no 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.000
 that cover the kabamba bomb that are 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.860
 deactivating good invite us 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.500
 invites the Galicians but good that in 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.470
 Galician, they were very motivated 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.560
 no and the truth is that it breaks me down 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.440
 very much our departure not because it is 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:38.760
 Ivan Guillen, apart from how good we are 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.590
 played us the role of good they were 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.540
 our classmates had to make us 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.669
 friends devise tactics and that as 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.870
 pretty well I had been doing 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.990
 very long that there was not a 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.190
 I started and I got along well with my team 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.440
 normally he usually insults himself 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.060
 there is usually no pique between them in the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.280
 session happens we can not this 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.729
 departure had rapport had 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:07.410
 team had had fellowship valley 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.200
 fellowship or that came out quite 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.910
 well in the game but good if not 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.500
 out by the end 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.360
 and that I want to say it but not 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.060
 I want to break I do not want to spoil the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.240
 final no but there was a pretty final 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.280
 disastrous here disabled we fought 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.410
 now is that we all sacks by 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.930
 the pump all all all here one 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.730
 placing another one kills me for legume 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.700
 madness everyone at the pump can you imagine 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.740
 12 people at the pump a fucking madness 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.440
 a helicopter there ours in the air 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.270
 and I can now choose a little 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.479
 repurchases that my colleagues who were 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.340
 like crazy trying to activate that bomb 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.860
 or sorry to turn off now because they have 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.810
 placed and nothing not disabled not 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.330
 deactivate go me by the micro and go 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.979
 motivating let's team and they managed 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.599
 deactivate but attentive because the 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:59.120
 games seems to end here but not 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.650
 it will not finish, they will replace it if 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.660
 bad I do not remember the opposite time 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.699
 I know how they placed it worth I do not know who had 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.800
 placing but with reposition 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:11.000
 they come back to the load plus there was a 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.889
 galician valera deceive him of our 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.220
 team I repeat because there was one of them 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:19.159
 that motivated us that is Galician 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.069
 motivator did not stop saying phrases 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.990
 motivating motivators forgiveness and 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.190
 motivate us and that really helped us 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.800
 Pretty much I think that was what I 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.919
 prompted to make 100 casualties 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.750
 and it helps us as I said it was already a 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.800
 good departure with respect to 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.009
 fellowship 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.440
 ua mixed there was friendship and already attentive 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.629
 because the end is near and tried to 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.729
 the desperate tried to place and pumme me 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:48.120
 hit the people in the foot could not 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:50.460
 do nothing we lost and as you can see 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.169
 Well disappointment was not very many 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.639
 disappointment our team the other clan 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.159
 well, descojonándose of us 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:59.069
 insulting no no but good was what 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:01.800
 happened we could change it and well very 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:04.379
 attentive now what you are going to see now 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.229
 you know my life is a learn with juanjo 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:09.180
 total not so good I wanted to teach some 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.370
 images of what is still the king 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.319
 spam on this map as you can see in 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.599
 this map is valid so you do not know 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:17.610
 They are born in the garden also in this area 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.409
 on the right there in that corner where 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.719
 there is a small hut here inside 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.430
 this garage and finally here outside the 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:25.349
 garage vale are the respawn area 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.509
 I wanted to say I wanted to clarify it not by 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:29.009
 if someone did not know it and also for that 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:31.110
