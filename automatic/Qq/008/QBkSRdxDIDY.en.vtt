00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.680
 I have here the functions whose 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.090
 graphical representation is a straight 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.690
 I know it's actually a 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.150
 function 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.849
 finn so I want to find his formula 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.539
 literal if I come the representation 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:26.689
 graph this right has for equation 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:30.520
 the equation of type y equal to x + b I 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:34.670
 know that b and give them to the origin 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:41.840
 so here the equation of the right will be the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:44.359
 type y equal to x + 3 you remember 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.390
 indeed give them originally for 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:52.039
 geeks and win 0 give them here and 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.859
 three to find the coefficient 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.420
 director of the right 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.449
 two solutions we will already see the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.089
 first we see here on the graph 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:13.400
 that the aco on the right goes through the point to 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:15.760
 2 coordinates 1-1 belongs to the right 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.870
 so his coordinates checks the equation 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:30.410
 from the right so i have one is equal to a 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:33.500
 times a +31 ordered 2 to 1 ap 6 2 ha good 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:40.850
 that's it I found one to find at 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:44.090
 I will do equal 1 - 3 equal less 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.220
 two okay I 'm going to spend another three 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.950
 side it's done - troyes - troyes plus one 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:54.880
 chan and at least 2 so I find like 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:58.000
 Equation of the right y equals - 2 x + 3 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:07.280
 so the function can be written 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:12.220
 literally f that ax to these - from 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.220
 zupce +3 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.540
 let's see now the second method I 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.060
 take the problem of g2 points to 2 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.500
 coordinates 1-1 and country if of 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.340
 coordinates out of three that are all 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.920
 two on the right 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.079
 what we saw at the end of 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.579
 chapter we saw what's called 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.400
 the proportionality of pupils 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.319
 increase and coefficient 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.900
 proportionality it's this famous so 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.190
 what is 1 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.489
 we always start with the same point 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:52.220
 it's the messy difference 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:58.620
 I will start p13 - 1/0 - 1 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:02.989
 we could describe yb - a difference 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.700
 to order on difference of abscissae 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.970
 right here 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:13.849
 3-1 I was saying about 0-1 dirt 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:21.540
 what pro - samse 2 / -1 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:23.790
 it gives me a lot less two and we 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.169
 find what we had just now 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.190
 that is, the function f 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:34.530
 it's the function that has x associates - 2x 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.540
 plus three so I advise you when 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.790
 you want employees this method you 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.090
 do not have to specify the 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.299
 points 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:50.810
 look good you start from b so if 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:54.150
 you make a messy difference 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.150
 when you go from b to a 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.169
 you have in the negative sense that makes 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:07.949
 minus two so less of on the 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:09.830
 difference of the abscissa here I advance of 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:12.770
 a plus 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.340
 here it's like I'm back from 2 - 2 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.709
 so the guideline coefficient of the 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.180
 right it's less 2/1 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.180
 it can be a method also a
