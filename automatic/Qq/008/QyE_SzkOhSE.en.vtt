 Please first congratulations

 Greuther FÃ¼rth to Frank Kramer 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.550
 reach the relegation place but 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 also congratulations you have to paderborn 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.579
 say the illegal round have played 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.790
 and now a class higher your luck 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.290
 allowed to try so yes for us was that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.180
 we came here very much 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.559
 injury caused when I the karl 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.570
 We've gone through nine 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 failures and in the last time 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.620
 Of course we have since since 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.270
 Last time we fell that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.680
 scorer in the whole round 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.219
 really hard lately 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.309
 severe 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.680
 indicative are the chances nico klotz 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.020
 against ingolstadt the empty gate and today 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.560
 always sees itself the last chance the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.110
 we had 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
 which actually does not have to 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.190
 does not go in, so we get it right 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.260
 hard and therefore have the opponent 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.200
 really want to have a hard time in 4 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.800
 1 4 1 system played that the rooms well 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.390
 the outside are also where they like to be 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.430
 do a lot of pressure on prosinecki and 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.140
 gieselmann put relatively to the chain 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.000
 can and thereby is the opponent after 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.190
 two options in the beginning no more 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.190
 so much came to mind 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.510
 yes and then I think you can do such a thing 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.900
 team like herbs will not 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.280
 dominate over 90 minutes so far or 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.600
 Keep away from the gate when you see how 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.850
 many gates have shot her 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.420
 They scored the most goals in 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.100
 the second league and then pass once 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.509
 not on our left side and 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.550
 will be punished then will be natural 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.740
 hard for us 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.950
 and overall we have the game 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.180
 earned 2 0 lost 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.740
 we have to see that we are ours 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.869
 have had the virtues world 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.630
 ie always 100 percent get in 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.310
 collectively always have to retrieve 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.700
 to stay in the league also next 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.850
 year we will be accordingly 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.430
 hinbekommen 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.470
 only towards the end now that many 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.660
 injured are just in the form in 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.080
 The offensive is really hard for us 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.920
 done and you have the round in peace 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.959
 analyze 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.260
 In the end, I think we are closing 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.320
 on it a place twelve before the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.610
 round was the first to drop 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.470
 the last four games hurt but the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.630
 Round overall was outstanding 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.450
 that's why my team would like to thank you 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.140
 thank you very much frank how does yours 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.140
 conclusion of 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.810
 I think we are good in the game, too 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.820
 come to try to pressure immediately 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.030
 then have to do just that 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.940
 addressed two ways where you can 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.600
 then unfortunately on the front quite present 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.750
 were as we were at the end and 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.000
 then you also noticed that 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.340
 has defended thousands of very compact 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.240
 very cleverly made space tight 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.100
 and of course we have problems there as well 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.990
 to play through the lines 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.860
 get 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.660
 nonetheless, the team has 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.680
 because it is very disciplined behavior 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.370
 no longer in the head through the wall 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.120
 but it remained calm and in the 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.560
 second half have us stop then 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.820
 just his and other times 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.180
 fueled and after the leadership if 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.730
 I was the train just like that 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.460
 broken that you felt that 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.950
 we can win the game 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.700
 Now we go to the relegation 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.770
 again two games against hsv of course 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.160
 is the bundesliga is always the favorite 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.420
 it will be like this again 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.220
 nonetheless I think we have 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.000
 a very good round played 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.890
 I think the second best round of the 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.470
 club history 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.990
 which has managed the team 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.799
 the guys really great and made 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.280
 that's why we're going with that too 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.180
 appropriate use and with 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.310
 corresponding settings and 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.380
 hope for the two relegation games 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.570
 the team has always shown that 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.610
 she is willing to resist 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.700
 never stop getting down to 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.410
 always leave very team 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.270
 closed very much too spend 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.300
 for the games and it will also be against 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.920
 do the hsv and that we are there two right 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.720
 Need good days is also clear though 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.190
 this is normal if the bundesliga wants 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.110
 yes that's our goal and everything 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.630
 more if you are on thursday and on the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:58.530
 sunday also wants to congratulate so 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.580
 really good round yes and 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.380
 all the best for the future and us 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.520
 others will see it at the latest on 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.350
 sunday thank you thank you frank there is 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.390
 ask from her from your side 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.590
 One of the two coaches then we would 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.590
 ask for a short hand sign 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:40.390
 christoph call please interesting 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.130
 could not spare the question of the 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.600
 be talk that is always an adversary 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.460
 there and I think rather mainz has it 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.200
 just very good in the second half 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.630
 but also after the first 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.010
 half-time and also in phases of the second 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.460
 halfway you have already seen that 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:57.340
 Of course Hamburg is really right 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.320
 the quality has made you good 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.220
 have unquestionably been used properly 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.960
 have and we have to get there right 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.150
 always have to hold our chance 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.890
 Search and do it if you do too 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.050
 I do not think I'm anything 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.500
 Conditional aspect because we have something to do 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.030
 but i think it was anyway 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.490
 Of course there in the course of the second 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.350
 halfway clear that you are the relegation 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.630
 have achieved and that one there then 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.180
 maybe nice 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.920
 Torn in the head through the wall here 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.100
 the question is at the top of the second row 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.100
 still 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.139
 Relegation has always a lot with 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.580
 to do psychology they are going along now 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.660
 A victory on the Rhine has form in the 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.010
 defeat see your team 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.660
 Psychologically in the advantage there you are 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.220
 afterwards always smarter than before but 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.990
 ultimately, it is so that we 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.820
 of course already in the role of outsider 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.900
 are also no question and feel there 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.070
 But we also fit 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.480
 if one is in fact the clear principle 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.680
 it like that 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:06.630
 the one as outsider comes to the 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:08.490
 can only win if it otherwise 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.930
 No wonder more are still two 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.330
 organizational issues 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.320
 the ticket procedure for the relegation 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.660
 you can find that on the homepage 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.770
 we'll shorten that at this point 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.880
 from there it can then again very 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.650
 read relaxed 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.900
 tomorrow at 10 o'clock is training resp 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.720
 phased out and on tuesday and wednesday 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.979
 will not be trained in public 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.020
 There will be a press conference on Tuesday 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.850
 we invite again separately 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.470
 otherwise wish them now 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.880
 nice sunday thank you for coming 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.510
 and see you next week 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.510
 Thank you
