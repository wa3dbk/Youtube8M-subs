00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.620
 today we are going to make a bag of the monster 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.570
 high of 14 x 14 x 26 for it 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.190
 we will need rubber eva league that the 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.830
 we will cut open because in account and 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.870
 we will make a central spiral of 18 x 9 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.010
 and then those throw those that I'll cut 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.010
 to 10 x 5 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.170
 they would stay like this 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.020
 we center it and we stick it all centered 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.949
 so that it stays on the same surface 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.400
 and we seal it on the tip as if it were 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.400
 an envelope 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.500
 we do the same with the other part with 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 the other strip 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.960
 and the one called ramón link in the other 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.300
 side to drag it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.690
 we are going to need also black eva rubber 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.399
 white and pink 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.039
 it has to be more or less like 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.699
 out an envelope like a middle hole 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.750
 we put our hand inside and square 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.180
 the corners 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.660
 we have to square a square first 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 one side and paste it so it does not move and 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.170
 then to reinforce the stay 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.400
 that in the union stuck well that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.400
 we do with the four corners 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.980
 hearing amazing you have written not 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.100
 I downloaded it in our blog or in the 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.710
 part of the description and we cut the 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.830
 mold in black to do what it would be 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.770
 the task by cutting from the same mold a 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.770
 skull and we make it in the white zone 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.860
 we place it and the block very well for 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.220
 that stays the most centered more straight 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.390
 possible and we paste it and fix it 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 it has to be fixed once 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.640
 now with the same mold we create what 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.570
 is the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.729
 the bass pattern and cut it in pink 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.580
 it is important if they should return to 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.760
 mold because well 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.070
 and in the traces of the igrafo they would stay 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.649
 provided that at the bottom it 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.720
 we present we put a rule in the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.210
 top because we want the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.580
 loop fly a little bit and it 's to that area 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.620
 would be where you would not stick then 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.600
 we proceed to paste the rest 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.630
 then we remove the rule and do not bend and 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.660
 there you see how they stay tied for outside 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.200
 in the block with the rest of the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.690
 bag that we stick it well both to the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.890
 area of ​​the common internal face in the area 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.330
 from outside and we present it as it is and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.250
 now we have to attach the closure 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.110
 I have put a Velcro on it. 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.690
 put several things same proportion 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.510
 true 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.390
 but well the two parties have to wait 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.460
 so that it stays well well grabbed and 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.430
 we take a strip as long as possible 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.610
 4 cm black and we stick it on 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.460
 one side and the other the most stuck 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.120
 possible we cut two strips of 10 by 5 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.040
 to make the ties 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.379
 we would not have to double as well 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.720
 it was a my and now you have to hit it in 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:13.180
 the center and the back part to 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.180
 that does not move in any way 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.280
 with a little dot it's worth 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.530
 we cut two strips of the one that has 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.260
 over chiquititas as if it were a 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.580
 ring that will wrap the loop 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.150
 and we stick it 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.980
 we turn it around and seal it 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.140
 we are going to paste this in the national 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.829
 to disguise a little bit the ugly one 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.829
 they make the folds 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.220
 it would stay more or less like that and already 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.940
 presented 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.070
 I hope you like them and positive votes and 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.150
 comments that help us a lot and 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.150
 thank you very much everyone
