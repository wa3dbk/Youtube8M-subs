now you guys sitting there on

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.350 
now you guys sitting there on
three-point<00:01:11.010> 60<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.520> probably<00:01:11.760> when<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.970> PSN

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
three-point 60 and probably when the PSN

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.940 
three-point 60 and probably when the PSN
comes<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.200> there's<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> be

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
comes up you know there's going to be

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
comes up you know there's going to be
another<00:01:14.159> update<00:01:14.520> obviously<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:16.320> even<00:01:16.590> in

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
another update obviously but even in

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.499 
another update obviously but even in
that<00:01:16.710> those<00:01:17.189> 2a<00:01:17.460> flags<00:01:17.790> will<00:01:17.939> probably<00:01:18.299> still

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
that those 2a flags will probably still

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.550 
that those 2a flags will probably still
be<00:01:18.540> there<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.930> we'll<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.200> able<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> downgrade

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.350 
or do whatever so math louia hasn't
released<00:01:22.409> yet<00:01:22.590> how<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.430> maybe<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
released yet how to do this maybe it's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
released yet how to do this maybe it's
not<00:01:24.479> stable<00:01:24.780> yet<00:01:24.990> maybe<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.680> caused<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> lot<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
not stable yet maybe it caused a lot of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.039 
not stable yet maybe it caused a lot of
breaks<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.790> something<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.630> I'd
