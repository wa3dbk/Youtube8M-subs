00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.710
 hey i'm in the Bundestag 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.699
 junior world champion bodybuilding me 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.489
 want to help you with this 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.869
 to make your supplementation optimal 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.460
 that you do not have a bad conscience 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.840
 would have what can knock do what 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.849
 I have to do what error 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.670
 on my part that's why of me 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:38.659
 a few recommendations on week plan 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.989
 have us first on the basics 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:46.370
 limited because we have the muscle optimally 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.949
 feed, we want to wish us we plump 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.920
 want to insert the mass phase and for 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:56.539
 six real definition phase of my 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.059
 of course, there are such must-have 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.649
 I have limited myself to the one 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.239
 I now take to me currently also 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.149
 now go into my preparation 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.039
 in the morning on the first time fast exactly 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:11.200
 this works with whey protein and 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.200
 at that time 5 km Berlin 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.800
 I think every day should show 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.150
 should at least five complete 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.479
 program him to be taken 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.070
 whether in the morning at noon in the shake to the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.510
 Hard training after the shake is there 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.560
 like her 15 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:42.710
 because you take that to the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.820
 Workers of the Work Amino War 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.040
 bring in between times because of me 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.600
 only then eat again after four hours 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.820
 It may then be too long then after two 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.490
 hours after my first time 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.500
 I then in amino shock with the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.300
 amino acids muscle is absolutely nourished 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.220
 Now latch is very nice when I do that 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.560
 In the offseason I am in my mass 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.180
 phase I have to work I am 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.830
 roofer else something before me 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.479
 I can not eat anytime I'm in 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.760
 my zollstock bag 27 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.940
 then they get in touch with it in between 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.590
 so you therefore get on my good white 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.739
 then I come home 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.090
 eating at noon is the reason for the training 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.910
 then there must be talk of my pension 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.489
 Supplementation is every peter alanine 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.620
 just be focused and clean that 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.120
 training in addition to shares against ronny team 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.400
 amino acid very important for the body 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.100
 in form training five gram economy 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.250
 or I take the bca 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.500
 dispenser of weida there is good expression to 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.580
 example with inside not me 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.200
 additionally clean 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.230
 then I drink muscle fried from 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.840
 training there is also creative inside that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.090
 is creative enough with in there 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.269
 may of that for normal athlete though 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.860
 I have a creative addition I need 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.819
 still creative because I stop by 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.060
 high body weight 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:12.749
 I'll bring my pcs with me 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.200
 the draw in there when I'm a very high 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.290
 become 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.469
 After training is important that you 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.329
 without drinking this sud with it 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.819
 protein as soon as possible to the 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.359
 Muscle cell reason for that is important 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.519
 that sift you good wire 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.439
 so that the protein and there a compass 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.109
 So belongs quasi sony 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.239
 carbohydrates kamaz roughly rethink 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.010
 the coal road, the mode of transport, the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.500
 provide for insulin distribution the 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.629
 The proteins transport the amino acid 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.870
 allowed to sing in the muscle cell in front of it 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:51.510
 and in the evening before going to sleep 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.680
 then you can drink casein 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.489
 also eat mark clark and can with 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.129
 Change protein with rhine 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.500
 the quasi there is a totally 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.180
 slowly digestible protein that is 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.849
 the citizen has done all night 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.799
 is sleeping at night and be regenerated 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.739
 Muscle and there exactly in it the muscle 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.989
 also be trusted yes that at one 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.939
 Renovation you will find everything in the twelve 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.500
 Weekly plan of me only remembers if 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.909
 you do everything 100 percent right 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.909
 you have 100 percent result
