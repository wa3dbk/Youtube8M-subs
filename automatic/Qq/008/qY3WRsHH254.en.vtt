00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.640
 great hyperspace war 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.110
 is one of the bloodiest wars in 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.870
 Republic of history in fact is the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.680
 war and war present have one and those 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 same roots 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.050
 we thought we destroyed the sith empire 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.250
 during that war and however the sith 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.150
 returned to avenge on 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.879
 since history has a property 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.250
 repeat we will never understand the reasons 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.020
 led to the current war so far 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.220
 do not study the great 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.220
 hyperspace war 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.539
 great hyperspace war 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:22.009
 came at a time of growth and prosperity 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.009
 our republics ash dash 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.859
 or comparison for the Sith these years were 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.049
 marked by rapid preparation 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.609
 future war 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.890
 remaining unknown to the republic 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.590
 the grids have captured all the planets in the area 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.890
 Caribs and now if so what 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.890
 to profit 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.000
 at that time the vibrations raged 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.459
 Civil War 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.219
 the nets were divided into two camps and 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:56.610
 One of them was visible to our garden 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:59.099
 by force or by pure chance two 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.700
 travelers in the republic of pisa clear 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:06.829
 colleague to naga sadao decided to use 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.940
 them to take advantage of the war 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.849
 travelers were imprisoned 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.670
 but Naga Sadu is personally weak sorrow 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.950
 in his fellow tribesmen he said it 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.950
 was a Republican job 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.599
 the Sith feared burning the republic and 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.630
 because unquestioningly rallied around 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:33.310
 their new leader naga kindergarten and steel 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.709
 prepare for the invasion of the republic 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.840
 some time later the foot of the garden and became 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.470
 to rule over their fellow tribesmen 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.630
 and 1 his decree was to attack the republic 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.260
 candles attacked several important planets 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.209
 including the cone itself 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.239
 Naga Sadu commanded his fighters 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.640
 being meditating a giant sphere 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.630
 which was near the star 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.340
 dark side victory was obvious 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.760
 republicans weren't ready to repel 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:14.360
 so powerful attack the dark side but 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:18.850
 happened and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.010
 Naga student sadu told it 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.470
 the power-hungry apprentice of naga sadu decided 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.930
 improve all power over the Sith and 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.130
 attacked his teacher on the course of the war 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.660
 has changed 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.090
 and the eldest without their Sith leader 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.490
 confused and were forced to become 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.830
 victims of the republican fleet which 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.830
 drove them all the way to Korriban 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.680
 knowing that his army is doomed to 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.740
 seedlings gave an unusual order 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.300
 destroy all mention of the Sith on 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.850
 oscillations of other planets 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.780
 Naga Sadu returned to whom he would understand 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:06.530
 that his power came to an end empire 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.720
 Sith lost and Naga had no 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.430
 no desire to restore 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.380
 his empire as foresaw naga sada 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.269
 Republicans launched a massive attack on 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.640
 under the Sith which was broken at that time 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.210
 how the republican fleet finished off the remnants 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.270
 Sith fleet naga sadu again hid on 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.020
 this time he flew into exile on yavin 4 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.820
 and at this critical moment the whole public 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.930
 made in my most fatal 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.690
 an error 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.760
 the Sith were no longer a threat but 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.760
 supreme chancellor had a different opinion 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.040
 he ordered the Jedi and the Republican 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.770
 the troops go to Korriban and others 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.770
 the planets so that the Sith become a story 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.900
 that's why the sith survivors 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.630
 set off to the depths of space still new 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.890
 house under the direction of the student 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.590
 Naga Garden 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:10.300
 this tag has proclaimed itself emperor and 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.910
 this title is alive to this day I think 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.220
 this is what motivated the surviving sith 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.160
 create a new empire on dromund kaas 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:24.100
 this is what made them return to 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:26.530
 Republic of 13 centuries later, what a pity that 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.940
 we cannot rewrite history and 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.560
 complete the great hyperspace 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.560
 war otherwise 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.800
 however we must not forget something 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.650
 Pavicus of another great hyperspace 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.600
 war and war present is conflict 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.770
 which occurred before becoming 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.870
 Sith Empire 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.870
 I will talk about this in the next report.
