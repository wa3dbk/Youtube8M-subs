00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
costly because your rims will end up

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
them if there are then make sure you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.690 
them if there are then make sure you

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
leave them out with a pick because they

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
leave them out with a pick because they

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.349 

you<00:01:54.890> always<00:01:55.130> consider<00:01:55.369> your<00:01:55.759> brake<00:01:56.060> pad

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
you always consider your brake pad

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.060 
you always consider your brake pad
compound<00:01:56.929> as<00:01:57.079> well<00:01:57.289> now<00:01:57.740> if<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:58.039> a

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
compound as well now if you have a

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.190

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
vice versa then you will need to change

your brake pads as well and that is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.529 
your brake pads as well and that is
definitely<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:04.159> job<00:02:04.429> you<00:02:04.789> need<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:04.939> stay<00:02:05.210> on<00:02:05.329> top

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539

honest I didn't really notice the
difference<00:02:33.349> but<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:33.980> might<00:02:34.160> have<00:02:34.310> more<00:02:34.459> luck

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
and if you have had then make sure you

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
it

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.890 
it
now<00:02:40.879> your<00:02:41.030> Pandits<00:02:41.450> shouldn't<00:02:41.690> have<00:02:41.780> moved

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
now your Pandits shouldn't have moved

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.170 
now your Pandits shouldn't have moved
over<00:02:42.290> time<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:42.860> if<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.040> has<00:02:43.220> done<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.819> want<00:02:44.090> to

over time but if it has done you want to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.400 
over time but if it has done you want to
know<00:02:44.299> about<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.629> it's<00:02:44.750> much<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:45.049> safety

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
know about it it's much for safety

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.069 
know about it it's much for safety
reasons<00:02:45.769> as<00:02:46.190> performance<00:02:46.849> so<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.450> check<00:02:47.870> just

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
reasons as performance so to check just

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.930 
reasons as performance so to check just
remember<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:48.739> you're<00:02:48.920> looking<00:02:49.310> for<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.730> pad

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
remember that you're looking for the pad

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.630 
remember that you're looking for the pad
to<00:02:50.180> hit<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.450> rim<00:02:50.599> squarely<00:02:51.220> evenly<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.459> then

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
to hit the rim squarely evenly and then

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.550 
to hit the rim squarely evenly and then
with<00:02:52.760> as<00:02:52.879> much<00:02:53.060> space<00:02:53.360> above<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.930> pad<00:02:54.319> as

below it if it goes too high or too low

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.289 
below it if it goes too high or too low
then<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.400> could<00:02:58.639> potentially<00:02:58.730> rubbing

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
then it could potentially rubbing

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.940 
then it could potentially rubbing
against<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.540> tire<00:02:59.810> or<00:03:00.079> end<00:03:00.260> up<00:03:00.380> in<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.620> spokes

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.009 
against a tire or end up in the spokes
and<00:03:01.130> by<00:03:01.819> hitting<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.120> rim<00:03:02.209> squarely<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.900> are

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
and by hitting the rim squarely you are

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.539 
and by hitting the rim squarely you are
getting<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.620> most<00:03:03.799> amount<00:03:04.100> of<00:03:04.220> performance

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
getting the most amount of performance

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.599 
getting the most amount of performance
if<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.780> squeal<00:03:06.200> slightly<00:03:06.709> then<00:03:07.099> you<00:03:07.190> can<00:03:07.340> tow

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
if it's squeal slightly then you can tow

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.580 
if it's squeal slightly then you can tow
the<00:03:07.819> pads<00:03:08.090> in<00:03:08.389> which<00:03:08.630> means<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.230> leading

the pads in which means that the leading

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.289 
the pads in which means that the leading
edge<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.829> the<00:03:09.950> pad<00:03:10.160> will<00:03:10.700> strike<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.150> rim

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
edge of the pad will strike the rim

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.210 
edge of the pad will strike the rim

edge to do any of these adjustments it's
a<00:03:15.440> very<00:03:15.680> simple<00:03:16.099> procedure<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.819> using<00:03:17.510> that

the brake pads wear out you will need to

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.580 
the brake pads wear out you will need to
move<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.820> lever<00:03:41.000> further<00:03:41.390> in<00:03:41.720> order<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.320> get

your brakes to come on to fix it is a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.110 
your brakes to come on to fix it is a
very<00:03:45.020> simple<00:03:45.470> thing<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.100> turning<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:46.760> dial

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
very simple thing of turning that dial

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.110 
very simple thing of turning that dial
there<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.800> that<00:03:48.800> effectively<00:03:49.340> tightens<00:03:50.000> the

there and that effectively tightens the
brakes<00:03:50.360> for<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:50.980> in<00:03:51.980> extreme<00:03:52.250> cases<00:03:52.550> though

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
brakes for you in extreme cases though

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.850

to<00:03:56.930> start<00:03:57.170> working<00:03:57.530> again<00:03:57.709> then<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.400> very

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
to start working again then you very

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.120 
to start working again then you very
simply<00:03:59.150> need<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.480> loosen<00:03:59.750> that<00:04:00.350> cable<00:04:00.830> cinch

simply need to loosen that cable cinch
bolt<00:04:01.400> there<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:02.080> then<00:04:03.430> push<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:05.060> pads<00:04:05.330> in

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
bolt there and then push the pads in

Monday video before and that is the

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.020 
Monday video before and that is the
friction<00:04:18.140> of<00:04:18.290> your<00:04:18.560> brake<00:04:18.859> cables<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:19.820> if<00:04:19.940> you

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
friction of your brake cables so if you

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.729 
friction of your brake cables so if you
ride<00:04:20.239> in<00:04:20.480> poor<00:04:20.690> conditions<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.260> lot<00:04:21.380> you'll

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
ride in poor conditions a lot you'll

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.670 
ride in poor conditions a lot you'll
find<00:04:22.040> that<00:04:22.160> water<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.940> grit<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:23.600> grime<00:04:23.900> find

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
find that water and grit and grime find

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.560 
find that water and grit and grime find
their<00:04:24.860> way<00:04:24.980> into<00:04:25.310> your<00:04:25.550> brake<00:04:25.940> cables<00:04:26.390> and

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
their way into your brake cables and

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.540 
their way into your brake cables and
then<00:04:26.750> essentially<00:04:27.229> increase<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.250> friction

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
then essentially increase the friction

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.790 
then essentially increase the friction
that<00:04:29.479> increase<00:04:29.750> in<00:04:29.870> friction<00:04:30.080> then<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.500> roads

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
that increase in friction then it roads

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.250 
that increase in friction then it roads
the<00:04:31.280> power<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.940> crucially<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.630> modulation

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
the power and crucially the modulation

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.740 
the power and crucially the modulation
of<00:04:33.530> your<00:04:33.650> brakes<00:04:34.040> it's<00:04:34.760> very<00:04:35.000> simple<00:04:35.300> fix<00:04:35.570> all

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
of your brakes it's very simple fix all

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.690 
of your brakes it's very simple fix all
you're<00:04:35.900> going<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.050> do<00:04:36.229> is<00:04:36.410> replace<00:04:36.800> your<00:04:37.430> brake

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
you're going to do is replace your brake

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.300 
you're going to do is replace your brake
cable<00:04:38.150> inners<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.660> outers<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:40.100> probably

cable inners and outers and you probably

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.950 
cable inners and outers and you probably
won't<00:04:40.520> be<00:04:40.669> able<00:04:40.700> to<00:04:40.850> underestimate<00:04:41.240> the

final<00:04:53.270> thing<00:04:53.419> to<00:04:53.450> check<00:04:53.750> is<00:04:54.200> something<00:04:54.620> again

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
final thing to check is something again

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.070 
final thing to check is something again
really<00:04:55.310> for<00:04:55.610> those<00:04:55.729> of<00:04:55.880> us<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.120> ride<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.690> pretty

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
really for those of us to ride in pretty

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.290 
really for those of us to ride in pretty
grim<00:04:57.350> conditions<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.550> is<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:59.030> brake

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
grim conditions and that is the brake

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.969 
grim conditions and that is the brake
caliper<00:04:59.840> itself<00:04:59.930> and<00:05:00.470> particularly<00:05:00.770> the

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
end up becoming seized meaning that it's

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.810

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
harder to pull your brake on and then

is too great if that's the case you can

seize brake caliper back to life so
there<00:05:26.240> we<00:05:26.300> go<00:05:26.360> then<00:05:26.600> it's<00:05:26.720> very<00:05:26.840> simple<00:05:27.289> things
