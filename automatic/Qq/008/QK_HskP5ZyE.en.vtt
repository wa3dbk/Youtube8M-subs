infinite series won a whole lot more
they<00:02:08.550> both<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.940> an<00:02:09.060> AB<00:02:09.270> crunch<00:02:09.599> which<00:02:09.840> moves

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
they both have an AB crunch which moves

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.980 
they both have an AB crunch which moves

shoulder on both figures the arms rotate

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
shoulder on both figures the arms rotate
they<00:02:20.030> also<00:02:20.270> move<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.670> down<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.300> arms
