left footed but I found that that didn't
even<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:53.100> matter<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.850> both<00:00:54.090> sides

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.690 
shots or something that I mentioned
earlier<00:02:02.180> it's<00:02:03.229> he<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.619> turn<00:02:05.399> games

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
earlier it's he can just turn games

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.029 
earlier it's he can just turn games
around<00:02:06.030> he<00:02:06.450> his<00:02:06.750> shot<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.649> come<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:07.920> of

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
around he his shot just can come out of

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.430 
around he his shot just can come out of
nowhere<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:09.629> right<00:02:09.660> there

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
nowhere just like that one right there

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.470 
nowhere just like that one right there
and<00:02:11.570> just<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.810> all<00:02:12.990> his<00:02:13.410> finishing<00:02:13.860> was<00:02:14.130> great

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and just and all his finishing was great

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.310 
and just and all his finishing was great
478<00:02:15.480> finishing<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.350> vision<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:18.330> think

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
478 finishing on this vision and I think

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.650 
478 finishing on this vision and I think
he<00:02:20.190> had<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.670> best<00:02:20.850> finish<00:02:21.090> shots<00:02:21.480> that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
he had one of the best finish shots that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.090 
he had one of the best finish shots that
I've<00:02:21.780> used<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.170> game<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.710> never<00:02:22.890> get

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
I've used in this game I can never get

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.600 
I've used in this game I can never get
finished<00:02:23.310> shots<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.850> land<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:26.250> seemed

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
finished shots to land but it seemed

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.350 
finished shots to land but it seemed
fine<00:02:26.940> with<00:02:27.150> piatti<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:29.180> some<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
fine with piatti and some of the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.480 
fine with piatti and some of the
negatives<00:02:30.750> about<00:02:30.840> him<00:02:31.140> are<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:32.070> he<00:02:32.370> is

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
negatives about him are that he is

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.270 
negatives about him are that he is
really<00:02:32.790> small<00:02:33.120> he<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.810> tiny<00:02:34.110> he's<00:02:34.500> five<00:02:34.950> foot

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
really small he is tiny he's five foot

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.490 
really small he is tiny he's five foot
four<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:37.280> he<00:02:38.280> his<00:02:38.610> strength<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.120> only<00:02:39.330> 30<00:02:39.750> so

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
four and he his strength is only 30 so

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.800 
four and he his strength is only 30 so
he<00:02:41.040> gets<00:02:41.490> muscled<00:02:41.940> off<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> ball<00:02:42.360> quite<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.600> bit

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
he gets muscled off the ball quite a bit

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.690 
he gets muscled off the ball quite a bit
but<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.200> was<00:02:43.350> sometimes<00:02:44.010> when<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.430> seemed

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
but it was sometimes when that seemed

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.060 
but it was sometimes when that seemed
kind<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.060> inconsistent<00:02:45.930> where<00:02:46.470> he<00:02:46.890> would

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
kind of inconsistent where he would

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.310 
kind of inconsistent where he would
actually<00:02:47.340> show<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:48.210> pretty<00:02:48.810> good<00:02:48.990> amount<00:02:49.170> of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
actually show a pretty good amount of

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.600 
actually show a pretty good amount of
strength<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.800> I'm<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.040> sure<00:02:50.100> what<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.580> up

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
strength so I'm not sure what was up

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.330 
strength so I'm not sure what was up
with<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.880> but<00:02:51.840> that's<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.920> clips<00:02:53.190> i

up he is running about 280 k on the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.660 
up he is running about 280 k on the
PlayStation<00:03:04.380> 3<00:03:04.590> at<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.710> Mona<00:03:04.920> I'm<00:03:05.340> not<00:03:05.490> sure

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
PlayStation 3 at the Mona I'm not sure

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.410 
PlayStation 3 at the Mona I'm not sure
about<00:03:05.700> xbox<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.990> know<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:08.610> database<00:03:09.240> is

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
about xbox and I know the database is

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.390 
about xbox and I know the database is
kind<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.690> messed<00:03:09.840> up<00:03:10.020> right<00:03:10.200> now<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:10.740> or<00:03:11.070> it's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
kind of messed up right now but or it's

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.910 
kind of messed up right now but or it's
just<00:03:11.520> inaccurate<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.530> that's<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.710> be<00:03:13.770> on

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
just inaccurate so that's going to be on

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.070 
just inaccurate so that's going to be on
for<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.250> video<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.790> think<00:03:15.209> piatti<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:15.989> all

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.750 
for this video I think piatti and all
was<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.320> really<00:03:16.770> great<00:03:16.860> player<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.580> should

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
was a really great player you should

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.979 
was a really great player you should
pick<00:03:17.880> them<00:03:18.000> up<00:03:18.060> if<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.300> can<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.750> i'll<00:03:18.810> see<00:03:18.930> you
