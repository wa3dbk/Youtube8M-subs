not winning exhaust and it's got a
little<00:00:26.670> bit<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.090> looks<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.810> somebody<00:00:28.170> was

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
little bit of looks like somebody was

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
little bit of looks like somebody was
doing<00:00:28.410> some<00:00:28.710> scraping<00:00:30.439> around<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:35.660> so<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
doing some scraping around it so the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.080 
doing some scraping around it so the
needs<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.079> little<00:00:37.200> bit<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> cleanup<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.520> it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
needs a little bit of cleanup but it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.779 
needs a little bit of cleanup but it
does<00:00:39.300> turn<00:00:39.809> over<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:42.260> it<00:00:43.260> didn't<00:00:44.160> want<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.520> run

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
does turn over and it didn't want to run

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.209 
does turn over and it didn't want to run
I<00:00:45.000> believe<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.780> low<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.230> compression<00:00:46.680> so

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
I believe it is low on compression so

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.270 
I believe it is low on compression so
it's<00:00:47.489> gonna<00:00:47.640> need<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.450> stuck<00:00:48.780> rings<00:00:49.440> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it's gonna need a it got stuck rings so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.770 
it's gonna need a it got stuck rings so
it's<00:00:50.430> gonna<00:00:50.550> need<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.090> Rings<00:00:51.690> reset<00:00:53.780> check

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it's gonna need the Rings reset check

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.979 
it's gonna need the Rings reset check
done<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.620> did<00:00:56.460> check<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.030> timing<00:00:57.600> chain<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
done I did check the timing chain the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.099 
done I did check the timing chain the
timing<00:00:58.350> chain<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.770> good<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.219> solid<00:00:59.960> all<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
timing chain is good and solid all the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.100 
timing chain is good and solid all the
valves<00:01:01.320> seem<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.890> working<00:01:02.190> ok<00:01:02.899> it<00:01:03.899> does

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
valves seem to be working ok it does

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.100 
valves seem to be working ok it does
turn<00:01:04.350> over<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.280> electric<00:01:05.790> start<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
turn over with the electric start and it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.969 
turn over with the electric start and it
does<00:01:07.290> kick<00:01:07.619> over<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> kick<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
does kick over with the kick so that is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.700 
does kick over with the kick so that is
all<00:01:11.220> good<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:12.060> was<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> bit<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.650> a
