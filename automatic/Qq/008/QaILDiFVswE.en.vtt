00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.670 
this video I want to talk a little bit
about<00:00:05.819> some<00:00:06.120> passing<00:00:06.660> fundamentals<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.319> how

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
about some passing fundamentals and how

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.780 
about some passing fundamentals and how
you<00:00:07.740> can<00:00:07.950> work<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.340> your<00:00:08.400> passing

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
you can work on your passing

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.430 
you can work on your passing
fundamentals<00:00:09.210> at<00:00:09.360> home<00:00:09.750> using<00:00:10.019> some<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
fundamentals at home using some of the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.200 
fundamentals at home using some of the
dry<00:00:10.559> land<00:00:10.740> equipment<00:00:10.920> from<00:00:11.219> hockey<00:00:11.490> shot<00:00:11.759> calm

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
dry land equipment from hockey shot calm

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.360 
dry land equipment from hockey shot calm
so<00:00:13.139> Before<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.500> jump<00:00:13.559> right<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.009> let<00:00:14.160> me<00:00:14.190> just

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
so Before we jump right in let me just

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.410 
so Before we jump right in let me just
show<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:14.700> equipment<00:00:14.969> we're<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.360> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
show you what equipment we're going to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.849 
show you what equipment we're going to
be<00:00:15.480> using<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.839> demonstrate<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.470> passing

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
be using to demonstrate this passing

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.250 
be using to demonstrate this passing
technique<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:18.029> we're<00:00:18.119> going<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.300> start<00:00:18.330> with

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
technique so we're going to start with

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.470 
technique so we're going to start with
the<00:00:19.920> hockey<00:00:20.100> shot<00:00:20.340> dryland<00:00:20.670> training<00:00:20.789> pox<00:00:21.240> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the hockey shot dryland training pox and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.140 
the hockey shot dryland training pox and
these<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.529> great<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:23.939> there

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
these are great you can see there

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.279 
these are great you can see there
they've<00:00:24.420> got<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:24.720> bit<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.900> knobs<00:00:25.109> on

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
they've got a little bit of knobs on

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.490 
they've got a little bit of knobs on
them<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:25.980> slide<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.640> well<00:00:27.019> in<00:00:28.019> off<00:00:28.320> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
them so they slide really well in off I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.919 
them so they slide really well in off I
surfaces<00:00:28.980> especially<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.660> dryland

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
surfaces especially on the dryland

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.179 
surfaces especially on the dryland
flooring<00:00:31.230> tiles<00:00:31.500> which<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> surface

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
flooring tiles which is the surface

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.610 
flooring tiles which is the surface
we're<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.730> working<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.180> with

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
we're going to be working on this with

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.670 
we're going to be working on this with
so<00:00:34.620> we've<00:00:34.739> got<00:00:35.300> dry<00:00:36.300> land<00:00:36.480> training<00:00:36.510> pucks<00:00:36.899> dry

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so we've got dry land training pucks dry

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.010 
so we've got dry land training pucks dry
line<00:00:37.829> flooring<00:00:38.219> tiles<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.730> then<00:00:39.239> we're<00:00:39.930> going

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
line flooring tiles and then we're going

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.690 
line flooring tiles and then we're going
to<00:00:40.079> using<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> passing<00:00:40.710> rebounder<00:00:41.129> called<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
to using a passing rebounder called the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.940 
to using a passing rebounder called the
past<00:00:42.030> master<00:00:42.510> I've<00:00:43.020> used<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:43.350> quite<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> bit

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
past master I've used these quite a bit

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.520 
past master I've used these quite a bit
they're<00:00:44.190> great<00:00:44.539> you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.660> use<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.050> or<00:00:46.350> off

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
they're great you can use them on or off

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
they're great you can use them on or off
the<00:00:46.559> ice<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.070> you're<00:00:47.190> using<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> ice

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the ice if you're using them off the ice

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
the ice if you're using them off the ice
let<00:00:48.059> me<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.270> show<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.390> underneath<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.559> can

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
let me just show you underneath you can

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.900 
let me just show you underneath you can
say<00:00:49.770> they've<00:00:49.920> got<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> kind<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> rubber

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
say they've got like a kind of a rubber

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.410 
say they've got like a kind of a rubber
band<00:00:51.890> that's<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.070> rebounding<00:00:53.489> band<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> if

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
band that's the rebounding band and if

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.850 
band that's the rebounding band and if
you<00:00:54.510> use<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> mafi<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> state<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.559> put<00:00:55.770> these

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
you use a mafi I state you put these

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.939 
you use a mafi I state you put these
sticky<00:00:56.190> pads<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.629> if<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.710> actually

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
sticky pads on if not you can actually

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
sticky pads on if not you can actually
it's<00:00:59.910> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> hard<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.899> pop

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
it's kind of hard to see but you can pop

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.219 
it's kind of hard to see but you can pop
the<00:01:01.320> middle<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.920> sticky<00:01:02.100> pad<00:01:02.399> and

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
the middle out of that sticky pad and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.620 
the middle out of that sticky pad and
there's<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.640> spot<00:01:05.640> where<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> spike<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.360> go<00:01:06.479> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
there's a spot where a spike can go in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.320 
there's a spot where a spike can go in
so<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.560> use<00:01:07.680> these<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:08.010> spikes<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:09.030> on

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
so you can use these with spikes for on

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
so you can use these with spikes for on
ice<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> sticky<00:01:10.619> pads<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.220> off-ice

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
ice or with the sticky pads for off-ice

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.510 
ice or with the sticky pads for off-ice
training<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.799> pretty<00:01:14.280> simple

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
training and that's it so pretty simple

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.810 
training and that's it so pretty simple
set<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.330> pucks<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.840> rebounder<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.610> good

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
set up some pucks a rebounder and a good

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.630 
set up some pucks a rebounder and a good
surface<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.600> work<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.830> let<00:01:20.159> me<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.610> ahead

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
surface to work with so let me go ahead

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.940 
surface to work with so let me go ahead
and<00:01:20.820> we'll<00:01:21.210> cut<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.600> show<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.710> technique

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and we'll cut and show you the technique

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.600 
and we'll cut and show you the technique
and<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:23.700> how<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> work<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.659> home<00:01:25.610> ok

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and then how to work on this at home ok

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.830 
and then how to work on this at home ok
my<00:01:26.759> philosophy<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.210> maybe<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> little<00:01:27.689> bit

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
my philosophy is maybe a little bit

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.149 
my philosophy is maybe a little bit
different<00:01:28.140> than<00:01:28.229> other<00:01:28.409> coaches<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.890> terms<00:01:29.040> of

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
different than other coaches in terms of

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.880 
different than other coaches in terms of
passing<00:01:29.610> technique<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.270> development<00:01:30.890> but

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
passing technique and development but

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.780 
passing technique and development but
obviously<00:01:32.280> there<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> number<00:01:32.579> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
obviously there are a number of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.090 
obviously there are a number of
different<00:01:32.909> paths<00:01:33.299> types<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.079> these<00:01:34.829> past

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
different paths types and these past

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.560 
different paths types and these past
types<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.460> come<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.700> useful<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.270> different

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
types can come in useful in different

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.109 
types can come in useful in different
scenarios<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.530> games<00:01:37.799> my<00:01:38.549> philosophy<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
scenarios in the games my philosophy is

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.240 
scenarios in the games my philosophy is
you<00:01:39.420> need<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.750> able<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.409> them<00:01:40.770> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
you need to be able to do all of them so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.710 
you need to be able to do all of them so
you<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:41.820> coaches<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.600> focus

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you know some coaches I know just focus

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.719 
you know some coaches I know just focus
mainly<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.229> touch<00:01:43.470> passes<00:01:43.950> some<00:01:44.159> coaches<00:01:44.490> miss

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
mainly on touch passes some coaches miss

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.340 
mainly on touch passes some coaches miss
you<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.240> say<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.570> always<00:01:46.020> got<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.290> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
you know say it's always got to be a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.920 
you know say it's always got to be a
cushion<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.799> sweep<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.750> then

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
cushion and sweep you know and then

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.120 
cushion and sweep you know and then
there's<00:01:49.110> other<00:01:49.259> there's<00:01:49.560> other<00:01:49.710> pass<00:01:49.920> types

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
there's other there's other pass types

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
there's other there's other pass types
as<00:01:50.310> well<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.729> got<00:01:50.850> saucer<00:01:51.240> pass<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
as well you know you got saucer pass and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.910 
as well you know you got saucer pass and
stuff<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.899> we're<00:01:52.380> not<00:01:52.470> focusing<00:01:52.799> as

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
stuff like that we're not focusing as

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
stuff like that we're not focusing as
much<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.159> saucer<00:01:53.399> passes<00:01:53.820> today<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.630> my

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
much on saucer passes today but my

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.740 
much on saucer passes today but my
philosophy<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> every<00:01:56.640> player<00:01:56.939> should<00:01:57.570> be

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
philosophy is every player should be

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.569 
philosophy is every player should be
able<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.170> cushion<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.770> sweep<00:01:59.009> now<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> know

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
able to do cushion and sweep now I know

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.069 
able to do cushion and sweep now I know
I've<00:01:59.820> heard<00:02:00.030> coaches<00:02:00.390> say<00:02:00.540> well<00:02:00.719> yeah<00:02:00.930> but

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
I've heard coaches say well yeah but

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.929 
I've heard coaches say well yeah but
when<00:02:01.320> you're<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.590> full<00:02:01.890> speed<00:02:02.070> cushion

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
when you're going full speed cushion

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.149 
when you're going full speed cushion
sweep<00:02:03.210> isn't<00:02:03.509> effective<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.079> don't<00:02:04.979> believe

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
sweep isn't effective I don't believe

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.039 
sweep isn't effective I don't believe
that<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.340> believe<00:02:05.640> every<00:02:06.119> player<00:02:06.360> needs<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.960> be

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
that I believe every player needs to be

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.169 
that I believe every player needs to be
able<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.740> needs<00:02:08.580> also<00:02:08.879> be<00:02:08.970> able<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
able to do it and needs also be able to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.089 
able to do it and needs also be able to
do<00:02:09.270> touch<00:02:09.479> pass<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> game

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
do touch pass and so then in a game

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.680 
do touch pass and so then in a game
situation<00:02:11.250> whichever<00:02:12.030> one<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.390> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.540> make

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
situation whichever one is going to make

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.770 
situation whichever one is going to make
the<00:02:12.780> most<00:02:12.870> sense<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.379> player

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
the most sense that player

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.930 
the most sense that player
has<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.410> his<00:02:14.620> or<00:02:14.740> her<00:02:14.770> arsenal<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.520> can

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
has that in his or her arsenal and can

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.690 
has that in his or her arsenal and can
use<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:16.780> when<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.770> whenever<00:02:18.040> we're<00:02:18.310> talking

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
use it so when it whenever we're talking

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.030 
use it so when it whenever we're talking
technique<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.300> always<00:02:19.750> start<00:02:20.200> by<00:02:20.350> developing

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
technique I always start by developing

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.309 
technique I always start by developing
the<00:02:21.310> cushion<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.819> sweet<00:02:22.060> pass<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.600> the

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
the cushion and sweet pass and the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.199 
the cushion and sweet pass and the
cushion<00:02:23.620> sweep<00:02:23.890> again<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.850> this<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.120> little

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
cushion sweep again I do this a little

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.430 
cushion sweep again I do this a little
bit<00:02:25.390> differently<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.900> part<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.319> as<00:02:26.410> well

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
bit differently this part of it as well

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.040 
bit differently this part of it as well
but<00:02:27.100> what<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.640> like<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.030> see<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.959> know

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
but what I like to see is you know

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.180 
but what I like to see is you know
obviously<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.470> player<00:02:29.650> brings<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> puck

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
obviously the player brings the puck

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.460 
obviously the player brings the puck
back<00:02:30.520> as<00:02:30.850> he<00:02:31.480> or<00:02:31.600> she<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.750> ready<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.170> make<00:02:32.319> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
back as he or she is ready to make the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.830 
back as he or she is ready to make the
pass<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.890> then<00:02:33.310> as<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:34.090> past<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.450> being<00:02:34.630> made

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
pass and then as the past is being made

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.470 
pass and then as the past is being made
it's<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.230> nice<00:02:35.590> sweep<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.060> proxy<00:02:37.420> is

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
it's just nice sweep and the proxy is

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.840 
it's just nice sweep and the proxy is
flat<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.260> ice<00:02:38.410> or<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.069> flooring<00:02:39.550> tiles

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
flat on the ice or on the flooring tiles

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.000 
flat on the ice or on the flooring tiles
in<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.060> situation<00:02:40.330> okay<00:02:41.110> now<00:02:41.560> when<00:02:41.890> you're

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
in this situation okay now when you're

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.949 
in this situation okay now when you're
receiving<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.730> pass<00:02:42.940> what<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.569> like<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.930> see

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
receiving the pass what I like to see

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.030 
receiving the pass what I like to see
and<00:02:44.290> I'm<00:02:44.350> not<00:02:44.440> going<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.709> enough<00:02:44.739> space

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
and I'm not going to have enough space

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.830 
and I'm not going to have enough space
on<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> camera<00:02:45.610> on<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.360> film<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.660> do<00:02:46.750> this

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
on the camera on the the film to do this

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.250 
on the camera on the the film to do this
but<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.950> tell<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> players<00:02:49.180> turn<00:02:49.750> your<00:02:49.959> stick

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
but I tell the players turn your stick

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.740 
but I tell the players turn your stick
blade<00:02:50.560> up<00:02:50.769> okay<00:02:51.670> that's<00:02:51.970> that's<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
blade up okay that's that's this is the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.270 
blade up okay that's that's this is the
part<00:02:52.959> that's<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.170> little<00:02:53.350> bit<00:02:53.440> different<00:02:53.769> turn

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
part that's a little bit different turn

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.430 
part that's a little bit different turn
your<00:02:54.370> stick<00:02:54.670> blade<00:02:54.940> up<00:02:55.180> then<00:02:55.780> as<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.230> puck

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
your stick blade up then as the puck

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.120 
your stick blade up then as the puck
comes<00:02:56.739> in<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.519> roll<00:02:57.880> your<00:02:58.300> top<00:02:58.840> hand<00:02:59.110> over<00:02:59.500> now

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
comes in you roll your top hand over now

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.770 
comes in you roll your top hand over now
the<00:03:00.580> reason<00:03:00.819> why<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.360> different<00:03:01.390> i'm

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
the reason why this is different i'm

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.150 
the reason why this is different i'm
going<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:01.989> turn<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.290> angle<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:02.800> can<00:03:02.920> see

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
going to turn the angle so you can see

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.630 
going to turn the angle so you can see
this<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:03.880> i'm<00:03:03.970> receiving<00:03:04.390> okay<00:03:05.640> stick

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
this but if i'm receiving okay stick

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.210 
this but if i'm receiving okay stick
blade<00:03:06.880> up<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.330> then<00:03:08.110> as<00:03:08.319> i<00:03:08.470> roll<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.860> over<00:03:08.920> as

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
blade up and then as i roll it over as

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.990 
blade up and then as i roll it over as
you<00:03:09.459> can<00:03:09.610> see<00:03:09.940> my<00:03:10.600> receiving<00:03:11.080> target<00:03:11.680> is

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
you can see my receiving target is

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.420 
you can see my receiving target is
square<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.420> passer<00:03:14.050> along<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.040> entire

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
square to the passer along the entire

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.280 
square to the passer along the entire
route<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.450> my<00:03:16.810> cushion<00:03:17.319> ok<00:03:18.070> now<00:03:18.940> what<00:03:19.870> lazier

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
route of my cushion ok now what lazier

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.390 
route of my cushion ok now what lazier
players<00:03:20.530> do<00:03:20.739> or<00:03:20.860> players<00:03:21.070> I<00:03:21.130> haven't<00:03:21.310> been

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
players do or players I haven't been

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.460 
players do or players I haven't been
taught<00:03:21.610> right<00:03:21.880> it's<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.570> natural<00:03:22.900> way<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.290> do

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
taught right it's the natural way to do

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.170 
taught right it's the natural way to do
it<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.739> they<00:03:23.890> start<00:03:24.190> out<00:03:24.340> here<00:03:24.760> they're<00:03:25.000> still

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
it is they start out here they're still

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.220 
it is they start out here they're still
trying<00:03:25.269> to<00:03:25.420> do<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.570> cushion<00:03:25.840> but<00:03:25.959> look<00:03:26.110> at

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
trying to do the cushion but look at

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.479 
trying to do the cushion but look at
where<00:03:26.320> their<00:03:26.470> stick<00:03:26.650> blade<00:03:26.829> is<00:03:26.950> they<00:03:27.280> haven't

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
where their stick blade is they haven't

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.670 
where their stick blade is they haven't
opened<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.060> up<00:03:28.209> okay<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.049> they<00:03:29.140> start<00:03:29.440> out<00:03:29.530> here

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
opened it up okay so they start out here

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.410 
opened it up okay so they start out here
I<00:03:29.739> see<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.220> lot<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.850> then<00:03:31.090> as<00:03:31.239> they're

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
I see this a lot and then as they're

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.840 
I see this a lot and then as they're
coming<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:32.190> they're<00:03:33.190> trying<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.519> pull<00:03:33.670> back

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
coming in they're trying to pull back

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.640 
coming in they're trying to pull back
now<00:03:34.360> if<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.660> look<00:03:34.840> at<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:34.989> timing<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.500> this

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
now if you look at the timing of this

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.979 
now if you look at the timing of this
there's<00:03:36.160> only<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.549> split<00:03:37.030> second<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.780> puck

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
there's only a split second of the puck

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.110 
there's only a split second of the puck
can<00:03:38.200> hit<00:03:38.470> where<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:38.980> blades<00:03:39.280> actually<00:03:39.700> square

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
can hit where the blades actually square

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.539 
can hit where the blades actually square
and<00:03:40.420> then<00:03:41.170> it's<00:03:41.560> not<00:03:41.799> square<00:03:42.040> again<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:42.430> it's

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
and then it's not square again so it's

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.430 
and then it's not square again so it's
not<00:03:42.700> square<00:03:43.030> knot<00:03:43.359> square<00:03:43.720> knot<00:03:43.930> square<00:03:44.260> knot

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
not square knot square knot square knot

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.640 
not square knot square knot square knot
square<00:03:45.540> knot<00:03:46.540> square<00:03:46.930> knot<00:03:47.140> square<00:03:47.470> knot

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.220

square<00:03:47.980> knot<00:03:48.160> square<00:03:48.459> square<00:03:48.910> here<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:49.510> then

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
square knot square square here and then

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.110 
square knot square square here and then
not<00:03:50.440> square<00:03:50.769> again<00:03:51.010> whereas<00:03:51.670> if<00:03:51.790> you're<00:03:51.940> doing

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
not square again whereas if you're doing

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.880 
not square again whereas if you're doing
it<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.239> way<00:03:52.269> i<00:03:52.359> recommend<00:03:52.930> it's<00:03:53.109> square

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
it the way i recommend it's square

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.470 
it the way i recommend it's square
square<00:03:54.310> square<00:03:54.340> square<00:03:54.730> square<00:03:55.120> square

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
square square square square square

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.560 
square square square square square
square<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.799> whole<00:03:56.950> way<00:03:57.160> through<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:57.940> why

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
square the whole way through so why

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.199 
square the whole way through so why
that's<00:03:58.840> useful<00:03:59.109> is<00:03:59.440> if<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.549> get<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.700> situation

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
that's useful is if you get a situation

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.640 
that's useful is if you get a situation
where<00:04:01.299> you've<00:04:01.420> misread<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.200> speed<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
where you've misread the speed of the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.500 
where you've misread the speed of the
puck<00:04:02.859> ok<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.489> pucks<00:04:03.670> coming<00:04:03.970> in<00:04:04.060> faster

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
puck ok so the pucks coming in faster

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.330 
puck ok so the pucks coming in faster
than<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.720> anticipated<00:04:05.290> instead<00:04:06.130> of<00:04:06.160> having

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
than you anticipated instead of having

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.280 
than you anticipated instead of having
to<00:04:06.549> try<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:06.910> know<00:04:07.030> pull<00:04:07.390> back<00:04:07.600> quicker<00:04:07.959> and

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
to try to you know pull back quicker and

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.830 
to try to you know pull back quicker and
hope<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.340> hit<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.820> hope<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.690> puck

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
hope that you hit it hope that the puck

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.840 
hope that you hit it hope that the puck
hits<00:04:11.019> your<00:04:11.140> stick<00:04:11.380> square<00:04:11.859> while<00:04:12.430> your<00:04:12.640> stick

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
hits your stick square while your stick

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.259 
hits your stick square while your stick
is<00:04:12.880> square<00:04:13.299> and<00:04:13.450> not<00:04:14.140> roll<00:04:14.350> off<00:04:14.850> it's<00:04:15.850> it's<00:04:16.150> a

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
is square and not roll off it's it's a

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.590 
is square and not roll off it's it's a
lot<00:04:16.479> easier<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.870> just<00:04:17.109> time<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.700> if<00:04:18.700> your

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
lot easier to just time it if your

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.060 
lot easier to just time it if your
technique<00:04:20.019> is<00:04:20.109> like<00:04:20.289> this<00:04:20.470> so<00:04:20.709> if<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.890> puck

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
technique is like this so if the puck

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.980 
technique is like this so if the puck
comes<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.489> puck<00:04:22.180> comes<00:04:22.390> in<00:04:22.510> harder<00:04:22.780> than<00:04:22.900> you

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
comes in puck comes in harder than you

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.360 
comes in puck comes in harder than you
expect<00:04:23.320> boom<00:04:23.909> techniques<00:04:24.909> so<00:04:25.120> same

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
expect boom techniques so same

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.090 
expect boom techniques so same
okay<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.000> believe<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.630> or<00:04:27.750> not<00:04:27.870> you'll<00:04:28.800> you'll

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
okay and believe it or not you'll you'll

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.590 
okay and believe it or not you'll you'll
be<00:04:29.190> able<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.400> control<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:29.820> puck<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.030> lot<00:04:30.389> more

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
be able to control the puck a lot more

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.150 
be able to control the puck a lot more
effectively<00:04:30.990> this<00:04:31.169> way<00:04:31.320> you're<00:04:31.919> probably

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
effectively this way you're probably

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.650 
effectively this way you're probably
going<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.460> have<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.610> relearn<00:04:33.090> this<00:04:33.360> if<00:04:33.540> you've

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
going to have to relearn this if you've

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.900 
going to have to relearn this if you've
learned<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.020> wrong<00:04:34.139> way<00:04:34.199> but<00:04:35.010> at<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.880> end

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
learned it the wrong way but at the end

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.100 
learned it the wrong way but at the end
of<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.120> day<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.360> works<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.600> lot<00:04:36.690> better<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.020> let

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
of the day it works a lot better so let

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.719 
of the day it works a lot better so let
me<00:04:37.199> try<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.410> show<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:37.680> what<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:38.370> looks<00:04:38.430> like

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
me try to show you what this looks like

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.760 
me try to show you what this looks like
a<00:04:38.850> little<00:04:39.030> bit<00:04:39.270> we'll<00:04:40.110> see<00:04:40.229> if<00:04:40.290> we<00:04:40.380> can<00:04:40.500> keep<00:04:40.620> it

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
a little bit we'll see if we can keep it

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.090 
a little bit we'll see if we can keep it
all<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.070> frame<00:04:41.750> okay<00:04:42.750> see<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.590> start<00:04:44.010> with

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
all in the frame okay see I start with

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:59.120 
all in the frame okay see I start with
my<00:04:44.220> stick<00:04:44.490> play<00:04:44.699> it<00:04:44.820> up<00:04:57.710> okay<00:04:58.710> so<00:04:58.770> hopefully

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
my stick play it up okay so hopefully

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.710 
my stick play it up okay so hopefully
you<00:04:59.190> see<00:04:59.310> how<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.490> works<00:04:59.760> what<00:05:00.479> I'm<00:05:00.570> going<00:05:00.600> to

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
you see how that works what I'm going to

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.120 
you see how that works what I'm going to
do<00:05:00.840> now<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.289> change<00:05:01.620> you<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.860> little<00:05:01.889> bit

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
do now is change you a little bit

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.379 
do now is change you a little bit
different<00:05:02.370> camera<00:05:02.639> angle<00:05:02.940> so<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.030> can<00:05:03.180> see

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
different camera angle so you can see

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.909 
different camera angle so you can see
what<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:03.780> looks<00:05:03.930> like<00:05:03.990> with<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:04.260> past<00:05:04.470> master

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
what it looks like with the past master

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.129 
what it looks like with the past master
and<00:05:05.610> everything<00:05:05.910> kind<00:05:06.030> of<00:05:06.120> in<00:05:06.240> effect<00:05:06.810> all<00:05:07.020> at

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
and everything kind of in effect all at

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.350 
and everything kind of in effect all at
the<00:05:07.229> same<00:05:07.380> time<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.830> then<00:05:08.820> we'll<00:05:09.240> go<00:05:09.330> from

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
the same time and then we'll go from

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.580 
the same time and then we'll go from
there<00:05:09.510> okay<00:05:12.110> so<00:05:13.110> let's<00:05:13.260> show<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.380> what<00:05:13.530> this

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
there okay so let's show you what this

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.830 
there okay so let's show you what this
looks<00:05:13.650> like<00:05:13.860> straight<00:05:14.190> on<00:05:14.430> now<00:05:14.639> as<00:05:15.539> you<00:05:15.720> can

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
looks like straight on now as you can

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:28.010 
looks like straight on now as you can
see<00:05:16.110> my<00:05:16.380> stick<00:05:16.860> stay<00:05:17.789> square<00:05:18.300> with<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.600> target

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.120 

now<00:05:29.020> after<00:05:29.440> you've<00:05:29.530> gotten<00:05:29.710> to<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:29.920> point

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
now after you've gotten to the point

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.280 
now after you've gotten to the point
where<00:05:30.280> your<00:05:30.970> cushion<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:31.600> sweet<00:05:31.810> pass<00:05:32.020> is

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
where your cushion and sweet pass is

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.960 
where your cushion and sweet pass is
kind<00:05:32.500> of<00:05:32.560> nailed<00:05:32.710> down<00:05:32.920> then<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.670> can<00:05:33.820> start

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
kind of nailed down then you can start

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.730 
kind of nailed down then you can start
working<00:05:34.210> on<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:34.540> more<00:05:34.720> advanced<00:05:35.200> passes<00:05:35.620> like

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
working on the more advanced passes like

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.920 
working on the more advanced passes like
touch<00:05:36.010> passes<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.640> saucer<00:05:37.390> passes<00:05:37.720> as<00:05:37.780> well

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
touch passes and saucer passes as well

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.090 
touch passes and saucer passes as well
but<00:05:38.080> we're<00:05:38.200> not<00:05:38.290> going<00:05:38.410> to<00:05:38.470> focus<00:05:38.620> on<00:05:38.800> that<00:05:38.920> for

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
but we're not going to focus on that for

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.710 
but we're not going to focus on that for
this<00:05:39.220> video<00:05:39.660> with<00:05:40.660> touch<00:05:40.960> passes<00:05:41.530> the<00:05:41.950> idea<00:05:42.370> is

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
this video with touch passes the idea is

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.910 
this video with touch passes the idea is
the<00:05:43.720> biggest<00:05:44.020> problem<00:05:44.080> with<00:05:44.350> touch<00:05:44.470> passes<00:05:44.800> is

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
the biggest problem with touch passes is

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.010 
the biggest problem with touch passes is
players<00:05:45.190> can't<00:05:45.490> control<00:05:45.910> them<00:05:46.150> they<00:05:46.540> flip<00:05:46.840> up

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
players can't control them they flip up

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.450 
players can't control them they flip up
on<00:05:47.260> them<00:05:47.410> or<00:05:47.530> they<00:05:47.590> bounce<00:05:47.800> off<00:05:47.980> their<00:05:48.160> stick

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
on them or they bounce off their stick

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.740 
on them or they bounce off their stick
in<00:05:48.610> an<00:05:48.700> area<00:05:48.820> that<00:05:48.940> they're<00:05:49.090> not<00:05:49.270> expecting<00:05:49.540> or

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
in an area that they're not expecting or

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.620 
in an area that they're not expecting or
not<00:05:49.870> intending<00:05:50.440> so<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.490> key<00:05:51.700> to<00:05:51.880> touch<00:05:52.090> passes

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
not intending so the key to touch passes

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.710 
not intending so the key to touch passes
is<00:05:52.780> what<00:05:53.560> you're<00:05:53.710> going<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:53.890> do<00:05:54.040> is<00:05:54.510> push<00:05:55.510> your

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
is what you're going to do is push your

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.560 
is what you're going to do is push your
bottom<00:05:56.140> hand<00:05:56.500> or<00:05:56.800> sorry<00:05:57.580> push<00:05:57.820> your<00:05:58.000> top<00:05:58.240> hand

bottom hand or sorry push your top hand

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.960 
bottom hand or sorry push your top hand
forward<00:05:58.960> now<00:05:59.710> what<00:05:59.920> that<00:06:00.070> does<00:06:00.340> is<00:06:00.580> as<00:06:00.820> you<00:06:00.910> can

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
forward now what that does is as you can

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.540 
forward now what that does is as you can
see<00:06:01.090> pushing<00:06:01.930> the<00:06:02.020> top<00:06:02.200> hand<00:06:02.500> forward<00:06:02.800> cups

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
see pushing the top hand forward cups

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.610 
see pushing the top hand forward cups
the<00:06:03.850> blade<00:06:04.030> of<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.270> stick<00:06:04.540> okay<00:06:05.260> I'm<00:06:05.440> going<00:06:05.530> to

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
the blade of the stick okay I'm going to

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.690 
the blade of the stick okay I'm going to
try<00:06:05.740> to<00:06:05.770> show<00:06:05.980> you<00:06:06.040> this<00:06:06.130> a<00:06:06.250> little<00:06:06.400> bit<00:06:06.580> better

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
try to show you this a little bit better

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.480 
try to show you this a little bit better
angle<00:06:07.120> okay<00:06:07.840> from<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.230> side<00:06:08.470> angle<00:06:08.860> as<00:06:08.980> you

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
angle okay from the side angle as you

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.250 
angle okay from the side angle as you
push<00:06:09.670> your<00:06:09.790> top<00:06:10.000> hand<00:06:10.270> forward<00:06:10.600> it<00:06:10.810> cups<00:06:11.080> the

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
push your top hand forward it cups the

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.680 
push your top hand forward it cups the
blade<00:06:11.440> of<00:06:11.470> your<00:06:11.650> stick<00:06:11.920> then<00:06:12.550> with<00:06:13.090> that<00:06:13.120> angle

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
blade of your stick then with that angle

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.150 
blade of your stick then with that angle
all<00:06:13.870> you're<00:06:14.170> doing<00:06:14.200> is<00:06:14.530> literally<00:06:14.830> just<00:06:15.040> a

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
all you're doing is literally just a

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.370 
all you're doing is literally just a
cross-checking<00:06:15.790> motion<00:06:16.300> with<00:06:16.870> your<00:06:16.900> stick

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
cross-checking motion with your stick

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.190 
cross-checking motion with your stick
angle<00:06:17.830> place<00:06:18.040> still<00:06:18.730> cupped<00:06:19.030> stick<00:06:19.960> stays

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
angle place still cupped stick stays

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.440 
angle place still cupped stick stays
cupped<00:06:20.590> on<00:06:20.770> the<00:06:20.890> ice<00:06:21.040> bottom<00:06:21.970> hand<00:06:22.180> has<00:06:22.360> to

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
cupped on the ice bottom hand has to

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.090 
cupped on the ice bottom hand has to
have<00:06:22.540> a<00:06:22.570> lot<00:06:22.690> of<00:06:22.720> strength<00:06:23.020> on<00:06:23.170> this<00:06:23.350> in<00:06:23.830> order

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
have a lot of strength on this in order

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.250 
have a lot of strength on this in order
to<00:06:24.220> especially<00:06:24.520> fits<00:06:24.850> if<00:06:25.030> your<00:06:25.210> touch<00:06:25.780> passing

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
to especially fits if your touch passing

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.340 
to especially fits if your touch passing
a<00:06:26.380> hard<00:06:26.590> pass<00:06:26.830> okay<00:06:27.610> but<00:06:28.450> that's<00:06:28.600> the<00:06:28.870> concept

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
a hard pass okay but that's the concept

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.140 
a hard pass okay but that's the concept
so<00:06:29.650> I'm<00:06:29.830> going<00:06:29.980> to<00:06:30.010> bounce<00:06:30.610> this<00:06:30.790> into<00:06:31.060> the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
so I'm going to bounce this into the

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.660 
so I'm going to bounce this into the
past<00:06:31.330> master<00:06:31.720> again<00:06:31.960> and<00:06:32.170> use<00:06:32.920> touch<00:06:33.190> passes

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
past master again and use touch passes

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.030 
past master again and use touch passes
this<00:06:33.760> time<00:06:34.000> and<00:06:34.210> you<00:06:34.510> can<00:06:34.660> see<00:06:34.960> the<00:06:35.410> angle<00:06:35.920> of

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
this time and you can see the angle of

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.430 
this time and you can see the angle of
the<00:06:36.160> stick<00:06:36.460> and<00:06:36.670> how<00:06:36.820> it<00:06:37.000> keeps<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.360> puck<00:06:37.540> flat

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
different angle so you can kind of see

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.920 
different angle so you can kind of see
from<00:06:53.670> the<00:06:53.760> side<00:06:53.970> view<00:06:54.030> and<00:06:54.450> we'll<00:06:54.810> go<00:06:54.900> from

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
from the side view and we'll go from

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.640 
from the side view and we'll go from
there<00:06:55.110> okay<00:06:56.780> so<00:06:57.780> here<00:06:58.020> we<00:06:58.110> go<00:06:58.200> with<00:06:58.320> the<00:06:58.410> side

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
we're going to have enough strength

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.550 
we're going to have enough strength
behind<00:07:11.040> the<00:07:11.430> puck<00:07:11.700> to<00:07:11.970> keep<00:07:12.510> it<00:07:12.660> flat<00:07:12.900> and<00:07:13.140> keep

behind the puck to keep it flat and keep
it<00:07:13.680> going<00:07:13.890> in<00:07:14.010> the<00:07:14.070> direction<00:07:14.190> that<00:07:14.460> we<00:07:14.610> intend

it going in the direction that we intend

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.150

so<00:07:15.390> let's<00:07:15.690> take<00:07:15.810> a<00:07:15.870> look<00:07:16.080> at<00:07:16.200> it<00:07:16.230> now<00:07:16.350> from<00:07:17.010> the

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
so let's take a look at it now from the

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:34.820 
so let's take a look at it now from the
side<00:07:17.370> view<00:07:33.290> so<00:07:34.290> there<00:07:34.440> you<00:07:34.500> have<00:07:34.530> it<00:07:34.650> that's

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:34.830 
side view so there you have it that's

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.560 
side view so there you have it that's
your<00:07:34.980> proper<00:07:35.310> technique<00:07:35.670> on<00:07:35.850> the<00:07:36.120> cushion<00:07:36.450> and
