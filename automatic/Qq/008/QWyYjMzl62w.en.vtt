you can also have the files

it is rocking a 300 milli amp hour

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.470 
it is rocking a 300 milli amp hour
battery<00:04:02.260> which<00:04:03.160> doesn't<00:04:03.579> sound<00:04:03.790> all<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.060> big

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
battery which doesn't sound all that big

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.990 
battery which doesn't sound all that big
but<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.200> watch<00:04:05.530> after<00:04:05.829> all<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.400> so<00:04:06.760> far

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
but it is a watch after all and so far

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.729 
but it is a watch after all and so far
the<00:04:07.180> battery<00:04:07.480> life<00:04:07.660> has<00:04:07.690> been<00:04:07.959> great<00:04:08.410> I

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
the battery life has been great I

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.979 
the battery life has been great I
typically<00:04:09.370> get<00:04:09.489> about<00:04:09.549> three<00:04:10.209> days<00:04:10.450> out<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.870> it

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
typically get about three days out of it

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.120 
typically get about three days out of it
before<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.319> have<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.590> reach<00:04:11.769> our

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
before I have to reach our

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.550 
before I have to reach our
so<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.820> seems<00:04:13.030> pretty<00:04:13.240> solid<00:04:13.480> as<00:04:13.900> far<00:04:14.350> as<00:04:14.470> I'm

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
so it seems pretty solid as far as I'm

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.070 
so it seems pretty solid as far as I'm
concerned<00:04:15.480> there's<00:04:16.480> not<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.660> whole<00:04:16.840> lot<00:04:16.870> you

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
concerned there's not a whole lot you

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.920 
concerned there's not a whole lot you
can<00:04:17.200> do<00:04:17.350> in<00:04:17.590> terms<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.220> battery<00:04:18.610> management

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
can do in terms of battery management

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.030 
can do in terms of battery management

low but even at relatively high

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.000 
low but even at relatively high
brightness<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.260> should<00:04:23.440> still<00:04:23.680> be<00:04:23.830> able<00:04:23.890> to

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
brightness you should still be able to

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.650 
brightness you should still be able to
get<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.160> reasonable<00:04:24.550> amount<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.150> time<00:04:25.330> out<00:04:25.570> of

running walking cycling and hiking and

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.810 
running walking cycling and hiking and

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
how many calories you've burned you've

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.280 
how many calories you've burned you've
also<00:05:06.970> got<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.240> pedometer<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.870> measure<00:05:08.050> your

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
also got a pedometer to measure your

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.930 
also got a pedometer to measure your
steps<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.830> I'm<00:05:08.950> not<00:05:09.130> sure<00:05:09.340> if<00:05:09.610> it's<00:05:09.790> a

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
steps and I'm not sure if it's a

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.630 
steps and I'm not sure if it's a
connectivity<00:05:10.450> issue<00:05:10.780> or<00:05:11.200> just<00:05:11.500> a<00:05:11.620> bug<00:05:11.920> but

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
connectivity issue or just a bug but

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.100 
connectivity issue or just a bug but
intended<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.030> freeze<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.360> lot<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:13.870> all<00:05:13.930> of<00:05:14.050> a

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
intended to freeze a lot and all of a

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.990 
intended to freeze a lot and all of a
sudden<00:05:14.440> your<00:05:14.560> steps<00:05:14.830> would<00:05:15.010> just<00:05:15.220> skyrocket

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
sudden your steps would just skyrocket

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.370 
sudden your steps would just skyrocket
so<00:05:16.270> it's<00:05:16.480> hard<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.720> really<00:05:16.840> gauge<00:05:17.140> how

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
so it's hard to really gauge how

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.260 
so it's hard to really gauge how
accurate<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.920> pedometer<00:05:18.340> actually<00:05:18.700> is<00:05:18.910> and

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
accurate the pedometer actually is and

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.180 
accurate the pedometer actually is and
if<00:05:19.960> you<00:05:20.080> want<00:05:20.110> you<00:05:20.440> can<00:05:20.560> also<00:05:20.680> monitor<00:05:21.160> your

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
if you want you can also monitor your

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.220 
if you want you can also monitor your
sleep<00:05:21.400> which<00:05:21.850> I<00:05:21.940> actually<00:05:22.090> did<00:05:22.510> just<00:05:22.570> wants<00:05:23.170> to

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
sleep which I actually did just wants to

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.320 
sleep which I actually did just wants to
see<00:05:23.380> exactly<00:05:23.710> what<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:24.040> was<00:05:24.100> measuring<00:05:24.550> turns

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
see exactly what it was measuring turns

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.910 
see exactly what it was measuring turns
out<00:05:25.540> not<00:05:25.780> only<00:05:25.840> does<00:05:26.200> it<00:05:26.290> measure<00:05:26.440> how<00:05:26.710> long

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
out not only does it measure how long

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.500 
out not only does it measure how long
you<00:05:27.100> sleep<00:05:27.220> but<00:05:27.910> how<00:05:28.000> long<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.330> lay

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
you sleep but how long you lay

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.470 
you sleep but how long you lay
