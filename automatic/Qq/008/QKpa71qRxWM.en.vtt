00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.430
 so let's go and prepare the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.269
 chocolate cake without butter and without 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.220
 eggs 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.410
 as it has no scale to use a spoon 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.340
 to measure the ingredients in the case of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.610
 flour and 8 tablespoons full 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.610
 fine 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.800
 in the case of sugar I'll use 10 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.219
 tablespoons full of sugar I 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 I used sugar, but I'm quiet. 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.539
 5 tablespoons 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.940
 in the case of sunflower oil advice 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:01.489
 also five tablespoons full 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.049
 our next ingredient is milk and 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.970
 400 ml milk 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.189
 in the case of milk you can use those 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.960
 disposable plastic cups only 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.470
 to measure milk 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.630
 this is my baking powder 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.640
 in the case of my baking powder and it has 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.670
 the essence of vanilla so I do not need 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:27.330
 add the essence of vanilla 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.820
 I also added on the cake the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 chocolate drops but do not need to 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.930
 This is the first time I've done it. 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.650
 I used and was also not good armadillo 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.650
 need 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.619
 The first step is to mix all 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.640
 dry ingredients with the wooden spoon 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.640
 Hollow, it's normal, no problem, then. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.390
 I took it well, you got a way 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 well all the dry ingredients and you 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.210

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.210
 adding the liquid ingredients 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.319
 another important thing after you 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.950
 adding the ingredients 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.380
 liquid is move very quickly is one 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.590
 The secret of this recipe is to mix well 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.430
 fast dry ingredients and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:32.549
 liquid ingredients what people then 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.620
 a study well this allows me to mix and I 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.549
 I'm going to add the drops of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.030

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:47.190
 Exact amount you and you will decide 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.890

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:56.480
 I put more or less two spoons 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.480
 in spoons and 62 in stockings will 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.829

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.329
 cake 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.730
 now the coolest part is coming 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.829
 put the cake to jump 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.630
 I put it here in my form in case I 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.739
 use the fame of silicone that it is the anti 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.070
 adherent 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:27.540
 so you do not need to fight so now I go 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.660
 place in the oven for 50 minutes at 160 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.660
 degrees 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.459
 then people this is the end result 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.560
 There's a flight, it's already done. 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.410
 a little bit creepy but does not have 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.840
 problem if it is a cake that is used for 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.670
 breakfast is not a party cake 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.680
