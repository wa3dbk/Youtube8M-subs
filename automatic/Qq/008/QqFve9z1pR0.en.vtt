00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
use that cord that we just saw in order

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.210 
use that cord that we just saw in order
to<00:01:35.880> route<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.299> into<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:36.659> mixer<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.040> use

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to route that into your mixer so you use

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.340 
to route that into your mixer so you use
one<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:38.579> put<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:39.720> tape<00:01:39.960> input

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
one of these put it in your tape input

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.889 
one of these put it in your tape input
that's<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.450> let's<00:01:42.659> go<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that's what I do and now let's go to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.200 
that's what I do and now let's go to
Skype<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.409> make<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> phone<00:01:44.130> call<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:45.180> can

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
Skype and make a phone call and we can

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
Skype and make a phone call and we can
actually<00:01:45.450> record<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> phone<00:01:46.229> call<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.829> prove

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
