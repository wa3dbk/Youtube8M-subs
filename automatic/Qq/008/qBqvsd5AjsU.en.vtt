one at first you can always add things
to<00:00:15.750> your<00:00:15.780> layouts<00:00:16.349> in<00:00:16.650> all<00:00:16.890> these<00:00:17.160> steps<00:00:17.490> that

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
to your layouts in all these steps that

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.010 
to your layouts in all these steps that
we're<00:00:17.820> teaching<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.509> you're<00:00:18.869> learning

how to do so what I'm going to teach you
to<00:00:21.060> do<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.480> from<00:00:21.779> your<00:00:21.960> Shinae<00:00:22.380> turn<00:00:22.740> how<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> do

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
to do is from your Shinae turn how to do

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.760 
to do is from your Shinae turn how to do
a<00:00:23.580> jazz<00:00:23.850> layout<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.020> if<00:00:25.109> we're<00:00:25.320> doing<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
a jazz layout so if we're doing a

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.830 
a jazz layout so if we're doing a
regular<00:00:25.949> Shinae<00:00:26.520> turn<00:00:26.760> we<00:00:27.000> would<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.390> two

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
regular Shinae turn we would do two

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.950 
regular Shinae turn we would do two
steps<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.890> two<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> third<00:00:30.300> step<00:00:30.689> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
steps one two and on the third step I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.229 
steps one two and on the third step I
want<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.560> step<00:00:31.949> back<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239

plie into that right leg your left leg
goes<00:00:36.930> into<00:00:37.440> almost<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.100> Kupe<00:00:38.550> position

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
goes into almost like a Kupe position

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.819 
goes into almost like a Kupe position
but<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.300> way<00:00:39.600> open<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.290> you're<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> be

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
arms back you don't want to open this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
arms back you don't want to open this
way<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.579> if<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
way because if you do this it kind of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.249 
way because if you do this it kind of
cuts<00:01:01.379> off<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:02.460> back<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.600> arch<00:01:03.840> right

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
cuts off your back in your arch right

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.279 
cuts off your back in your arch right
here<00:01:04.289> all<00:01:04.949> right<00:01:05.009> but<00:01:05.399> if<00:01:05.759> you<00:01:05.880> press<00:01:06.149> down

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
here all right but if you press down

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.690 
here all right but if you press down
then<00:01:07.289> you<00:01:07.410> have<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> little<00:01:07.800> bit<00:01:08.009> more<00:01:08.220> room<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
then you have a little bit more room to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.899 
then you have a little bit more room to
manipulate<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:09.780> layout<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:11.100> again<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.820> we

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
manipulate your layout so again if we

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.200 
manipulate your layout so again if we
take<00:01:12.119> our<00:01:12.330> Shinae<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> two<00:01:14.210> we

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
take our Shinae we have one and two we

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.080 
take our Shinae we have one and two we
laid<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.510> three<00:01:16.080> come<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.070> four<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.939> can

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
laid out three come up on four you can

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.480 
laid out three come up on four you can
also<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> ground<00:01:19.110> bottom<00:01:19.470> ah<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.920> really

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
also do a ground bottom ah and really

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
also do a ground bottom ah and really
whack<00:01:20.790> your<00:01:21.030> leg<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.570> laid<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.200> same

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
whack your leg and laid out at the same

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.249 
whack your leg and laid out at the same
time<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.920> well<00:01:23.159> or<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.479> even<00:01:24.509> take<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.020> one

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
time as well or we can even take it one

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.469 
time as well or we can even take it one
step<00:01:25.290> further<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> layout<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
step further and do a layout to the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.469 
step further and do a layout to the
floor<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.500> over<00:01:28.799> our<00:01:28.979> toes<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.420> would

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
floor going over our toes so how would

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.810 
floor going over our toes so how would
we<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.700> could

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
we do that we do it like this we could

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.429 
we do that we do it like this we could
take<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> from<00:01:33.299> our<00:01:33.450> Shinae<00:01:33.689> turn<00:01:33.900> again<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
take it from our Shinae turn again and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.300 
take it from our Shinae turn again and
Shinae<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.390> two<00:01:37.170> instead<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.070> laying

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
Shinae one and two instead of laying

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.190 
Shinae one and two instead of laying
that<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.090 
that right there I'm going to have you
open<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.979> three<00:01:41.970> four<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.259> fall<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
open it up three four and you fall to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.039 
open it up three four and you fall to
your<00:01:44.130> knees<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:45.150> remember<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:45.780> think
