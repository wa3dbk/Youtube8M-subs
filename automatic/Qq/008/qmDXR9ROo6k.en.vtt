so<00:00:17.750> I've<00:00:17.840> just<00:00:17.990> got<00:00:18.140> a<00:00:18.170> one<00:00:18.380> terabyte<00:00:18.590> drive

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
so I've just got a one terabyte drive

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.710 
so I've just got a one terabyte drive
right<00:00:19.310> here<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:20.060> it's<00:00:20.210> got<00:00:20.330> several

right here and it's got several

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.170 
right here and it's got several
partitions<00:00:21.290> on<00:00:21.439> it<00:00:21.590> but<00:00:22.310> not<00:00:22.520> but

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
partitions on it but not but

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.760 
partitions on it but not but
specifically<00:00:23.660> this<00:00:23.810> video<00:00:24.109> to<00:00:24.289> show<00:00:24.439> you<00:00:24.470> how

specifically this video to show you how

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.040 
specifically this video to show you how
to<00:00:24.830> back<00:00:25.070> up<00:00:25.100> onto<00:00:25.520> a<00:00:25.699> partition<00:00:26.420> other<00:00:26.660> than

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
to back up onto a partition other than

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.300 
to back up onto a partition other than
the<00:00:27.439> primary<00:00:27.920> one<00:00:28.100> which<00:00:28.640> is<00:00:28.670> sda1<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:30.310> also

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
the primary one which is sda1 and also

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.090 
the primary one which is sda1 and also
to<00:00:31.369> an<00:00:31.670> ext3<00:00:32.239> partition<00:00:32.800> because<00:00:33.800> they're<00:00:33.980> not

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
to an ext3 partition because they're not

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.830 
to an ext3 partition because they're not
mounted<00:00:34.460> by<00:00:34.580> default<00:00:34.940> even<00:00:35.449> if<00:00:35.570> they're<00:00:35.750> the

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
mounted by default even if they're the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.619 
mounted by default even if they're the
first<00:00:35.989> partition<00:00:36.440> on<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.680> drive<00:00:37.480> so<00:00:38.480> this

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
first partition on the drive so this

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.270 
first partition on the drive so this
assumes<00:00:38.960> you've<00:00:39.199> on<00:00:39.350> acer<00:00:39.620> tablet<00:00:39.799> that's

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
assumes you've on acer tablet that's

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.869 
assumes you've on acer tablet that's
been<00:00:41.019> that's<00:00:42.019> got<00:00:42.350> clockworkmod<00:00:43.250> recovery<00:00:43.280> on

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
been that's got clockworkmod recovery on

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.789 
been that's got clockworkmod recovery on
it<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.150> if<00:00:44.690> you're<00:00:44.839> asking<00:00:45.260> sandwich<00:00:45.710> or

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:45.799 
it and if you're asking sandwich or

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.490 
it and if you're asking sandwich or
patch<00:00:45.949> bootloader<00:00:46.629> and<00:00:47.629> it's<00:00:48.049> assume<00:00:48.320> that

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
patch bootloader and it's assume that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.600 
patch bootloader and it's assume that
you're<00:00:48.589> able<00:00:48.650> to<00:00:48.890> bring<00:00:49.010> it<00:00:49.070> into<00:00:49.159> Thor's<00:00:49.460> or

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
you're able to bring it into Thor's or

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.479 
you're able to bring it into Thor's or
covery<00:00:49.909> with<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:50.720> normal<00:00:50.989> method<00:00:51.159> so<00:00:52.159> the

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
covery with the normal method so the

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.630 
covery with the normal method so the
first<00:00:52.699> thing<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.879> want<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.059> do<00:00:53.180> is<00:00:54.519> get<00:00:55.519> the

cable for the external hard drives and
plug<00:00:58.129> it<00:00:58.280> into<00:00:58.400> the<00:00:58.519> USB<00:00:58.549> host<00:00:59.030> port<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:02.540> also

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
plug it into the USB host port and also

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.609 
plug it into the USB host port and also
get<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:04.119> USB<00:01:05.119> cable<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.570> computer<00:01:06.049> plug<00:01:06.470> that
