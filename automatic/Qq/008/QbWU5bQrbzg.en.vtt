00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
with it that's good because I was didn't

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.370 
with it that's good because I was didn't
want<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:38.969> out<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.329> delays<00:01:39.719> I'm

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
want to go out and get more delays I'm

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.630 
want to go out and get more delays I'm
going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> rush<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.920> quite<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> bit<00:01:41.219> i'm<00:01:41.520> over

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
going to rush this quite a bit i'm over

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.830 
going to rush this quite a bit i'm over
you<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.939> time<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.149> set<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.630> i'm<00:01:42.689> going

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
you have time to set it up so i'm going

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
you have time to set it up so i'm going
to<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> gym<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.289> a<00:01:43.350> second<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.399> we're<00:01:45.090> playing

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
to the gym in a second so we're playing

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.520 
to the gym in a second so we're playing
all<00:01:45.420> evening<00:01:45.749> though<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.109> I'll<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.380> rid<00:01:46.499> of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
all evening though and I'll get rid of

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.959 
all evening though and I'll get rid of
you<00:01:46.619> guys<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.159> soon<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.399> possible<00:01:47.759> within<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
you guys as soon as possible within the

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.700 
you guys as soon as possible within the
next<00:01:48.030> week<00:01:48.359> I<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.289> obviously<00:01:49.530> really

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
next week I know it's obviously really

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.319 
next week I know it's obviously really
late<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.219> I'm<00:01:50.280> doing<00:01:50.429> my<00:01:50.549> best<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.060> let's<00:01:51.090> put

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
late but I'm doing my best so let's put

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.090 
late but I'm doing my best so let's put
the<00:01:51.509> batteries<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> controller<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.039> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the batteries in the controller so it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.559 
the batteries in the controller so it
comes<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.460> double-a<00:01:53.789> batteries<00:01:54.270> which

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
comes with the double-a batteries which

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:55.730 
comes with the double-a batteries which
slot<00:01:54.840> into<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> back<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> controller

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
slot into the back of the controller

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.399 
slot into the back of the controller
like<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> believe<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.210> slot<00:01:57.929> side<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
like so I believe a slot side and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.959 
like so I believe a slot side and
apparently<00:01:58.889> these<00:01:59.219> controllers<00:01:59.639> are<00:01:59.819> much

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
apparently these controllers are much

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.300 
apparently these controllers are much
more<00:02:00.119> efficient<00:02:00.509> than<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.659> last<00:02:00.899> gen<00:02:01.200> ones<00:02:01.469> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
more efficient than the last gen ones so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.099 
more efficient than the last gen ones so
we<00:02:02.759> should<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.179> seeing<00:02:03.479> where<00:02:03.840> which<00:02:03.990> is

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
we should be seeing where which is

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.919 
we should be seeing where which is
negative<00:02:04.289> that's<00:02:04.770> negative<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:06.270> positive

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
negative that's negative as positive

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.130 
negative that's negative as positive
that's<00:02:07.799> negative<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.640> positive<00:02:09.140> which

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
that's negative not positive which

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
that's negative not positive which
apparently<00:02:10.500> last<00:02:10.890> long<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.640> much<00:02:11.790> more

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
apparently last long because I much more

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.280 
apparently last long because I much more
efficient<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.510> they<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:12.810> many<00:02:13.200> other

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
efficient and they have many other

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.950 
efficient and they have many other
improvements<00:02:14.510> actually<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.600> feels<00:02:15.630> quite

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
improvements actually that feels quite

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.900 
improvements actually that feels quite
nice<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.560> was<00:02:16.830> bitching<00:02:17.160> about<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.490> bit<00:02:17.520> when

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
nice I was bitching about it a bit when

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.110 
nice I was bitching about it a bit when
I<00:02:17.940> was<00:02:18.120> using<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.630> on

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
I was using it on

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.970 
I was using it on
in<00:02:19.209> game<00:02:19.480> book<00:02:20.019> actually<00:02:20.830> I'm<00:02:20.890> quite

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
in game book actually I'm quite

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.410 
in game book actually I'm quite
impressively<00:02:21.430> control<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.909> I've<00:02:22.000> got<00:02:22.180> my<00:02:22.330> own

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
impressively control and I've got my own

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.420 
impressively control and I've got my own
one<00:02:22.659> I<00:02:22.900> feels<00:02:23.440> quite<00:02:23.650> nice<00:02:23.830> quite<00:02:24.159> happy<00:02:24.400> with

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
one I feels quite nice quite happy with

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.820 
one I feels quite nice quite happy with
that<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:25.540> also<00:02:25.659> get<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.900> headset<00:02:26.349> under<00:02:26.620> here

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
that we also get a headset under here

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.759 
that we also get a headset under here
this<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.909> a<00:02:28.090> cheap<00:02:28.390> little<00:02:28.569> headset<00:02:29.110> it's<00:02:29.500> just

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
this is a cheap little headset it's just

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.860 
this is a cheap little headset it's just
for<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> regular<00:02:30.519> chat<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.940> audio<00:02:31.180> parties<00:02:31.690> and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
for a regular chat and audio parties and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.960 
for a regular chat and audio parties and
stuff<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:33.220> connects<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.640> bottom<00:02:33.849> of<00:02:33.879> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
stuff it connects to the bottom of the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.910 
stuff it connects to the bottom of the
controller<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:34.659> not<00:02:34.810> wireless<00:02:35.080> where's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
controller so it's not wireless where's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.530 
controller so it's not wireless where's
what<00:02:36.250> obviously<00:02:36.579> is<00:02:36.640> wireless<00:02:36.940> controllers

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
what obviously is wireless controllers

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.360 
what obviously is wireless controllers
wireless<00:02:37.690> base<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.440> has<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.769> log<00:02:39.040> into<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
wireless base it has to log into the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.229 
wireless base it has to log into the
controller<00:02:39.700> physically<00:02:40.180> itself<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:41.260> do<00:02:41.590> this

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
controller physically itself to do this

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.509 
controller physically itself to do this
is<00:02:43.239> 0<00:02:43.360> plugs<00:02:43.599> into<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.900> controller<00:02:44.590> as<00:02:45.340> you

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
is 0 plugs into the controller as you

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.680 
is 0 plugs into the controller as you
can<00:02:45.640> see<00:02:45.730> with<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:45.879> connector<00:02:46.299> here<00:02:46.510> which

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
can see with this connector here which

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.880 
can see with this connector here which
slots<00:02:46.930> into<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.230> back<00:02:47.349> of<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.530> controller

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
slots into the back of the controller

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.000 
slots into the back of the controller
and<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.519> sits<00:02:48.670> on<00:02:48.849> one<00:02:49.030> ear<00:02:49.060> like<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.870> come<00:02:50.860> up

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
and it sits on one ear like so come up

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.970 
and it sits on one ear like so come up
it<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.329> a<00:02:52.359> one<00:02:52.629> ear<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:52.989> so<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.829> has

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
it this is a one ear like so and it has

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.509 
it this is a one ear like so and it has
a<00:02:54.010> small<00:02:54.489> microphone<00:02:54.879> which<00:02:55.269> can<00:02:55.480> swivel<00:02:55.810> and

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
a small microphone which can swivel and

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.160 
a small microphone which can swivel and
it<00:02:57.519> should<00:02:57.670> sound<00:02:57.819> alright<00:02:58.060> wonder<00:02:58.540> soon<00:02:58.750> it's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
it should sound alright wonder soon it's

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.500 
it should sound alright wonder soon it's
also<00:02:59.349> got<00:02:59.650> volume<00:03:00.400> control<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.030> meet<00:03:01.269> Mike

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
also got volume control and meet Mike

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.020 
also got volume control and meet Mike
buttons<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.290> pad<00:03:02.680> itself<00:03:02.829> so<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.670> should

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
buttons on the pad itself so that should

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.460 
buttons on the pad itself so that should
be<00:03:04.060> perfectly<00:03:04.540> good<00:03:04.720> for<00:03:04.930> using<00:03:05.260> with<00:03:05.349> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
be perfectly good for using with the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.770 
be perfectly good for using with the
controller<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.819> will<00:03:07.000> probably<00:03:07.450> be<00:03:07.569> doing

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
controller and I will probably be doing

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.270

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.339 
very nice and it looks like she'll be
functional<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:31.900> i'll<00:04:31.960> probably<00:04:32.110> be<00:04:32.260> using

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
functional so i'll probably be using
