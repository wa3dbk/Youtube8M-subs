 so we wanted to be able in the title 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.340
 I changed elements my fist in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.480

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.260
 items there then headdress of the royal mood so 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.880
 really good jet 180 vitajus 10 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.279
 only what interests me the 30 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.560
 chance to f 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.809
 the thirty intel forgiveness 68 chance 38 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.420
 too critical wisdom an unv within 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.070
 fire damage it's a shame this 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.370
 prospecting sacristan cr-48 nine doc or 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 then the res 48 to 20 of luck 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.059
 some critics hardly a calf of 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.910
 damage rather not bad so the base 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.879
 jeannot pap kamba capm astralis the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.770
 base also for the level 130 we 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.579
 I'm 10 years old, lives at 60 chance when you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.809
 wisdom of po 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.120
 this prospecting me strawberry notary at 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.400
 Drago really nice of a plum 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.729
 emerald so low of his life late barely 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.729
 1 in. 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.610
 what's his name is royal amulets 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.079
 so it's not super jet but 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.490
 it was the only thing I can have 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.049
 for the jet mayor that I could have 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.159
 for the quarters but that I had so 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.570
 without inviting to 50 intel 37-37 chance 28 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.439
 ap wisdom of critical sitting 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.460
 fire damage 5 at 312 prospecting it's 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:35.869
 very land fire four leaks and eight to 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.600
 bout the tasty ring so 147 fast to 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.299
 45 chance 18 wisdom five shots 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.140
 9 damage to the resistance bags 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.880
 r4 very pm 9 resistance pushed really 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.439
 not bad then so there I could have 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.479
 I could have done the blackout or 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.080
 total if you him it's a mode that is 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.220
 rather not bad but I opted for 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.380
 to put belt and boots of 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.789
 flirty because it's hot 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.729
 as much luck and in addition it gives 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.429
 better resistances and I typed well 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.780
 in originality so here I have 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.510
 put that I saw that it was really 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.750
 really pretty much anyway their 127 quick 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.340
 at 50 strength 43 chance 21 wise and on the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.820
 critical hit is a pity of prospecting 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.989
 185 initiative four songs i pod 4 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.530
 4% resin and neutral lands neutral 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.120
 fire water and 4 esther r so yes there is 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.530
 more strength than luck because 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.920
 these systems that are often kraft is 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.230
 for for strength 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:41.030
 so that's it's not it's not finally y'a 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.350
 not necessarily super big fountains 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.060
 unless you want to pay a million 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.130
 If I even more belt impact the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.299
 re - acceleration of kama I believe so 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.069
 kind of mid- range at the waist 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.010
 it's a bit expensive so 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.319
 then the words of the dredger 114 8 to 44 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.500
 intel 40 of luck 4 or criticize a pm 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.209
 it's a pity three care 13 prospecting 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.079
 219 break 8% earth resistance at 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.630
 dauphinÃ© than the trophies so the base 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.160
 Examiners teasing players because 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.320
 because I simply did not have 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.280
 8 badly to play as a good base of 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:17.260
 vitality with the tease g8 if I 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.020
 could I put the piaf there 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.350
 but after that I will not have a little bit 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.890
 a pm 2 - 2 c it is not or no longer 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.020
 then 80 lives with the survivor a 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.900
 sturdy little - if you criticize 40 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.410
 power is a pest to the for 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:41.180
 damage sites so with this stuff on 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:46.160
 we arrive at 2402 quickly said peace 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.940
 at 6pm early miss 200 prospecting 4 in3 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:56.420
 a calf 153 of wisdom 155 of strength 140 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:01.990
 of intel and 212 of luck plus the 45 of 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.990
 power we it's about 200 550 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.520
 the 13 damages and the twenty-seven 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.040
 damage to the name it's really bad 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.950
 so on your person does not care g15 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.400
 we criticize if care 8 8 is not 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.380
 whew 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.200
 but I always pushed and damage 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.799
 possible 22 good is we do not care a 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.790
 little resistance level so five 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.420
 remain fixed neutral 9% will be neutral at 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:34.010
 level of hestayres so we set 21% 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:38.060
 rest I have that fixed 12% to 12 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.330
 fixed pardon at the level of rays at g10 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.940
 fixed 17% and reiser justifies that it's 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.710
 ugly 0% 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.240
 according to g push networks but hey 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.520
 this 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.009
 it's not the must so here at the level 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.660
 of the entity stuff in front of it's a little 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.660
 little bit of cabbage to learn at 50 t shirt that 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.770
 get done fast enough so fast there's no 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.509
 I have today turn boost 5500 pv 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:11.360
 it'll go down pretty fast so do not 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:16.419
 booster tac 263 then hop the pipes in 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:20.599
 picole says ap181 euros 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:26.500
 what I can do also these taxes was 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.500
 the moats and islets is pretty good 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:36.409
 So after I can do to have Mashala 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:37.940
 and agencies kills 300 it seems to the canton 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.360
 and I showed and when I miss my part 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.780
 chain zotto I can lose or burned and 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.360
 platinum and that's it 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.710
 323 in power it's really really 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.570
 a lot of good work at the level of the rox 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.450
