mountain<00:00:49.250> skis<00:00:49.520> but<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:50.150> still<00:00:50.390> got<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.540> think

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
mountain skis but you still got to think

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.240 
mountain skis but you still got to think
about<00:00:51.020> what<00:00:51.290> are<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.410> gonna<00:00:51.500> do<00:00:51.710> when<00:00:52.040> you<00:00:52.100> go

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
about what are you gonna do when you go

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.549 
about what are you gonna do when you go
over<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.520> edge<00:00:52.550> okay<00:00:53.390> first<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.870> all<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.230> like

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
over the edge okay first of all I like

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.290 
over the edge okay first of all I like
to<00:00:54.650> think<00:00:54.860> about<00:00:54.920> terrain<00:00:55.460> matching<00:00:55.940> I<00:00:56.059> call

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
to think about terrain matching I call

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.210 
to think about terrain matching I call
it<00:00:56.450> but<00:00:56.930> right<00:00:57.050> now<00:00:57.110> I'm<00:00:57.470> standing<00:00:57.830> on<00:00:57.920> a<00:00:57.980> flat

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
it but right now I'm standing on a flat

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.830 
it but right now I'm standing on a flat
slope<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:58.700> I'm<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.910> balance<00:00:59.300> standing<00:00:59.690> on<00:00:59.750> the

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
slope and I'm in balance standing on the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.810 
slope and I'm in balance standing on the
center<00:01:00.080> of<00:01:00.170> my<00:01:00.230> skis<00:01:00.559> what<00:01:01.250> happens<00:01:01.520> when<00:01:01.640> I<00:01:01.700> go

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
center of my skis what happens when I go

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.640 
center of my skis what happens when I go
over<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.089> edge<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.600> all<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.110> sudden<00:01:03.140> amount

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
over the edge and all of a sudden amount

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.530 
over the edge and all of a sudden amount
of<00:01:03.739> steep<00:01:03.949> incline<00:01:04.370> I<00:01:04.730> got<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.150> match<00:01:05.300> that

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
of steep incline I got to match that

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.510 
of steep incline I got to match that
terrain<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.200> I'm<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.500> same<00:01:06.650> position<00:01:06.860> when

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
terrain so I'm in the same position when

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.220 
terrain so I'm in the same position when
I<00:01:07.550> hit<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:07.880> slope<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.780> other<00:01:08.900> thing<00:01:09.110> is

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
I hit the slope the other thing is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.720 
I hit the slope the other thing is
tactics<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.130> know<00:01:10.220> we've<00:01:10.430> talked<00:01:10.610> about

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
tactics you know we've talked about

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.980 
tactics you know we've talked about
technique<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.420> we're<00:01:11.570> going<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.720> talk<00:01:11.870> about

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
technique and we're going to talk about

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.800 
technique and we're going to talk about
tactics<00:01:12.610> when<00:01:13.610> I<00:01:13.640> hit<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.000> snow<00:01:14.210> down<00:01:14.570> there

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
tactics when I hit the snow down there

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.350 
tactics when I hit the snow down there
what<00:01:14.990> am<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:15.140> going<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.350> do<00:01:15.440> next<00:01:15.620> so<00:01:16.330> what<00:01:17.330> I

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
what am I going to do next so what I

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.899 
what am I going to do next so what I
mean<00:01:17.720> we<00:01:17.900> think<00:01:18.170> about<00:01:18.290> is<00:01:18.890> not<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.430> drop<00:01:19.670> in

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
mean we think about is not the drop in

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.640 
mean we think about is not the drop in
to<00:01:20.180> drop<00:01:20.390> in<00:01:20.570> ZZ<00:01:20.780> part<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:21.290> what<00:01:21.409> am<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.560> going

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
to drop in ZZ part it's what am I going

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.350 
to drop in ZZ part it's what am I going
to<00:01:21.710> do<00:01:21.800> after<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.280> drop

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.130 

okay<00:01:29.230> I'm<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.740> my<00:01:29.860> take<00:01:30.100> off<00:01:30.870> coming<00:01:31.870> over

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
okay I'm I and my take off coming over

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.730 
okay I'm I and my take off coming over
the<00:01:32.230> edge

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
the edge

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.609 
the edge
matching<00:01:33.670> landing<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.540> turning

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.590 

so<00:01:40.310> there<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.490> have<00:01:40.579> it<00:01:40.729> we've<00:01:41.210> got<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:41.359> match

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
so there you have it we've got to match

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.060 
so there you have it we've got to match
your<00:01:41.810> skis<00:01:42.049> with<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.439> slope<00:01:42.679> of<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:42.890> hill

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
your skis with the slope of the hill

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.459 
your skis with the slope of the hill
