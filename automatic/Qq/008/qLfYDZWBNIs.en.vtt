00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you guys in my opinion on which one you

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.569 
you guys in my opinion on which one you
should<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.420> for<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.559> hard<00:00:34.950> earned<00:00:35.040> money<00:00:35.190> so

should get for your hard earned money so
let's<00:00:35.790> go<00:00:35.940> let's<00:00:36.270> start<00:00:36.480> off<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> height

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
let's go let's start off with the height

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.100 
let's go let's start off with the height
basically<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> specs<00:00:38.969> around<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.719> length

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
basically the specs around the length

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.990 
basically the specs around the length
height<00:00:40.440> with<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.040> stuff<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.820> same

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
height with all that stuff is the same

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.430 
height with all that stuff is the same
it's<00:00:42.300> 0.11<00:00:43.110> 20.6<00:00:44.100> 8<00:00:44.340> inches<00:00:44.840> as<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.050> move<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's 0.11 20.6 8 inches as we move on to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.459 
it's 0.11 20.6 8 inches as we move on to
wait<00:00:46.680> again<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.370> exactly<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.059> same<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
wait again it's exactly the same the

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.770 
wait again it's exactly the same the
resolution<00:00:49.469> exact<00:00:50.100> again<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.149> exactly<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
resolution exact again it's exactly the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
resolution exact again it's exactly the
same<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> similarities<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.370> but

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
same so a lot of similarities here but

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.819 
same so a lot of similarities here but
when<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.180> move<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> cpu<00:00:55.079> that's<00:00:55.559> where<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
when we move on to cpu that's where you

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.170 
when we move on to cpu that's where you
see<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> difference<00:00:56.160> because<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.699> first<00:00:56.969> one

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
see a difference because the first one

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.529 
see a difference because the first one
was<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> sandy<00:00:58.230> bridge<00:00:58.440> core<00:00:58.859> i5<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.460> core<00:00:59.820> i7

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
was a sandy bridge core i5 or core i7

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.510 
was a sandy bridge core i5 or core i7
depending<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.230> chose<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.309> new

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
depending on what you chose but the new

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.299 
depending on what you chose but the new
macbook<00:01:02.760> air<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.120> an<00:01:03.420> Ivy<00:01:03.960> Bridge<00:01:04.199> core<00:01:04.769> i5<00:01:05.280> or

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
macbook air is an Ivy Bridge core i5 or

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.210 
macbook air is an Ivy Bridge core i5 or
core<00:01:05.580> i7<00:01:06.510> processor<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.979> don't<00:01:08.130> know

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
core i7 processor so if you don't know

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.410 
core i7 processor so if you don't know
what<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.369> difference<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:09.030> ahead<00:01:09.119> search

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
what the difference is go ahead search

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.030 
what the difference is go ahead search

like fully solid at except for the
graphics<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.860> can't<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> hold<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
graphics I just can't get a hold of that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
graphics I just can't get a hold of that

just<00:01:45.119> don't<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.479> graphics<00:01:46.049> I'd<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.560> I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
just don't know graphics I'd like see I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.230 
just don't know graphics I'd like see I
see<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:46.950> big<00:01:47.009> number<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.640> four<00:01:47.850> thousand

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
see this big number I see four thousand

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.910 
see this big number I see four thousand
verses<00:01:48.329> three<00:01:48.659> thousand<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.290> okay<00:01:49.860> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
verses three thousand I'm like okay so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
verses three thousand I'm like okay so
four<00:01:50.220> thousand<00:01:50.549> must<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.790> better<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.750> i<00:01:51.810> don't

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
four thousand must be better but i don't

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.270 
four thousand must be better but i don't
know<00:01:52.110> why<00:01:52.320> i<00:01:52.350> don't<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> technology

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
know why i don't know the technology

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
know why i don't know the technology
behind<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.060> pretty<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
behind it I pretty much know the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.830 
behind it I pretty much know the
psychology<00:01:55.590> behind<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.920> cpu<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.430> like

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
psychology behind the cpu and like

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.380 
psychology behind the cpu and like
resolution<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.110> type<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> stuff<00:01:59.210> as<00:02:00.210> we

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
resolution all that type of stuff as we

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
resolution all that type of stuff as we
more<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> memory<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> couple<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> bit

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
more to memory so we have a couple a bit

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.459 
more to memory so we have a couple a bit
of<00:02:02.430> different<00:02:03.119> stuff<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.140> first

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
of different stuff here so we the first

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.130 
of different stuff here so we the first
one<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.860> tooth<00:02:05.159> mid-2011<00:02:05.909> model<00:02:06.420> has<00:02:06.540> two<00:02:06.840> or

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
one the tooth mid-2011 model has two or

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.270 
one the tooth mid-2011 model has two or
four<00:02:07.469> gigabytes<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.670> ddr3<00:02:09.709> memory<00:02:10.709> clocked<00:02:11.099> at

four gigabytes of ddr3 memory clocked at
thousand<00:02:12.590> 333<00:02:13.590> megahertz

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
thousand 333 megahertz

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.400 
thousand 333 megahertz
whereas<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> newer<00:02:15.150> one<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.600> macbook<00:02:15.750> air<00:02:16.170> to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
whereas a newer one that macbook air to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.640 
whereas a newer one that macbook air to
2012<00:02:17.100> model<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.550> either<00:02:18.060> 4<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:18.570> 8<00:02:18.900> gigabytes<00:02:19.410> in

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
2012 model is either 4 or 8 gigabytes in

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.040 
2012 model is either 4 or 8 gigabytes in
empty<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.460> has<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> far<00:02:20.880> higher<00:02:21.180> speed<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.870> so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
empty it has a far higher speed to it so

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.510 
empty it has a far higher speed to it so
it's<00:02:22.200> at<00:02:22.610> 1016<00:02:23.610> hundred<00:02:24.120> megahertz<00:02:25.080> with

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
it's at 1016 hundred megahertz with

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.900 
it's at 1016 hundred megahertz with
ddr3l<00:02:26.630> memory<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.370> big<00:02:29.370> difference<00:02:29.730> here

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
ddr3l memory so a big difference here

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.460 
ddr3l memory so a big difference here
and<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.150> really<00:02:30.480> good<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.720> see<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.140> apples

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
and it's really good to see the apples

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.760 
and it's really good to see the apples
doing<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.890> storage<00:02:32.880> as<00:02:33.060> we<00:02:33.180> move<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.450> again

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
doing the storage as we move on again

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.320 
doing the storage as we move on again
the<00:02:34.770> difference<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.280> we're<00:02:35.490> only<00:02:35.610> given<00:02:36.210> an

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
the difference is we're only given an

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.900 
the difference is we're only given an
extra<00:02:36.720> 5<00:02:36.930> 12<00:02:37.260> gigabytes<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.830> storage<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.340> kind

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
extra 5 12 gigabytes of storage so kind

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.400 
extra 5 12 gigabytes of storage so kind
of<00:02:39.000> goes<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> new<00:02:39.570> one<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.870> terms<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> this

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
of goes to the new one in terms of this

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.870 
of goes to the new one in terms of this
but<00:02:40.650> let<00:02:40.890> me<00:02:40.920> go<00:02:41.100> over<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.340> details<00:02:41.700> again

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
but let me go over to details again

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
but let me go over to details again
ports<00:02:42.660> we<00:02:43.050> have<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> bit<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.590> difference<00:02:43.830> here

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
ports we have a bit of difference here

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.650 
ports we have a bit of difference here
so<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.490> time<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.790> put<00:02:44.940> Thunderbolt<00:02:45.360> still

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
so it's time to put Thunderbolt still

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.360 
so it's time to put Thunderbolt still
the<00:02:45.780> same<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.830> thing<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.040> we<00:02:47.250> have

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
the same and the thing that we have

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.920 
the same and the thing that we have
different<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.790> now<00:02:47.940> it's<00:02:48.180> they<00:02:48.690> kind<00:02:48.900> of

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
different is now it's they kind of

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.820 
different is now it's they kind of
bumped<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.260> up<00:02:49.320> from<00:02:49.500> USB<00:02:49.830> 2.0<00:02:50.040> USB<00:02:52.310> 3.0<00:02:54.620> too<00:02:55.620> so

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
bumped it up from USB 2.0 USB 3.0 too so

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.470 
bumped it up from USB 2.0 USB 3.0 too so

you might want to search that up or even

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.970 
you might want to search that up or even

there<00:03:05.100> was<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> new<00:03:05.520> standard<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.060> Wi-Fi<00:03:06.480> I

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
there was a new standard of Wi-Fi I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.060 
there was a new standard of Wi-Fi I
don't<00:03:07.260> know<00:03:07.350> if<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.530> was<00:03:07.740> actually

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
don't know if it was actually

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.980 
don't know if it was actually
standardized<00:03:08.490> there<00:03:08.700> was<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> new<00:03:09.060> Wi-Fi<00:03:09.540> wave

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
standardized there was a new Wi-Fi wave

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.240 
standardized there was a new Wi-Fi wave
or<00:03:10.230> something<00:03:10.350> but<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:10.800> know<00:03:11.040> if<00:03:11.100> they

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
or something but I know if they

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.850 
or something but I know if they
standardized<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:13.170> seems<00:03:13.350> like<00:03:13.410> apples

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
standardized it but it seems like apples

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.440 
standardized it but it seems like apples
sticking<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.370> basics<00:03:14.730> for<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.060> it'll

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
sticking with the basics for this it'll

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.660 
sticking with the basics for this it'll
but<00:03:15.720> they'll<00:03:15.900> both<00:03:16.080> have<00:03:16.110> USB<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.920> four<00:03:17.460> point

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
but they'll both have USB to four point

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
so let's give my opinion what I think

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.630 
so let's give my opinion what I think
about<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.570> which<00:03:51.870> one<00:03:52.140> should<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.590> get<00:03:53.010> so

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
about it so which one should you get so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.370 
about it so which one should you get so
this<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:53.970> what<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.270> all<00:03:54.480> comes<00:03:54.510> down<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:54.990> if<00:03:55.260> you

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
this is what it all comes down to if you

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.080 
this is what it all comes down to if you
want<00:03:55.530> better<00:03:55.770> specs<00:03:56.250> if<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.520> want<00:03:56.700> beef<00:03:56.880> your

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
want better specs if you want beef your

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.810 
want better specs if you want beef your
specs<00:03:57.480> then<00:03:58.140> definitely<00:03:58.470> go<00:03:58.620> for<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:58.950> 2012

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
specs then definitely go for the 2012

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.730 
specs then definitely go for the 2012
the<00:04:00.030> model<00:04:00.510> because<00:04:00.750> it's<00:04:00.930> newer<00:04:01.320> you<00:04:01.590> get

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
the model because it's newer you get

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.949 
the model because it's newer you get
more<00:04:01.950> round<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.670> get<00:04:02.820> more<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.420> get<00:04:03.570> a<00:04:03.600> Ivy

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
more round you get more you get a Ivy

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.740 
more round you get more you get a Ivy
Bridge<00:04:04.140> which<00:04:04.350> is<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.470> fairly<00:04:04.920> big<00:04:05.130> difference

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
Bridge which is a fairly big difference

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.090 
Bridge which is a fairly big difference
you<00:04:06.750> get<00:04:06.930> better<00:04:07.080> graphics<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:07.800> I<00:04:07.860> don't<00:04:08.040> know

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
you get better graphics but I don't know

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.070 
you get better graphics but I don't know
how<00:04:08.610> much<00:04:08.790> difference<00:04:09.240> graphics<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:09.959> I

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
how much difference graphics is like I

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.250 
how much difference graphics is like I
said<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:11.340> get<00:04:11.520> USB<00:04:11.760> 3.0<00:04:12.450> faster<00:04:12.930> transfer

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
said and you get USB 3.0 faster transfer

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.340 
said and you get USB 3.0 faster transfer
speeds<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.920> all<00:04:14.730> for<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.270> same<00:04:15.810> or<00:04:16.049> less

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
speeds and all for the same or less

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.990 
speeds and all for the same or less
price<00:04:16.739> or<00:04:16.980> cheaper<00:04:17.010> price<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:17.820> that's

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
price or cheaper price so that's

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.120 
price or cheaper price so that's
definitely<00:04:18.209> good<00:04:18.540> but<00:04:19.410> when<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.680> comes<00:04:19.890> to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
definitely good but when it comes to

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.710 
definitely good but when it comes to
actually<00:04:20.609> when<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.760> talk<00:04:20.970> about<00:04:21.000> price<00:04:21.510> when

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
actually when you talk about price when

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.570 
actually when you talk about price when
I<00:04:21.750> talk<00:04:21.989> about<00:04:22.169> price<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.979> have<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.220> keep<00:04:23.400> in

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
I talk about price you have to keep in

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.310 
I talk about price you have to keep in
mind<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.030> macbook<00:04:24.419> air<00:04:24.690> 0<00:04:24.720> is<00:04:24.930> actually

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
macbook air to mid-2011 model because

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.610 
macbook air to mid-2011 model because
there<00:04:46.420> are<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.600> couple<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:46.930> spec<00:04:47.200> differences

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
there are a couple of spec differences

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.750

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
but you have to remember to wait and

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.130 
but you have to remember to wait and
everything<00:04:49.120> that's<00:04:49.570> all<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.900> same<00:04:50.110> the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
everything that's all the same the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.800 
everything that's all the same the
resolution<00:04:50.890> zactly<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.790> same<00:04:52.000> so<00:04:52.240> you're<00:04:52.690> not

here go for a macbook pro go for like
the<00:05:04.990> new<00:05:05.170> one<00:05:05.380> maybe<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.950> retina<00:05:06.250> display<00:05:06.490> one

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670

it's<00:05:07.590> 0.72<00:05:08.590> inches<00:05:09.010> thin<00:05:09.610> so<00:05:09.850> it's<00:05:10.630> very<00:05:11.140> very

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
it's 0.72 inches thin so it's very very

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
that because at the biggest part of this

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.240 
that because at the biggest part of this
macbook<00:05:16.570> air<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:16.960> remember<00:05:17.860> it's<00:05:17.980> a<00:05:18.040> wedge

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
macbook air to remember it's a wedge

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.610 
macbook air to remember it's a wedge
shape<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.730> time<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.180> 0.68<00:05:19.960> at<00:05:20.170> the<00:05:20.320> bigot<00:05:20.590> a

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
shape the time to it 0.68 at the bigot a

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.280 
shape the time to it 0.68 at the bigot a
lot<00:05:20.860> biggest<00:05:21.160> part<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:21.490> that's<00:05:22.030> 0.72<00:05:22.900> all

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.220 
lot biggest part and that's 0.72 all
across<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:24.120> not<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.150> huge<00:05:25.480> difference<00:05:25.660> between

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
across so not a huge difference between

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.380 
across so not a huge difference between
the<00:05:26.350> two<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:27.370> of<00:05:27.640> course<00:05:27.880> when<00:05:28.120> you<00:05:28.210> move<00:05:28.360> a
