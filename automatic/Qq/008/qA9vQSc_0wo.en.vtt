features of this puzzle so the size of

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
features of this puzzle so the size of
this<00:00:29.340> puzzle<00:00:29.579> is<00:00:30.000> exactly<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.809> same<00:00:31.140> size<00:00:31.529> as

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
this puzzle is exactly the same size as

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.520 
this puzzle is exactly the same size as
your<00:00:32.160> normal<00:00:32.369> Diana<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.300> high<00:00:33.510> because<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
your normal Diana on high because it is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.819 
your normal Diana on high because it is
just<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.130> dial<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.670> hi<00:00:36.110> rubiks<00:00:37.110> only<00:00:37.500> really

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
just a dial and hi rubiks only really

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830 
just a dial and hi rubiks only really
lived<00:00:38.100> inside<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.940> modded<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> internal

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
lived inside and modded the internal

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.260 
lived inside and modded the internal
pieces<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> outside<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> cube<00:00:41.640> hasn't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
pieces so the outside of the cube hasn't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.770 
pieces so the outside of the cube hasn't
actually<00:00:42.420> changed<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:43.260> all<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.150> size<00:00:45.450> is

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
actually changed at all so the size is

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290 
actually changed at all so the size is
exactly<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> same<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.640> stickers<00:00:48.060> were

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
exactly the same and the stickers were

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.460 
exactly the same and the stickers were
also<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.870> standard<00:00:49.550> Diane<00:00:50.550> Lane<00:00:50.700> hi<00:00:50.910> stickers

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
in the unboxing on my channel so onto

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
in the unboxing on my channel so onto
the<00:01:07.740> turning<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.310> puzzle<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the turning of this puzzle this is the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
the turning of this puzzle this is the
nicest<00:01:09.630> puzzle<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.680> ever<00:01:10.890> felt<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
nicest puzzle that I have ever felt it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.469 
nicest puzzle that I have ever felt it
is<00:01:11.759> so<00:01:12.000> smooth<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.869> turns<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.469> so<00:01:13.649> nice

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
is so smooth and it turns it's so nice

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.330 
is so smooth and it turns it's so nice
there's<00:01:15.479> next<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.960> no<00:01:16.259> friction<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
there's next to no friction on the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.059 
there's next to no friction on the
pieces<00:01:17.579> so<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.509> turning<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.409> easy<00:01:19.679> yet

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.069 
pieces so the turning is really easy yet

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.859 
pieces so the turning is really easy yet
it's<00:01:20.159> still<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.399> very<00:01:20.639> controllable<00:01:21.359> puzzle

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it's still a very controllable puzzle

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.179 
it's still a very controllable puzzle
it's<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:23.039> really<00:01:23.369> easy<00:01:23.579> to<00:01:23.729> turn<00:01:25.189> compared

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it's really really easy to turn compared

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.889 
it's really really easy to turn compared
to<00:01:26.340> my<00:01:26.459> normal<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:27.119> high<00:01:27.299> which<00:01:27.630> I've<00:01:27.749> had<00:01:27.840> for

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
to my normal on high which I've had for

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.609 
to my normal on high which I've had for
quite<00:01:28.139> a<00:01:28.259> while<00:01:29.209> it<00:01:30.209> does<00:01:30.450> turn<00:01:30.659> very<00:01:30.959> nice<00:01:31.200> but

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
quite a while it does turn very nice but

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.349 
quite a while it does turn very nice but
it<00:01:31.709> isn't<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.249> nice<00:01:32.459> as<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.939> bit<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.240> is

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
it isn't as nice as a little bit one is

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.830 
it isn't as nice as a little bit one is
but<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.659> quite<00:01:33.899> slow<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:35.069> I<00:01:35.840> have

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
but it's quite slow actually I have

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.389 
but it's quite slow actually I have
actually<00:01:36.959> lubricated<00:01:37.679> this<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.889> lot<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.219> well

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
actually lubricated this a lot as well

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.569 
actually lubricated this a lot as well
so<00:01:39.619> this<00:01:40.619> puzzle<00:01:41.039> which<00:01:41.159> I've<00:01:41.279> not<00:01:41.429> actually

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
so this puzzle which I've not actually

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.090 
so this puzzle which I've not actually
had<00:01:41.909> very<00:01:41.939> long<00:01:42.450> at<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:42.779> turns<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.889> better

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
had very long at all turns a lot better

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.519 
had very long at all turns a lot better
already<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.969> haven't<00:01:45.270> properly<00:01:45.899> broken<00:01:46.289> it

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:46.529 
already and I haven't properly broken it

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:49.279 
already and I haven't properly broken it
in<00:01:46.649> yet<00:01:46.859> it<00:01:47.789> just<00:01:47.999> turns<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.539> much<00:01:48.749> better<00:01:48.990> than

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
in yet it just turns so much better than

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.120 
in yet it just turns so much better than
any<00:01:49.529> other<00:01:49.799> 3x3<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:51.439> now<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.499> guess<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:53.039> I

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
any other 3x3 I have now I guess if I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.039 
any other 3x3 I have now I guess if I
did<00:01:53.310> buy<00:01:53.459> a<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:53.759> bit<00:01:53.939> zhanchi<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.899> would

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
did buy a little bit zhanchi that would

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.800 
did buy a little bit zhanchi that would
turn<00:01:55.229> very<00:01:55.590> well<00:01:55.889> but<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.789> just<00:01:57.209> like<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> lube

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
turn very well but I just like the lube

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.789 
turn very well but I just like the lube
it's<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.170> hi

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's one hi

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's one hi
there's<00:01:59.039> something<00:01:59.340> about<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> long<00:01:59.849> car

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
there's something about the long car

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.510 
there's something about the long car
that<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:01.109> and<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:02.039> feels<00:02:02.340> so

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
that I really like and it just feels so

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.819 
that I really like and it just feels so
nice

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
nice

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.019 
nice
the<00:02:04.829> size<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.279> it<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.759> little<00:02:05.939> bit

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:06.029 
the size of it that it's a little bit

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.330 
the size of it that it's a little bit
small<00:02:06.359> I<00:02:06.630> really<00:02:06.929> like<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.349> this<00:02:07.950> cube<00:02:08.250> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
small I really like that this cube is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.330 
small I really like that this cube is
also<00:02:08.520> really<00:02:08.910> good<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.149> 100<00:02:09.780> solving<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:11.160> one

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
also really good for 100 solving the one

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.309 
also really good for 100 solving the one
hi<00:02:11.490> is<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.849> my<00:02:11.970> favorite<00:02:12.240> 3x3<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.110> pieces

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
hi is just my favorite 3x3 so the pieces

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.589 
hi is just my favorite 3x3 so the pieces
on<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.650> puzzle<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.280> been<00:02:17.519> modded<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.299> cube

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
on this puzzle have been modded the cube

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.920 
on this puzzle have been modded the cube
has<00:02:18.750> had<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.079> 48<00:02:19.739> point<00:02:20.069> edge

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
has had the 48 point edge

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.930 
has had the 48 point edge
now<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.530> don't<00:02:21.620> really<00:02:22.160> know<00:02:22.430> what<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.730> is

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
now I don't really know what that is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.310 
now I don't really know what that is
because<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.360> haven't<00:02:23.690> really<00:02:23.930> seen<00:02:24.260> much

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
because I haven't really seen much

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.770 
because I haven't really seen much
difference<00:02:24.950> on<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.340> pieces<00:02:25.700> anyway<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.750> I

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
difference on the pieces anyway but I

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.780 
difference on the pieces anyway but I
guess<00:02:27.110> because<00:02:27.380> I've<00:02:27.650> had<00:02:27.830> my<00:02:28.010> normal<00:02:28.610> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
guess because I've had my normal and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.880 
guess because I've had my normal and
high<00:02:28.910> for<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.330> long<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.840> guess<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.320> have<00:02:30.530> kind<00:02:30.710> of

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
high for so long I guess I have kind of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.520 
high for so long I guess I have kind of
worn<00:02:31.130> down<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.430> pieces<00:02:31.790> anyway<00:02:32.530> but

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
worn down the pieces anyway but

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.500 
worn down the pieces anyway but
apparently<00:02:33.890> prevents<00:02:34.400> lock<00:02:34.640> ups<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.420> be

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
apparently prevents lock ups and to be

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.940 
apparently prevents lock ups and to be
honest<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.840> haven't<00:02:36.020> actually<00:02:36.230> had<00:02:36.500> any<00:02:36.680> lock

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
honest I haven't actually had any lock

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.060 
honest I haven't actually had any lock
ups<00:02:37.130> at<00:02:37.280> all<00:02:37.430> anyway<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:38.830> whatever<00:02:39.830> they've

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
ups at all anyway so whatever they've

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.750 
ups at all anyway so whatever they've
done<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.640> definitely<00:02:41.120> works<00:02:42.460> but<00:02:43.460> as<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.640> can

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
done it definitely works but as you can

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.120 
done it definitely works but as you can
see<00:02:43.820> this<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.660> just<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:45.080> normal<00:02:45.440> one<00:02:45.560> hi<00:02:45.800> the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
see this is just a normal one hi the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.190 
see this is just a normal one hi the
same<00:02:46.340> sensors<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.000> everything<00:02:47.120> compared<00:02:48.080> to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
same sensors and everything compared to

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.460 
same sensors and everything compared to
my<00:02:48.320> normal<00:02:48.590> one<00:02:49.010> as<00:02:49.160> well<00:02:49.750> as<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:50.990> see<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
my normal one as well as you can see the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.170 
my normal one as well as you can see the
pieces<00:02:51.860> aren't<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.310> lyrics<00:02:52.460> one<00:02:52.820> haven't

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
pieces aren't the lyrics one haven't

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.260 
pieces aren't the lyrics one haven't
been<00:02:53.300> worn<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.690> as<00:02:53.840> much<00:02:54.760> but<00:02:55.760> yeah<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.210> just

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
been worn in as much but yeah it's just

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.640 
been worn in as much but yeah it's just
a<00:02:56.510> standard<00:02:56.900> one<00:02:57.110> hi<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.840> cube<00:03:00.080> is<00:03:00.260> very

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
a standard one hi so the cube is very

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.250 
a standard one hi so the cube is very
good<00:03:00.950> for<00:03:01.190> karna<00:03:01.550> cutting<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.150> have<00:03:02.750> tensioned

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
good for karna cutting I have tensioned

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.020 
good for karna cutting I have tensioned
it<00:03:03.350> since<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.680> got<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.340> was<00:03:04.460> quite<00:03:04.730> loose

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
it since I got it and it was quite loose

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.330 
it since I got it and it was quite loose
out<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.420> box<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.170> have<00:03:06.410> tightened<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.070> quite

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
out the box so I have tightened it quite

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.120 
out the box so I have tightened it quite
a<00:03:07.370> bit<00:03:07.670> but<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.690> still<00:03:09.020> cuts<00:03:09.320> line<00:03:09.710> to<00:03:09.950> line

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
a bit but it still cuts line to line

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.910 
a bit but it still cuts line to line
without<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.790> problem<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.600> sometimes<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.650> can

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
without a problem and sometimes it can

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.030 
without a problem and sometimes it can
cut<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> bit<00:03:14.090> more<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.440> corner<00:03:15.710> cutting<00:03:15.890> is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
cut a bit more so the corner cutting is

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.100 
cut a bit more so the corner cutting is
very<00:03:16.400> very<00:03:16.670> good<00:03:16.940> because<00:03:17.240> I<00:03:17.510> do<00:03:17.660> have<00:03:17.930> my

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
very very good because I do have my

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.290 
very very good because I do have my
cubes<00:03:18.440> quite<00:03:18.710> tight<00:03:19.040> it's<00:03:19.880> just<00:03:20.090> personal

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
cubes quite tight it's just personal

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.020 
cubes quite tight it's just personal
preference<00:03:20.750> but<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:22.040> cube<00:03:22.340> can<00:03:22.490> still<00:03:22.760> kind

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
preference but the cube can still kind

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.440 
preference but the cube can still kind
of<00:03:23.180> cook<00:03:23.300> very<00:03:23.600> very<00:03:23.720> well<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:25.150> it's<00:03:26.150> also

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
of cook very very well and it's also

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.479 
of cook very very well and it's also
very<00:03:26.870> very<00:03:27.020> good<00:03:27.350> for<00:03:27.530> reverse<00:03:27.860> cuts<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.370> can

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
very very good for reverse cuts it can

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.880 
very very good for reverse cuts it can
cut<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.700> bowel<00:03:29.000> half<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.720> cube<00:03:29.989> e<00:03:30.140> reverse<00:03:30.530> it's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
cut a bowel half a cube e reverse it's

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.240 
cut a bowel half a cube e reverse it's
very<00:03:31.220> very<00:03:31.610> nice<00:03:32.709> I've<00:03:33.709> really<00:03:34.100> been

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
very very nice I've really been

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.940 
very very nice I've really been
impressed<00:03:34.340> by<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.970> puzzle<00:03:35.440> turning<00:03:36.440> the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
impressed by this puzzle turning the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.770 
impressed by this puzzle turning the
corner<00:03:37.130> cutting<00:03:37.520> everything<00:03:37.910> it's<00:03:38.180> really

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
corner cutting everything it's really

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.300 
corner cutting everything it's really
really<00:03:39.230> good<00:03:39.380> puzzle<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:42.050> cube<00:03:42.380> also<00:03:42.650> hardly

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
really good puzzle the cube also hardly

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.790 
really good puzzle the cube also hardly
ever<00:03:43.489> locks<00:03:43.820> off<00:03:44.090> so<00:03:44.570> I<00:03:44.810> solve<00:03:45.230> very<00:03:45.530> very

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
ever locks off so I solve very very

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.550 
ever locks off so I solve very very
smoothly<00:03:46.130> on<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.550> I<00:03:47.120> hardly<00:03:47.959> get<00:03:48.110> lock<00:03:48.350> ups

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
smoothly on it I hardly get lock ups

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.320 
smoothly on it I hardly get lock ups
while<00:03:48.739> speed<00:03:49.070> solving<00:03:49.580> which<00:03:49.790> is<00:03:49.970> really

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
while speed solving which is really

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.080 
while speed solving which is really
really<00:03:50.510> nice<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.610> since<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.730> started<00:03:52.970> using

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
really nice and since I started using

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.949 
really nice and since I started using
this<00:03:53.450> cube<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:54.080> have<00:03:54.470> actually<00:03:54.830> got<00:03:54.980> sub-20

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
this cube I have actually got sub-20

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.150 
this cube I have actually got sub-20
I've<00:03:56.959> started<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.350> get<00:03:57.440> some<00:03:57.650> point<00:03:57.830> average

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
I've started to get some point average

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.570 
I've started to get some point average
just<00:03:58.670> quite<00:03:58.970> frequently<00:03:59.540> actually<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.400> am

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
just quite frequently actually so I am

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.060 
just quite frequently actually so I am
very<00:04:01.880> impressed<00:04:02.030> with<00:04:02.360> this<00:04:02.510> puzzle<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.920> might

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
very impressed with this puzzle it might

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.199 
very impressed with this puzzle it might
have<00:04:04.160> something<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.489> do<00:04:04.700> with<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.940> fact<00:04:05.150> that

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
have something to do with the fact that

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.840 
have something to do with the fact that
I<00:04:05.330> have<00:04:05.630> pretty<00:04:06.080> much<00:04:06.200> learnt<00:04:06.560> full<00:04:06.950> PLL<00:04:07.459> but

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
I have pretty much learnt full PLL but

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.660 
I have pretty much learnt full PLL but
still<00:04:08.500> since<00:04:09.500> I've<00:04:09.680> started<00:04:09.860> using<00:04:10.100> this<00:04:10.280> cube

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
still since I've started using this cube

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.270 
still since I've started using this cube
I've<00:04:10.880> been<00:04:11.030> solving<00:04:11.330> a<00:04:11.420> lot<00:04:11.600> smoother<00:04:12.320> and<00:04:12.980> not

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
I've been solving a lot smoother and not

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.460 
I've been solving a lot smoother and not
been<00:04:13.430> getting<00:04:13.519> lock<00:04:13.850> ups<00:04:14.030> at<00:04:14.150> all<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:14.989> guess

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
been getting lock ups at all so I guess

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.990 
been getting lock ups at all so I guess
that<00:04:15.590> has<00:04:15.709> definitely<00:04:15.950> contributed<00:04:16.340> to

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
that has definitely contributed to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.840 
that has definitely contributed to
getting<00:04:17.299> sub<00:04:17.660> 20<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:21.320> overall<00:04:21.980> this<00:04:22.400> is<00:04:22.460> an

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
getting sub 20 so overall this is an

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.320 
getting sub 20 so overall this is an
amazing<00:04:23.450> 3x3<00:04:24.200> it<00:04:24.830> costs<00:04:25.220> only<00:04:25.310> 22<00:04:25.940> dollars

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
amazing 3x3 it costs only 22 dollars

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.690 
amazing 3x3 it costs only 22 dollars
