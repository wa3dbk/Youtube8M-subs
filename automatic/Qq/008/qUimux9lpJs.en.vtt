things about being a neckline bit nurse

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.190 
things about being a neckline bit nurse
is<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.239> don't<00:00:57.360> really<00:00:57.540> have<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> typical

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
is that you don't really have a typical

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.160 
is that you don't really have a typical
day<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.730> anything<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.750> happen<00:01:00.930> at

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
day and because anything can happen at

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
day and because anything can happen at
any<00:01:01.290> point<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.870> but<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.530> generally<00:01:04.860> start<00:01:05.430> at

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
any point and but we generally start at

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.819 
any point and but we generally start at

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
hope to finish what about five but

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
hope to finish what about five but
obsolete<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.770> depends<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.490> what's

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
obsolete just depends on what's

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.389 
obsolete just depends on what's
happening<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.889> I<00:01:13.920> thought<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.249> might

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
happening and what I thought you might

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.129 
happening and what I thought you might
like<00:01:14.429> to<00:01:14.609> see<00:01:14.789> some<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.179> stuff<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.990> do

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.139 
like to see some of the stuff but we do

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:48.830 
like to see some of the stuff but we do
in<00:01:16.289> a<00:01:16.350> day

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.850 

and<00:01:49.840> we're<00:01:50.110> just<00:01:50.260> going<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.410> take<00:01:50.590> a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
and we're just going to take a

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.370 
and we're just going to take a
peritoneal<00:01:51.820> tap<00:01:52.090> from<00:01:52.390> this<00:01:52.600> horse<00:01:52.840> which<00:01:53.350> is

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
peritoneal tap from this horse which is

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.930 
peritoneal tap from this horse which is
a<00:01:53.860> belly<00:01:54.130> tap<00:01:54.400> and<00:01:54.670> we<00:01:55.630> get<00:01:56.190> there's<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.250> cavity

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
a belly tap and we get there's a cavity

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.730 
a belly tap and we get there's a cavity
there<00:01:58.120> where<00:01:58.330> we<00:01:58.420> can<00:01:58.570> get<00:01:58.810> fluid<00:01:59.200> from<00:01:59.440> and

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
there where we can get fluid from and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.950 
there where we can get fluid from and
then<00:02:00.370> we'll<00:02:00.580> test<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.940> fluid<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.570> see<00:02:01.780> what

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
then we'll test the fluid to see what

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:14.880 
then we'll test the fluid to see what
the<00:02:02.050> white<00:02:02.230> blood<00:02:02.500> cells<00:02:02.800> alike

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.010 

just<00:02:15.550> going<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.819> run<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.330> sample<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:16.990> the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
just going to run the sample on the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:31.440 
just going to run the sample on the
hematology<00:02:17.680> machine<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.540> opportunites<00:02:30.450> then

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
hematology machine so opportunites then

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.840 
hematology machine so opportunites then
I'll<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:31.930> measure<00:02:32.860> its<00:02:33.190> total<00:02:33.610> protein<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
I'll just measure its total protein and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:44.699 
I'll just measure its total protein and
the<00:02:37.720> refractometer<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.230> results<00:02:44.620> for

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
the refractometer and so the results for

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.170 
the refractometer and so the results for
that<00:02:44.800> for<00:02:45.130> its<00:02:45.250> white<00:02:45.400> blood<00:02:45.610> cell<00:02:45.790> that's<00:02:45.940> not

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
that for its white blood cell that's not

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.640 
that for its white blood cell that's not
point<00:02:46.420> eight<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:46.810> that's<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.050> good<00:02:47.200> indicator

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
point eight so that's a good indicator

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.410 
point eight so that's a good indicator
and<00:02:48.239> these<00:02:49.239> two<00:02:49.540> have<00:02:49.750> had<00:02:49.900> surgery<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:51.420> so

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
and these two have had surgery and so

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.660 
and these two have had surgery and so
they're<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:52.870> recovering<00:02:53.680> now<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.459> we're

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
they're just recovering now and we're

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.790 
they're just recovering now and we're
just<00:02:54.700> increasing<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.750> amount<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.320> feed<00:02:56.560> their

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
just increasing the amount of feed their

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.710 
just increasing the amount of feed their
gex<00:02:56.980> once<00:02:57.310> I've<00:02:57.489> had<00:02:57.640> surgery<00:02:58.180> they<00:02:58.300> go<00:02:58.420> on<00:02:58.570> to

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
gex once I've had surgery they go on to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.540 
gex once I've had surgery they go on to
fluids<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.290> don't<00:02:59.440> have<00:02:59.590> any<00:02:59.650> food<00:03:00.040> for<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> few

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
fluids and don't have any food for a few

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.449 
fluids and don't have any food for a few
days<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.900> then<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.620> have<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.860> introduce<00:03:03.070> it

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
days and then you have to introduce it

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.180 
days and then you have to introduce it
slowly<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:04.300> make<00:03:04.420> sure<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.900> their<00:03:05.190> stomach

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
slowly to make sure that their stomach

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.140

horse<00:03:28.870> because<00:03:29.049> we're<00:03:29.170> now<00:03:29.260> going<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.650> give<00:03:29.769> it

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
horse because we're now going to give it

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.160 
horse because we're now going to give it
some<00:03:30.070> drugs<00:03:30.370> but<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.150> have<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.450> work<00:03:31.600> out<00:03:31.930> how

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
some drugs but you have to work out how

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.009 
some drugs but you have to work out how
much<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.560> give<00:03:32.709> by<00:03:33.040> per<00:03:33.400> kilogram<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.690> we<00:03:34.870> now

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
much to give by per kilogram so we now

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.449 
much to give by per kilogram so we now
know<00:03:35.200> how<00:03:35.410> much<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.739> weighs<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.220> we<00:03:36.280> can

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
know how much it weighs and we can

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.520 
know how much it weighs and we can
calculate<00:03:36.670> its<00:03:37.120> drugs<00:03:37.360> this<00:03:38.019> also<00:03:38.230> has<00:03:38.410> got<00:03:38.500> a

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
calculate its drugs this also has got a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.350 
calculate its drugs this also has got a
wound<00:03:38.769> on<00:03:39.010> its<00:03:39.070> heal<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.790> because<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.120> where

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
wound on its heal and because of where

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.000 
wound on its heal and because of where
it<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.840> keeps<00:03:41.049> opening<00:03:41.260> sort<00:03:41.769> of<00:03:41.829> put<00:03:41.980> a

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
it is it keeps opening sort of put a

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.550 
it is it keeps opening sort of put a
cast<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.579> horse<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.090> keep<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.450> still<00:03:43.780> so

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
cast on the horse to keep it still so

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.080 
cast on the horse to keep it still so
that<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.860> wind<00:03:45.040> can<00:03:45.220> heal<00:03:45.610> and<00:03:47.130> i<00:03:48.130> actually

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
that the wind can heal and i actually

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.420 
bit of tape there so the horse can't
change<00:05:27.950> itself<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:29.320> then<00:05:30.320> turn<00:05:30.650> it<00:05:30.680> on<00:05:30.830> there
