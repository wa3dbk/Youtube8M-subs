 At the beginning of each automated 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.330
 Production is the smooth flow 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.760
 of the raw material from the goods receipt over 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.910
 the material preparation and promotion 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.650
 up to the injection molding machine 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.740
 raw material is different 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.130
 Delivered in the case of the enns as a sackware 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.380
 or big bags are done after unloading 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.629
 the true input check with internal 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.820
 marking a possible 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.860
 Tracing is according to this principle 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 first in first out ensures the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.410
 rest commodity will be in specially for that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.300
 provided areas from the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.559
 static warehouse all the way to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.750
 Space saving sliding shelf system 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.780
 a bag task funnel made of stainless steel 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.880
 takes the raw material to smaller ones 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.610
 Container wander in the blue plastic 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.060
 Great cocktails are over tilting 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.610

 two-stage side channel compression 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.210
 ensure optimal under pressure 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.439
 Generation for a gentle material 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.590
 promotion for loading of 60

 injection molding machines with 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.220
 Plastic granules were over 5000 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.729
 meter stainless steel tube dn 50 and over 700 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.869
 glass shelves laid technical 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.450
 plastic granules with some 50 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.340
 percent glass fiber content needed in 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.500
 materials handling materials 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.950
 corresponding wear protection in 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.439
 concrete application case glass shelves for 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.630
 an optimal conveyor logic became that 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.270
 pipe network also laid outdoors 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.670
 for this had separate requirements 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.930
 like insulation protection from weathering though 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.369
 also the sound insulation can be fulfilled 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.009
 39 3 world dryer with one 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.899
 Total power up to 1600 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.869
 cubic meters of dry air per hour 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.160
 allow for optimal material and 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.180
 energy efficiency 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.680
 that means a 30 to 40 percent 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.120
 Energy saving compared 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.580
 conventional molecular drying them 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.849
 parallel to the central drying takes place 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.400
 the decentralized drying so directly on 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:35.280
 the injection molding machine exactly as needed 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:37.349
 and request about the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.319
 Production control with support 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.989
 the erp system carries out the planning of the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.090
 production process the necessary 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.940
 documents are directly related to the manufacturer 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 before the rest process available to all 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.569
 relevant data for the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.700
 material supply including drying 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.160
 Parameters are transmitted via barcodes 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.810
 given so that a consistent 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.700
 secured coupling of the conveyor 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.730
 with an optimal material 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.830
 processing is possible the central 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.909
 Visualization shows the status of the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.560
 plant throughout the entire production chain 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.690
 in production processes the one 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.879
 supply of grinded material 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.370
 the exact dosage is done by means of 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.319
 gravimetric dosing systems too 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.099
 in the dosing of far patches for 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.099
 come use 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.480
 insert processes require besides the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.410
 injection still another 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.349
 degree of automation for the handling of 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.180
 metal parts an automated 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.220
 Feeding and loading of the metal 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.220
 axes with integrated poka yoke 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.799
 Methods ensure the placement process 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.260
 injection molding tool the subsequent 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.110
 injection molding process ends with the robot 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.660
 removal of the finished parts the consequences of 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.230
 100% testing with high speed cameras 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.880
 guarantee a zero error strategy 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.769
 for gentle treatment of the parts 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.319
 These are determined by a specific 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.230
 Assembly logic directly into the customer 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.450
 and packaging packed 32 containers 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.060
 get together and can 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.319
 directly on the truck and safely loaded 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.319
 to the customer
