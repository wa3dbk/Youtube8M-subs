hello<00:00:01.050> there<00:00:01.260> and<00:00:01.290> welcome<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.220> little

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
hello there and welcome to this little

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.760 
hello there and welcome to this little
quick<00:00:02.700> tip<00:00:03.080> today<00:00:04.080> I'm<00:00:04.200> gonna<00:00:04.319> show<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.560> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
quick tip today I'm gonna show you the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.099 
quick tip today I'm gonna show you the
little<00:00:04.859> bit<00:00:04.980> about<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:06.270> new<00:00:06.600> little

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
little bit about this new little

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.209 
little bit about this new little
technique<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.680> found<00:00:09.860> that<00:00:10.860> relates<00:00:11.130> to

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
technique that I found that relates to

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.539 
technique that I found that relates to
hard<00:00:11.429> surface<00:00:11.730> modeling<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> normally

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
hard surface modeling so normally

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.300 
hard surface modeling so normally
whenever<00:00:14.759> you're<00:00:15.089> doing<00:00:15.929> any<00:00:16.260> hard<00:00:17.190> surface

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
whenever you're doing any hard surface

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.460 
whenever you're doing any hard surface
modeling<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.270> do<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> lot<00:00:19.439> of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
modeling you have to do a lot of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.200 
modeling you have to do a lot of
creasing<00:00:20.660> via<00:00:21.660> edge<00:00:22.050> loops<00:00:23.090> inserting<00:00:24.090> edge

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
creasing via edge loops inserting edge

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.599 
creasing via edge loops inserting edge
loops<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.050> normally<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.310> you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
loops so normally what you do is you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.710 
loops so normally what you do is you
just<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.840> sort<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.170> thing<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:29.449> I've<00:00:30.449> done

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
just do this sort of thing and I've done

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.860 
just do this sort of thing and I've done
this<00:00:30.840> for<00:00:31.080> years<00:00:31.289> basically<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
this for years basically like just that

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.330 
this for years basically like just that
technique<00:00:34.230> right<00:00:34.410> there<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:37.040> blender<00:00:38.040> has

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
technique right there and blender has

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.810 
technique right there and blender has
not<00:00:38.550> had<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.120> end<00:00:39.660> gun<00:00:39.840> tools<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.980> mesh

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
not had the end gun tools will be mesh

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.510 
not had the end gun tools will be mesh
is<00:00:42.270> what's<00:00:42.510> called<00:00:42.750> now<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.559> um<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:44.280> years

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
is what's called now but um for years

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.000 
is what's called now but um for years
and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.420> had<00:00:45.780> been<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.200> ingrained<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and I had been so ingrained in it that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.160 
and I had been so ingrained in it that
and<00:00:47.250> even<00:00:47.430> realized<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.239> there's<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:48.960> one

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and even realized that there's just one

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.650 
and even realized that there's just one
technique<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.800> use<00:00:49.950> that's<00:00:50.660> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
technique that you can use that's you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.330 
technique that you can use that's you
couldn't<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.079> able<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.320> use<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.039> weren't

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
couldn't be able to use that you weren't

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.510 
couldn't be able to use that you weren't
able<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> use<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.860> all<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.070> time<00:00:56.309> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
able to use for all that time that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.760 
able to use for all that time that
blender<00:00:56.879> didn't<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.449> tool<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
blender didn't have this tool so the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.090 
blender didn't have this tool so the
tool<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.039> beveled<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.440> usually<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.949> I

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
tool is beveled and usually like I

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.570 
tool is beveled and usually like I
didn't<00:01:02.579> use<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.210> long<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
didn't use it for a long time and

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.130 
didn't use it for a long time and
usually<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:06.180> oh<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.540> beveled

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
usually you just think oh it's beveled

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.840 
usually you just think oh it's beveled
or<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.830> creating<00:01:08.570> just<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.689> little<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.770> know

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
or like creating just a little you know

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
or like creating just a little you know
edges<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> didn't

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
edges right there but what I didn't

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.200 
edges right there but what I didn't
realize<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> turn<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
realize is that you can turn up the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.179 
realize is that you can turn up the
segment's<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> little<00:01:16.049> bit<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.040> get

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
segment's a little bit and you can get

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.850 
segment's a little bit and you can get
exactly<00:01:17.909> what<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.479> did<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.830> whole

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
exactly what I just did the whole

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.399 
exactly what I just did the whole
inserting<00:01:20.549> edge<00:01:20.670> loop<00:01:20.880> thing<00:01:21.060> only<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.659> more

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
inserting edge loop thing only it's more

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.690 
inserting edge loop thing only it's more
precise<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.270> adjust<00:01:24.390> how<00:01:25.549> sharp<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
precise and you can adjust how sharp the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.179 
precise and you can adjust how sharp the
creases<00:01:27.060> afterwards<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.229> instead<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> having

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
creases afterwards so instead of having

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.940 
creases afterwards so instead of having
to<00:01:29.340> readjust<00:01:29.930> this<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.560> having<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
to readjust this and like having the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.030 
to readjust this and like having the
edge<00:01:32.070> slide<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.850> everything<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.720> just

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
edge slide and everything you can just

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
edge slide and everything you can just
put<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.159> right<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.750> you're<00:01:36.750> good<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.930> go

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
put it right in and you're good to go

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.300 
put it right in and you're good to go
you<00:01:37.170> don't<00:01:37.439> even<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.890> modify<00:01:38.340> at<00:01:38.579> all<00:01:40.310> but

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you don't even have to modify at all but

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.950 
you don't even have to modify at all but
there's<00:01:41.820> other<00:01:42.000> app<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.780> with

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
there's other app it's not just with

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.800 
there's other app it's not just with
single<00:01:43.439> edges<00:01:43.710> either<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.299> you<00:01:45.299> know<00:01:45.420> if

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
single edges either you can you know if

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.380 
single edges either you can you know if
you<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.430> like<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.820> part<00:01:48.119> it's

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you have like a like this part it's

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.340 
you have like a like this part it's
rolling<00:01:48.659> across<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:51.140> insert<00:01:52.140> one

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
rolling across here you can insert one

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
rolling across here you can insert one
right<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.280> even<00:01:53.610> control<00:01:54.060> how

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
right there and you can even control how

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.810 
right there and you can even control how
tight<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> want<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> even<00:01:56.070> how

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
tight you want that to be and even how

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.780 
tight you want that to be and even how
many<00:01:56.880> segments<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:58.920> there

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
many segments that are on there

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.610 
many segments that are on there
and<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.690> just<00:02:00.960> creates<00:02:01.650> this<00:02:01.740> amazing<00:02:03.620> hard

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
and it just creates this amazing hard

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.500 
and it just creates this amazing hard
surface<00:02:05.030> look<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.050> could<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:07.890> this

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
surface look like I I could not get this

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.980 
surface look like I I could not get this
sort<00:02:09.510> of<00:02:09.570> thing<00:02:10.200> even<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.680> I<00:02:10.800> want<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.340> with

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990

sort of thing even if I want to with
inserting<00:02:12.990> edge<00:02:13.230> loops<00:02:13.500> because<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:14.280> so

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
inserting edge loops because it's so

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.310 
inserting edge loops because it's so
precise<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.610> clean<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.970> make<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.450> it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
precise and it's so clean to make and it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.100 
precise and it's so clean to make and it
doesn't<00:02:19.920> take<00:02:20.070> any<00:02:20.220> time<00:02:20.310> either<00:02:20.880> which<00:02:21.060> is

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110

there's one more thing that I want to
show<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.800> this<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:31.890> happening

show you and that is this is happening
to<00:02:32.310> me<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.700> don't<00:02:32.940> know<00:02:33.030> how<00:02:33.240> many<00:02:33.300> times<00:02:33.860> but

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
to me I don't know how many times but

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.560 
to me I don't know how many times but
like<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.510> going<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.930> make<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:38.090> like<00:02:39.090> an<00:02:39.210> insect

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
like you going to make a like an insect

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.110 
like you going to make a like an insect
on<00:02:40.020> your<00:02:40.290> hard<00:02:40.470> surface<00:02:40.770> mesh<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:42.000> have

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
on your hard surface mesh so you have

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.780 
on your hard surface mesh so you have
like<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.270> circle<00:02:42.690> type<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.080> thing<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.190> maybe

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
like a circle type of thing and maybe

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.690 
like a circle type of thing and maybe
you<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.660> too<00:02:46.080> sphere<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:47.190> make<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.460> circular

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
you do too sphere to make it circular

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.550 
you do too sphere to make it circular
and<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.980> go<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:52.160> extrude<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.520> who<00:02:54.030> forgets

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
and you go to extrude it and who forgets

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.260 
and you go to extrude it and who forgets
because<00:02:55.560> either<00:02:55.920> you're<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.640> low<00:02:57.000> poly

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
because either you're in like low poly

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.860 
because either you're in like low poly
mode<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.620> forget<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.720> insert<00:03:00.720> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
mode and you just forget to insert it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.190 
mode and you just forget to insert it
but<00:03:01.020> usually<00:03:01.950> what<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.160> do<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.520> you<00:03:03.200> extrude

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
but usually what you do is you extrude

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470 
but usually what you do is you extrude
scale<00:03:04.590> down<00:03:04.770> first<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.820> then<00:03:05.910> set<00:03:06.120> then

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
scale down first and then set then

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.890 
scale down first and then set then
extrude<00:03:07.440> down<00:03:07.590> but<00:03:08.580> sometimes<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.420> forget<00:03:09.570> I

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
extrude down but sometimes I forget I

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.550 
extrude down but sometimes I forget I
just<00:03:10.110> go<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:11.840> have<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.989> redo<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
just go like that and I have to redo the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.320

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
entire thing I have to delete that face

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.900 
entire thing I have to delete that face
and<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.200> do<00:03:16.739> all<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:16.980> junk<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:17.760> now

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
this edge at bevel control B again and

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.310 
this edge at bevel control B again and
you're<00:03:27.090> good<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.209> go<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.810> don't<00:03:27.900> even<00:03:28.080> have<00:03:28.200> to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
over again I can tighten it up as much

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
don't even have to select the edges if

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
you have like a singular face like this

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.720 
you have like a singular face like this
can't<00:03:41.580> control<00:03:41.880> B<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:43.340> scale<00:03:44.340> down<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.580> little

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
can't control B and scale down a little

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.300 
can't control B and scale down a little
bit<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> nice<00:03:46.440> clean<00:03:46.860> insight

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
into your heart surface

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.140 
into your heart surface
and<00:03:50.300> I<00:03:50.450> just<00:03:50.630> think<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:50.900> is<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:52.370> cool<00:03:52.610> just

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
that you can do this now and I hadn't

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.070 
that you can do this now and I hadn't
known<00:03:55.820> about<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.240> for<00:03:56.390> such<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.660> long<00:03:56.990> time<00:03:57.160> but

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
known about it for such a long time but

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.400
