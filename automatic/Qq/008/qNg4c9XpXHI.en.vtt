short but the second one is actually a

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.490 
short but the second one is actually a
lot<00:00:47.170> longer<00:00:47.379> than<00:00:47.649> I<00:00:47.829> thought<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.190> was<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.719> I'm

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
lot longer than I thought it was but I'm

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.229 
lot longer than I thought it was but I'm
just<00:00:50.649> gonna<00:00:50.769> cover<00:00:50.980> these<00:00:51.219> two<00:00:51.429> conversations

just gonna cover these two conversations

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.419 
just gonna cover these two conversations
and<00:00:52.539> then<00:00:53.289> I'll<00:00:53.440> go<00:00:53.620> ahead<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:54.010> get<00:00:54.160> ready<00:00:54.339> to

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
and then I'll go ahead and get ready to

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.950 
and then I'll go ahead and get ready to
start<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.670> chapter<00:00:55.149> as<00:00:55.359> you<00:00:55.510> can<00:00:55.629> see<00:00:55.750> this<00:00:55.870> is

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
start the chapter as you can see this is

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.619 
start the chapter as you can see this is
only<00:00:56.079> a<00:00:56.230> seven<00:00:56.559> minute<00:00:56.800> video<00:00:57.179> but<00:00:58.179> the<00:00:58.269> second

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
only a seven minute video but the second

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.110 
only a seven minute video but the second
video<00:00:58.749> for<00:00:59.170> today<00:00:59.289> will<00:00:59.559> be<00:00:59.589> the<00:01:00.190> entire<00:01:00.550> 11

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
video for today will be the entire 11

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.989 
video for today will be the entire 11
minute<00:01:01.390> period<00:01:01.839> so<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:02.410> think<00:01:03.280> that'll<00:01:03.670> make<00:01:03.699> up

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
minute period so I think that'll make up

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:07.740 
minute period so I think that'll make up
for<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.269> rather<00:01:05.019> short<00:01:05.440> video<00:01:06.480> so<00:01:07.480> once

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.110 
for this rather short video so once
again<00:01:07.900> this<00:01:08.290> chapter<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.010> bean<00:01:09.220> 5<00:01:09.670> videos

desert<00:02:03.820> terrain<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.469> seems<00:02:05.649> like<00:02:05.829> in

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
desert terrain because it seems like in

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.620 
desert terrain because it seems like in
every<00:02:06.189> game<00:02:06.369> they<00:02:06.549> try<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:06.820> add<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.270> desert

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
every game they try to add the desert

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.889 
every game they try to add the desert
arena<00:02:07.869> in<00:02:08.170> at<00:02:08.320> least<00:02:08.470> one<00:02:08.800> chapter<00:02:09.100> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
arena in at least one chapter and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.210 
arena in at least one chapter and
basically<00:02:10.899> what<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.170> desert<00:02:11.470> train<00:02:11.680> does<00:02:11.980> is

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
basically what the desert train does is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.270 
basically what the desert train does is
it<00:02:12.370> slows<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.970> down<00:02:13.000> majorly<00:02:14.160> units<00:02:15.160> on

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
it slows you down majorly units on

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.630 
it slows you down majorly units on
horseback<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.270> armored<00:02:17.230> units<00:02:17.860> have<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.130> very

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
horseback and armored units have a very

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.070 
horseback and armored units have a very
difficult<00:02:18.940> time<00:02:19.390> moving<00:02:19.690> through<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.140> sands

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
difficult time moving through the sands

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.860 
difficult time moving through the sands
and<00:02:21.230> then<00:02:21.980> also<00:02:22.640> it's<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.090> some<00:02:23.420> units<00:02:23.750> in

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
and then also it's just some units in

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.650 
and then also it's just some units in
general<00:02:24.260> will<00:02:24.380> have<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> smaller<00:02:25.660> movement

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
general will have a smaller movement

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.130 
general will have a smaller movement
range<00:02:26.870> than<00:02:27.200> they<00:02:27.290> normally<00:02:27.470> would<00:02:27.950> have

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
range than they normally would have

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.140 
range than they normally would have
however<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.590> can<00:02:30.770> kind<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.040> avoid<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.640> using

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
however you can kind of avoid this using

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.110 
however you can kind of avoid this using
flying<00:02:32.630> units<00:02:33.110> magical<00:02:33.920> units<00:02:34.250> or<00:02:34.520> magic

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
flying units magical units or magic

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.060 
flying units magical units or magic
units<00:02:35.450> not<00:02:35.660> magical<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.290> guess<00:02:36.530> but<00:02:36.740> whatever

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
units not magical I guess but whatever

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.730 
units not magical I guess but whatever
and<00:02:37.630> thieves<00:02:38.630> because<00:02:39.110> they<00:02:39.260> can<00:02:39.410> actually

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
and thieves because they can actually

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.200 
and thieves because they can actually
move<00:02:39.890> through<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.250> sands<00:02:40.760> pretty<00:02:40.970> quickly

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
move through the sands pretty quickly

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.260 
move through the sands pretty quickly
and<00:02:41.570> then<00:02:42.320> some<00:02:42.740> units<00:02:43.160> like<00:02:43.370> upgraded<00:02:44.000> class

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
and then some units like upgraded class

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.450 
and then some units like upgraded class
units<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:44.900> Boyd<00:02:45.560> at<00:02:45.770> this<00:02:45.890> time<00:02:46.100> can<00:02:46.340> also

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
units like Boyd at this time can also

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.840 
units like Boyd at this time can also
move<00:02:46.850> through<00:02:47.090> quite<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.720> few<00:02:47.810> spaces<00:02:48.170> as<00:02:48.500> well

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
move through quite a few spaces as well

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.280 
move through quite a few spaces as well
but<00:02:49.850> just<00:02:49.910> keep<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.480> mind<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.960> when<00:02:51.140> you're

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
but just keep in mind that when you're

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.070 
but just keep in mind that when you're
going<00:02:51.530> through<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.890> sands<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.940> will<00:02:53.660> be<00:02:53.810> left

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
going through the sands you will be left

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.860 
going through the sands you will be left
behind<00:02:54.200> more<00:02:55.160> often<00:02:55.580> than<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:56.480> would

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
behind more often than you would

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.890 
behind more often than you would
normally<00:02:57.230> on<00:02:57.620> normal<00:02:58.040> terrain<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.480> just<00:02:59.720> keep

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
normally on normal terrain so just keep

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.130 
normally on normal terrain so just keep
that<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.110> mind<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.710> use<00:03:00.890> your<00:03:02.110> use<00:03:03.110> your

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
that in mind and use your use your

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.020 
that in mind and use your use your
movement<00:03:03.920> limits<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.610> best<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:04.910> your

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
movement limits to the best of your

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.230 
movement limits to the best of your
ability<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.770> think<00:03:06.770> in<00:03:06.920> this<00:03:07.070> video<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.730> use<00:03:08.210> a

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
ability I think in this video I use a

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.060 
ability I think in this video I use a
lot<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.690> units<00:03:09.020> that<00:03:09.170> have<00:03:09.380> high<00:03:09.590> movement

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
lot of units that have high movement

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.350 
lot of units that have high movement
range<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.610> they<00:03:10.820> don't<00:03:10.970> really<00:03:11.060> have<00:03:11.180> that

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
range so they don't really have that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.610 
range so they don't really have that
much<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.840> problem<00:03:13.960> but<00:03:14.960> we're<00:03:15.350> gonna<00:03:15.440> go

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
much of a problem but we're gonna go

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.160 
much of a problem but we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:15.710> and<00:03:15.830> leave<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.310> base<00:03:16.840> also<00:03:17.840> something

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
ahead and leave the base also something

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.940 
ahead and leave the base also something
else<00:03:18.350> about<00:03:18.590> sand<00:03:20.110> there<00:03:21.110> are<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.320> lot<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.740> items

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
else about sand there are a lot of items

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.860 
else about sand there are a lot of items
you<00:03:22.310> could<00:03:22.460> find<00:03:22.700> hidden<00:03:22.940> in<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.270> sand<00:03:23.510> and

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
you could find hidden in the sand and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.640 
you could find hidden in the sand and
I'm<00:03:24.710> also<00:03:24.920> going<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.750> be<00:03:26.750> taking<00:03:27.140> some<00:03:27.170> units

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
I'm also going to be taking some units

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.790 
I'm also going to be taking some units
around<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.070> area<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:28.760> had<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> game<00:03:30.170> if<00:03:30.350> accused

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
around the area I had a game if accused

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.770 
around the area I had a game if accused
page<00:03:31.070> omen<00:03:31.490> at<00:03:31.580> this<00:03:31.700> time<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.209> know<00:03:32.480> all<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
treasures are so I'm also gonna try to

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.740 
treasures are so I'm also gonna try to
get<00:03:35.690> as<00:03:35.780> much<00:03:35.959> buried<00:03:36.709> treasure<00:03:37.010> as<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.400> can<00:03:37.750> in

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
get as much buried treasure as I can in

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.540 
get as much buried treasure as I can in
order<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.080> find<00:03:39.470> buried<00:03:39.830> treasure<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:40.370> need

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
order to find buried treasure you need

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.840 
order to find buried treasure you need
units<00:03:40.910> it's<00:03:41.090> very<00:03:41.420> high<00:03:41.660> luck<00:03:42.020> and<00:03:42.850> usually

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
units it's very high luck and usually

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.120 
units it's very high luck and usually
magic<00:03:44.330> users<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.959> thieves<00:03:45.260> can<00:03:45.620> find<00:03:45.890> stuff

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
magic users and thieves can find stuff

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.600 
magic users and thieves can find stuff
very<00:03:47.000> easily<00:03:47.380> so<00:03:48.380> I'm<00:03:48.620> definitely<00:03:48.980> taking

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
very easily so I'm definitely taking

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.930 
very easily so I'm definitely taking

bandits or so she thinks they're bandits

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.580 
bandits or so she thinks they're bandits
or<00:04:10.130> so<00:04:10.310> we<00:04:10.520> think<00:04:10.760> they're<00:04:10.910> bandits<00:04:11.209> with

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
or so we think they're bandits with

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.420 
or so we think they're bandits with
these<00:04:12.590> guys<00:04:12.860> might<00:04:13.340> have<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.580> little<00:04:13.790> more

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
these guys might have a little more

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.740 
these guys might have a little more
relevance<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.730> storyline<00:04:17.090> than<00:04:17.570> just

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
relevance to the storyline than just

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.480 
relevance to the storyline than just
being<00:04:17.900> bandits<00:04:18.620> but<00:04:18.830> we'll<00:04:19.070> see<00:04:19.220> what<00:04:19.340> happens

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.490

gonna take Boyd I'm not gonna take Oscar

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.460 
gonna take Boyd I'm not gonna take Oscar
because<00:05:08.060> Oscar<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.600> going<00:05:08.840> to<00:05:08.900> have<00:05:09.050> a<00:05:09.080> very

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
because Oscar is going to have a very

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.700 
because Oscar is going to have a very
difficult<00:05:09.770> time<00:05:10.520> moving<00:05:10.940> through<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.360> sand

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
difficult time moving through the sand

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:20.490 
difficult time moving through the sand
and<00:05:12.710> I'd<00:05:12.860> rather<00:05:12.980> not<00:05:13.100> have<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.490> right<00:05:14.180> now

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.920 

I<00:05:20.590> just<00:05:21.280> did<00:05:21.490> that<00:05:21.670> so<00:05:21.880> I<00:05:21.940> could<00:05:22.030> bring<00:05:22.540> them<00:05:22.750> up

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
I just did that so I could bring them up

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.320 
I just did that so I could bring them up
to<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.170> top<00:05:23.500> of<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:23.920> list<00:05:24.160> but<00:05:24.970> now<00:05:25.090> I'm<00:05:25.210> going

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
to the top of the list but now I'm going

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.720 
to the top of the list but now I'm going
to<00:05:25.420> go<00:05:25.510> through<00:05:25.750> all<00:05:25.930> my<00:05:25.960> units<00:05:26.530> show<00:05:27.130> you<00:05:27.190> what

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
to go through all my units show you what

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.030 
to go through all my units show you what
their<00:05:27.880> stats<00:05:28.150> are<00:05:28.360> like<00:05:28.570> since<00:05:29.560> some<00:05:29.770> of<00:05:29.860> them

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
their stats are like since some of them

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.490 
their stats are like since some of them
are<00:05:30.360> advanced<00:05:31.360> one<00:05:31.570> more<00:05:31.750> level<00:05:31.990> because<00:05:32.410> I

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
are advanced one more level because I

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.920 
are advanced one more level because I
gave<00:05:32.650> them<00:05:32.770> bonus<00:05:33.100> experience<00:05:33.720> so<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:34.750> just

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
gave them bonus experience so I just

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.870 
gave them bonus experience so I just
thought<00:05:35.050> I'd<00:05:35.200> take<00:05:35.350> a<00:05:35.410> few<00:05:35.730> seconds<00:05:36.730> or<00:05:36.850> a

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
thought I'd take a few seconds or a

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.940 
thought I'd take a few seconds or a
minute<00:05:37.000> or<00:05:37.330> so<00:05:37.540> just<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.870> show<00:05:38.050> you<00:05:38.080> what<00:05:38.830> all

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
minute or so just to show you what all

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.740 
minute or so just to show you what all
my<00:05:39.070> units<00:05:39.430> look<00:05:39.610> like<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.090> what<00:05:40.210> weapons<00:05:40.540> they

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
my units look like and what weapons they

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.200 
my units look like and what weapons they
have

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
have

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.050 
have
notice<00:05:43.210> how<00:05:43.450> Metheny<00:05:44.110> Wolff<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:45.040> Jill<00:05:45.760> are

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
notice how Metheny Wolff and Jill are

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.930 
notice how Metheny Wolff and Jill are
unable<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:47.170> carry<00:05:47.800> some<00:05:48.190> of<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.400> equipment

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
unable to carry some of the equipment

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.760 
unable to carry some of the equipment
that<00:05:48.970> they<00:05:49.210> have<00:05:49.450> or<00:05:49.780> they're<00:05:49.930> unable<00:05:50.170> to<00:05:50.380> use

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
that they have or they're unable to use

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.890 
that they have or they're unable to use
some<00:05:51.520> of<00:05:51.640> the<00:05:51.700> equipment<00:05:51.820> I'm<00:05:52.390> actually<00:05:52.570> going

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
some of the equipment I'm actually going

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.190 
some of the equipment I'm actually going
to<00:05:53.100> focus<00:05:54.100> on<00:05:54.490> raising<00:05:54.790> them<00:05:55.270> probably<00:05:56.050> the

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
to focus on raising them probably the

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.680 
to focus on raising them probably the
most<00:05:56.410> in<00:05:56.620> this<00:05:56.740> chapter<00:05:57.040> so<00:05:57.880> they<00:05:58.000> can<00:05:58.210> advance

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
most in this chapter so they can advance

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.840 
most in this chapter so they can advance
a<00:05:58.900> few<00:05:59.110> more<00:05:59.260> levels<00:05:59.620> and<00:05:59.830> their<00:06:00.460> weapon

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
a few more levels and their weapon

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.370 
a few more levels and their weapon
levels<00:06:01.210> as<00:06:01.360> well<00:06:01.540> so<00:06:01.810> they<00:06:01.930> can<00:06:02.050> actually<00:06:02.169> use

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
levels as well so they can actually use

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.920 
levels as well so they can actually use
those<00:06:02.740> weapons<00:06:03.240> so<00:06:04.240> a<00:06:04.270> lot<00:06:04.419> of<00:06:04.450> the<00:06:04.600> weapons

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
those weapons so a lot of the weapons

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.600

this<00:06:33.580> formation<00:06:34.240> I<00:06:34.450> kind<00:06:35.320> of<00:06:35.380> just<00:06:35.530> moved

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
really wasn't thinking very much when I

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.080 
really wasn't thinking very much when I
was<00:06:42.910> doing<00:06:43.240> this<00:06:43.360> uh<00:06:43.590> repositioning<00:06:44.940> also<00:06:45.940> I'm
