00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.300
 and point 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.710
 here in the stadium but well triumph 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.080
 and finally 10 against the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.240
 america but in parts first the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.119
 I return the Turk Mohamed 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.310
 moderate applause but not with euphoria 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.840
 to think like that is a return a return 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.130
 expected from the Turkish here to the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.349
 city ​​after it was announced that it was going 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 to lead the team of the America in the 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.910
 hobby as you say this one they received it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.369
 well and after the whistle well as 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.590
 well said he that is rival exactly 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.930
 several interesting plays but some 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 they the most important in a heel 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.690
 of fidel martínez that almost marks in the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.730
 first part that would have been 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.040
 truly a great goal, but not for 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.120
 the second time and clearly that is what 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.390
 became the dominator 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.430
 that's mainly me crown had a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.920
 that a great individual play hits 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.930
 the post and subsequently had to leave 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.370
 injured ankle for years commented 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.600
 that there is nothing of consideration but 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.980
 it was one of the clearest moves that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.270
 I had just like in the castle about 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.800
 everything in what was the unfolding of 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.589
 tijuana and that continued to point was of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.810
 mark but then muñoz had enough to 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.340
 see was sparked to the Hungarian camera these 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.570
 teams and they know very well and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.140
 unfortunately and he was expelled 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.810
 does it unfairly 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.040
 was not the one who was part of it and should 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.990
 to come an appeal from 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.750
 tijuana and perhaps reduction 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.640
 punishment had been ruled out but I ayoví 7 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.190
 point so is the Ecuadorian jaime ayoví 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.040
 he had minutes entered instead of hercule 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.080
 gomez and did not really have much towards the 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.790
 offensive but then he says win 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.530
 exactly is the most important thing 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.470
 and at the peak moment, the triumph 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.479
 with alone in that action that finally 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.040
 remains in the area and pellerano returns to 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.229
 put goal to beat the American 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.759
 exactly like that occasion and there 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.380
 in the Aztec stadium from outside the 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.729
 area did it again here in the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.140
 Hot to mark the stadium 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.520
 would be the final marker of a 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 goal for zero triumph deserved for the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.009
 clients we go with Caesar Farias their 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.009
 words at the end of which 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.510
 internationally I imagine 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.990
 the best team 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.560
 it's part 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.160
 positive things that were seen in the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.160
 court because 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.400
 the situations of goal 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.980
 meanwhile as someone who knows the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.660
 gesture of handling the ups and downs as 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.430
 is Turkish is not exactly the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.320
 america team coach makes 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.740
 the balance of what was this defeat 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.720
 against the tijuana team I felt very 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.970
 bit weird because I did not know in the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.200
 visitor dressing but well pleased 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.550
 by the reception people 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.170
 for the memories that he has left us here 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.690
 and if it's a time 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.760
 by ties exceeded the team does not 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.189
 found the ball and good 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.549
 I hope we serve is learning 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.439
 all all matches serve as 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.239
 experience and we close with the figure of 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.250
 cristian pellerano party that is another 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.409
 once had a great game not nothing 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.480
 more recovering balls defending but 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.220
 with his great offensive contribution he 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.049
 we made a great match I think we went 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.299
 very superior we had the situations 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.970
 clearer throughout the 90 minutes 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.859
 and I think it would have been a point out there 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.680
 we did not have the three points like that 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.700
 we are very happy about that 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.670
 we are very grateful to 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.030
 that what Antonio told us to each one 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.400
 of us and in that sense one one 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.720
 he is always grateful 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.200
 it's important to win so 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.120
 represents the rival and for what it is 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.609
 assert the point of the other day of 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.980
 visitor then it's good to start like this 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.720
 to make us strong and we have to 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.980
 try to keep working to continue 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.569
 down this road from the stadium 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.790
 hot for sports chains luís 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.620
 ramírez ernesto spin rodrigo but no longer 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.950
 There are m for group sports chains 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.950
 chains 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.050
