81<00:00:29.340> degrees

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
81 degrees

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.060 
81 degrees
this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.539> Celsius<00:00:31.109> they<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.740> make<00:00:31.830> them<00:00:31.920> in

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
this is Celsius they don't make them in

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.350 
this is Celsius they don't make them in
Fahrenheit<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:33.030> had<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
Fahrenheit so you just had to get a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.520 
Fahrenheit so you just had to get a
conversion<00:00:33.690> chart<00:00:35.450> after<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.719> done<00:00:36.870> press

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
conversion chart after you done press

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.959 
conversion chart after you done press
the<00:00:37.559> very<00:00:37.920> top<00:00:38.100> key<00:00:38.250> right<00:00:38.430> there<00:00:40.910> all<00:00:41.910> right

the very top key right there all right
you<00:00:42.329> hold<00:00:42.780> down<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> s<00:00:43.170> again<00:00:43.469> we'll<00:00:43.649> go

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you hold down the s again we'll go

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.440 
you hold down the s again we'll go
through<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.010> through<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:44.730> Russell<00:00:45.000> six<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
through that through there Russell six I

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.310 
through that through there Russell six I
tell<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:46.610> what<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.879> f1

tell you what they are what you see f1

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.600 
tell you what they are what you see f1
what<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.860> let<00:00:50.039> go<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> s

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
what you want to do is let go of the s

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.380 
what you want to do is let go of the s
key<00:00:50.850> hit<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.750> once<00:00:52.050> UCF<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.190> hold<00:00:53.969> your<00:00:54.210> s<00:00:54.360> key

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
key hit up once UCF to hold your s key

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.720 
key hit up once UCF to hold your s key
and<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.100> says<00:00:56.250> point<00:00:56.550> five

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and then you see it says point five

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.090 
and then you see it says point five
that's<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> variance<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.020> it'll<00:00:58.680> come<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.980> if

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that's the variance so it'll come on if

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.000 
that's the variance so it'll come on if
it<00:00:59.219> falls<00:00:59.430> between<00:00:59.850> half<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> degree

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
it falls between half a degree

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.950 
it falls between half a degree
falstaff<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> regalo<00:01:03.329> then<00:01:03.570> I'll<00:01:03.690> cuddle<00:01:03.840> on

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
falstaff the regalo then I'll cuddle on

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.679 
falstaff the regalo then I'll cuddle on
the<00:01:04.470> heat<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> goes<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> drag<00:01:06.510> on

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the heat if it goes I have a drag on

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.149 
the heat if it goes I have a drag on
it'll<00:01:07.170> cut<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:10.229> cooling<00:01:10.560> side<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.010> has

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
it'll cut on the the cooling side it has

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.020 
it'll cut on the the cooling side it has
a<00:01:11.189> cool<00:01:11.430> inside<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.210> made<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:14.030> if

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
a cool inside and it's made for all if

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.260 
a cool inside and it's made for all if
you<00:01:15.270> had<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> children<00:01:15.810> hooked<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
you had a children hooked up to like a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.800 
you had a children hooked up to like a
fish<00:01:18.270> aquarium

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
fish aquarium

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.219 
fish aquarium
yeah<00:01:19.500> heating<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.040> cooling<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.689> also<00:01:21.900> works

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
yeah heating and cooling it also works

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.240 
yeah heating and cooling it also works
for<00:01:22.409> an<00:01:22.500> incubator<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> um<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:25.250> fan

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
for an incubator if you have a um a fan

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
for an incubator if you have a um a fan
that<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> cool<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> incubator<00:01:27.810> off

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that up to it to cool the incubator off

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.620 
that up to it to cool the incubator off
it<00:01:28.170> gets<00:01:28.320> too<00:01:28.439> hot<00:01:28.700> alright<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.240> after<00:01:30.390> we're

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
it gets too hot alright so after we're

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.469 
it gets too hot alright so after we're
done<00:01:30.720> setting<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.860> press<00:01:32.100> sure<00:01:32.479> your

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
done setting that just press sure your

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.170 
done setting that just press sure your
power<00:01:33.659> key<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:33.930> well<00:01:34.140> once<00:01:34.409> all<00:01:35.189> right<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:36.030> goes

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
power key as well once all right it goes

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.960 
power key as well once all right it goes
back<00:01:36.770> as<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.130> we're<00:01:38.280> heating<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.820> we

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
back as you see we're heating if we

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.480 
back as you see we're heating if we
touch<00:01:39.360> our<00:01:39.479> probe<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.049> hold<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.439> those<00:01:41.310> two

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
touch our probe and hold it those two

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.819 
touch our probe and hold it those two
will<00:01:41.700> increase<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.409> over<00:01:43.530> cut<00:01:43.680> off

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
will increase you know see over cut off

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.010 
will increase you know see over cut off
as<00:01:44.100> soon<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.490> gets<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> exact

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
as soon as it gets to the to the exact

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.060 
as soon as it gets to the to the exact
temperature<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.590> set<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:49.100> all<00:01:50.100> right

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
temperature we set it at all right

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.130 
temperature we set it at all right
and<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.189> see<00:01:52.430> it<00:01:52.490> squish<00:01:53.000> over<00:01:53.240> cooling<00:01:53.600> as

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
and you see it squish over cooling as

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.840 
and you see it squish over cooling as
soon<00:01:54.380> as<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.530> got<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.679> little<00:01:54.799> too<00:01:54.920> hot<00:01:57.700> now<00:01:58.700> if

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
soon as it got a little too hot now if

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.100 
soon as it got a little too hot now if
you<00:01:58.969> don't<00:01:59.090> have<00:01:59.270> anything<00:01:59.539> hooked<00:01:59.840> up<00:01:59.990> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
you don't have anything hooked up the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.240 
you don't have anything hooked up the
cooling<00:02:00.350> then<00:02:00.590> you're<00:02:00.770> fine

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
cooling then you're fine

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.160 
cooling then you're fine
it's<00:02:02.240> not<00:02:02.450> gonna<00:02:02.570> do<00:02:02.659> anything<00:02:02.840> but<00:02:03.049> it's

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
it's not gonna do anything but it's

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.270 
it's not gonna do anything but it's
always<00:02:03.259> gonna<00:02:03.469> switch<00:02:03.679> to<00:02:03.829> there's<00:02:04.009> no<00:02:04.100> way<00:02:04.219> to

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
always gonna switch to there's no way to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.450 
always gonna switch to there's no way to
turn<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.520> off<00:02:05.409> now<00:02:06.409> hit<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.740> S<00:02:06.859> again

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
turn it off now hit the S again

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.969 
turn it off now hit the S again
and<00:02:07.549> let's<00:02:08.000> go<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.149> number<00:02:08.420> 3<00:02:08.660> F<00:02:08.869> 3<00:02:08.979> because

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
and let's go to number 3 F 3 because

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.150 
and let's go to number 3 F 3 because
that's<00:02:10.129> F<00:02:10.399> 1<00:02:10.670> 2<00:02:10.940> 3<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.690> 4<00:02:11.750> H<00:02:12.470> do<00:02:12.680> different<00:02:13.010> type

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
that's F 1 2 3 and 4 H do different type

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.009 
that's F 1 2 3 and 4 H do different type
alright<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.780> we'll<00:02:15.049> just<00:02:15.170> go<00:02:15.290> 1<00:02:15.530> 2<00:02:15.860> 3<00:02:16.780> well<00:02:17.780> go

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
alright so we'll just go 1 2 3 well go

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.150 
alright so we'll just go 1 2 3 well go
and<00:02:18.140> pass<00:02:18.349> it<00:02:18.560> ok<00:02:18.830> f<00:02:19.010> 3<00:02:19.280> be<00:02:19.879> it<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.090> s<00:02:20.209> again

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
and pass it ok f 3 be it to s again

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.759 
and pass it ok f 3 be it to s again
you'll<00:02:22.160> see<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:23.209> says<00:02:23.510> 3<00:02:23.840> minutes<00:02:24.170> that's

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
you'll see that says 3 minutes that's

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.250 
you'll see that says 3 minutes that's
more<00:02:24.980> compressor<00:02:25.400> delay<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.940> that's<00:02:26.720> if<00:02:27.140> you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
more compressor delay and that's if you

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.870 
more compressor delay and that's if you
have<00:02:27.440> chiller<00:02:27.709> hooked<00:02:27.950> up<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> or

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
have chiller hooked up to it or

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.770 
have chiller hooked up to it or
something<00:02:29.150> like<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.420> would<00:02:29.630> have<00:02:29.750> a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
something like that that would have a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.420 
something like that that would have a
compressor<00:02:30.260> running<00:02:30.560> for<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:30.890> cooling<00:02:31.190> side

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
compressor running for the cooling side

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.030 
compressor running for the cooling side
and<00:02:32.150> then<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.840> only<00:02:33.019> allows<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.620> item<00:02:34.010> to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
and then it only allows that item to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.650 
and then it only allows that item to
come<00:02:34.340> on<00:02:34.549> three<00:02:35.000> minutes<00:02:35.090> after<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.569> last

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
come on three minutes after the last

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.839 
come on three minutes after the last
time<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:35.930> went<00:02:36.140> off<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:37.099> that<00:02:37.340> way<00:02:37.579> it<00:02:37.700> doesn't

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
time I went off so that way it doesn't

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.240 
time I went off so that way it doesn't
come<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.360> too<00:02:39.170> quickly<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.650> overheat<00:02:40.130> the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
come on too quickly and overheat the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.240 
come on too quickly and overheat the
compressor<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:42.170> we're<00:02:42.769> not<00:02:42.860> gonna<00:02:43.040> be<00:02:43.190> using

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
compressor so we're not gonna be using

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.069 
compressor so we're not gonna be using
that<00:02:43.579> so<00:02:43.849> we<00:02:43.970> shouldn't<00:02:44.180> go<00:02:44.269> past<00:02:44.480> them<00:02:44.690> what<00:02:44.930> s

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
that so we shouldn't go past them what s

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.160 
that so we shouldn't go past them what s
again<00:02:46.840> ok<00:02:47.890> there<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:48.950> go

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
again ok there we go

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.259 
again ok there we go
that<00:02:51.170> 4<00:02:51.440> will<00:02:52.370> hit<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.640> s<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.940> hold<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.150> now

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
that 4 will hit the s and hold it now

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.670 
that 4 will hit the s and hold it now
you<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.900> hold<00:02:54.049> it<00:02:54.110> down<00:02:54.140> if<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.440> change

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
you have to hold it down if you change

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.479 
you have to hold it down if you change
something<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:55.430> says<00:02:55.670> 0<00:02:55.970> 0<00:02:56.290> what<00:02:57.290> F<00:02:57.530> 4<00:02:57.859> is<00:02:58.130> is<00:02:58.459> a

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
something it says 0 0 what F 4 is is a

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.210 
something it says 0 0 what F 4 is is a
calibration<00:02:59.030> setting<00:02:59.569> allowing<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.410> to

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
calibration setting allowing you to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.080 
calibration setting allowing you to
raise<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:01.940> or<00:03:02.120> down<00:03:02.769> depending<00:03:03.769> on<00:03:04.190> if<00:03:04.639> you

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
raise it up or down depending on if you

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.660 
raise it up or down depending on if you
need<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.389> calibrate<00:03:05.600> your<00:03:06.170> thermostat<00:03:06.709> over

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
need to calibrate your thermostat over

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.120 
need to calibrate your thermostat over
the<00:03:07.850> years<00:03:08.120> who<00:03:08.299> have<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.709> sometimes<00:03:09.709> they'll

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
the years who have it sometimes they'll

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.430 
the years who have it sometimes they'll
get<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.310> good<00:03:10.519> review<00:03:10.670> out<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.420> you'll<00:03:11.930> have<00:03:12.170> to

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
get a good review out and you'll have to

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.460 
get a good review out and you'll have to
all<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:13.819> have<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.060> test<00:03:14.299> them<00:03:14.450> using<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.260> glass

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
all you have to test them using a glass

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.620 
all you have to test them using a glass
of<00:03:15.500> water<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:15.889> ice<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.430> then<00:03:17.239> you'll<00:03:17.389> set<00:03:17.600> up

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
of water and ice and then you'll set up

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.410 
of water and ice and then you'll set up
to<00:03:17.780> 32<00:03:18.139> degrees<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:19.130> if<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.400> not<00:03:19.519> exactly<00:03:20.000> 32

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
to 32 degrees and if it's not exactly 32

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.030 
to 32 degrees and if it's not exactly 32
degrees<00:03:20.690> then<00:03:21.019> you'll<00:03:21.170> move<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.590> up<00:03:21.799> or<00:03:21.980> down

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
degrees then you'll move it up or down

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.979 
degrees then you'll move it up or down
to<00:03:22.190> whatever<00:03:22.639> you<00:03:22.880> need<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.209> do<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.750> do<00:03:23.870> the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
to whatever you need to do to do the

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:24.610 
to whatever you need to do to do the
calibrating

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
calibrating

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.610 
calibrating
all<00:03:25.130> right<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.900> which<00:03:27.049> are<00:03:27.230> just<00:03:27.470> hit<00:03:27.590> that

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
all right so which are just hit that

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.690 
all right so which are just hit that
power<00:03:28.430> key<00:03:28.670> wants<00:03:29.739> there<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.920> go<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.549> see

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
power key wants there you go you see

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.509 
power key wants there you go you see
it's<00:03:31.819> heating<00:03:32.060> again<00:03:33.160> hold<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.430> we'll

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
it's heating again hold it and we'll

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.869 
it's heating again hold it and we'll
heat<00:03:34.669> it<00:03:34.790> up

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.789 

there<00:03:40.879> we<00:03:40.940> go<00:03:41.060> cut<00:03:41.330> off<00:03:41.450> that's<00:03:42.349> really<00:03:42.620> all<00:03:42.769> it

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
there we go cut off that's really all it

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.190 
there we go cut off that's really all it
