00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
in the long run I think I picked

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.170 
in the long run I think I picked
something<00:03:55.110> from<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.830> newest<00:03:56.340> set

something from the newest set

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.780 
something from the newest set
I<00:03:57.209> felt<00:03:58.110> like<00:03:58.230> obviously<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.220> should<00:03:59.610> use<00:03:59.760> some

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.880 
I felt like obviously I should use some
stuff<00:04:00.239> from<00:04:00.330> that<00:04:00.570> that's<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.200> because<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.470> kind

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
stuff from that that's it because I kind

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.910 
stuff from that that's it because I kind
of<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.280> makes<00:04:02.310> sense<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:04.080> don't<00:04:04.560> know<00:04:04.739> where<00:04:04.890> I

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
of it makes sense I don't know where I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.780 
of it makes sense I don't know where I
would<00:04:05.040> have<00:04:05.220> gotten<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.489> from

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.070 
developed one hell of a skin tone okay
so<00:06:07.750> far<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.259> outerwear<00:06:08.889> I<00:06:09.960> definitely<00:06:10.960> think

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
so far the outerwear I definitely think

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.469 
so far the outerwear I definitely think
it's<00:06:11.259> elaborative<00:06:11.710> with<00:06:11.860> this<00:06:12.009> be<00:06:12.219> bohemian

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
it's elaborative with this be bohemian

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.879 
it's elaborative with this be bohemian
top<00:06:13.479> is<00:06:13.690> perfect<00:06:14.199> I<00:06:14.289> think<00:06:14.469> they<00:06:14.560> came<00:06:14.710> from

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
top is perfect I think they came from

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.320 
top is perfect I think they came from
seasons<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.669> I<00:06:15.759> felt<00:06:16.000> like<00:06:16.120> it<00:06:16.210> was<00:06:16.300> very

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
seasons and I felt like it was very

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.140 
seasons and I felt like it was very
bohemian<00:06:16.810> I<00:06:17.169> even<00:06:17.830> went<00:06:18.219> and<00:06:18.430> tried<00:06:18.729> to<00:06:19.029> go

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
bohemian I even went and tried to go

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.140 
bohemian I even went and tried to go
ahead<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.479> slap<00:06:19.900> on<00:06:20.139> some<00:06:20.500> of<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:21.159> new<00:06:21.580> like

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
ahead and slap on some of the new like

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.890 
ahead and slap on some of the new like
dress<00:06:22.680> no<00:06:23.680> skirt<00:06:24.279> legging<00:06:24.969> option<00:06:25.360> hidden<00:06:25.779> it

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
dress no skirt legging option hidden it

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.779 
dress no skirt legging option hidden it
didn't<00:06:26.199> like<00:06:26.319> it<00:06:26.469> so<00:06:26.500> again<00:06:27.339> I<00:06:27.370> kind<00:06:27.610> of<00:06:27.639> went

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
didn't like it so again I kind of went

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:29.879
