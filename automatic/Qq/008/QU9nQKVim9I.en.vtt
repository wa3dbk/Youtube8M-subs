00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello dear friends and in this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.890
 I will tell the video and show you how to do it. 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.679
 military car let's get down to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:17.660
 its assembly, we need here such 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:20.369
 detail and how to impose on it 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.570
 here it is from the injection and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.570
 one such 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.990
 do another row further choose here 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:35.530
 such a circled such we need 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:41.610
 make them around the edges that's what we have 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 it turns out in the middle we lay down like this 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.360
 that is, we are making a flat surface 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.570
 next we need this detail 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.480
 we do it like that 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.190
 the gap 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.330
 here we have been to us as you guessed it 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.839
 I think you already guessed doing a file I 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.990
 found their yellow blue lights and then I 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:13.600
 there will be money i fix here 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:16.600
 Blue's like this and matured something here at 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.930
 us and so it turns out in the front I took 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.930
 black and i will be yellow 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:39.259
 Well, so we catch the yellow here 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.659
 u live what happens next we take 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:47.409
 just such a detail 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:51.830
 you need to do this here always 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:56.020
 so here we can get 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:01.200
 take the glass I found and so he set 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.750
 here here so 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.930
 that is, after we constantly 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.930
 formed two high points we put 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.590
 but here of course we fill it here 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.590
 such and such a way see 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:29.800
 we are lacking here therefore another 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:34.390
 next to these simple ones to fix in 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.960
 this row is black here to me one more what 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.130
 he is a scientist 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:46.140
 I did not find so I took two 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:50.110
 I always took the little blacks green 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.600
 here so we fix here 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.030
 normal blows 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.030
 warm too we fix go attention 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.650
 all wearing skype but lurking here 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.650
 the gap is such a detail 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.960
 tavern so that we do not have such 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.690
 I went out rippled and here are such 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.690
 mount them here so doing 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:31.040
 as 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:35.180
 Well, so do we fix and that's it 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.910
 the roof turns out like this so where 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.700
 make more interesting bypass the trunk 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:47.900
 also green for well here so here i am 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.090
 also found such a spare part here 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.680
 our high body is ready 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:58.400
 such a body can cling wheels 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:03.800
 Of course here we are ready to them 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:08.420
 harvested branches like this 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:11.209
 the machine is ready to button the military like me and 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.770
 I told you our machine is ready. 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.260
 there is but unfortunately than the stoves we 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.190
 we can not plant everything yet 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.190
