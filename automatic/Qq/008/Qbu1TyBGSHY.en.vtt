new name this is huge huge news and
there<00:00:12.929> are<00:00:13.019> three<00:00:13.290> reasons<00:00:13.530> aside<00:00:14.040> from<00:00:14.190> the

there are three reasons aside from the

there are three reasons aside from the
lower<00:00:14.519> prices<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.150> think<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.509> going

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
lower prices that I think this is going

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.450 
lower prices that I think this is going
to<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.870> phenomenal<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.500> organic<00:00:16.980> consumers

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460

number one because this presumably the

will be able to open up in cities and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269 
will be able to open up in cities and

expand<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.590> instance<00:00:32.099> instacart

partnership<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.600> Whole<00:00:33.780> Foods<00:00:33.809> has<00:00:34.079> been

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
partnership with Whole Foods has been

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.590 
partnership with Whole Foods has been
phenomenally<00:00:34.920> successful<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:36.059> guess<00:00:36.360> is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
phenomenally successful and my guess is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.690 
phenomenally successful and my guess is
that<00:00:36.630> whole<00:00:36.960> foods<00:00:37.170> will<00:00:37.590> use<00:00:37.770> instacart<00:00:38.399> for

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
that whole foods will use instacart for

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.940 
that whole foods will use instacart for
this<00:00:38.820> new<00:00:39.090> chain<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.079> number<00:00:40.649> three

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
this new chain as well and number three

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.729 
this new chain as well and number three
as<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:42.120> may<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.329> Whole<00:00:43.110> Foods<00:00:43.140> said<00:00:43.620> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
as you may know Whole Foods said that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
as you may know Whole Foods said that
they're<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> label<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.610> GMOs<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.180> their

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
they're going to label all GMOs in their

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.110 
they're going to label all GMOs in their
stores<00:00:45.690> by<00:00:46.010> 2018<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.370> guess<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:47.940> will

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
stores by 2018 and my guess is they will

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.240 
stores by 2018 and my guess is they will
take<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.450> policy<00:00:48.899> with<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> new<00:00:49.379> store<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
take that policy with the new store this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.360 
take that policy with the new store this
new<00:00:50.460> chain<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:50.940> well<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.809> means<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.710> GMO

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
new chain as well so that means that GMO

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.069 
new chain as well so that means that GMO
labeling<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.910> its<00:00:54.059> stores<00:00:54.300> will<00:00:54.539> expand<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
labeling in its stores will expand in

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.389 
labeling in its stores will expand in
many<00:00:55.289> cities<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.949> states<00:00:56.390> in<00:00:57.620> 2018<00:00:58.620> because

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
many cities and states in 2018 because

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.450 
many cities and states in 2018 because
we<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.670> two<00:00:59.850> very<00:00:59.879> serious<00:01:00.570> situations<00:01:01.199> in

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
we have two very serious situations in

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.950 
we have two very serious situations in
that<00:01:02.460> are<00:01:02.579> taking<00:01:02.969> place<00:01:03.000> right<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
that are taking place right now the

trying to push through that could

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.429 
trying to push through that could
potentially<00:01:08.850> make<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.450> illegal<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.140> label

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
