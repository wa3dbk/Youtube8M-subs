do<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.920> measure<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.399> tree<00:00:44.789> without<00:00:45.270> having<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
do you measure a tree without having to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.040 
do you measure a tree without having to
climb<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.590> well<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:47.940> lots<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.420> tools<00:00:48.660> we

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.460 
yeah but a big tree is too tall and
dangerous<00:02:46.030> for<00:02:46.209> me<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.450> climb<00:02:46.690> how<00:02:47.260> would<00:02:47.440> I

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
dangerous for me to climb how would I

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.250 
dangerous for me to climb how would I
measure<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.190> real<00:02:48.459> life<00:02:48.730> what<00:02:49.690> if<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.989> told

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
measure it in real life what if I told

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.960 
measure it in real life what if I told
you<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.709> you<00:02:51.130> could<00:02:51.340> measure<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.640> tree

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
you that you could measure a tree

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.440 
you that you could measure a tree
without<00:02:52.630> having<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.350> leave<00:02:53.530> your<00:02:53.739> ground

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
without having to leave your ground

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.370 
without having to leave your ground
teach<00:02:55.450> me<00:02:56.700> well<00:02:57.700> stampy<00:02:58.269> which<00:02:58.840> tree<00:02:59.200> do<00:02:59.260> you

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
teach me well stampy which tree do you

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.870 
teach me well stampy which tree do you
want<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.890> measure<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:02.440> one<00:03:02.980> can<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.670> don't

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
want to measure that one can you don't

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.880 
want to measure that one can you don't
stand<00:03:04.150> right<00:03:04.420> at<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.840> base<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.350> then<00:03:05.500> yeah

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
stand right at the base of it then yeah

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.430 
stand right at the base of it then yeah
sure<00:03:08.850> I'll<00:03:09.850> hold<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.450> ruler<00:03:10.630> in<00:03:10.870> front<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.320> me

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
sure I'll hold the ruler in front of me

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.400 
sure I'll hold the ruler in front of me
with<00:03:11.590> my<00:03:11.620> arm<00:03:12.040> out<00:03:12.310> straight<00:03:12.870> now<00:03:13.870> I'll<00:03:14.079> close

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
with my arm out straight now I'll close

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.280 
with my arm out straight now I'll close
one<00:03:14.769> eye<00:03:15.000> back<00:03:16.000> away<00:03:16.299> from<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.630> tree<00:03:16.780> slowly

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
one eye back away from the tree slowly

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.920 
one eye back away from the tree slowly
until<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.739> tree<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.820> ruler<00:03:19.269> appear<00:03:19.840> to

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
until the tree and the ruler appear to

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.610 
until the tree and the ruler appear to
be<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.170> same<00:03:20.470> size<00:03:21.600> next<00:03:22.600> keeping<00:03:23.109> my<00:03:23.230> arms

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
be the same size next keeping my arms

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.860 
be the same size next keeping my arms
straight<00:03:23.950> I'll<00:03:24.549> turn<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.060> rule<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.359> sideways

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
straight I'll turn the rule of sideways

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.720 
straight I'll turn the rule of sideways
so<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.769> runs<00:03:26.950> level<00:03:27.430> with<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.700> ground

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
so that it runs level with the ground

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.630 
so that it runs level with the ground
I'll<00:03:28.660> keep<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.320> end<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.950> ruler<00:03:30.130> lined<00:03:30.459> up

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
I'll keep the end of the ruler lined up

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.060 
I'll keep the end of the ruler lined up
with<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.880> tree<00:03:31.090> trunk<00:03:31.450> now<00:03:32.019> stampy<00:03:32.470> can<00:03:32.980> you

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
with the tree trunk now stampy can you

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.860 
with the tree trunk now stampy can you
walk<00:03:33.220> away<00:03:33.400> from<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.820> tree<00:03:34.000> trunk<00:03:34.239> out<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.780> the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
walk away from the tree trunk out to the

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.530 
walk away from the tree trunk out to the
other<00:03:35.079> end<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.410> your<00:03:35.470> ruler<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:37.209> could<00:03:37.359> stop

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
other end of your ruler you could stop

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.949 
other end of your ruler you could stop
now<00:03:37.660> stampy<00:03:38.049> stay<00:03:38.739> right<00:03:39.040> there

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
now stampy stay right there

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.170 
now stampy stay right there
now<00:03:40.959> using<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.739> measuring<00:03:42.010> tape<00:03:42.280> I'll<00:03:42.609> measure

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
now using a measuring tape I'll measure

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.880 
now using a measuring tape I'll measure
the<00:03:43.329> distance<00:03:43.840> along<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.200> ground<00:03:44.380> between

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
the distance along the ground between

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.830 
the distance along the ground between
the<00:03:45.040> actual<00:03:45.220> tree<00:03:45.760> trunk<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.630> place

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
give you the tree height whoa

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.479 
give you the tree height whoa
this<00:03:51.609> tree<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.090> 6<00:03:52.359> meters<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:52.959> 23<00:03:53.769> centimeters
