coming out at the end of this summer so

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
coming out at the end of this summer so
this<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> competitor<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.980> competitor<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this is a competitor a competitor that

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.560 
this is a competitor a competitor that
is<00:00:48.300> also<00:00:48.510> 4k<00:00:48.989> TV<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.320> curved<00:00:49.829> 65-inch<00:00:50.570> the

is also 4k TV and curved 65-inch the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.270 
is also 4k TV and curved 65-inch the
technology<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> drastically<00:00:52.710> different<00:00:52.829> this

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
technology is drastically different this

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.279 
technology is drastically different this
is<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.520> newer<00:00:53.789> technology<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.809> difficult

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
is a newer technology which is difficult

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.849 
is a newer technology which is difficult
to<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.760> large<00:00:57.149> screen<00:00:57.750> TVs<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.710> them

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to use on large screen TVs you see them

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.770 
to use on large screen TVs you see them
on<00:00:58.980> phones<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.550> tablets<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
on phones and in tablets but the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.090 
on phones and in tablets but the
advantage<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.739> doesn't<00:01:02.010> require

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
advantage is that it doesn't require

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.299 
advantage is that it doesn't require
backlighting<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.329> only<00:01:03.979> thinner<00:01:04.979> than<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
backlighting it's only thinner than a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
backlighting it's only thinner than a
cell<00:01:05.549> phone<00:01:05.729> yes<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.420> very<00:01:06.510> very<00:01:06.990> it's

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
cell phone yes it's very very it's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.590 
cell phone yes it's very very it's
incredible<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.420> doesn't

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
incredible and and because it doesn't

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.149 
incredible and and because it doesn't
have<00:01:09.810> its<00:01:09.960> own<00:01:10.080> light<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> cells<00:01:10.860> turn

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
have its own light when the cells turn

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.280 
have its own light when the cells turn
off<00:01:11.430> there's<00:01:11.820> no<00:01:11.880> power<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.479> pitch<00:01:12.900> black

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
off there's no power it's pitch black

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
off there's no power it's pitch black
okay<00:01:13.799> some<00:01:14.130> people<00:01:14.400> don't<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.610> very

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
okay some people don't like very

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.609 
okay some people don't like very
contrasting<00:01:15.210> pictures<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:15.930> both<00:01:16.110> TVs<00:01:16.470> are

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
contrasting pictures but both TVs are

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.109 
contrasting pictures but both TVs are
adjustable<00:01:17.100> you'd<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.580> blacks<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
adjustable you'd get more blacks on the
