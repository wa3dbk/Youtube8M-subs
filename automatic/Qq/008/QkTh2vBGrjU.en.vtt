that is one of the biggest questions and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.779 
that is one of the biggest questions and
unfortunately<00:00:46.870> i<00:00:47.170> don't<00:00:47.769> think<00:00:48.039> anybody<00:00:48.370> can

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
unfortunately i don't think anybody can

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
when it's over over but as I know it um

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.160 
when it's over over but as I know it um
they<00:01:21.250> say<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.700> light<00:01:21.939> side<00:01:22.299> is<00:01:22.329> winning<00:01:22.750> that

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
they say the light side is winning that

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.950 
they say the light side is winning that
means<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.530> dark<00:01:23.860> side<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:24.579> losing<00:01:25.509> which

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
means the dark side is losing which

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.789 
means the dark side is losing which
means<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:28.360> happened<00:01:28.899> is<00:01:29.110> that<00:01:29.500> what<00:01:29.770> I

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
means that what happened is that what I

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.700 
means that what happened is that what I
believe<00:01:30.280> will<00:01:30.460> happen<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:32.439> light

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
believe will happen is that the light

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.310 
believe will happen is that the light
dragons<00:01:33.189> will<00:01:33.399> come<00:01:33.579> out<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:33.969> then<00:01:34.750> in<00:01:35.020> turn

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
dragons will come out and then in turn

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.349 
dragons will come out and then in turn
the<00:01:35.500> next<00:01:35.890> event<00:01:36.189> which<00:01:36.909> should<00:01:37.149> take

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
the next event which should take

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.959 
the next event which should take
probably<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.079> same<00:01:38.259> amount<00:01:38.409> of<00:01:38.680> time<00:01:38.969> the

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
probably the same amount of time the

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.300 
probably the same amount of time the
dark<00:01:40.299> dragons<00:01:40.869> will<00:01:41.020> come<00:01:41.229> out<00:01:41.409> if<00:01:41.619> they<00:01:42.070> wait

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
dark dragons will come out if they wait

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.330 
dark dragons will come out if they wait
so<00:01:42.549> I<00:01:43.450> think<00:01:43.960> that's<00:01:44.289> basically<00:01:44.740> what<00:01:45.100> will

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
so I think that's basically what will

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.980 
so I think that's basically what will
happen<00:01:45.789> a<00:01:45.969> lot<00:01:46.149> of<00:01:46.299> people<00:01:46.450> are<00:01:46.659> complaining

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
happen a lot of people are complaining

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.469 
happen a lot of people are complaining
about<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.500> breeding<00:01:47.859> changes<00:01:48.429> telling<00:01:49.299> to

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
about the breeding changes telling to

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.179 
about the breeding changes telling to
change<00:01:49.780> them<00:01:50.020> back<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.590> course<00:01:50.859> there<00:01:51.039> are

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
change them back of course there are

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.190 
change them back of course there are
people<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:51.670> says<00:01:51.909> no<00:01:52.450> they<00:01:52.780> like<00:01:53.020> the

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
people that says no they like the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.190 
people that says no they like the
breeding<00:01:53.530> change<00:01:53.799> I<00:01:53.950> assume<00:01:54.399> they<00:01:54.549> have<00:01:54.579> every

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
have a light egg let's say you have a

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.060 
have a light egg let's say you have a
light<00:02:44.350> egg<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.430> habitat<00:02:45.820> right<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:47.070> when

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
light egg in the habitat right now when

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.520 
light egg in the habitat right now when
the<00:02:48.160> event<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.580> over<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:49.570> egg<00:02:49.840> will<00:02:50.170> be<00:02:50.320> in

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
the event is over that egg will be in

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.430 
the event is over that egg will be in
bude<00:02:50.800> with<00:02:51.250> light<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.360> know<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:53.080> know<00:02:53.170> it

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
bude with light you know you know it

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.290 
bude with light you know you know it
would<00:02:53.560> be<00:02:53.680> embedded<00:02:54.160> like<00:02:54.340> with<00:02:54.550> light<00:02:54.820> and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
would be embedded like with light and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.240 
would be embedded like with light and
then<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.750> turns<00:02:55.990> into<00:02:56.080> light<00:02:56.470> dragon<00:02:56.800> that's

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
then it turns into light dragon that's

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.300 
then it turns into light dragon that's
what<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.520> assume<00:02:57.940> will<00:02:58.150> happen<00:02:58.690> uh<00:02:59.160> what<00:03:00.160> will

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
what I assume will happen uh what will

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.800 
what I assume will happen uh what will
happen<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> dark<00:03:00.970> side<00:03:01.210> so<00:03:01.510> what<00:03:01.720> will

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
happen to a dark side so what will

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.840 
happen to a dark side so what will
happen<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.230> dark<00:03:02.530> side<00:03:02.830> is<00:03:02.980> what<00:03:03.250> I'm<00:03:03.490> assuming

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
happen to dark side is what I'm assuming

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.870 
happen to dark side is what I'm assuming
is<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:05.260> Dark<00:03:05.560> Dragon<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.520> know<00:03:06.640> what

is that the Dark Dragon you know what

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.030 
is that the Dark Dragon you know what
whatever<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.480> accumulated<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.440> let's<00:03:08.950> say

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
whatever you accumulated like let's say

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.950 
whatever you accumulated like let's say
you<00:03:09.130> shove<00:03:09.520> like<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.090> know<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.210> lot<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.510> points

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
you shove like you know a lot of points

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.160 
you shove like you know a lot of points
into<00:03:11.230> darkness<00:03:12.240> um<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.510> points<00:03:13.810> will<00:03:13.930> stay

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
into darkness um the points will stay

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.200 
into darkness um the points will stay
there<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:15.100> habitat<00:03:15.580> will<00:03:15.760> stay<00:03:15.970> there

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210
