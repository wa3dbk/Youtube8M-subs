resting pretty much on on this tube here

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399 
resting pretty much on on this tube here
and<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.360> L<00:01:15.540> bracket<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.080> we're<00:01:16.229> just

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
and on this L bracket here we're just

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.580 
and on this L bracket here we're just
tied<00:01:16.560> into<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> frame<00:01:17.479> I<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:19.020> use<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
tied into the frame I also use the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.450 
tied into the frame I also use the
rubber<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.450> isolate<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:23.000> cable<00:01:24.000> ties<00:01:24.210> from

rubber to isolate the cable ties from
the<00:01:26.460> frame<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> wouldn't<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.320> scratched

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
the frame so it wouldn't get scratched

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
the frame so it wouldn't get scratched
what<00:01:31.140> are<00:01:31.229> their<00:01:31.350> details<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.310> yes<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
what are their details so yes this is

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.249 
what are their details so yes this is
the<00:01:33.030> back<00:01:33.180> cover<00:01:33.420> there's<00:01:33.689> another<00:01:33.900> coverage

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the back cover there's another coverage

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.609 
the back cover there's another coverage
just<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.549> side<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
just like it you know on this side and

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
just like it you know on this side and
it's<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.979> held<00:01:38.930> by<00:01:39.930> these<00:01:40.759> four<00:01:41.759> four

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
it's going to be held by these four four

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.859 
it's going to be held by these four four
inch<00:01:42.689> long<00:01:43.009> bolts<00:01:44.009> with<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> washer<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.630> each

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
inch long bolts with a washer on each

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
inch long bolts with a washer on each
side<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.430> lock<00:01:50.610> nut<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:51.619> plastic<00:01:52.640> makes<00:01:53.640> a

side and in a lock nut a plastic makes a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.420 
side and in a lock nut a plastic makes a
night<00:01:54.000> lock<00:01:54.180> nut<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.630> believe<00:01:54.869> they're<00:01:55.020> called

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
night lock nut I believe they're called

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.340 
night lock nut I believe they're called
so<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.719> hold<00:01:57.869> them<00:01:58.079> without

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
so that you know I can hold them without

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.109 
so that you know I can hold them without
a<00:01:58.500> lot<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.890> torque<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.670> should<00:01:59.880> be<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> should<00:02:00.719> be

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
a lot of torque it should be a should be

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.859 
a lot of torque it should be a should be
able<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.740> run<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:04.770> whole<00:02:05.009> torque<00:02:05.869> without

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
able to run your whole torque without

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.949 
able to run your whole torque without
backing<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.649> without<00:02:08.429> having<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.959> compress

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
backing out without having to compress

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.260 
backing out without having to compress
the<00:02:10.200> plastic<00:02:10.739> too<00:02:10.830> much<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.879> did<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the plastic too much so what I did to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.230 
the plastic too much so what I did to
add<00:02:12.390> stiffness<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
add stiffness and

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.130 
add stiffness and
direction<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:16.480> know<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.630> have<00:02:16.810> three

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
direction is I you know I have three

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.750 
direction is I you know I have three
nails<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.830> basically<00:02:18.250> go<00:02:18.460> through<00:02:18.490> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
nails that basically go through the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.580 
nails that basically go through the
corrugations<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:20.140> central<00:02:20.500> nail<00:02:20.680> has<00:02:21.010> been

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
corrugations the central nail has been

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.890 
corrugations the central nail has been
trimmed<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.830> both<00:02:24.040> ends<00:02:24.490> with<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.330> dremel<00:02:25.600> tool

to<00:02:26.800> serve<00:02:27.070> as<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:28.030> know<00:02:28.120> stiff<00:02:28.990> point<00:02:29.230> for

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
to serve as a you know stiff point for

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.070 
to serve as a you know stiff point for
this<00:02:29.560> tie<00:02:29.770> wrap<00:02:29.980> or<00:02:30.400> play<00:02:30.730> cable<00:02:31.240> tie<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.450> tie

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
this tie wrap or play cable tie to tie

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.970 
this tie wrap or play cable tie to tie
to<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.620> then<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.760> other<00:02:33.850> two<00:02:34.090> nails

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
to and then the other two nails

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.250 
to and then the other two nails
basically<00:02:35.980> provide<00:02:38.610> some<00:02:39.610> resistance<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
basically provide some resistance to the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260 
basically provide some resistance to the
side<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:41.710> this<00:02:41.860> cable<00:02:42.610> tie<00:02:42.760> can't<00:02:43.030> slide

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
side so this cable tie can't slide

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.540 
side so this cable tie can't slide
forward<00:02:43.600> or<00:02:43.690> backward<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.380> I'm<00:02:44.920> also<00:02:45.220> you

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
forward or backward and I'm also you

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.240 
forward or backward and I'm also you
know<00:02:45.670> bolting<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.260> side<00:02:47.470> covers<00:02:47.860> near

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
know bolting the the side covers near

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.790 
know bolting the the side covers near
where<00:02:48.940> these<00:02:49.090> nails<00:02:49.330> are<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:49.930> it'll<00:02:50.140> also<00:02:50.260> be<00:02:50.530> a

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
where these nails are so it'll also be a

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.550 
where these nails are so it'll also be a
pretty<00:02:51.160> stiff<00:02:51.490> in<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:51.790> direction<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:53.380> can

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
pretty stiff in this direction you can

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.020 
pretty stiff in this direction you can
see<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.980> what<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.340> cover<00:02:54.610> looks<00:02:54.880> like

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
see what the what the cover looks like

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.220 
see what the what the cover looks like
on<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.690> side<00:02:55.930> here<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.480> it'll<00:02:59.110> look<00:02:59.170> the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
on this side here and it'll look the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.630 
on this side here and it'll look the
same<00:02:59.440> on<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.710> other<00:02:59.830> side<00:03:00.070> when<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.370> put<00:03:00.610> that

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
same on the other side when I put that

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.560 
same on the other side when I put that
cover<00:03:01.000> on<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.520> covers<00:03:03.790> will<00:03:03.940> add<00:03:04.270> some

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
cover on so the covers will add some

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.180 
cover on so the covers will add some
additional<00:03:04.750> stiffness<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.650> know<00:03:05.740> I<00:03:05.800> did<00:03:06.040> I'll

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
additional stiffness you know I did I'll

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.400 
additional stiffness you know I did I'll
run<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.550> corrugations<00:03:07.180> in<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.200> direction

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
run the corrugations in this direction

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.340 
run the corrugations in this direction
to<00:03:09.060> add<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.150> vertical<00:03:10.540> stiffness<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:13.630> then

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
to add a vertical stiffness and then

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.940 
to add a vertical stiffness and then
