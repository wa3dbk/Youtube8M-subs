00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.750
 will do 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.860
 flash when I have absolutely no mobility 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:44.780
 This is an extremely difficult and I have 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:46.780
 I'm still blatant about you 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.309
 design here 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.879
 the goal is that eads is so neat 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.149
 depart 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.579

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.140
 depending on the comments of the class 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.300
 on 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:05.030
 here is still comparatively harmless 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:07.970
 and wait to be careful because 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.729
 I just toughness Asperg what it 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.390
 You saw that and I did 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.020
 'm gone but do not know 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.020
 that should not be the same with the twice 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.950
 eleven press the error I do more often 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.950
 I'm talking myself away 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.539

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:39.219
 perfect lead like cola or must 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:43.479
 at least with here is completely free 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.310
 The problem is that this year 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.890

 sometimes pick up other weapons with it 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.270

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.369
 it can happen does not but the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.310
 after this 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.450
 this is my go there that is 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 does not have to happen as that runs out 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:15.579

 need opponents com selection a 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.849
 a little unfair 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:48.970
 a part of the class now 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.510
 the bottom left hidden or something there 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.510
 probably in the front 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:07.980
 I think I already know today 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:27.120
 the mentally disturbed ghost has the east 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:30.570
 later chip peaches cashes maine 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.950
 Lobster from a glass where I wait 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.200
 the fact that such a chance comes a 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:45.450
 Do not expect to play at saver 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:47.820
 unfavorable on this I have them 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.300
 but not at least they can 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.730
 Do not apologize to me 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.850
 Generally you should hear it if you like it a lot 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.170
 loud right now yes what I'm trying 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.340
 I fill it out as well as possible 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.650
 The old always such a funny 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.010
 Noise background goes better 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.470
 Unfortunately not, but I'm trying so well 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.790
 goes see how to filter 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.790
 now that I look tolerable 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.220
 139 was 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:35.240

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:42.110
 monitor god 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.110

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:56.400
 as far as I still have it today 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.300
 long as it's really over of course 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.830
 nothing though tomorrow episode or so 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.870
 Twenties , of course, is ridiculous 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:24.509
 that I am classifying this here again 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:25.500
 Of course, I was 15 with 20 points 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:30.810

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:45.839
 eight shot it reached that reach here 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:48.949
 feeling better they do because the ramp was 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:48.949
 really slow it down 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:01.860

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:04.919
 follow race glass 47 took 06 minutes 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.830

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.650
 super instructions for the series is pleased 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.060
