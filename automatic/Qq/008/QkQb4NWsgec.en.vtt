00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.929
 which is not advisable to repair 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.119
 analog manufacturing connecting dense

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.440
 catalyst for cars mazda 3 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.500
 corrugation 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.500
 lost its integrity and worthwhile 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.280
 before it the catalyst will be removed and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.280
 replaced 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:28.440
 I cut the exhaust system for 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.630
 shock mount give mount 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.720
 catalyst 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:41.480
 car body then exhaust 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.480
 the system is cut for the catalyst 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:52.160
 remove the side then give mount 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.870
 engine exhaust manifold and 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.930
 remove the catalyst along with the exhaust 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.930
 collector 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:09.660
 catalyst is cut off someone mount 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:15.380
 car body start removing 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.540
 catalyst because the body 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.390
 the catalyst is adjacent directly to 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.820
 one collector 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.410
 the body cuts the filter element 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.930
 removed for installation prepare new 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.700
 catalyst 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:38.180
 it is a catalyst of the Polish company 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:46.040
 manufacturer and wg-3 you rizoyu intake 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:48.730
 the cone then the catalyst is set 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.730
 on the exhaust manifold 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:59.360
 secured by welding the joints 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:02.830
 catalyst housings with exhaust 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.830
 collector thoroughly boil 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:12.500
 I cut off part of the exhaust pipe with a place 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.700
 to install the sensor lambda probe then 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.700
 cut the second letter 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.130
 on the new corrugation 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.580
 sets the pipe with space for 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.930
 installation sensor lambda probe 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:40.810
 if the compound is boiled then a new one 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.960
 wave set on the catalyst seats 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.520
 compounds are then boiled down 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.120
 welding 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.480
 paint with heat resistant paint already 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.860
 mounted bracket for mounting 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.310
 catalyst new car body 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.640
 exhaust manifold catalyst 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.210
 set on a regular place with the old 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.050
 exhaust pipes cut brackets 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.120
 pipe bending shock absorbers 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.410
 firms ben bye 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:23.350
 make repair pipe on it 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:29.380
 distribution is done then I prune it to 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:31.389
 right length repair pipe 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.790
 set on a regular place exhaust 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:38.580
 system, it will connect the new corrugation with 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:45.910
 the rest of the exhaust system 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.479
 compounds boil then places locations 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.300
 welding 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.840
 paint heat-resistant paint repair 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.820
 is over 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.860
 warranty on all work performed and 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.860
