equations<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:28.980> their<00:00:29.310> institutions<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.210> they

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
equations or their institutions so they

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.260 
equations or their institutions so they

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
get a seasonal miss Bannister okay so

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.380 
get a seasonal miss Bannister okay so
let's<00:00:33.450> start<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> first<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.170> itself

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390

happening<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.989> what's<00:00:58.109> happening<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.649> like

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
happening so what's happening it is like

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
happening so what's happening it is like
one<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.059> what<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.329> put<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> having<00:01:00.899> all

one so so what you put you having all

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
one so so what you put you having all
these<00:01:01.109> particles<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.340> had

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
these particles and then you had

something<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.050> thing<00:02:01.260> about<00:02:01.290> physics

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
something the thing about physics

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.710 
something the thing about physics

all<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> same<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.630> see<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:13.080> splashing<00:02:14.040> you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
all the same you see that splashing you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.550 
all the same you see that splashing you
see<00:02:15.120> all<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.630> happening<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:16.380> a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
see all of this is happening it's a

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.650 
see all of this is happening it's a
simulated<00:02:16.950> experience<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.790> not<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.270> pig<00:02:18.450> an

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
simulated experience it's not a pig an

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.640 
simulated experience it's not a pig an
experience<00:02:19.200> that's<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:19.709> makes<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:21.650> an

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
experience that's what makes it an

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.490 
experience that's what makes it an
office<00:02:23.100> really<00:02:23.520> not<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.660> mention<00:02:24.959> beautiful

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
office really not to mention beautiful

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.199 
office really not to mention beautiful
like<00:02:25.890> me<00:02:26.070> how<00:02:26.220> much<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.550> mean<00:02:26.730> how<00:02:26.880> would<00:02:26.940> you

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
like me how much you mean how would you

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.580 
like me how much you mean how would you
capture<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:29.160> level<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.670> beauty<00:02:30.260> without<00:02:31.260> to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
capture this level of beauty without to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.800 
capture this level of beauty without to
see<00:02:31.770> we<00:02:32.010> need<00:02:32.160> natural<00:02:32.490> juices<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.660> is

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
see we need natural juices this is

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.420 
see we need natural juices this is
capturing<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.500> beauty<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.280> natural

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
capturing the beauty of the natural

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.550 
capturing the beauty of the natural
world<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.270> way<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.690> simply<00:02:37.020> can't<00:02:37.410> do

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
world in a way that you simply can't do

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.210 
world in a way that you simply can't do
much<00:02:37.800> as<00:02:37.950> they<00:02:38.070> do<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.660> actually<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.980> know<00:02:41.130> an

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
much as they do and actually you know an

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220 
much as they do and actually you know an
observer<00:02:41.550> this<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.970> self<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.540> constrain<00:02:43.050> you

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
observer this is self and constrain you

observer this is self and constrain you
that<00:02:43.470> time<00:02:43.890> period<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.700> actually<00:02:45.060> not

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
that time period is it actually not

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.199 
that time period is it actually not
because<00:02:46.200> it's<00:02:46.380> article<00:02:47.070> based<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:48.000> can

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
because it's article based you can
