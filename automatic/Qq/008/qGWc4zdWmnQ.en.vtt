about how I do these flying joints this

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.120 
about how I do these flying joints this
is<00:00:11.849> for<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> picture<00:00:12.269> frame<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.679> corners

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130

is for a picture frame and the corners
when<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.150> do<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.719> makes<00:00:15.870> for<00:00:16.080> an

unbelievably strong joint load yourself
a<00:00:22.470> little<00:00:22.710> jig<00:00:23.840> then<00:00:24.840> either<00:00:25.080> rides<00:00:25.500> over<00:00:25.830> your

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
a little jig then either rides over your

matter this one is like this you set a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.430 
matter this one is like this you set a
90<00:00:35.360> degree<00:00:36.360> boards<00:00:36.809> there

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
90 degree boards there

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.630 
90 degree boards there
I<00:00:41.210> just<00:00:42.210> cut<00:00:42.540> these<00:00:42.750> joints<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.590> box<00:00:43.950> what

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
I just cut these joints in this box what

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
I just cut these joints in this box what
you<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.329> go<00:00:45.600> back<00:00:48.140> hold<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.320> in

off bring the fence back and you wind
out<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.840> experiment<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> depth<00:01:02.129> P<00:01:02.370> one

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
out this experiment with the depth P one

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.719 
out this experiment with the depth P one
saw<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> saw<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.369> leave<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
saw the saw is not going to leave the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.950 
saw the saw is not going to leave the
square<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.409> down<00:01:10.650> there<00:01:11.810> you're<00:01:12.810> going

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
square and it's down there you're going

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.390 
square and it's down there you're going
to<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.350> through<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> small<00:01:14.159> flat

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
to have to go through with a small flat

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.429 
to have to go through with a small flat
a<00:01:14.820> pinched<00:01:15.090> brow<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.369> sand<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.939> smooth<00:01:18.439> make

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
a pinched brow and sand it smooth make

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.929 
a pinched brow and sand it smooth make
it<00:01:19.590> you'll<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.310> gets<00:01:20.430> square<00:01:22.939> then

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it you'll see when it gets square then

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.719 
it you'll see when it gets square then
you<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.439> standard

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
you take if you use just a standard

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.130 
you take if you use just a standard
eight-inch<00:01:26.729> blade<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.540> buy<00:01:27.689> these<00:01:27.750> eight

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
eight-inch blade you can buy these eight

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.440 
eight-inch blade you can buy these eight
inch<00:01:28.409> boards<00:01:29.220> already<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.000> walnut<00:01:32.450> sort

inch boards already this is walnut sort

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.060 
inch boards already this is walnut sort
of<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:36.290> take<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> pencil<00:01:37.619> outline<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:39.090> and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
of then take a pencil outline it and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
of then take a pencil outline it and
then<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.430> bandsaw<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.630> want<00:01:42.810> to

do and I exaggerated this piece it's
just<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.119> bigger<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> these<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:49.890> part

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
just a bigger one of these this part

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.889 
just a bigger one of these this part
that<00:01:50.399> goes<00:01:50.549> into<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> box<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> cut

that goes into the box you want to cut

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.510 
that goes into the box you want to cut
that<00:01:52.049> out<00:01:52.520> because<00:01:53.520> you'll<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.060> better<00:01:54.299> fit

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
that out because you'll get a better fit
