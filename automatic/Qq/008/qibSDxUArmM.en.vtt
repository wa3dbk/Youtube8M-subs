you a couple of cubes believe it or not

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.010 
you a couple of cubes believe it or not
this<00:04:33.340> is<00:04:33.520> actually<00:04:34.030> one<00:04:34.300> of<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.600> Bourbons

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
this is actually one of the Bourbons

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.020 
this is actually one of the Bourbons
that<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.380> actually<00:04:35.710> think<00:04:36.100> is<00:04:36.370> improved<00:04:36.880> with

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
that I actually think is improved with

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.410 
that I actually think is improved with
ice<00:04:38.370> even<00:04:39.370> if<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:39.610> just<00:04:39.670> a<00:04:39.910> little<00:04:40.120> bit<00:04:40.270> I

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
ice even if it's just a little bit I

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.360 
ice even if it's just a little bit I
don't<00:04:40.900> know<00:04:41.050> why<00:04:41.200> maybe<00:04:41.500> it's<00:04:41.890> because<00:04:42.130> it

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
don't know why maybe it's because it

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.890 
don't know why maybe it's because it
makes<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.700> viscosity<00:04:43.090> of<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.690> mouth<00:04:43.870> just

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
makes the viscosity of the mouth just

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.500 
makes the viscosity of the mouth just
