University of Oxford Heidi when I was
training<00:00:18.199> there<00:00:19.199> was<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> sense<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
training there was a sense that the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.720 
training there was a sense that the

publishing over the last few years

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.020 
publishing over the last few years
suggests<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.439> that's<00:00:31.830> not<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.640> case

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
suggests that that that's not the case

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.220 
suggests that that that's not the case
could<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.360> tell<00:00:33.600> us<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> bit<00:00:33.780> about<00:00:33.899> that

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
could you tell us a bit about that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.049 
could you tell us a bit about that
please<00:00:34.670> sure<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.059> um<00:00:37.219> in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> past<00:00:38.610> few<00:00:38.790> years

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
please sure so um in the past few years

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.459 
please sure so um in the past few years
there<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.360> been<00:00:39.540> imaging<00:00:39.960> studies<00:00:40.260> done

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
there have been imaging studies done

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.680 
there have been imaging studies done
have<00:00:40.770> suggested<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.730> gross<00:00:42.270> structure

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
have suggested that the gross structure

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.209 
have suggested that the gross structure
of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> gray<00:00:43.230> matter<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> brain<00:00:43.800> can

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
of the gray matter of the brain can

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.369 
of the gray matter of the brain can
change<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:45.120> experience<00:00:45.719> when<00:00:45.930> people<00:00:46.200> learn

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
change with experience when people learn

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.830 
change with experience when people learn
a<00:00:46.649> new<00:00:46.680> skill<00:00:47.100> such<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.760> juggling<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.480> example

a new skill such as juggling for example
and<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.680> we've<00:00:49.860> been<00:00:50.160> particularly

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and what we've been particularly

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.220 
and what we've been particularly
interested<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.510> looking<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.050> whether

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
interested in looking at is whether

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.290 
interested in looking at is whether
similar<00:00:52.800> types<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.520> change<00:00:53.760> might<00:00:53.969> happen<00:00:54.210> in

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
similar types of change might happen in

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.760 
similar types of change might happen in
the<00:00:54.329> white<00:00:54.600> matter<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.050> connecting<00:00:55.500> fiber

pathway to the brain and the results
we've<00:00:58.230> presented<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.890> suggests<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.960> when

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
we've presented here suggests that when

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.139 
we've presented here suggests that when
people<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.829> healthy<00:01:02.190> adult<00:01:02.489> subjects<00:01:02.910> learn

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
people have healthy adult subjects learn

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.420 
people have healthy adult subjects learn
a<00:01:03.420> skill<00:01:03.629> such<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.140> juggling<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.739> fiber

pathways of their brain change over a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.380 
pathways of their brain change over a
period<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.710> weeks<00:01:07.920> months

period of weeks months

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.700 
period of weeks months
the<00:01:10.390> big<00:01:10.570> question<00:01:10.689> now<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.140> what<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:11.439> change

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
the big question now is what that change

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.249 
the big question now is what that change
means<00:01:12.009> what's<00:01:12.490> going<00:01:12.759> on<00:01:12.880> in<00:01:13.000> their<00:01:13.119> brains<00:01:13.360> to

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
means what's going on in their brains to

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.350 
means what's going on in their brains to
give<00:01:14.470> us<00:01:14.590> that<00:01:14.740> change<00:01:15.520> on<00:01:15.729> our<00:01:15.880> imaging

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
give us that change on our imaging

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.570 
give us that change on our imaging
measure<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:17.110> we<00:01:17.320> think<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:17.740> things<00:01:18.250> such<00:01:18.549> as

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
measure and we think that things such as

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.820 
measure and we think that things such as
changes<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.390> amount<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.720> Milan<00:01:20.200> wrapping

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
changes in the amount of Milan wrapping

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.870 
changes in the amount of Milan wrapping
around<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.130> axons<00:01:21.549> or<00:01:21.729> even<00:01:22.479> changes<00:01:22.930> in<00:01:23.080> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
around the axons or even changes in the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.280 
around the axons or even changes in the
density<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:24.909> axons<00:01:25.390> within<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.750> bundle<00:01:26.080> might

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
density of axons within a bundle might

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.020 
density of axons within a bundle might
be<00:01:26.470> driving<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.280> effects<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:27.670> we<00:01:27.850> see<00:01:28.000> in

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
be driving the effects that we see in

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.840 
be driving the effects that we see in
our<00:01:28.240> imaging<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.920> how<00:01:30.100> how<00:01:30.520> does<00:01:30.700> one

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
our imaging that but how how does one

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.550 
our imaging that but how how does one
measure<00:01:31.090> these<00:01:31.360> changes<00:01:31.960> what<00:01:32.110> techniques

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
measure these changes what techniques

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.260 
measure these changes what techniques
here<00:01:32.799> using<00:01:33.159> open<00:01:33.460> above<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.820> standard<00:01:34.149> with

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
here using open above the standard with

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.020 
here using open above the standard with
MRI<00:01:34.570> techniques<00:01:35.399> so<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.549> technique<00:01:36.850> we've

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
MRI techniques so the technique we've

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.480 
MRI techniques so the technique we've
been<00:01:37.210> using<00:01:37.360> is<00:01:37.539> diffusion<00:01:38.289> MRI<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.340> in

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
been using is diffusion MRI so in

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.330 
been using is diffusion MRI so in
diffusion<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.200> it's<00:01:41.350> using<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.590> same<00:01:41.830> MRI

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
diffusion we so it's using the same MRI

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.040 
diffusion we so it's using the same MRI
scanner<00:01:42.700> but<00:01:42.880> we<00:01:43.000> sensitize<00:01:43.479> our<00:01:43.690> signal<00:01:44.020> to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
scanner but we sensitize our signal to

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.469 
scanner but we sensitize our signal to
the<00:01:44.259> self<00:01:44.770> diffusion<00:01:45.069> of<00:01:45.280> water<00:01:45.340> in<00:01:46.179> the<00:01:46.270> brain

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the self diffusion of water in the brain

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.419 
the self diffusion of water in the brain
which<00:01:46.690> is<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:47.140> useful<00:01:47.649> thing<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:48.039> do<00:01:48.250> in<00:01:48.340> this

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
which is a useful thing to do in this

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.160 
which is a useful thing to do in this
context<00:01:49.000> because<00:01:49.270> we<00:01:49.420> know<00:01:49.569> that<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:49.899> tissue

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
context because we know that in tissue

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.290 
context because we know that in tissue
with<00:01:50.440> a<00:01:50.470> highly<00:01:51.069> directional<00:01:51.250> structure<00:01:52.060> such

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
with a highly directional structure such

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.419 
with a highly directional structure such
as<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.479> fiber<00:01:52.750> bundle<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:54.280> will<00:01:54.399> be

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
as a fiber bundle there will be

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.219 
as a fiber bundle there will be
directional<00:01:55.030> dependence<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.780> diffusion

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
directional dependence to the diffusion

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.529 
directional dependence to the diffusion
signal<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:56.770> we<00:01:56.800> see<00:01:57.069> more<00:01:57.280> diffusion<00:01:57.850> along<00:01:58.420> an

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
signal so we see more diffusion along an

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.169 
signal so we see more diffusion along an
axial<00:01:58.899> crossmax<00:01:59.560> so<00:02:00.369> by<00:02:00.580> measuring<00:02:00.819> water

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
axial crossmax so by measuring water

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.789 
axial crossmax so by measuring water
diffusion<00:02:01.539> in<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.899> way<00:02:02.080> we<00:02:02.319> can<00:02:02.350> gain<00:02:02.770> a

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
diffusion in this way we can gain a

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.330 
diffusion in this way we can gain a
number<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:04.380> important<00:02:05.380> measures<00:02:05.830> which<00:02:06.039> tell

number of important measures which tell

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.559 
number of important measures which tell
us<00:02:06.460> something<00:02:06.759> about<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.970> structure<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
us something about the structure of the

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.570 
us something about the structure of the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
tissue so the particular measure we've

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.800 
tissue so the particular measure we've
been<00:02:09.759> looking<00:02:10.060> at<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.390> something<00:02:10.690> called

been looking at it's something called

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.350 
been looking at it's something called
fractional<00:02:11.140> anisotropy<00:02:11.739> which<00:02:12.360> quantifies

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
fractional anisotropy which quantifies

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.940

that<00:02:13.810> directional<00:02:14.140> dependence<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.890> the

of intrnt intensive training regimes

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.740 
of intrnt intensive training regimes
that<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:48.110> assume<00:02:48.440> with<00:02:48.740> resulting<00:02:49.750> intense

patterns of axons in the brain that that

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.080

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
type of intensive neuronal activity will

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.670 
type of intensive neuronal activity will
have<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.330> knock-on<00:02:59.540> effect<00:03:00.020> on<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.290> structure

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
have a knock-on effect on the structure

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.170 
have a knock-on effect on the structure
of<00:03:00.710> the<00:03:00.830> brain<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.280> we<00:03:01.400> think<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.790> type

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
of the brain so we think that that type

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.230 
of the brain so we think that that type

influence<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.690> brain<00:03:05.900> structure<00:03:06.320> in<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.500> way

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
influence the brain structure in a way

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.850 
influence the brain structure in a way
that<00:03:06.800> might<00:03:06.950> then<00:03:07.130> persist<00:03:07.580> for<00:03:08.180> weeks<00:03:08.860> so

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
that might then persist for weeks so

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.310 
that might then persist for weeks so
