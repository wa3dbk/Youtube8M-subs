00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.710
 hello your bank shows you how to change 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.710
 the filters of a compact osmosis 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.250
 apart from the filters for the 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.560
 maintenance we will need a 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.240
 screwdriver and a pair of gloves 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.279
 latex 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.890
 We will start by removing the caps from the 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.320
 team to do it we take out the lid 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.029
 superior once withdrawn we will have 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.000
 access to cover screws 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.329
 we remove the screws and the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.329
 top 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.960
 Y 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 i 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.120
 we will start the maintenance closing the 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.040
 entering water and emptying the osmosis 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.040
 opening the service tap 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.149
 then we remove the filter from 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.729
 sediments of osmosis 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.149
 It is important to remember the order of 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.220
 connections as a guide the filters have 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.920
 drawn an arrow with the sense of 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.960
 water flow if you look when removing 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.009
 the old filter will be easier 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.009
 place the new 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.100
 we continue with the two filters of 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.530
 coal the procedure is the same as 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.840
 the previous one with the difference that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.900
 these are joined by the back 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.140
 with a tube it is important to look at the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.970
 sense of water flow these filters 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.440
 they also have some arrows marked 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.440
 to facilitate the work 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.960
 we follow and now we remove the post 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.300
 carbon filter to do it like in 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.210
 the previous cases the filter comes 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.310
 marked and we just need to respect the 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.060
 direction of the arrows to put it 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.060
 correctly 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.580
 we have the filters ready now 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.460
 we will purge to avoid getting dirty 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.680
 the membrane of osmosis to do it 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.140
 we removed the security clip first 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.580
 of the entrance tube to the membrane and 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.110
 pressing first inward 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.630
 we remove the tube 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.310
 next we put a container 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.380
 under the tube that we just 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.350
 disconnect and we open the tap of 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.110
 entrance will begin to leave water with a 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.030
 dark color we should let it out 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.390
 until you see that the water is totally 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.390
 clean 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.590
 once the clean water comes out we can already 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.660
 close the tap and connect the tube is 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.970
 important to put the security click of 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.540
 new 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.540
 i 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.950
 we already have the osmosis ready to put it 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.200
 in its place now we open the tap of 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.420
 entrance of the water and let pass a 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.270
 approximately to fill the 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.330
 deposit completely past this time 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.420
 we open the service tap and leave 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.670
 that the deposit is empty we will repeat the 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.570
 process of filling and emptying the deposit 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:02.760
 again we put the covers back and 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:05.760
 we will have the mochis ready to use 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.760
 two
