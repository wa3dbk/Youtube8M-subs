00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.350
 giving body scrub 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.810
 Asia Salvation is not familiar with what it is

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.820

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.200
 so called shade but i don't know me 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.870
 why was it a mac, and yet I chose 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.930
 someone that light is such a gentle 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.750

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.620
 girls well dressed blush 1st and 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.570
 texture 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.550
 how to apply in one layer so you can and 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.130
 layering more more then you have 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.080
 do not overdo them with rings 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.590
 fit here is renan as a daily 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.590
 makeup 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.020
 so x flour and signal hotel for a wedding and 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.380
 to dark eyes I put in 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.240
 crushed looks overloaded rock 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.490
 a cold pink tinge on lipstick and 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.039
 something more gently pink that she chose 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.990
 this shade of mind is of course the shade 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.900
 angel because I knew that I was not with him 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.880
 guess it and it will be this principle 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.789
 pink which will be like daily 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.590
 look good on the lips and not 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.360
 I know how he so when again smokey ice 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.070
 so I put it with those rosy with 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.620
 dark eyes and it was very very 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.910
 cool yes this is my color in principle he and 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.759
 not bright it is not dull in moderation such 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.160
 nice i agree that help light 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.530
 shade very timol base cool 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.360
 well about the quality of lipstick yes she 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.039
 keeps well during the day we write 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.750
 minus this lipstick for me is that she 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.270
 turned out to be not so creamy as 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.000
 she still represented her 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.610
 the texture is thick and applied 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.409
 hard as if a little dry 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.940
 blues to pay some wetter then 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.010
 she was just five plus 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.949
 And so of course, and the principle of the five I 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.990
 I put and good lipstick who wants you can 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.639
 try them with decorative cosmetics 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.190
 then I went who is again in a smile 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:45.840
 rainbows when i saw these 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:49.599

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:52.090
 27 gentle beautiful shade I took it 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:55.120
 also the form of such as balm butcher 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.880
 very wet so nice texture and 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.210
 on finish she would look deep here 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.300
 You applied a soft moisturizing lipstick 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.060
 shine is something such mango butter 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.280
 so because of this she has such protection and 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.260
 moisturizing with 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.360
 in fact when lipstick is completely from you 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.610
 cleaned the sound of a sponge such know how 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.350
 after a good good balm that is 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.650
 In this of course huge five with plus
