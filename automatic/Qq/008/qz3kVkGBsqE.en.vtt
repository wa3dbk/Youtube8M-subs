00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.390 

the<00:02:27.330> third<00:02:27.570> game<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.020> awesome<00:02:28.380> off<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:29.130> run

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
the third game is awesome off this run

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.130 
the third game is awesome off this run
at<00:02:29.550> 30<00:02:29.760> frames<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.240> second<00:02:30.660> while<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.450 
ground but 60 during the spawn minigame
the<00:02:33.870> reason<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.260> ran<00:02:34.440> only<00:02:34.620> at<00:02:34.800> 30<00:02:35.040> frames<00:02:35.250> per

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
the reason it ran only at 30 frames per

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.610 
the reason it ran only at 30 frames per
second<00:02:35.970> was<00:02:36.120> because<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.510> left<00:02:36.660> vsync<00:02:37.140> enabled

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
second was because I left vsync enabled

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.770 
second was because I left vsync enabled
which<00:02:38.040> limits<00:02:38.430> my<00:02:38.580> frame<00:02:38.820> rate<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.060> 60<00:02:39.570> frames

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
which limits my frame rate to 60 frames

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.170 
which limits my frame rate to 60 frames
a<00:02:39.930> second<00:02:40.320> but<00:02:40.830> still<00:02:41.160> dropped<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.520> 30<00:02:41.820> when<00:02:42.150> I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
a second but still dropped to 30 when I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.030 
a second but still dropped to 30 when I
was<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.570> ground<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.470> graphics<00:02:43.890> quality

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
was on the ground the graphics quality

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.070 
was on the ground the graphics quality
was<00:02:44.370> also<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.790> high<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.600> same<00:02:45.780> note<00:02:45.990> of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
was also on high on the same note of

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.070 
was also on high on the same note of
vsync<00:02:46.500> laptop<00:02:47.430> screen<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:48.030> display<00:02:48.060> only<00:02:48.540> 60

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
vsync laptop screen can display only 60

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.470 
vsync laptop screen can display only 60
frames<00:02:49.320> per<00:02:49.410> second<00:02:49.890> maximum<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> recommend

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
frames per second maximum so I recommend

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.450 
frames per second maximum so I recommend
enabling<00:02:51.690> vsync<00:02:52.380> on<00:02:52.530> most<00:02:52.740> games<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.160> order<00:02:53.250> to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
enabling vsync on most games in order to

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:44.429 
enabling vsync on most games in order to
save<00:02:53.610> battery<00:02:53.880> life

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.350 

so<00:03:45.439> game<00:03:45.680> four<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.220> Team<00:03:46.459> Fortress<00:03:46.760> 2<00:03:47.150> I

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
so game four is Team Fortress 2 I

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.789 
so game four is Team Fortress 2 I
haven't<00:03:47.659> got<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> whole<00:03:48.019> lot<00:03:48.170> to<00:03:48.319> say<00:03:48.500> but<00:03:48.560> it

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
haven't got a whole lot to say but it

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.770 
haven't got a whole lot to say but it
rang<00:03:48.950> constantly<00:03:49.489> at<00:03:49.579> 60<00:03:49.939> frames<00:03:50.150> per<00:03:50.299> second

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
rang constantly at 60 frames per second
