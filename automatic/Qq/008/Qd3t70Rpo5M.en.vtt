00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
to identify with it right it's really

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.080

from my life

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.089 
from my life
is<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:13.510> articulation<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.500> an<00:03:14.620> optimistic

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
is the articulation of an optimistic

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.089 
is the articulation of an optimistic
vision<00:03:15.639> of<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.879> future<00:03:16.060> right<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.889> me

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
vision of the future right and to me

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.830 
vision of the future right and to me
this<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:18.790> necessary<00:03:19.000> because<00:03:19.450> without

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
this is so necessary because without

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.580 
this is so necessary because without
that<00:03:20.109> you<00:03:20.680> can't<00:03:21.459> build<00:03:21.909> anything<00:03:22.329> without<00:03:23.200> an

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
that you can't build anything without an

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.530 
that you can't build anything without an
optimistic<00:03:24.099> vision<00:03:24.549> of<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.849> future<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.389> can

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
optimistic vision of the future you can

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.690 
optimistic vision of the future you can
only<00:03:25.780> compete<00:03:26.170> for<00:03:26.680> who<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:27.069> going<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.370> tear

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
only compete for who is going to tear

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.140 
only compete for who is going to tear
down<00:03:27.730> what<00:03:28.000> we<00:03:28.329> have<00:03:28.569> less<00:03:28.959> yes<00:03:29.889> and<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:31.000> is

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
down what we have less yes and this is

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.119 
down what we have less yes and this is
something<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.629> drives<00:03:31.900> me<00:03:32.260> nuts

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.189 

I<00:03:36.129> look<00:03:36.669> at<00:03:36.760> these<00:03:36.849> pieces<00:03:37.030> as<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.359> moment<00:03:37.840> set

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:38.199 
I look at these pieces as a moment set

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.800 
I look at these pieces as a moment set
aside<00:03:38.530> for<00:03:39.459> contemplation<00:03:40.269> on<00:03:40.359> a<00:03:40.419> certain

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
aside for contemplation on a certain

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.020 
aside for contemplation on a certain
issue<00:03:40.959> I've<00:03:41.829> tried<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.310> make<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.579> music<00:03:42.909> so

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
issue I've tried to make the music so

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.089 
issue I've tried to make the music so
that<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.269> supports<00:03:43.449> that<00:03:44.079> issue<00:03:44.319> supports<00:03:45.010> a

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
that it supports that issue supports a

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.280 
that it supports that issue supports a
way<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.549> looking<00:03:45.790> at<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.209> it's<00:03:46.659> not<00:03:46.780> trying<00:03:47.199> to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
way of looking at it it's not trying to

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.629 
way of looking at it it's not trying to
tell<00:03:47.470> people<00:03:47.500> this<00:03:47.889> is<00:03:47.949> the<00:03:48.190> right<00:03:48.400> way<00:03:48.579> to

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
tell people this is the right way to

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.159 
tell people this is the right way to
think<00:03:48.879> about<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.269> or<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.480> wrong<00:03:49.690> way<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.959> think

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
think about it or the wrong way to think

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.099 
think about it or the wrong way to think
about<00:03:50.319> it<00:03:50.730> I've<00:03:51.730> tried<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.389> use<00:03:52.419> the<00:03:52.840> way<00:03:52.959> the

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
about it I've tried to use the way the

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.699 
about it I've tried to use the way the
music<00:03:53.379> works<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:54.430> show<00:03:54.760> my<00:03:55.510> idea<00:03:56.199> about<00:03:56.530> how

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
music works to show my idea about how

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.789 
music works to show my idea about how
the<00:03:56.769> politics<00:03:57.370> working<00:03:57.760> for<00:03:58.599> example<00:03:59.199> this<00:03:59.620> is

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
the politics working for example this is

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:00.629 
the politics working for example this is
the<00:03:59.919> interesting<00:04:00.220> thing

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
the interesting thing

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.270 
the interesting thing
I<00:04:00.760> hope<00:04:01.150> about<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.139> way<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:02.859> have<00:04:03.040> set

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
I hope about the way that I have set

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.439 
I hope about the way that I have set
this<00:04:03.400> up<00:04:03.459> is<00:04:03.819> that<00:04:05.099> everyone<00:04:06.120> sings<00:04:07.120> every

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449
