00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
five-game you think that's just because

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.000

they<00:03:04.360> make<00:03:04.810> assumptions<00:03:05.319> on<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:05.620> stuff<00:03:05.799> or

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
is there going to be some sort of

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.350 
is there going to be some sort of
compatibility<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:08.739> cashed<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:09.819> key<00:03:10.030> over
