00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:03.769
 hull preparation and installation 

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:05.720
 motherboard 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.810
 first we need to disassemble the body then 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.689
 There is a remove the cover or side panels 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.979
 As a rule, shells are either intended to be 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.710
 cover either two side and top 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.869
 panel 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.249
 on our case the left panel is already 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.060
 filmed 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.039
 put the case on its side 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.279
 right panels have to be removed 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.579
 if the motherboard is impossible 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.599
 puts on top of the nearest building 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.670
 for example, the basics of blocking this 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.530
 power supply 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.530
 then the panel on which 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.030
 installed motherboard 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.000
 removed from the body then it is put on 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.810
 the board and then the panel with the board is attached 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.650
 back to the hull 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.150
 generally more convenient to use 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.020
 enclosures in which the power supply 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.350
 horizontally positioned they 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.240
 vertically 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.980
 so it does not prevent to install 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.660
 motherboard and does not impede it 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.610
 blowing 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.600
 in our case is enough 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.270
 free space 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.920
 so we will insert a fee 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.480
 directly into the body 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.110
 on the panels that are attached maternal 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.660
 the board can be threaded hole 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.300
 risk-free hole 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.740
 threaded metal racks 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.280
 in some cases rack needs 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.850
 pre-screw to the panel 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.990
 the number and location of racks 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.920
 must exactly match 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.500
 number and location 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.680
 holes on the motherboard 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.570
 extra racks in the wrong place 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.350
 can touch the board and close 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140
 any contacts 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.330
 There are already racks in our case 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.260
 that we only need to install correctly 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.000
 on them a fee 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.620
 dimensions and mounting method 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.430
 motherboard 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.110
 characterized by the so-called form 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.150
 a factor 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.320
 for home and office computers 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.660
 most commonly used boards 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.460
 form factors and three X and micro and 3 thousand 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.439
 our house has a form factor hotel 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.439
 riksos and fastens on nine screws 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.190
 install the board so that the holes in it 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.190
 matched racks and fasten screws 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.859
 we have an electric screwdriver so we 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.309
 twist feints quickly and neatly 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:29.639
 if you use ordinary crystals 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.059
 screwdriver make sure not to screwdriver 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.769
 jumped off and did not hit the payment 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.370
 Also, do not tighten the screws. 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.189
 too hard not to repaint the board 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.409
 better not to tighten the screws first 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.009
 emphasis of hell twist their descendants making sure 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.009
 that the board costs exactly 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.809
 motherboard installed
