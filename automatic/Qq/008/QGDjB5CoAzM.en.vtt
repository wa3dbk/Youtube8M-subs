00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Speak there guys from youtube, whoever 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.859
 here, silva had an inscription and that 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.599
 requested a video is that I would make a 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.230
 video teaching how to tighten current 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.230
 receive thousand 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.199
 all you will need is in the kit 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.079
 tools that comes with your bike ok 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.000
 Your bike came with a kit. Yes, it goes there. 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.789
 dealer where you got her that 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.070
 is wrong you have to come with a kit of 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.300
 Beauty tools do not know what you 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.570
 will find the hex key and 19 and 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.210
 17 and you will find this cable 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.350
 extensor you will find this key 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.820
 strange here 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.409
 The first step is you to loose and 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:54.550
 screw if using hex wrench 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:57.239
 loosen the side that the arrow is the side of 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.100
 out into the side of the wheel 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.159
 so I already gave an arrow on the steering wheel 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.840
 to facilitate demonstration here you 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:10.549
 loose it well 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.729
 this one next door is crying next to you 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.909
 the arrow will dissipate fuzuera in the manual 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.689
 said the chain needs to have 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.429
 a clearance of 30 millimeters ie 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:29.869
 three centimeters so her backlash 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:33.049
 you medic so sure is but here is more 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:38.179
 or less than half the current from here 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:40.220
 Up here you can meditate on the 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.789
 from the bottom and from the top 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.590
 from the chain from here she's up 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.079
 that she stays must have three 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.590
 centimeters is this chain gap 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.590
 of the week this and already with screw 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.619
 proceed here to tighten the chain 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.329
 or for concurrent maintenance right 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:08.560
 is part of current maintenance with 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:08.560
 is to keep her there in the right tension show 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:20.510
 now this key with this extensive and use 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.630
 lino with the dog in the place where the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.599
 current arrow or chain 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.150
 you have to do something else you have 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.810
 to turn an extender here for you 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.239
 Can not handle because he's half 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.239
 sloping side is half a little bend 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.340
 Why are you going to do it? 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.209
 let me show location 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:59.970
 this piece here in this play here is where 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:05.820
 you fit it to be able to make the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.920
 you position on this key 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:15.540
 on here 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:26.220
 so whoever won two parts 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:28.850
 Here a dog who supported nor 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.850
 extensive 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:43.769
 here we are loosening the 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:47.100
 chain that loosen from below 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:53.970
 from the bottom up making a move 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:56.420
 here from the bottom up is pressing the 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.420
 chain 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:09.060
 in this case the case and she was very 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.829
 tight can not stay like that cup 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:17.930
 they have a specific gap 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:21.000
 very stretched puts your head here 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.910
 so stay put your head up to 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.880
 head up and loose 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.180
 her head down to tighten the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.690
 current now we will loose 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.690
 chain 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.319
 See how it stayed here. 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:53.409
 this is more the same 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:03.289
 two strings lines that day will miss 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:20.029
 in the chain gradually and here you can 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:29.849
 measuring with a ruler is good only 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:33.529
 got the ruler to measure here 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.529
 and with 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.730
 also're right 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:10.090
 okay with some off three centimeters of 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.610
 that the starting line of the chain 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:21.570
 the top line is at the top where it is 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:21.570
 measuring 3 centimeters off 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.900
 This is it, I hope you have 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:42.639
 understood as it does 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:47.530
 I am not here to tighten the question of 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:53.040
 tighten the bolts here on the bike to 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:07:01.630
 turn the screw clockwise 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:05.500
 tightening in the anti-clockwise 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:08.320
 this personal now that it is understood is 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.650
