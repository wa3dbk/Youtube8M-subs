and have the courage to keep going

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.940 
and have the courage to keep going
because<00:00:49.399> sometimes<00:00:50.140> you<00:00:51.140> get<00:00:51.289> up<00:00:51.440> in<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.770> day

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
because sometimes you get up in the day

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.680 
because sometimes you get up in the day
and<00:00:52.190> does<00:00:52.340> he<00:00:52.460> have<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:52.610> new<00:00:52.820> ache<00:00:53.000> or<00:00:53.270> new<00:00:53.420> pain

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
and does he have a new ache or new pain

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.600 
and does he have a new ache or new pain
and<00:00:53.930> sometimes<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.440> do<00:00:54.590> get<00:00:54.739> discouraged<00:00:55.340> and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
and sometimes you do get discouraged and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.840 
and sometimes you do get discouraged and
to<00:00:56.300> see<00:00:56.510> someone<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:56.989> keeps<00:00:57.469> going<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.100> is

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
to see someone that keeps going and is

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.760 
to see someone that keeps going and is
able<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.180> do<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.719> I<00:00:59.960> think<00:01:00.350> it's<00:01:00.649> very

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
able to do that I think it's very

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.740 
able to do that I think it's very
encouraging<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.670> lot<00:01:01.820> of<00:01:01.940> older<00:01:02.210> people<00:01:02.600> and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
encouraging to a lot of older people and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.999 
encouraging to a lot of older people and
why<00:01:02.930> is<00:01:02.989> this<00:01:03.170> type<00:01:03.410> of<00:01:03.440> thing<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:03.649> even<00:01:03.739> gets

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
why is this type of thing that even gets

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.200 
why is this type of thing that even gets
people<00:01:04.280> emotional<00:01:04.729> when<00:01:04.820> they<00:01:04.940> see<00:01:05.000> it

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
people emotional when they see it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.460 
people emotional when they see it
because<00:01:05.570> most<00:01:05.750> people<00:01:05.930> don't<00:01:05.990> love<00:01:06.289> people

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
because most people don't love people

because most people don't love people
don't<00:01:06.590> make<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:07.970> because<00:01:08.360> we

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
don't make it that that is because we

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.859 
don't make it that that is because we
relate<00:01:09.410> older<00:01:10.160> you<00:01:10.280> get<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.789> more<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:11.630> can
