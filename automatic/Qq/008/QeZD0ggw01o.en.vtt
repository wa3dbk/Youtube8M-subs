00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:03.879
 to 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.969
 and I'm with with and we were talking about 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.200
 the advent calendars that for 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.670
 these holidays 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.699
 of course 24 days before the arrival 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.890
 euro in europe are very much I am more 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.410
 it reminded me a bit 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.240
 childhood in my family this was but 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.630
 religious but how is the warming 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 you are 24 days before 24 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.480
 we started to open each shtick has 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.150
 a lockers this one opens and from behind 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.250
 a surprise appears and it really was 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.320
 for us guys it was all know what 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180
 is what everyone reads in your house who 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.130
 he was doing it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.830
 we did not bring it and give it more 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.350
 germany- and each one had my brothers 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.050
 everyone had their calendar and in 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.920
 general are transparent against glass 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.920
 then this one 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.129
 but I love it because they already have 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.379
 messages that may have something real 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.860
 generally 24 are on shelves 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.920
 ebre with 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.210
 his manias we did not know much about 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.880
 advent calendar until 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.039
 we started our work 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.439
 many years and the teachers who 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.289
 they traveled when I was traveling all 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:26.270
 we brought the calendars and we taught 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:28.789
 paint calendars where people were very 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.740
 common in that era of country 6 and 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:37.179
 doing it good is good and in this 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.890
 case well against what I came blue blue 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.220
 no no but it's good it comes to your good 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.600
 This full color is good given what 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.899
 I'm going to do first is the part of 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.770
 up with a paper not very gray or very 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.390
 fine if only which one I'm going to paste 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.849
 napkins I'm actually going to combine 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.630
 residence in this case I worked with two 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:05.420
 in the same tone and I paste them both 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.539
 with the glue to occupy very well 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.840
 this is very simple berger the technique 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.760
 in itself everything is simple the secret is 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.250
 in knowing how to combine the tones 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.440
 because above directly applied the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.070
 glue if I want 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.500
 this genre wrinkles to give it an effect 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.990
 texture 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.070
 a little more interesting effect more 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.130
 interesting that all brightness has has 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.660
 shine that we are going to give it later a 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.420
 Once we apply all the glue 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.610
 above napkins I 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.310
 I chose not exactly not have to 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.310
 be two can be more begins 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.260
 and the other job 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.569
 is complete 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.450
 because I 'll see I have millions of 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.780
 service designs 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.069
 the base are 2 but then this part the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.610
 completed with other things if for example 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.680
 can be with an ox heart is like 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.819
 that I 'm putting together my own 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.330
 napkin 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.360
 my own motive 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.580
 each one will have a clear cap 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.240
 Exactly good this way let's go 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.780
 completing the design and if I want a 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.850
 Once it is very dry this coloring by 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.000
 over with acrylics 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.420
 for example to give you some details 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.760
 that stand out even more 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.980
 of the design itself for example can 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.140
 get to do this what I just 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.530
 do with the horns of the reindeer or 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.660
 well intensify 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.610
 if the red of the father noel 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.710
 that is when we do decoupage 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.930
 and we can also paint on the 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.770
 napkin to reinforce precisely because 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.980
 are this is a paper 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.310
 and I can even do all the 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.180
 decorations with the drop in this case 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.180
 golden 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.760
 here we see some and clear hearts of 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.790
 little tree like that 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.170
 reign everything that is just golden that 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.290
 you see here 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.870
 this work is very nice 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.470
 good 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.310
 and in the part of the die and here I put 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:31.129
 one as an example if above we're going 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.569
 to give a number that will go from 1 to 24 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.860
 in this case use a 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.509
 this one itself 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.509
 for example the 2 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.230
 with taponador Gomez how I 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.110
 they like more are more critical covers better 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.440
 If I'm more used, it's according to 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.440
 custom of each charge discharge and 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.270
 I did it in the white tones and there 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.950
 you can put good because you have a 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.080
 extension of numbers with which you can 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.120
 put all the different numbers 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.120
 colors actually too but I did it 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.750
 with white and in this case a touch of 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.770
 golden above 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.480
 Well, for example, what you did 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.580
 in this calendar is that they are not 1 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:24.860
 as not because you have to search also 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:27.080
 that in general guys guys or is this 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.840
 it's not so fast the visualization of 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.330
 look 11 we have to open this one that is 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.530
 well clear good and below this 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.990
 die what we are going to make wait 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.120
 something something that can be generated 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:46.949
 as a surprise like that 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:50.220
 what can a star be a star or 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:52.930
 what is also in this case with the 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.920
 glue to occupy 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.160
 I worked 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.569
 in this case what is the bottom part 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.069
 with the plates 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.949
 if they are a little thicker than the 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:08.039
 die what I do is cut out 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.159
 cut with a thumbtack that works 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.159
 all right 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.250
 then when you reach number one 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.550
 the first day of December what is 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:24.740
 does it open or surprise appears what 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:28.460
 it appears more everything with things that you have in 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.930
 house and what you told about a wood 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.669
 how good can you hang him? 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.280
 here I liked the background also gave me 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.620
 moved clear and then if we want to give it 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.460
 still a touch to everything shiny what 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.139
 I did 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.340
 there is a glue to recover that already 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:45.139
 it has mixed brightness if it is applied 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.800
 Now all we will not notice but 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.800
 it's dry 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:57.020
 that's all the technique that also 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:07:00.679
 suddenly I can think of a 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:03.949
 week before the family with the boys 

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:07.809
 to be able to read guys is not a 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:11.659
 surprise for parents 

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:13.969
 Godmother pride is a tradition and of 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:16.129
 surprise to surprise for the guys and 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:25.580
 it really generates a lot of anxiety 

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:29.709
 the number one French but like me 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.709
 loved good minutes we dreamed 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.330
 plante has a very complete range 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.730
 products for painters 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.920
 better acrylic tones and so that the 

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.410
 stencil varieties accessories is 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:49.310
 water varnishes silk paints 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:51.850
 sheets complete the artistic line of 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.850
 technical plan
