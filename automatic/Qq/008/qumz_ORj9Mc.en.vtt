00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.349
 Now we want the pattern of cut 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 I have little to look at and I have one 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.030
 the scale must be exactly five centimeters 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.590
 be that long you can measure and after 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.020
 then I would do everything else first 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.539
 print the first page first 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.519
 then I usually have flowers on mine 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.170
 cut patterns so that knows what's ahead and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.210
 what's behind and what the food is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.099
 Here I only have the food with one 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.720
 flower marked so nothing goes wrong 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.020
 can 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.270
 I also use triangles as pass 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.340
 signs to meet 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.379
 when the sewing patterns are on top of each other 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.450
 People are always asking me questions 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.010
 again why do I mine 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.390
 cutting pattern in two formats whole 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.480
 just here you can see that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.879
 So this is the a4 but for that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.860
 American format would not do that 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.770
 The paper would fit and I would just need 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.449
 still two cut pattern parts are the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.940
 already here on it 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.250
 Letters of course are the extra 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 and if now to the place of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.060
 have these pictures then you know that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.460
 were now the classic bag ready 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.549
 Now it goes on with my beach 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.890
 cottage theme and that is in turquoise and 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.210
 has the wider handles so if 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.490
 you want to sew that then you have to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.180
 just up to the cutting plan 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.409
 go 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.250
 he comes here and then that's the topic 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.659
 I would do it, too 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.340
 maybe staple together if you have that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.390
 now that with unused want 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.970
 then you have a nice one here 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.380
 cut plan and it goes on with 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.810
 the vw-bus theme 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.180
 that is now in dark blue and has the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.110
 Chancellor hopes that Chancellor 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.299
 fold 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 if everything is cut out so have 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.579
 i will be part of a and b for example then 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.159
 this line covered here and mine 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.270
 of course, signs must be natural 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.119
 juxtaposed think that once 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.560
 glued together with adhesive tape and so on 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.439
 keep to all procedures 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 pattern and you need 70 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.930
 centimeters in length and 1 meter 30 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.840
 in width and from feed you need 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.510
 40 cm if we have a lived kurt 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.520
 use 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.590
 of course we do not hope this 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.810
 cut pattern part 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.810
 but I would recommend you anyway 70 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.030
 cm just because 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.690
 is simply the thing too complicated 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.990
 makes 70 centimeters 40 inches all right 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.030
 Let's start cutting when I have it 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.350
 I have a small head here 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.540
 my old center topic and so and so 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.420
 I just pick it up and then it will 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.700
 tailored and actually exists 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.610
 Here only to note that this part 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.780
 here it is part 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.940
 must be tailored in the fabric book 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.990
 and everything else will be twice 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.540
 tailored 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.130
 Of course we also have that here 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.020
 part of the bag that we only need 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.600
 so once I leave that until the 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.970
 I just cut it once 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.980
 and then I have this part left over 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.440
 and maybe there's something I can do 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.390
 nice to see from it maybe need 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.390
 I again as a contrast for a 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.010
 another bag or a wallet or 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.970
 Something like that in the direction 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.090
 I have my wallets too 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.610
 your travel bags where you pass yours 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.280
 you can put it in it for free 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.720
 Sewing pattern of samana should have that 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.930
 I developed for your blog for those 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.480
 and German passport has, of course 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.230
 wide all so I find funny that the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.180
 rest of the band offers a more well on matter 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.080
 in any case, she can do that from o mamas 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.850
 download 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.500
 the cut pattern is the link to it 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.010
 of course on my website too 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.310
 and then you can match that with you 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.470
 also sew well so now we cut 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.170
 That's all I want you to do then 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.510
 show something here for a while 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.450
 how it cuts is always important 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.010
 you cut from the left side because 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.390
 you then have the control over the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.230
 So you can do it a bit 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.230
 raise here 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.950
 and because you do not always like that the internet 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.959
 Of course, it does not work unless you have one 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.819
 the movies downloaded to be 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.450
 children or so it's natural one 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.970
 great thing 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.440
 there is then the written 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.440
 instruction in english 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.689
 continue to watch how you want 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.430
 That bag you go together then gives 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.870
 it had to be here long ago just had to 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.389
 click on it and then you can 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.270
 look at what you would like one 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.680
 Introducing the sewing of the bag as well 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.749
 to place bags and feet 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.949
 of course, how to make such a poplar bag 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.949
 that's a great thing 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.310
 I wish you a lot of fun with it and 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.310
 thanks for the audience
