 food so for cooking 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.660
 stuffed zucchini we need 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.720
 zucchini better to take brackets 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.840
 size for this dish 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 we also need lentils which i 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 pre-soaked in water about 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.619
 for six hours, that is, I didn't cook it 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.640
 didn't do anything to her just soaked in 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.000
 I have increased the water I have increased 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.820
 in size about twice as much to me 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.530
 will need a tomato sweet pepper 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.570
 parsley green oil 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.939
 asafoetida spice which will replace me 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.110
 onion garlic 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.340
 accordingly if you do not have this 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.740
 mince spices you also add garlic 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.479
 and onions and salt that's all 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.720
 first we have to prepare for 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.479
 stuffing zucchini so we take such 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.549
 large zucchini 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.549
 we cut off his corners 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.440
 and cut into such thick pieces where 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.440
 that 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:24.370
 43 centimeters 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:27.099
 that is thick enough then we 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.629
 must cut out the middle with a knife 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:34.060
 in our zucchini and here it is the average 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.700
 part we still need we will 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.970
 add it stuffing that is, we must 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.599
 There are here such tins for 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.599
 minced meat 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
 and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.819
 so here are our stuffing cups 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:05.010
 ready now proceed to mince 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.459
 I will need lentils for stuffing 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.650
 soaked and some of these here here 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:15.660
 viscera most likely even half 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.750
 here this softly zucchini ta and also 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.060
 salt and spices asafoetida repeat if 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.360
 you have no such spice you can 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:30.410
 replace it with a slice of onion and garlic 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.660
 we need a powerful blender because 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.739
 lentils we will need to grind 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.930
 straight 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.930
 I put the lentils in the pasta bowl 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:52.730
 I can't grind everything right away 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:55.290
 I will do it in parts and part of the pulp 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:01.220
 look the pulp should not be too 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.220
 a lot of different stuffing will be very liquid 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:13.940
 add asafoetida here add salt and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.370
 grind to obtain a homogeneous 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:26.910
 the masses and so I crushed the potion 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:32.460
 I have such a mince 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:37.430
 add lentil mince and also greens 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.430

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.480

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:11.389
