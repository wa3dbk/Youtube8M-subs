it along a longer period of time and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.390 
it along a longer period of time and
incorporating<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.170> player<00:02:49.530> feedback<00:02:49.800> as<00:02:50.190> we

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
incorporating that player feedback as we

incorporating that player feedback as we
go<00:02:50.550> along<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:51.180> care<00:02:51.690> what<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.960> players<00:02:52.170> think

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
go along we care what the players think

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.560 
go along we care what the players think
and<00:02:52.740> that's<00:02:52.920> one<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> reasons<00:02:53.730> why<00:02:53.940> we're

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
and that's one of the reasons why we're

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.210 
and that's one of the reasons why we're
not<00:02:54.600> releasing<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.290> all<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.560> one<00:02:55.710> go<00:02:55.890> we<00:02:56.070> want

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
not releasing it all in one go we want

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.790 
not releasing it all in one go we want
to<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.550> module<00:02:57.060> by<00:02:57.210> module<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:58.350> get<00:02:58.530> player

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
to do it module by module we get player

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.890 
to do it module by module we get player
feedback<00:02:59.070> as<00:02:59.460> we<00:02:59.580> go<00:02:59.730> along<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.390> think<00:03:00.780> that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
feedback as we go along and I think that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.540 
feedback as we go along and I think that
will<00:03:00.990> help<00:03:01.110> reshape<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.560> website<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.370> the
