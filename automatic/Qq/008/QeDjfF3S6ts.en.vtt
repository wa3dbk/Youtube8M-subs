good<00:00:37.520> for<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:37.760> come<00:00:38.000> he's<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.210> brilliant

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
good for you come he's a brilliant

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.389 
good for you come he's a brilliant
talent<00:00:38.899> I've<00:00:39.230> watched<00:00:39.620> him<00:00:39.829> now<00:00:40.010> for<00:00:40.250> nearly

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
talent I've watched him now for nearly

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.049 
talent I've watched him now for nearly
two<00:00:40.640> years

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
two years

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.209 
two years
very<00:00:41.750> consistent<00:00:42.170> he's<00:00:42.590> now<00:00:42.800> getting<00:00:42.980> the

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
very consistent he's now getting the

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.459 
very consistent he's now getting the
goals<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:43.850> I<00:00:44.270> think<00:00:44.809> he'd<00:00:44.960> be<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.079> real<00:00:45.289> asset

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
goals and I think he'd be a real asset

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.290 
goals and I think he'd be a real asset
ring<00:00:45.920> them<00:00:46.129> they'd<00:00:46.340> be<00:00:46.579> good<00:00:46.879> on<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.149> wing

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
ring them they'd be good on the wing
