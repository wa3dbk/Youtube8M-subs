00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.830
 hit the fraps program how to set up 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.560
 fraps not to lag in the games we 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.810
 start after you have crossed by 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.420
 link which be in the description and clicked 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:54.120
 installation takes a very slow sense 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.710
 very quickly further this file is already 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.769

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.650

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.490
 license further we turn off go 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:24.350
 next we give high priority of course 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:28.710

 This is a program that takes, as it were. 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.620
 energy at the computer so if you have 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.470

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.069
 crap but if you half says 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.720

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:52.209
