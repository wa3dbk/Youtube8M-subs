00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.530 

okay<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:26.560> let's<00:01:26.800> try<00:01:27.010> just<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.370> little<00:01:27.400> bit<00:01:27.940> so

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
okay so let's try just a little bit so

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.980 
okay so let's try just a little bit so
let's<00:01:28.720> put<00:01:28.870> another<00:01:28.990> layer<00:01:29.380> on<00:01:29.440> on<00:01:30.480> this<00:01:31.480> on<00:01:31.750> my

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
let's put another layer on on this on my

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.110 
let's put another layer on on this on my
ring<00:01:32.320> finger<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.740> see<00:01:33.190> if<00:01:33.730> it<00:01:33.880> makes<00:01:33.970> a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
ring finger and see if it makes a

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:47.030 
ring finger and see if it makes a
difference

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.950 

so<00:01:47.580> as<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.790> see<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.120> it's<00:01:48.630> pretty<00:01:48.840> much

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
so as you can see it's it's pretty much

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.710 
so as you can see it's it's pretty much
a<00:01:49.020> thin<00:01:49.320> layers<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.580> doesn't<00:01:51.030> even<00:01:51.120> code<00:01:51.570> it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
a thin layers it doesn't even code it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.820 
a thin layers it doesn't even code it
properly<00:01:52.050> as<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.470> see<00:01:52.620> it's<00:01:52.770> very

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
properly as you can see it's very

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.430 
properly as you can see it's very
streaky<00:01:53.370> it<00:01:53.820> doesn't<00:01:54.270> seem<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.290> to

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
streaky it doesn't seem to want to

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.860 
streaky it doesn't seem to want to
really<00:01:57.590> cover<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.800> nicely<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.580> I'm<00:02:00.570> pretty

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
really cover it nicely so I'm pretty

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.300

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.170 

okay<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.520> I've<00:02:42.520> been<00:02:42.670> sitting<00:02:42.910> here<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.150> a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
okay so I've been sitting here for a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.330 
okay so I've been sitting here for a
couple<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.420> minutes<00:02:43.690> now<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.320> is<00:02:44.590> starting

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
couple of minutes now and it is starting

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.060 
couple of minutes now and it is starting
to<00:02:45.580> dry<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.510> has<00:02:47.410> made<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.010> difference<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:49.020> apply

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
to dry it has made a difference to apply

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.710 
to dry it has made a difference to apply
the<00:02:51.070> crackle<00:02:51.550> when<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.060> nail<00:02:52.210> polish<00:02:52.570> is

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the crackle when the nail polish is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.490 
the crackle when the nail polish is
still<00:02:53.310> relatively<00:02:54.310> wet<00:02:54.960> now<00:02:55.960> I<00:02:55.990> certainly

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
still relatively wet now I certainly

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.270 
still relatively wet now I certainly
didn't<00:02:56.770> leave<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.070> for<00:02:57.220> 60<00:02:57.610> seconds<00:02:59.040> before<00:03:00.040> I

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
didn't leave it for 60 seconds before I

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.520 
didn't leave it for 60 seconds before I
applied<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.940> crackle<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:04.110> I'm<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.350> going<00:03:05.470> to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
applied the crackle so I'm just going to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.530 
applied the crackle so I'm just going to

i'm not sure if you can actually see

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.720 
i'm not sure if you can actually see
that<00:03:21.670> it's<00:03:21.850> crackled<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.280> get<00:03:24.550> right

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
that it's crackled I if I get right

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.820

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
close up to it I can see that it has

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.770 
close up to it I can see that it has
tried<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.550> crackle<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.209> certainly<00:03:28.420> hasn't

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
tried to crackle and it certainly hasn't

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.890 
tried to crackle and it certainly hasn't
just<00:03:29.170> separated<00:03:29.740> like<00:03:29.860> water<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.370> oil<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:31.750> it

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
just separated like water to oil like it

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.460

did<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.200> other<00:03:32.320> day<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:33.400> I'm<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:35.380> wondering

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
did the other day so I'm just wondering

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.360 
did the other day so I'm just wondering
maybe<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.910> case<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.980> can't<00:03:38.980> really

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
maybe it's a case of you can't really

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.900 
maybe it's a case of you can't really
apply<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:40.060> pink<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> black<00:03:41.890> background<00:03:42.250> maybe

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
apply a pink to a black background maybe

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.259 
apply a pink to a black background maybe
it's<00:03:43.180> just<00:03:43.300> not<00:03:43.739> suited<00:03:44.739> for<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.820> like<00:03:46.150> I

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
it's just not suited for that so like I

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.210 
it's just not suited for that so like I
said<00:03:46.330> I'm<00:03:46.690> going<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.380> go<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.860> I'm<00:03:48.040> going<00:03:48.190> to
