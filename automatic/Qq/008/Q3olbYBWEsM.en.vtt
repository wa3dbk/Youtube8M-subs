00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
more water and less oil that will also

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.830 
more water and less oil that will also
help<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.340> set<00:03:00.669> the<00:03:00.849> curls<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.599> great<00:03:01.810> a

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.249 
and of course with the curly fro you
lose<00:06:11.530> a<00:06:11.560> little<00:06:11.979> bit<00:06:12.129> of<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:13.030> curl<00:06:13.990> definition

lose a little bit of the curl definition
but<00:06:15.069> that's<00:06:15.280> okay<00:06:15.669> I<00:06:16.000> mean<00:06:16.569> we<00:06:16.810> can<00:06:17.020> expect<00:06:17.500> our

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
but that's okay I mean we can expect our

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.309 
but that's okay I mean we can expect our
hair<00:06:18.340> to<00:06:18.729> be<00:06:18.940> like<00:06:19.300> it<00:06:19.479> would<00:06:19.659> be<00:06:19.720> if<00:06:20.080> it<00:06:20.229> were

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
hair to be like it would be if it were

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.290 
hair to be like it would be if it were
one<00:06:20.500> hundred<00:06:20.620> percent<00:06:20.860> natural<00:06:21.340> that's<00:06:22.090> just

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
one hundred percent natural that's just

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.050 
one hundred percent natural that's just
not<00:06:22.449> going<00:06:22.569> to<00:06:22.629> happen<00:06:22.720> because<00:06:23.699> it's<00:06:24.699> not<00:06:24.879> one

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
not going to happen because it's not one

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.360 
not going to happen because it's not one
other<00:06:25.210> person<00:06:25.330> natural<00:06:26.050> so<00:06:26.650> we<00:06:26.889> kind<00:06:27.099> of<00:06:27.190> have

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
other person natural so we kind of have

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.010 
other person natural so we kind of have
to<00:06:27.490> just<00:06:27.520> do<00:06:27.970> the<00:06:28.120> best<00:06:28.300> that<00:06:28.509> we<00:06:28.569> can<00:06:28.930> to<00:06:29.169> mimic

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
to just do the best that we can to mimic

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:49.119 
to just do the best that we can to mimic
to<00:06:32.020> mimic<00:06:32.319> the<00:06:32.470> style
