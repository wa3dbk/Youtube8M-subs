okay what about it being a false
negative<00:00:38.730> potentially<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:40.820> mean<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.030> an

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
negative potentially I mean there is an

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.910 
negative potentially I mean there is an
incubation<00:00:42.570> time<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.260> sometimes<00:00:43.649> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
incubation time then sometimes it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.830 
incubation time then sometimes it
doesn't<00:00:44.040> show<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.640> test<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> few<00:00:45.510> months

doesn't show up on test for a few months
but<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.350> still<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> chance<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.460> you're

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
but it's still the chance is what you're

no<00:00:56.309> no<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.059> what's<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
no no I think what's this you in the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.400 
no no I think what's this you in the
tester<00:00:58.350> right<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:59.160> right<00:00:59.309> now

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
tester right for right now

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.719 
tester right for right now
soon<00:01:01.280> you're<00:01:01.370> healthy<00:01:01.730> okay<00:01:02.180> put<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.170> my

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
soon you're healthy okay put a my

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.460 
soon you're healthy okay put a my
because<00:01:04.729> I'm<00:01:05.089> thinking<00:01:05.510> if<00:01:05.630> it's<00:01:05.780> not<00:01:05.960> HIV

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
because I'm thinking if it's not HIV

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.649 
because I'm thinking if it's not HIV
like<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:06.830> might<00:01:06.950> be<00:01:07.070> one<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.400> cancers

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.069 

how<00:01:11.409> many<00:01:11.590> symptoms<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.880> you<00:01:13.750> definitely

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
how many symptoms and you definitely

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.959 
how many symptoms and you definitely
don't<00:01:14.170> have<00:01:14.380> any<00:01:14.530> tumors<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.219> that's<00:01:15.880> a

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
don't have any tumors and that's a

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.029 
don't have any tumors and that's a
necessity<00:01:16.090> with<00:01:16.570> diagnosing<00:01:17.140> cancer<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.740> guess

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
necessity with diagnosing cancer I guess

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.090 
necessity with diagnosing cancer I guess
it<00:01:18.250> would<00:01:18.430> be<00:01:19.289> I'm<00:01:20.289> sorry<00:01:20.619> it's<00:01:20.799> just<00:01:20.950> like
