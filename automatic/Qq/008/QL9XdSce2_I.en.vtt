00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 and then people enrolled the channel of the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.910
 beauty designs good before start here 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.160
 video lesson written here on channel for 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.410
 to be inside all the news 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.269
 already enjoy the video too short 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.799
 our page in the face leave the link in the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.990
 good description come on 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.020
 in this video here I'm going to teach you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.490
 how to light a led lead to see 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.289
 lucio beauty 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.160
 until we have an environment not 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.429
 have sunlight from the lamp even the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.149
 entity will light well let's go there 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.390
 Here's a schematic. It 's an idea. Let's get it. 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 one leg of it binds positive 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:46.649
 his other leg we will connect one 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.170
 360 ons resistor to turn negative as well 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.160
 that in the middle of this amendment 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:59.489
 let's play on the contrary traffic base 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:04.860
 of pc 547 in the emitter of these transit 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.170
 Let's connect the negative on the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.439
 exist let's play base on another 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:17.240
 bring your pc 547 here also not 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.799
 condemn collector we'll still get a wire 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.799
 connects to a car receiver 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.200
 the other leg here of what's left of a 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:34.250
 car to stay positive on the bc emitter 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.509
 Let's call or negative 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.650
 his collector 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.939
 Let's connect to the negative of the led and the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.890
 another leg in led 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.720
 Let's attach a 360 resistor. 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:55.470
 bus another losing result here 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.469
 connected to the positive wire that is the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.640
 wine was positive here just for this 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:06.640
 sector by this dr 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.640
 positive from source six others 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.120
 the negative good here by the issuer 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.430
 transitions this exists or negative 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.830
 source is good to say that it goes 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.260
 do when there is no light in the environment 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.540
 this light is not getting here is not 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.320
 from dr 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.690
 the led more understand that this scheme 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.709
 here you can do many things 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.130
 you can connect a year do not have to light 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.390
 you connect a relay for example if it's you 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.840
 You can turn on a light bulb in your house. 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.350
 programmed 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.650
 the yoki has finished turning the light 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.459
 night will light up the lamp a fight 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.840
 daily and there the mother there for you only 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.640
 For you, you never like another one. 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.290
 charge this business of playing make 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.239
 57 years is a good idea 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:06.500
 well let's go , here's our staff 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.720
 Our set is only this one. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.820
 part that looks right 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.049
 this part that is something else I'm 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.340
 making 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.340
 alright let's go 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.459
 this is a source that has six 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.750
 others 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:27.370
 I'll get here for you to observe. 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.370
 the camera closer to you watching 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:40.200
 my mother 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:43.290
 Grandpa Callos you may notice that the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:49.170
 LED will turn off or remove them slowly or 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:04:07.340
 will he understand with it is 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:04:09.870
 pays without lighting its lights with a 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.450
 good place of the day light you can if it were 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:19.370
 a blu ray film and relay pick up a relay 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:22.950
 my good talking to him the focus is r 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.790
 Fire clears beauty 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.990
 the video lets you write the channel 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:34.050
 will pair all the news 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:38.720
 suggestion of executives to be done 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:42.560
 the 26th meeting in the comments 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.560
 beauty was personal
