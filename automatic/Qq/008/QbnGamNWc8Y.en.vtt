00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.450
 Years but I think that's more of a sequel 'eclipse' with the way in 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.749
 the EU 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.960
 who is older than free stream than 70 to 100 millimeters 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.939
 why me 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.930
 So it's a betting tax objectively with 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.149
 Marko 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.490
 first to the box 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.640
 Here we see the same 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.540
 we have three years warranty 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.990
 then we have here 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.990
 while the dream lost it, she added chic information 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.100
 this will be 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.310
 4 percent a glass of Prokop Photo Magazine 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.210
 Doris rated as very good 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.440
 Of these, as the names have, it is not too 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.990
 they are not black at the beginning of 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.040
 four to five and six 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.840
 have daily here 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.320
 again information 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.190
 Think about it 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 Let's just do it 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.740
 gave the first time she had 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 once clarified 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.940
 in Bielefeld 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 in the NLA it was risky 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.460
 as well as here 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 a bustle Dom 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.320
 but we already have here 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.320
 the area is located 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.740
 Jan Eder contains sitting and that 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.440
 So far we have been lying 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.840
 Daniela back deep 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 At the beginning, her song sent Forint 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.260
 we will lead you with the energy in light 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.590
 as they look like this 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.130
 that's the advantage so you know about it and they recognize the Nordic 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.479
 Walker 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.459
 but off 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 then we have the area deep here 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.079
 publish for facticity 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.039
 teut 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.919
 Here we have it OK 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.859
 the name Siegmar the g 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.249
 with money for colleges like long south of Iceland has failed 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.139
 it was even more 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.139
 can someone give me a macro function - were affected 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.389
 Putting Colom 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.169
 and then we can 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.359
 Focus Log Better 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.839
 and here we see the magnification 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.989
 one to two 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.379
 but how should it have been to this video actually guilty 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.869
 if the publishing house GmbH is to be renamed comments 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.069
 I just think it's their train ticket times
