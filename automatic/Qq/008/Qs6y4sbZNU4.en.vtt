00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
a double oven when you need it so by

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.600 
a double oven when you need it so by
just<00:01:21.690> heating<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.500> upper<00:01:23.010> portion<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
just heating up the upper portion you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.830 
just heating up the upper portion you
know<00:01:23.730> for<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.000> things<00:01:24.300> that<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> would<00:01:24.690> cook

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
know for the things that you would cook

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.480 
know for the things that you would cook
on<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.050> normal<00:01:25.260> everyday<00:01:25.590> basis<00:01:26.160> like<00:01:26.310> let's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
on a normal everyday basis like let's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
on a normal everyday basis like let's
say<00:01:26.550> pizza<00:01:26.880> chicken<00:01:27.420> nuggets<00:01:27.840> things<00:01:28.020> like

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
say pizza chicken nuggets things like

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080 
say pizza chicken nuggets things like
that<00:01:28.350> instead<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.160> heating<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.580> that<00:01:29.730> filled

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that instead of heating up that filled

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
that instead of heating up that filled
5.9<00:01:30.780> cubic<00:01:31.170> foot<00:01:31.320> oven<00:01:31.590> capacity<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.460> heat

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
5.9 cubic foot oven capacity just heat

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.460 
5.9 cubic foot oven capacity just heat
up<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.880> upper<00:01:33.210> portion<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:34.050> you're<00:01:34.320> going

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
up this upper portion and you're going

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.810 
up this upper portion and you're going
to<00:01:34.560> save<00:01:34.770> approximately<00:01:34.950> thirty-five

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
to save approximately thirty-five

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.609 
to save approximately thirty-five
percent<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.450> energy<00:01:36.840> savings<00:01:36.869> instead<00:01:37.500> of

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
percent in energy savings instead of

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.820 
percent in energy savings instead of
thinking<00:01:37.800> of<00:01:37.920> an<00:01:38.100> entire<00:01:38.400> other<00:01:39.650> one<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
thinking of an entire other one of the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.830 
thinking of an entire other one of the
nice<00:01:41.010> things<00:01:41.040> too<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.970> dual<00:01:42.210> convection

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
nice things too is it is dual convection

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.060 
nice things too is it is dual convection
so<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.140> connection<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.710> upper

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
so you have connection in the upper

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
so you have connection in the upper
portion<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> lower<00:01:45.390> portion<00:01:45.690> as<00:01:45.990> well

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
portion and the lower portion as well

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.840 
portion and the lower portion as well
looking<00:01:46.710> through<00:01:46.740> different<00:01:47.070> items<00:01:47.460> with<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
looking through different items with the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.880 
looking through different items with the
so<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.479> could<00:01:48.660> do<00:01:48.810> two<00:01:49.110> different<00:01:49.290> items<00:01:49.740> at

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
so you could do two different items at

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.260 
so you could do two different items at
the<00:01:50.010> same<00:01:50.190> time<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.760> an<00:01:50.910> upper

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the same time you can do an upper

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.380 
the same time you can do an upper
portion<00:01:51.300> lower<00:01:52.170> portion<00:01:52.800> up<00:01:53.220> or<00:01:53.490> only<00:01:53.640> lower

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
portion lower portion up or only lower

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.990 
portion lower portion up or only lower
overall<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.990> well<00:01:55.170> absolutely

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
overall as well absolutely

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.960 
overall as well absolutely
and<00:01:57.180> also<00:01:57.900> with<00:01:58.830> induction<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.550> great<00:01:59.730> thing

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
and also with induction the great thing

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.990 
and also with induction the great thing
with<00:02:00.120> induction<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:01.610> induction<00:02:02.610> cooking

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
with induction is induction cooking

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.780 
with induction is induction cooking
allows<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.750> save<00:02:03.960> energy<00:02:04.260> and<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:05.250> also<00:02:05.460> is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
allows you to save energy and it also is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.790 
allows you to save energy and it also is
safer<00:02:06.150> because<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.810> cooktop<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.620> not

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
safer because your cooktop is not

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.620 
safer because your cooktop is not
actually<00:02:08.210> what's<00:02:09.210> heating<00:02:09.660> up<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:11.390> pots<00:02:12.390> and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
actually what's heating up the pots and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.320 
actually what's heating up the pots and
pans<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.740> it's<00:02:14.040> safer<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.610> doesn't<00:02:14.880> get<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.120> if

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
pans so it's safer it doesn't get up if

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.820 
pans so it's safer it doesn't get up if
you<00:02:15.450> something<00:02:15.780> spills<00:02:16.080> over<00:02:16.230> since<00:02:16.650> your

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
you something spills over since your

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.290 
you something spills over since your
cooktops<00:02:17.220> not<00:02:17.400> hot<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:17.880> not<00:02:18.060> going<00:02:18.180> to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
cooktops not hot it's not going to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.570 
cooktops not hot it's not going to
school<00:02:18.600> right<00:02:18.840> into<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.620> well<00:02:19.800> no<00:02:20.220> fear<00:02:20.430> of

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
school right into it as well no fear of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.030

can hit well or hit my is a simmer and
then<00:02:51.090> my<00:02:51.600> sent<00:02:51.840> temperature<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.290> once<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.590> hits

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
then my sent temperature so once it hits

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.949 
then my sent temperature so once it hits
that<00:02:52.980> boil<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.850> automatically<00:02:54.570> will<00:02:54.780> drop

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
that boil it automatically will drop

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.450 
that boil it automatically will drop
down
