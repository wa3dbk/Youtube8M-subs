00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
up against the wall it's going to work

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.150 
up against the wall it's going to work
very<00:02:07.240> well<00:02:07.300> I'm<00:02:08.759> pretty<00:02:09.759> positive<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:11.160> so

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
very well I'm pretty positive of that so

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.690 
very well I'm pretty positive of that so
yeah<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.060> next<00:02:13.090> time<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.510> see<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.780> it'll<00:02:14.050> be

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
yeah the next time you see it it'll be

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.060 
yeah the next time you see it it'll be
attached<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.970> wall<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.650> what<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
attached to the wall this is what the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.300 
attached to the wall this is what the
final<00:02:21.250> product<00:02:21.580> looks<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:24.100> it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
final product looks like I have it

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.610 
final product looks like I have it
anchored<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.120> wall<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.350> see<00:02:26.530> it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
anchored to the wall as you can see it

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.750 
anchored to the wall as you can see it
only<00:02:26.740> comes<00:02:27.100> out<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.610> think<00:02:28.450> four<00:02:28.930> inches<00:02:29.760> then

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
only comes out I think four inches then

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.760 
only comes out I think four inches then
