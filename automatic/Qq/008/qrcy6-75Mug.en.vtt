food coloring along with rubbing alcohol

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.120 
food coloring along with rubbing alcohol
and<00:00:22.610> this<00:00:23.240> new<00:00:23.450> way<00:00:23.660> uses<00:00:24.140> kool-aid<00:00:24.680> it's<00:00:24.980> just

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
and this new way uses kool-aid it's just

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.660 
and this new way uses kool-aid it's just
really<00:00:25.310> cool<00:00:25.700> it's<00:00:26.360> a<00:00:26.570> cool<00:00:26.780> project<00:00:27.020> to<00:00:27.350> do

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
sure what color that's going to make we

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.289 
sure what color that's going to make we
didn't<00:01:53.929> try<00:01:54.079> that<00:01:54.140> one<00:01:54.880> kind<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:55.939> hoping<00:01:56.119> it's

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
didn't try that one kind of hoping it's

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.179 
didn't try that one kind of hoping it's

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
and you're just going to put a little

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.160 
and you're just going to put a little
bit<00:02:10.759> in<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.150> dissolve<00:02:11.540> I'd<00:02:11.750> say<00:02:11.930> about<00:02:12.019> a

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
bit in to dissolve I'd say about a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.630 
bit in to dissolve I'd say about a
quarter<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.040> cup

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
quarter of a cup

quarter of a cup
of<00:02:14.290> very<00:02:15.290> hot<00:02:15.590> water<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.310> your<00:02:16.750> kool-aid

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
of very hot water so your kool-aid

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.140 
of very hot water so your kool-aid
dissolves<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.530> can<00:02:18.709> kind<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.069> see<00:02:19.760> just<00:02:19.940> just

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
dissolves you can kind of see just just

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.520 
dissolves you can kind of see just just
a<00:02:20.270> little<00:02:20.540> bit<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.750> may<00:02:20.870> not<00:02:21.020> think<00:02:21.050> oh<00:02:21.290> that's

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
a little bit you may not think oh that's

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.660 
a little bit you may not think oh that's
not<00:02:21.680> gonna<00:02:21.830> be<00:02:21.890> enough<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.190> color<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.520> rice

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
not gonna be enough to color the rice

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.150 
not gonna be enough to color the rice
but<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:24.680> about<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.920> quarter<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.430> cup

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
but it is it's about a quarter of a cup

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.790 
but it is it's about a quarter of a cup
just<00:02:28.160> teach<00:02:28.910> more<00:02:29.209> here<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:30.350> want<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.590> stir<00:02:30.740> it

kool-aid<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.660> bag<00:03:15.130> then<00:03:16.130> you're<00:03:16.280> just

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
kool-aid in the bag then you're just

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.949 
kool-aid in the bag then you're just
going<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.610> mush<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:17.000> around<00:03:17.060> until<00:03:17.540> it's<00:03:17.810> all

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
going to mush it around until it's all

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.259 
going to mush it around until it's all
mixed<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.920> you'll<00:03:19.400> see<00:03:19.579> how<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.700> happens

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
mixed and you'll see how that happens

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.569 
mixed and you'll see how that happens
in<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.200> your<00:03:21.500> white<00:03:21.709> rice<00:03:21.980> will<00:03:22.250> be<00:03:22.280> wet

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
in here and your white rice will be wet

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.039 
in here and your white rice will be wet
after<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:23.239> so<00:03:23.540> you're<00:03:23.660> going<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:23.930> to

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
after this so you're going to have to

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.640 
after this so you're going to have to
let<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.260> dry<00:03:24.730> one<00:03:25.730> thing<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.030> we<00:03:26.120> did<00:03:26.650> was

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
let it dry one thing that we did was

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.160 
let it dry one thing that we did was
that<00:03:27.850> when<00:03:28.850> we<00:03:28.940> made<00:03:29.120> ours<00:03:29.329> at<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.870> training

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
that when we made ours at the training

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.130 
that when we made ours at the training
it<00:03:30.860> was<00:03:31.010> sunny<00:03:31.310> outside<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:32.420> we<00:03:32.570> set<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.900> trays

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
it was sunny outside so we set the trays

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.670 
it was sunny outside so we set the trays
outside<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.540> like<00:03:35.540> this<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:35.810> 20<00:03:35.959> minutes<00:03:36.470> the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
outside and like this in 20 minutes the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.580 
outside and like this in 20 minutes the
rice<00:03:36.799> was<00:03:37.010> already<00:03:37.340> dry<00:03:37.640> so<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:39.470> may<00:03:39.560> be

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
rice was already dry so that may be

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.930 
rice was already dry so that may be
something<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:39.950> want<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.130> consider<00:03:40.430> or<00:03:40.850> you

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
something you want to consider or you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.250 
something you want to consider or you
could<00:03:41.060> possibly<00:03:41.390> even<00:03:41.480> bake<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.900> on<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.140> oven

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
could possibly even bake it on the oven

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.990 
could possibly even bake it on the oven
maybe<00:03:42.620> at<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.799> low<00:03:42.980> setting<00:03:43.310> 300<00:03:44.500> for<00:03:45.640> 15<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.730> 20

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
maybe at a low setting 300 for 15 to 20
