00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
think all eyes I think 99.9 of the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.030 
think all eyes I think 99.9 of the
squatters<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.990> chosen<00:03:11.230> anyway<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:11.980> think

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
squatters is chosen anyway so I think

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.280 
squatters is chosen anyway so I think
the<00:03:12.310> big<00:03:12.490> thing<00:03:12.520> is

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
the big thing is

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.440 
the big thing is
is<00:03:13.379> for<00:03:13.620> bent<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.879> if<00:03:15.060> there's<00:03:15.269> another

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
is for bent and and if there's another

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.809 
is for bent and and if there's another
place<00:03:16.200> up<00:03:16.500> for<00:03:16.769> grabs<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.219> squad<00:03:17.489> which<00:03:17.670> is

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
place up for grabs in the squad which is

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.789 
place up for grabs in the squad which is
doubtful<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.810> it's<00:03:19.170> probably<00:03:19.379> going<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.739> be

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
doubtful and it's probably going to be

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.589 
doubtful and it's probably going to be
his<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.280> that's<00:03:20.879> what<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.090> think<00:03:21.390> there<00:03:21.540> will

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
his and that's what I think there will

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.599 
his and that's what I think there will
be<00:03:21.659> it<00:03:21.930> will<00:03:21.959> be<00:03:22.079> all<00:03:22.319> eyes<00:03:22.530> will<00:03:22.680> be<00:03:22.739> on<00:03:22.859> him

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609
