world I did I made a computer do that it
was<00:00:46.480> just<00:00:46.690> astonishing<00:00:46.930> learning<00:00:47.800> how<00:00:47.860> to

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
was just astonishing learning how to

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.890 
was just astonishing learning how to
program<00:00:48.100> didn't<00:00:48.400> start<00:00:48.640> off<00:00:48.730> as<00:00:48.790> wanting<00:00:49.690> to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
program didn't start off as wanting to

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.280

learn<00:00:50.680> all<00:00:50.920> of<00:00:51.070> computer<00:00:51.489> science<00:00:51.970> or<00:00:52.290> trying

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
learn all of computer science or trying

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.780 
learn all of computer science or trying

like<00:00:55.030> that<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.390> just<00:00:55.570> started<00:00:56.170> off<00:00:56.229> because<00:00:56.409> I

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
like that it just started off because I

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.500 
like that it just started off because I
wanted<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.830> do<00:00:56.949> this<00:00:57.610> one<00:00:57.879> simple<00:00:58.120> thing<00:00:58.390> I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
wanted to do this one simple thing I

wanted to do this one simple thing I
want<00:00:58.659> to<00:00:58.720> make<00:00:58.809> something<00:00:59.080> that<00:00:59.170> was<00:00:59.229> fun<00:00:59.470> for

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
myself and my sisters and I wrote this

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.229 
myself and my sisters and I wrote this
little<00:01:02.320> program<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:03.339> basically<00:01:03.790> just<00:01:04.030> add<00:01:04.210> a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
little program and basically just add a

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.550 
little program and basically just add a
little<00:01:04.540> bit<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.199> then<00:01:05.290> when<00:01:05.440> we<00:01:05.530> need

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
little bit to it and then when we need

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.110 
little bit to it and then when we need
to<00:01:05.740> learn<00:01:05.830> something<00:01:06.130> new<00:01:06.370> I<00:01:06.610> looked<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.060> up

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
to learn something new I looked it up

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.850 
to learn something new I looked it up
either<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.600> book<00:01:07.780> or<00:01:08.020> on<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.350> internet<00:01:08.470> had

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
either in a book or on the internet had

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.200 
either in a book or on the internet had
and<00:01:08.950> then<00:01:09.040> added<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.400> little<00:01:09.520> bit<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.850> it<00:01:09.880> it's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
and then added a little bit to it it's

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.910 
and then added a little bit to it it's
really<00:01:10.330> not<00:01:10.750> unlike<00:01:10.960> kind<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.590> playing<00:01:11.799> an

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
really not unlike kind of playing an

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.130 
really not unlike kind of playing an
instrument<00:01:12.280> or<00:01:12.430> something<00:01:12.580> or<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.960> know<00:01:14.020> or

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
playing a sport it starts out being very

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.649 
playing a sport it starts out being very
intimidating<00:01:18.759> but<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.270> kind<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.479> get<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
intimidating but you kind of get the

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.690 
intimidating but you kind of get the
hang<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:19.990> over<00:01:20.200> time<00:01:20.610> clothing<00:01:21.610> is

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
hang of it over time clothing is

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.420 
hang of it over time clothing is
something<00:01:22.000> that<00:01:22.299> can<00:01:22.479> be<00:01:22.600> learned<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.079> I<00:01:24.009> know

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
something that can be learned and I know

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.190 
something that can be learned and I know
it<00:01:24.700> can<00:01:24.729> be<00:01:24.880> intimidating<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:25.990> lot<00:01:26.170> of

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
it can be intimidating and a lot of

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.459 
it can be intimidating and a lot of
things<00:01:26.530> are<00:01:26.740> intimidating<00:01:27.460> but<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:29.320> know

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
things are intimidating but you know

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.289 
things are intimidating but you know
what<00:01:29.890> isn't<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.520> lot<00:01:30.759> of<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.969> coding<00:01:31.210> that

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
what isn't a lot of the coding that

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.779 
what isn't a lot of the coding that
people<00:01:31.539> do<00:01:31.689> is<00:01:31.810> actually<00:01:31.990> fairly<00:01:32.320> simple<00:01:32.789> it's

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
people do is actually fairly simple it's

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.999 
people do is actually fairly simple it's
it's<00:01:34.719> more<00:01:34.990> about<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.380> process<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.829> breaking

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
it's more about the process of breaking

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.399 
it's more about the process of breaking
down<00:01:36.280> problems<00:01:36.909> then<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.810> know<00:01:38.140> sort<00:01:38.320> of

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
down problems then you know sort of

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.649 
down problems then you know sort of
coming<00:01:38.799> up<00:01:38.920> with<00:01:38.950> complicated<00:01:39.939> algorithms<00:01:40.479> as

people traditionally think about it you

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.950 
people traditionally think about it you
don't<00:01:45.460> have<00:01:45.609> to<00:01:45.820> be<00:01:45.909> a<00:01:45.939> genius<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.570> know<00:01:46.659> how<00:01:46.899> to

that's<00:01:51.670> about<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.119> should<00:01:52.630> probably<00:01:52.750> know
