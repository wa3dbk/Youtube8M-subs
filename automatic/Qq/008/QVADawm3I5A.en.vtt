this<00:00:20.830> collection<00:00:21.189> is<00:00:22.859> based<00:00:23.859> on<00:00:25.019> gravity

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
this collection is based on gravity

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.200 
this collection is based on gravity
when<00:00:27.429> I<00:00:27.460> say<00:00:27.759> gravity<00:00:28.449> what<00:00:28.990> I<00:00:29.019> mean<00:00:29.320> is<00:00:29.560> that

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
when I say gravity what I mean is that

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.460 
when I say gravity what I mean is that
the<00:00:31.210> collection<00:00:31.539> will<00:00:32.100> show<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.400> sense<00:00:33.880> of

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
the collection will show a sense of

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.960 
the collection will show a sense of
lightness<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:36.070> a<00:00:36.970> sense<00:00:37.720> of<00:00:38.700> almost<00:00:39.700> no

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
lightness and a sense of almost no

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.000 
lightness and a sense of almost no

the<00:00:45.670> head<00:00:45.910> what<00:00:46.780> I'm<00:00:46.960> inspired<00:00:47.470> to<00:00:47.590> design<00:00:48.010> his

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
the head what I'm inspired to design his

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.970 
the head what I'm inspired to design his
hair<00:00:48.490> that<00:00:48.520> looks<00:00:48.940> almost<00:00:49.450> that<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.350> kind<00:00:50.890> of

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
hair that looks almost that is kind of

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.430 
hair that looks almost that is kind of
underwater<00:00:51.490> but<00:00:52.450> they<00:00:52.600> are<00:00:52.660> not<00:00:52.840> really

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
underwater but they are not really

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.370 
underwater but they are not really
underwater<00:00:53.980> because<00:00:54.940> it's<00:00:55.270> about<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:56.260> know

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
underwater because it's about you know

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.260 
underwater because it's about you know
you're<00:00:56.590> creating<00:00:57.130> almost<00:00:57.430> like<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:58.030> piece<00:00:58.240> of

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
you're creating almost like a piece of

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.890 
you're creating almost like a piece of
art<00:00:58.630> and<00:00:59.020> it's<00:00:59.830> almost<00:00:59.980> like<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.400> drawing<00:01:01.030> this

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
art and it's almost like a drawing this

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.550 
art and it's almost like a drawing this
is<00:01:02.110> called<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.800> kinky<00:01:03.280> waves<00:01:03.550> kinky<00:01:04.539> is<00:01:04.780> asko

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
is called the kinky waves kinky is asko

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.899 
is called the kinky waves kinky is asko
asko<00:01:05.590> double<00:01:06.460> meaning

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
asko double meaning

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.270 
asko double meaning
that's<00:01:07.090> no<00:01:07.299> I<00:01:07.329> mean<00:01:07.719> kinky<00:01:08.380> asked<00:01:08.859> there<00:01:09.159> is<00:01:09.249> a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
that's no I mean kinky asked there is a

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.590 
that's no I mean kinky asked there is a
kink<00:01:09.759> in<00:01:09.969> the<00:01:10.119> hair

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
kink in the hair

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.980 
kink in the hair
it's<00:01:10.929> a<00:01:11.049> new<00:01:11.259> way<00:01:11.530> they<00:01:12.100> have<00:01:12.869> kind<00:01:13.869> of

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
it's a new way they have kind of

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.069 
it's a new way they have kind of
discovered<00:01:14.590> with<00:01:14.979> one<00:01:15.460> of<00:01:15.609> my<00:01:15.819> old<00:01:16.390> technical

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
discovered with one of my old technical

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.859 
discovered with one of my old technical
bamboo<00:01:17.560> technique<00:01:18.039> but<00:01:18.939> done<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:19.359> the<00:01:19.479> more<00:01:19.719> at

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
bamboo technique but done in the more at

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.870 
bamboo technique but done in the more at
the<00:01:19.990> total<00:01:20.350> way<00:01:20.530> which<00:01:20.979> he<00:01:21.130> looks<00:01:21.340> really<00:01:21.609> cool

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
the total way which he looks really cool

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.190 
the total way which he looks really cool
and<00:01:22.179> very<00:01:23.280> high<00:01:24.280> catching<00:01:24.789> you<00:01:25.390> know<00:01:25.569> but<00:01:26.109> in

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
and very high catching you know but in

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.380 
and very high catching you know but in
the<00:01:26.289> meantime<00:01:26.469> is<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.159> simple<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.909> I<00:01:28.179> love

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
the meantime is so simple and I love

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.440 
the meantime is so simple and I love
that<00:01:28.569> I<00:01:28.630> love<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.869> simplicity<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:30.450> combining

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
that I love the simplicity of combining

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.179 
that I love the simplicity of combining
something<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.960> is<00:01:32.049> very<00:01:32.289> classic<00:01:32.649> that

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
something that is very classic that

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.599 
something that is very classic that
bears<00:01:33.460> called<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.880> twist<00:01:34.689> really<00:01:35.189> yeah<00:01:36.249> again

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
bears called a twist really yeah again

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.550 
bears called a twist really yeah again
with<00:01:36.819> the<00:01:36.939> curl<00:01:37.149> see<00:01:37.539> you<00:01:38.380> have<00:01:38.530> different

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
with the curl see you have different

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.249 
with the curl see you have different
textures<00:01:39.340> for<00:01:39.939> example<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.509> way<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:41.109> achieve

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
textures for example the way you achieve

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.349 
textures for example the way you achieve
disparity<00:01:42.219> is<00:01:42.729> by<00:01:43.560> using<00:01:44.560> rollers<00:01:45.549> on<00:01:45.969> the

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
disparity is by using rollers on the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.959 
disparity is by using rollers on the
roots<00:01:46.539> and<00:01:46.929> then<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.799> just<00:01:48.069> back<00:01:48.459> home<00:01:48.729> the

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
roots and then you just back home the

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.959 
roots and then you just back home the
ends<00:01:49.740> become<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.920> ends<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.429> just<00:01:51.639> brush

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
ends become the ends and you just brush

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.059 
ends become the ends and you just brush
all<00:01:52.209> up<00:01:52.450> see<00:01:52.929> it's<00:01:53.079> quite<00:01:53.200> rough<00:01:53.469> on<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.920> age

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
all up see it's quite rough on the age

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.539 
all up see it's quite rough on the age
which<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.240> doesn't<00:01:55.569> make<00:01:55.719> it<00:01:55.929> so<00:01:56.200> waving<00:01:57.069> is<00:01:57.219> so

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
which it doesn't make it so waving is so

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.570 
which it doesn't make it so waving is so
romantic<00:01:57.789> you<00:01:58.299> know

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
romantic you know

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:07.240 
romantic you know
boring<00:02:04.510> in<00:02:05.510> this<00:02:05.690> case<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:06.260> call<00:02:06.650> it<00:02:06.770> salt<00:02:07.040> and

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
boring in this case I call it salt and

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.900 
boring in this case I call it salt and
pepper<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.180> is<00:02:11.180> just<00:02:11.690> like<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.020> little

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
pepper and so this is just like a little

pepper and so this is just like a little
policeman<00:02:13.910> kind<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.480> basketball<00:02:15.110> really

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
policeman kind of basketball really

classic they said no the Sassoon haircut
called<00:02:19.070> cadet<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.880> think<00:02:21.280> which<00:02:22.280> I've<00:02:22.520> always

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
called cadet I think which I've always

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.990 
called cadet I think which I've always
liked<00:02:23.300> but<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.960> rest<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:25.490> color<00:02:25.760> that

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
liked but the rest is the color that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.180 
liked but the rest is the color that
makes<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.450> case<00:02:27.200> there's<00:02:27.440> actually<00:02:27.920> three

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
makes it case there's actually three

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.100 
makes it case there's actually three
colors<00:02:28.610> in<00:02:28.760> there<00:02:28.970> there's<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.570> little<00:02:29.810> bit<00:02:29.930> of

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
colors in there there's a little bit of

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.340 
colors in there there's a little bit of
warmth<00:02:30.490> there<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.610> pure<00:02:31.970> white<00:02:32.210> also<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.230> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
warmth there is pure white also so the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.560 
warmth there is pure white also so the
hair<00:02:33.500> has<00:02:33.620> been<00:02:33.800> bleached<00:02:34.490> then<00:02:35.300> there<00:02:35.480> is

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
hair has been bleached then there is

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.950 
hair has been bleached then there is
some<00:02:35.810> black<00:02:36.130> some<00:02:37.130> brown<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.480> all<00:02:38.750> these

colors together he makes a really nice

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.240 
colors together he makes a really nice
salt<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.930> pepper<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.980> fascinating

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
salt and pepper it's a fascinating
