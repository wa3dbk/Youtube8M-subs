00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
have it a bit liquidy so I want to

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.649 
have it a bit liquidy so I want to
reduce<00:01:26.990> it<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:27.530> about<00:01:28.400> half<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:29.360> it's

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
reduce it to about half so that it's
