staying<00:00:09.469> in<00:00:09.769> this<00:00:09.889> light

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.720 

that's<00:00:13.380> what's<00:00:13.590> commonly<00:00:14.010> known<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.520> black

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
that's what's commonly known as black

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.580 
that's what's commonly known as black
ice<00:00:15.020> where<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.139> one's<00:00:16.320> actually<00:00:16.530> mush

black<00:00:18.830> ice<00:00:19.070> just<00:00:19.369> looks<00:00:19.550> like<00:00:25.480> black<00:00:26.480> ice<00:00:26.660> is

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
black ice just looks like black ice is

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.109 
black ice just looks like black ice is
quite<00:00:27.020> a<00:00:27.140> phenomenon<00:00:27.739> the<00:00:28.699> worst<00:00:28.880> I've<00:00:29.090> seen

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
quite a phenomenon the worst I've seen

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.659 
quite a phenomenon the worst I've seen
it<00:00:29.539> was<00:00:29.840> a<00:00:29.900> couple<00:00:30.079> years<00:00:30.380> ago<00:00:30.529> it<00:00:31.250> was<00:00:31.369> really

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
it was a couple years ago it was really

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.850 
it was a couple years ago it was really
cold<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.119> dryish<00:00:32.660> like<00:00:32.989> this<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:33.620> they<00:00:33.829> just

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
cold and dryish like this and they just

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.280 
cold and dryish like this and they just
started<00:00:34.489> drizzling<00:00:34.910> with<00:00:35.330> rain<00:00:35.570> ever<00:00:35.960> so

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
started drizzling with rain ever so

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.390 
started drizzling with rain ever so
lightly<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:36.860> then<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.670> rain<00:00:37.850> stopped<00:00:38.360> and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
lightly and then the rain stopped and

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.890 
lightly and then the rain stopped and
outside<00:00:40.400> my<00:00:40.610> house<00:00:40.850> it<00:00:41.210> looked<00:00:41.420> like<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.720> road

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
outside my house it looked like the road

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.520 
outside my house it looked like the road
was<00:00:42.079> wet<00:00:42.110> but<00:00:42.589> it<00:00:42.680> was<00:00:42.800> actually<00:00:43.040> sheet<00:00:43.610> ice

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
was wet but it was actually sheet ice

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.350 
was wet but it was actually sheet ice
and<00:00:45.530> that's<00:00:45.739> what<00:00:45.920> black<00:00:46.100> ice<00:00:46.339> is<00:00:46.670> what<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:47.239> was

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
and that's what black ice is what I was

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.420 
and that's what black ice is what I was
looking<00:00:47.420> at<00:00:47.750> earlier<00:00:47.780> on<00:00:48.079> wasn't<00:00:48.710> technically

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
looking at earlier on wasn't technically

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.969 
looking at earlier on wasn't technically
black<00:00:49.699> ice<00:00:49.879> it<00:00:50.150> was<00:00:50.239> just<00:00:50.480> mush<00:00:50.809> where<00:00:51.769> there

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
black ice it was just mush where there

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.490 
black ice it was just mush where there
was<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.100> puddle<00:00:52.339> from<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.790> rain<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.269> then<00:00:54.260> cars

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
was a puddle from the rain and then cars

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.990 
was a puddle from the rain and then cars
have<00:00:54.680> driven<00:00:54.830> over<00:00:55.220> it<00:00:55.339> and<00:00:55.519> it's<00:00:55.640> made<00:00:55.850> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
have driven over it and it's made the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.570 
have driven over it and it's made the
rain<00:00:56.150> finer<00:00:56.540> or<00:00:56.869> the<00:00:57.110> water<00:00:57.320> finer<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.430> it's

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
rain finer or the water finer and it's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.359 
rain finer or the water finer and it's
turned<00:00:58.790> to<00:00:58.850> ice<00:00:59.769> so<00:01:00.769> this<00:01:00.920> is<00:01:01.040> something<00:01:01.250> you

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
turned to ice so this is something you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.820 
turned to ice so this is something you
need<00:01:01.519> to<00:01:01.580> watch<00:01:01.790> out<00:01:02.059> for<00:01:02.379> there's<00:01:03.379> not<00:01:03.530> a<00:01:03.559> lot

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
need to watch out for there's not a lot

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.530 
need to watch out for there's not a lot
you<00:01:03.860> can<00:01:04.159> do<00:01:04.280> if<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:04.489> do<00:01:04.670> find<00:01:04.939> yourself<00:01:05.119> on

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
you can do if you do find yourself on

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.560 
you can do if you do find yourself on
black<00:01:05.750> ice<00:01:06.189> rule<00:01:07.189> number<00:01:07.369> one<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:07.850> do<00:01:08.030> not<00:01:08.180> use

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
black ice rule number one is do not use

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.800 
black ice rule number one is do not use
your<00:01:08.840> front<00:01:09.110> brake<00:01:10.090> if<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.240> have<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.600> slow

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
your front brake if you have to slow

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.649 
your front brake if you have to slow
down<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.500> steadily<00:01:13.130> easy<00:01:13.549> throttle<00:01:14.299> closed

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
down you steadily easy throttle closed

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.370 
down you steadily easy throttle closed
with<00:01:15.320> your<00:01:15.470> clutch<00:01:15.650> still<00:01:16.009> out<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:17.390> use<00:01:18.170> your

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
with your clutch still out and use your

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:27.570 
with your clutch still out and use your

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.700 

the<00:01:27.670> reason<00:01:28.000> for<00:01:28.150> that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
the reason for that

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.500 
the reason for that
is<00:01:30.159> Russia<00:01:30.400> breaking<00:01:31.030> with<00:01:31.180> your<00:01:31.299> culture

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
is Russia breaking with your culture

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.930 
is Russia breaking with your culture
your<00:01:32.470> engine<00:01:32.860> is<00:01:32.979> forcing<00:01:33.460> your<00:01:33.580> back<00:01:33.729> wheel

your engine is forcing your back wheel

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.609 
your engine is forcing your back wheel
to<00:01:34.119> keep<00:01:34.270> turning

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619

as long as you don't put your brake on
too<00:01:40.290> heavily<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.950> you're<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.820> quantum

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
too heavily and you're in quantum

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
using your battery I did this a few

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.910 
using your battery I did this a few
years<00:02:04.770> ago<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.810> was<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:06.930> bike<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.410> a<00:02:07.440> pupil

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
years ago I was on a bike with a pupil

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.520 
years ago I was on a bike with a pupil
didn't<00:02:08.550> realize<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:09.090> course<00:02:09.330> until<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.320> time

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
didn't realize of course until the time

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.160 
didn't realize of course until the time
it<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:10.890> actually<00:02:11.010> black<00:02:11.370> ice<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:12.720> people

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
it was actually black ice the people

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.810 
it was actually black ice the people
