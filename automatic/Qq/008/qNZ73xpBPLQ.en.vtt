that the Sony users guide discourages
you<00:02:45.489> from<00:02:45.819> installing<00:02:46.690> your<00:02:46.930> own<00:02:46.989> Ram<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.790> I

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
you from installing your own Ram so I

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.490 
you from installing your own Ram so I
thought<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.269> might<00:02:49.329> help<00:02:49.810> clear<00:02:50.230> up<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
thought this might help clear up the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.160 
thought this might help clear up the
mystery<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:51.420> you'll<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.600> what<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.930> getting
