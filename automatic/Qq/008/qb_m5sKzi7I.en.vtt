you<00:05:13.530> to<00:05:13.590> cut<00:05:13.860> out<00:05:13.890> your<00:05:14.010> carbs<00:05:14.520> 100%<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.750> go

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
you to cut out your carbs 100% and go

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.780 
you to cut out your carbs 100% and go
Atkins<00:05:16.440> diet<00:05:16.500> because<00:05:17.130> that's<00:05:17.340> not<00:05:17.580> going<00:05:17.730> to

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
Atkins diet because that's not going to

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.180 
Atkins diet because that's not going to
work<00:05:17.850> what<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.930> want<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.170> focus<00:05:19.350> on<00:05:19.620> doing<00:05:19.800> is

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
work what you want to focus on doing is

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.050 
work what you want to focus on doing is
doing<00:05:20.730> three<00:05:21.120> days<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.810> low<00:05:22.380> carbs<00:05:23.010> mixed<00:05:23.940> with

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
doing three days of low carbs mixed with

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.940 
doing three days of low carbs mixed with
one<00:05:24.330> day<00:05:24.540> of<00:05:24.660> high<00:05:24.900> carbs<00:05:25.410> all<00:05:25.590> right

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
one day of high carbs all right

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.700 
one day of high carbs all right
so<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.820> low<00:05:27.120> carb<00:05:27.480> day<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:28.290> going<00:05:28.500> to<00:05:28.560> be

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
so a low carb day is going to be

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.460 
so a low carb day is going to be
something<00:05:28.950> around<00:05:29.300> 150<00:05:30.300> grams<00:05:30.660> of<00:05:31.020> total

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
something around 150 grams of total

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.390 
something around 150 grams of total
carbs<00:05:31.890> or<00:05:32.070> less<00:05:32.930> depending<00:05:33.930> on<00:05:34.080> how<00:05:34.290> high<00:05:35.190> your

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
carbs or less depending on how high your

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.430 
carbs or less depending on how high your
body<00:05:35.610> fat<00:05:35.910> percentage<00:05:36.390> is<00:05:36.510> so<00:05:36.780> if<00:05:36.990> your<00:05:37.170> lower

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
body fat percentage is so if your lower

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.890 
body fat percentage is so if your lower
body<00:05:38.250> fat<00:05:38.640> and<00:05:39.030> don't<00:05:39.240> have<00:05:39.390> as<00:05:39.510> much<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.840> lose

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
body fat and don't have as much to lose

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.680 
body fat and don't have as much to lose
you<00:05:40.230> can<00:05:40.320> kind<00:05:40.590> of<00:05:40.620> stick<00:05:40.860> around<00:05:41.390> 150<00:05:42.390> grams

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
you can kind of stick around 150 grams

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.290 
you can kind of stick around 150 grams
of<00:05:42.900> carbs<00:05:43.290> a<00:05:43.410> day<00:05:43.670> whereas<00:05:44.670> if<00:05:44.880> you're<00:05:45.030> higher

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
of carbs a day whereas if you're higher

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.000 
of carbs a day whereas if you're higher
on<00:05:45.630> that<00:05:45.660> scale<00:05:46.140> you're<00:05:46.410> gonna<00:05:46.500> want<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.860> go<00:05:46.980> a

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
on that scale you're gonna want to go a

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.090 
on that scale you're gonna want to go a
lot<00:05:47.280> lower<00:05:47.900> probably<00:05:48.900> under<00:05:49.200> 100<00:05:49.590> grams<00:05:49.890> of

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
lot lower probably under 100 grams of

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.120 
lot lower probably under 100 grams of
carbs<00:05:50.550> total<00:05:51.030> for<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.390> day<00:05:51.600> and<00:05:52.050> focusing<00:05:53.040> on

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
carbs total for the day and focusing on

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.270 
carbs total for the day and focusing on
eating<00:05:53.430> more<00:05:53.820> just<00:05:54.090> lean<00:05:54.330> proteins<00:05:55.280> mixed

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
eating more just lean proteins mixed

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.300 
eating more just lean proteins mixed

greens different things like that and

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.550 
greens different things like that and
you<00:05:59.310> know<00:05:59.430> healthy<00:05:59.850> fats<00:06:00.120> for<00:06:00.690> those<00:06:00.840> low<00:06:01.260> carb

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
you know healthy fats for those low carb

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.190 
you know healthy fats for those low carb
days<00:06:01.800> then<00:06:02.370> on<00:06:02.490> your<00:06:02.640> high<00:06:02.820> carb<00:06:03.180> days<00:06:03.420> you're

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
days then on your high carb days you're

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.680 
days then on your high carb days you're
gonna<00:06:04.290> lower<00:06:04.620> your<00:06:04.920> fat<00:06:05.250> intake<00:06:05.730> and<00:06:06.090> you'll

gonna lower your fat intake and you'll

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.870 
gonna lower your fat intake and you'll
increase<00:06:07.140> your<00:06:07.290> carb<00:06:07.740> intake<00:06:07.890> so<00:06:08.460> you're<00:06:08.640> good

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
high card day you want to try to make

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.670 
high card day you want to try to make
this<00:06:34.430> on<00:06:34.730> a<00:06:34.790> day<00:06:35.210> where<00:06:35.840> you're<00:06:35.990> training<00:06:36.350> hard

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
this on a day where you're training hard

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.010 
this on a day where you're training hard
all<00:06:37.040> right<00:06:37.190> so<00:06:37.340> a<00:06:37.370> lot<00:06:37.730> of<00:06:37.880> activity<00:06:38.450> you're

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
all right so a lot of activity you're

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.570 
all right so a lot of activity you're
really<00:06:39.290> active<00:06:39.740> so<00:06:39.890> you're<00:06:40.010> gonna<00:06:40.100> burn<00:06:40.400> in

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
really active so you're gonna burn in

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.490 
really active so you're gonna burn in
those<00:06:40.700> carbs<00:06:41.150> and<00:06:41.300> use<00:06:41.420> them<00:06:41.630> using<00:06:42.260> them<00:06:42.350> as

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
those carbs and use them using them as

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.340 
those carbs and use them using them as
energy<00:06:43.070> all<00:06:43.340> right<00:06:43.550> so<00:06:44.360> your<00:06:44.750> high<00:06:44.900> carb<00:06:45.170> day

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
energy all right so your high carb day

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.020 
energy all right so your high carb day
they're<00:06:45.560> going<00:06:45.650> to<00:06:45.710> be<00:06:45.830> probably<00:06:46.400> around<00:06:46.550> 200

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
they're going to be probably around 200

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.740 
they're going to be probably around 200
and<00:06:47.570> 250<00:06:48.080> maybe<00:06:48.590> even<00:06:48.830> 300<00:06:49.070> grams<00:06:49.700> or<00:06:50.360> above

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
and 250 maybe even 300 grams or above

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.990 
and 250 maybe even 300 grams or above
just<00:06:51.500> for<00:06:51.650> that<00:06:51.740> one<00:06:51.920> day<00:06:51.980> be<00:06:52.460> kind<00:06:52.640> of<00:06:52.670> go<00:06:52.790> back

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
just for that one day be kind of go back

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.360 
just for that one day be kind of go back
on<00:06:53.210> your<00:06:53.330> low-carb<00:06:53.780> day<00:06:53.960> it's<00:06:54.920> very<00:06:55.130> critical

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
on your low-carb day it's very critical

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.160 
on your low-carb day it's very critical
that<00:06:55.610> you<00:06:55.790> do<00:06:55.940> that<00:06:56.120> but<00:06:56.300> just<00:06:56.360> some<00:06:56.660> basics

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.170 
that you do that but just some basics

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.350 
that you do that but just some basics
about<00:06:57.290> that<00:06:57.680> color<00:06:57.980> rotation<00:06:58.700> all<00:06:58.910> right

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
about that color rotation all right

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.060 
about that color rotation all right
so<00:06:59.810> that's<00:07:00.320> going<00:07:00.530> to<00:07:00.590> be<00:07:00.710> something<00:07:00.950> that

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
so that's going to be something that
