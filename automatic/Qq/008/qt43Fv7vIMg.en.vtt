00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.610
 video this time I bring you a video 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.689
 guide on how to unlock the achievement 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.210
 I have a lot of memory that consists of 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:24.660
 find all memory cards 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.449
 that are 16 gb good then like 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.050
 we see already I have all the map open 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.370
 unlocked and totally good insurance 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.460
 not quite but secure in quotes 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.190
 I recommend you first activate all 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.790
 control towers of those towers 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.450
 to discover the map 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 and then 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.780
 and discover all the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.590
 that is, the area is safe and good 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.500
 as we see there is the card icon 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.050
 of memory and they will ask how 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.980
 you will get how we will have it and good here 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.380
 is in the legend 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.770
 that is the icon had appeared 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.100
 yes and well normally if we cross the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.300
 campaign and everything and so on will not come out 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.030
 what will we have to do to get 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.130
 that we see that icon and power 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.630
 find them more easily as well 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.439
 go to some of the bases that we have 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.320
 and go to this cabinet where everyone is 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.470
 and well let's go to the map section and 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 we will have to buy 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.090
 those who say objects all those who 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.610
 they say objects are worth 1500 or 500 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.160
 we'll have to buy them 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 all of them I recommend that you buy 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.250
 all the treasures and objects like this can 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.410
 have all the icons on the map and can 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.860
 unlock everything to have everything already 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.350
 for 100% of the game and good as 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.790
 we see here is the last one that makes me 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.060
 miss me 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.530
 we can see it in 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.530
 in the manual menu 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.950
 in progress or if not in cards 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.410
 memory as we see here start moving 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.410
 and I only need one that is the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.410
 number 15 all the others I already have them 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.180
 and usually they are inside 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.840
 the bases are enemies 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.510
 and well that's been all this is the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.290
 I have a lot of memory and I hope 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.569
