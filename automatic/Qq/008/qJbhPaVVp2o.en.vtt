What's up guys? Another episode of Ana Maria Brogui.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.300
Today we're going to prepare the traditional Brazilian caipirinha.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.480
But with a touch that's going to give that very special flavor, which is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.470
the touch of gold, my friends!

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.130
We're going to use gold, real gold, a golden sheet.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.800
Of course it's a very

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.050
thin sheet of gold, right over here, I can barely pick it up to show

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.870
you all.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.710
But look,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.929
it's gold, real gold that we're gonna use

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.140
in this recipe.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.200
And just why, Big Caio, are you gonna use gold? My friends, we're in this time of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.890
great sporting events.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.440
So what does an athlete actually seek? So what does an athletics competitor actually seek?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.719
What does the woman from gymnastics seek? That gymnast that,

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.610
man, flips around and does all of that why, why?   Because she wants the gold,

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.329
she wants to get the gold,

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.299
The effort, the gold... Man, gold makes everyone happy. Gold is what everybody wants, it's the goal,

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.109
everyone wants the gold, my friend.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.090
And today we're going to prepare a caipirinha with it.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.140
There are sports that people don't even realize their going for the gold when they play it,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.359
Badmilton, for example...Badminton...Badminton

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.900
I can't even say it right...Badminton

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.640
The guy want's the gold, everybody wants the gold, my friends!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.620
So today we're gonna mix a caipirinha with a golden sheet, let's do it!

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.140
So let's start our recipe, reminding you that every ingredient in this recipe is in the video description here on youtube, all right?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.170
Just check out this gold sheet, check it out! It's very sensitive, see?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.560
Can you all see this? Look how sensitive it is, it will get all stuck, and if you don't let it go correctly, it breaks in your fingers, see?

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.499
Since we're gonna use this sheet in many pieces, there's no problem, OK?

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:51.079
You can buy it in the Internet, it's easy, alright?

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.780
Let's do it. Look, we're gonna start off our caipirinha by cutting the lemon, which

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.510
is where the secret to every good caipirinha resides. Why? In addition to using a

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.630
premium quality cachaça, a tasty cachaça,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.209
try to slice the lemon and remove the core from it, OK?

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.909
I'm gonna show you.

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.680
Let me put the glass over here.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.319
Let's cut it here. First, one side of the lemon.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.079
Then we cut the other side. Let it be noted that there are many ways to prepare a caipirinha.

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.650
This is the one I really like to do, all right?

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.079
We're gonna split the lemon right in the middle,

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.210
and here's the big secret, see?

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.420
To make a good caipirinha, you have to remove this white core, understand?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.800
Because it's bitter, it's the part of the lemon that bitters the drink after you leave it for a while in the glass.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.640
Bu then again, the caipirinha isn't supposed to last too long, know what I'm saying?  So,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.729
take this little core out. Let's leave it here.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.800
Then, my friend, we just need to cut the little lemon slices.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.000
Let's cut several slices from this lemon here, let's do it.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.320
The measure I like to use is exactly this one: half a lemon per glass, you know? .

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.629
Next. Having in mind that this drink here, man,

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.059
when the games you went to watch are over, those awesome games...

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.010
And you watched your athlete take the gold...

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.699
You celebrate it with the gold caipirinha. You have a foreign friend in Brazil?

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.810
You just give him a gold caipirinha and see how big his eyes are gonna get, my friends...

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.410
So let's throw in all of this lemon we chopped, right? Here inside the glass.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.000
Not chopped, sliced, right Brazil? We made some little lemon slices.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.209
So what do we do now?

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.829
Let's add two tablespoons of sugar, see, two large spoons.

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.549
This spoon is a little small so we're gonna add a little more, some extra sugar.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.969
And now, my friends!

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.129
Now we mix all this lemon,

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.809
smash it with the sugar, let's do it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.600
After that, we put it over here.

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.070
And now were gonna put the ice, my friends!  Plenty of it, all right?

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.629
Ice is also a secret for a good caipirinha, OK? A lot of ice.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.049
Let's fill it up here to the top.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.120
Come, ice. Come, ice.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.849
A lot of ice, you see?

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.079
I filled it to the top.

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.139
So what do we do now?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.100
Let's pour our cachaça.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.400
Let's pour some high quality cachaça.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.640
Fill it up with premium cachaça.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.601
And what's next? We mix it all up. Let's grab a

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.199
little mixer and, look,

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.700
pick it up from the bottom up for the flavor to spread through the entire drink.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:42.379
And now, my friends, its time for our secret ingredient:

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.270
the gold sheet.  It practically shreds apart, look how it goes

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.840
It's very sensitive, you see? The gold sheet is very sensitive.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.120
And now we throw it all in here, see, because it's gonna shred to pieces when we mix it up, alright?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.400
So throw in the entire piece and, see, smash it like this,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.700
for it to shred into little pieces, mixing it here with the caipirinha,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.800
Look how beautiful it gets, my friends!

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.460
Just look at it

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.700
And here we have our gold caipirinha, I'm gonna show you

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.500
in detail, up close, how it turned out.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.139
And we've reached the end of another video, my friends, see how beautiful our caipirinha here turns out?

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.639
Fell the hype, look how cool the gold pieces are, see? There's gold in the mixer, gold everywhere.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.260
Now I'm gonna have to taste it, aren't I?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.380
Excuse me while I check if it is delicious.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.600
Hmm...

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.600
My friends, it's perfect.

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:03.509
Delicious.

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.910
My friends, if you make it for a foreign friend of yours that comes to Brazil,

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.309
He’s gonna love it. If you prepare them for your friends, show them off for your friends at home.

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:13.880
You're there having fun, or at a bar.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.180
Hey, Big Caio, we went to celebrate the gold at the bar.

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.920
Make one of these, bring it along to see how it's gonna go my friends

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.640
it is really cool

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.479
This is unbelievable.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.559
And there we have it! A big hug for everyone

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:37.830
