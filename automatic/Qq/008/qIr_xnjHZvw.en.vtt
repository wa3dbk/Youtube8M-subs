00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.100
 I 'm going to explain a song 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.730
 the concept of god in the Koran is 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.220
 not the same with the good bible all of 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.830
 following a few key points the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.329
 Quran shows us a god called 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.759
 One of the units is one like that here 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.579
 but the Bible gives us a god 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.640
 trinitarian the father the son and the 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.410
 holy spirit are a god at this level 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.390
 I'm going to go I'll clear up the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.950
 things you that the Qur'an has indicated 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.940
 uniterre and that the Bible presented us 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.580
 culturality why the trinitarian god 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.690
 because the god of the Bible say it 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.530
 that in the Bible has sought to come on 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.240
 earth then he is for coming to the rescue 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.510
 of man so what are they 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.800
 had to do 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.820
 he is the father the son and the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.000
 holy spirit so he does bring down his 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.180
 word his word that takes a form and 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.329
 hand and she was called stage jesus 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.750
 is over and she comes for redemption 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:20.740
 to remove sin from the man she 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.190
 comes to have it sacrificed instead 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.170
 of the man who must go to hell 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.290
 however, the world had to be 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.799
 always ruled that things 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.710
 so continue the father ena and the 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.680
 holy spirit and the spirit that was ko 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.170
 peace that has in jesus so it's normal 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.030
 that if god have to get back in shape 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.180
 Human is the land he must 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.860
 be in three elements of the agreement says 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.520
 elohim sylvie breuil who wants to do 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.880
 lie the gods so this concept is 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.939
 not in the quran the wearing of a does not have 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.220
 wanted and then in the quran the god who 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.850
 is in the Koran he is in the seventh 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.040
 7th heaven in the leathery and above the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.610
 seventh heaven and the city tells us about 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.140
 three eyes go next the god who is 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.599
 in the Qur'an he says what 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:22.120
 cool says roy to art on the radio at the 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:25.360
 haye myelin radio 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.430
 which has no child and does not have 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.440
 been born that's the god of the current 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.989
 now when you take a under the 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.860
 112th on a theme when you take the 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.590
 bible mathieu 3 verse 16 and 17 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.290
 he says what when Jesus comes out of the waters of 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.870
 baptism the holy spirit takes shape 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.120
 corporal of doves and comes on 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.720
 the island there is laughter he is healthy spirit 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.129
 there imaged and father declares in the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.010
 eyes that this one is my beloved son 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.290
 in whom I put all my affection 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.040
 we will say then that the god of the Bible 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.470
 has a son and that the current god has 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.920
 no son we can not concept 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.690
 is not the god of the city says I 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.640
 saves not grace and said this is not the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.739
 thanks that you are saved by the means 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.510
 of the time it is the gift of god 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.459
 it's not by the students so that 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.879
 no one and and glorify does not boast 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.370
 refugees from 8.9 so they say to be the 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:28.120
 greece suffers, however, the god of the Koran 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:32.680
 says a hammam in circles animals in ovo 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.349

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.780

 more than sin say it from the current says 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.010
 to do the yew and that of the bible 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.980
 tino les yves can not afford the

 and crucified and risen for Italy 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.799
 then the concept dj is not the same one 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.260
 can not reduce it 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.669
