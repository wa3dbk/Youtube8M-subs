00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.720
 Y 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.140
 good little girls is cooler productions 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.300
 you have this critical opinion I'm worth 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.669
 shit as you want to take 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.679
 long before my vice to the games 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.989
 as represented in the channel name 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.879
 what I have on youtube is new spiderman 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.559
 because my hero the boy was the man 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.690
 spider and now they say they're going to 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.000
 change actor and restart history 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.100
 I started to investigate how it seems they had 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.199
 producer problems with directors what 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.420
 which in the short time that they already had 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.670
 to present spiderman 4 and not 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.289
 they had enough time canceled 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.510
 the delivery of said film and 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.820
 they started again but with different 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.219
 actors and now yes based on the comic 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.140
 honestly for me that 's a shit 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.609
 because I cartridge from Chico Che 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.339
 that each of the comics and movies 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.500
 that came from my favorite character and it's 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.050
 shit because it 's a spider 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.210
 and got the power to jump very high 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.130
 doubly bear your weight 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.710
 extraordinary and being able to climb walls 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.930
 but you do not get the essentials of all 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.960
 spider the web tell me those are not 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.910
 chingaderas perhaps as a producer of 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.860
 Spiderman movie called if no 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.630
 take out the fucking shit was cobweb but 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.640
 good apart the suit just in 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.470
 comparisons I'll stick with the one before 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.660
 those who say that the new suit wins 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.400
 Swallow your shit just by looking at the suit 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.650
 black and the new one I stay with my 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.660
 spiderman from before although I'm nobody 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.090
 to criticize then I will go to see the movie 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.190
 to see if they leave something salvageable another 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.440
 thing they want to look like the comic but 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.720
 Like they end up shitting it's supposed to 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.030
 Mary Jane is redhead and now they put us 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.190
 a pretty pretty but blonde blonde and 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.289
 according to have a stable family when 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.210
 it's not like that in the comic and the lizard does not 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.490
 was his first opponent then first 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.440
 he knows bus no doubt the crap every 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.750
 more time but I 'll go see the movie 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.470
 and I will give my eyes good I leave you guys and 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.470
 behave badly
