00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hey sports friends i'm simon yours 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.250
 muscle maker I'll explain you today 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.350
 how lately shoulder my shoulders 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.910
 relative good progress 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.530
 As you may have seen, I have 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.320
 Now I think this year the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 height and descent had me very much 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.320
 but also well developed 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.160
 setbacks had my accident and such 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.720
 on and on 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.640
 Currently I am at the point where I am 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.140
 I say think my job makes me so 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.340
 small piece is far , I may indeed 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.250
 not allow it but that's easy 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.960
 so a line through that through the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.820
 progress through my great 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.929
 development and that's why I have to go now 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.340
 currently let's see that I 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.290
 training completely on the evening publishers 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.370
 it's dark and dark in the morning anyway 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.420
 I have your jeans for the last videos 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.440
 trained there I finally had that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.300
 need me skipped workout 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.079
 have no sports education and so on 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.550
 on and on 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.899
 back to the topic I'll show you now 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.090
 I want to train my shoulders one 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.590
 Exercise is especially important to me and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.180
 this is an exercise with the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.550
 you impress relatively few people 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.410
 because you can with relatively small 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 Weight training is all the advantage 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.440
 just that many of you too 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.610
 can make home act briefly with 2 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 it can be wonderful 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.750
 I'll just take it 17 5 that's it 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.660
 certainly too many for many 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.769
 and just show me the exercise I 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.360
 Stand upright 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.340
 next to the dumbbells the dumbbells 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.170
 first so in the front of my hip 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.760
 Position me correctly 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.830
 stretched back chest beautiful 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.600
 put out body tension straight in 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.150
 lower back is particularly important 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.689
 Just look child straight and now 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.689
 it starts already 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.860
 so I will not be able to speak anymore 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.400
 he finally got the sentence you have completely 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.050
 well seen 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.510
 I always have such a little moment 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.910
 Isometric hold this isometric 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.500
 Keep up here on the height 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.810
 that they are acting the dumbbells 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.650
 Your shoulders are about maximum 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.390
 at height from the chin 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.220
 they are wonderful and wonderful 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.530
 instrument just as well 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.360
 make sure that the weight is too 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.070
 can can dominate any time 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.690
 we also could accept the 25's high 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.870
 smash and if the again 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.560
 gravity yes from gravity 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.220
 release the just whiz down 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.900
 to let 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.940
 nothing would be gained so that increases 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 The risk of injury is wonderful 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.230
 just a little moment at height 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.420
 the shoulders maximum for the child 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.770
 to keep and especially important 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.000
 I hope it will be seen 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.460
 I have been moving throughout the whole 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.620
 featured exposed breast 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.670
 I 'm not getting any forward 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.470
 put and have to the rear 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.920
 but always swollen an upright 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.930
 attitude 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.390
 It is an exercise with the wonderful 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.860
 lateral shoulder muscles also the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.720
 Arm muscles over an isometric 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.610
 you can train stress 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.410
 always likes to split front middle 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.959
 back shoulder that's a complex one 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.550
 exercise aims basically to the mean 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.250
 shoulder off but also the front and 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.989
 rear is wonderfully claimed 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.020
 in any case one of my favorite 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.550
 Exercises There are beautiful cannonballs like 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.440
 the execution goes by and large 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.910
 I have shown you now how they are 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.530
 detail is what you pay attention to 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.850
 must be something very important almost 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.260
 avoid gives of course knowledge 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.459
 those who are in coaching with me 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
 I'll have it all over again 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.790
 but a bit more detailed explains that 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.170
 I have you basic now 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.670
 conveys everything clearly 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.080
 Incidentally, in the next video there are only 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.570
 a little survey I develop 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.920
 currently some prototypes in the area 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.420
 Here, too, my knowledge is training 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.680
 this is definitely going to be a prototype 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.510
 again quite interesting so training 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.400
 equipment how to develop what 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.709
 Everything goes wrong and what is going on 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.780
 Everything is wrong when comes rauskommt 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.190
 in my next videos we'll see each other 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.190
 many greetings at simon
