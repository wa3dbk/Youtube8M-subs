00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.080
 very good other kids I'm copper today 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:12.000
 I bring you guide of quality 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.520
 and good comes proceed with the guide 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.170
 our passive what it does is that in the 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.640
 moment we get 20 power points 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.279
 of skill kale attacks 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.599
 inflict 8% over that magical year 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.980
 increases by an additional 9 percent 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.950
 for every six points of power of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.480
 discipline skill of power you get 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.430
 every ten points of the year to attack 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.840
 additional and finish get 8% of 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.850
 chip solution what is increased 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.250
 1% every six points of attack damage 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.739
 as I have from then on what 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.019
 what it does is what forces us is to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.500
 buy ones a saber stir sticks 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.500
 OK 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.150
 let's go with the q the cun throws his bed to 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.180
 a target inflicts a certain damage 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.800
 which scale with power of skill damage 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.490
 magical 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.840
 A.M 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.510
 in such a way that it stays that way 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.840
 when the brand stays when it stays 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.060
 the mark on the goal in this way 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.060
 when we burst it, we recover energy 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.289
 the w of the lime and creates a field of 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.049
 invisibility in which you get 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.960
 armor and magic resistance and the 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.939
 enemies that pass over it 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.369
 they will see your movement speed 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.770
 reduced in such a way that we can 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.299
 kill more easily while to cali 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.299
 is this circle will be invisible 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.829
 the calyx era inflicts magical damage to 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.829
 enemies that you have around you 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.979
 It does a great damage and is very good for you 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.979
 insights 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.900
 our ultimate the r 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.230
 a cali moves among the shadows to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.540
 reach your goal in a range 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.970
 quite high where you can repeat 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.530
 every 24 seconds 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.200
 in which you can repeat that every 24 a 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.880
 4 seconds later we have three charges 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.420
 when we spend them we will have to 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.090
 wait each for each load 24 seconds 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.270
 to return to again be able to use 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.270
 the last 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.670
 the combo of the lime and there would be one for 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.640
 put the mark an ere to break it and 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.920
 do a lot of damage and once if the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.260
 target is still dead we will throw the w 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.260
 and we will kill him doing the same as 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.300
 the sequence of objects that we are going to 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.640
 follow consists we will start with a 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.280
 revolver x text from which we will derive to 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.260
 raise candle saber gun x text that we 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.840
 will provide 45 years of attack and 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.260
 65 of weakness plus life robbery and 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.390
 spell suction 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.629
 then our bill will be based on power 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.290
 of skill buying depends on 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.360
 our enemies a center a center of 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.340
 crystal and line that gives us life 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.370
 since a cali also needs a lot 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.549
 life and then this will come to us as 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.290
 new 2000 of life and then we 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.329
 we will charge a mortal war of rabah 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.519
 gift that will greatly increase the power 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:51.239
 of skill depends if our team 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.780
 is going better or worse if we go worse and not 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.310
 they have in their team many of that 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.840
 according to body they buy us 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.000
 we will buy an hourglass they are already 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.230
 after the hat that is going to 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.750
 provide armor 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.549
 and also time from skill we carry 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.109
 very well and we want to get rid of spurts 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.090
 we will buy a pincer from 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.670
 isner death that will be able to us 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.260
 provide 100% power time of 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.870
 skill and 15 percent reduction 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.850
 of braking the activity that has 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:23.039
 is this object is very powerful which 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.080
 causes 15 percent of maximum life 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.599
 of the target champion as magic damage and 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.099
 increases all the magic bath by 20% 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.080
 the subsequent magical damage suffered 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.530
 for four seconds imagine what 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.530
 what is this 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.889
 then if we're still unsatisfied we 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.470
 we will buy a leandro 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.490
 thus ending our departure and good 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.490
 trying to win 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.490
 the sequence of skills that 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.560
 we will use with the chalice it will be a 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.520
 predominance of ura de or lakua first 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.340
 levels 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.490
 so one of him on level 1 3 5 7 and 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.810
 9 after 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.810
 the degree of the lae will predominate 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.990
 and then the air that you like 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.260
 we will do at level 6 11 and 16 after 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.200
 finally another of we will do the w the 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.880
 masters that we will use with lime and 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.270
 consist of 21 points 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.550
 in attack and 9 in defense in such a way 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.310
 that we have as much resistance as a 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.639
 great attack damage and well this has been 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.229
 everything for today more guides like this await us 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.280
 I hope you like it and we'll see you in 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.280
 the next goodbye
