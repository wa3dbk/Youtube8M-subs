completely helpless so it is always

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.830

behind<00:01:59.100> cover<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.509> brings<00:02:00.719> us<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.079> our

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
behind cover and that brings us to our

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.190 
behind cover and that brings us to our
second<00:02:01.590> topic<00:02:01.880> moving<00:02:02.880> from<00:02:03.180> cover<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> cover

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.900 

now<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.259> use<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:08.530> cover<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.220> probably<00:02:09.580> the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
now the use of cover is probably the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.000 
now the use of cover is probably the

this more efficiently like I said in the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.030 
this more efficiently like I said in the
first<00:02:18.850> section<00:02:19.209> number<00:02:19.660> one<00:02:19.930> always<00:02:20.260> reload

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
first section number one always reload

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.270 
first section number one always reload
behind<00:02:21.459> cover<00:02:21.930> number<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.230> make<00:02:23.890> sure<00:02:24.100> when

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
behind cover number to make sure when

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.920 
behind cover number to make sure when
you're<00:02:24.370> moving<00:02:24.700> around<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.239> map<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.900> you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
you're moving around the map that you

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.770 
you're moving around the map that you
always<00:02:26.230> move<00:02:26.650> from<00:02:26.920> cover<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.370> cover<00:02:27.569> do<00:02:28.569> not

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
always move from cover to cover do not

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.540 
always move from cover to cover do not
be<00:02:28.989> running<00:02:29.319> out<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.739> open<00:02:29.890> because<00:02:30.250> that

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
be running out in the open because that

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.090 
be running out in the open because that
leaves<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.209> very<00:02:31.959> vulnerable<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.770> enemy

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
leaves you very vulnerable to the enemy

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.180 
leaves you very vulnerable to the enemy
players<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.760> number<00:02:34.750> three<00:02:35.260> make<00:02:35.830> sure<00:02:35.860> if

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
players and number three make sure if

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.460 
players and number three make sure if
you<00:02:36.310> are<00:02:36.430> firing<00:02:37.120> at<00:02:37.270> an<00:02:37.510> enemy<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.020> for<00:02:38.410> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
you are firing at an enemy that for the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.009 
you are firing at an enemy that for the
most<00:02:38.650> part<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.250> are<00:02:39.280> behind<00:02:39.760> cover<00:02:40.150> or<00:02:40.480> are

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
most part you are behind cover or are

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.930 
most part you are behind cover or are
close<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.530> covers<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.280> can<00:02:42.459> retreat

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
close to covers so that you can retreat

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.020 
close to covers so that you can retreat
think<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.959> cover<00:02:44.260> as<00:02:44.530> another<00:02:45.190> defender<00:02:45.790> let's

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
think of cover as another defender let's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.360 
think of cover as another defender let's
say<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:47.110> more<00:02:47.290> defenders<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.160> have

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
say and the more defenders that you have

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.060 
say and the more defenders that you have
blocking<00:02:49.269> your<00:02:49.420> angles<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:49.989> your<00:02:50.080> sides<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
blocking your angles and your sides the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.160 
blocking your angles and your sides the
better<00:02:51.280> offensive<00:02:52.000> player<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.750> can<00:02:52.959> be

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
better offensive player that you can be

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.810 
better offensive player that you can be
because<00:02:53.800> if<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:53.980> have<00:02:54.130> your<00:02:54.280> back<00:02:54.489> in<00:02:54.700> your

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
because if you have your back in your

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.790 
because if you have your back in your
sides<00:02:55.090> covered<00:02:55.480> then<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.290> really<00:02:56.500> focus

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
sides covered then you can really focus

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.680 
sides covered then you can really focus
on<00:02:57.100> what's<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.400> front<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.060> spot<00:02:58.510> and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
on what's in front of you and spot and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.460 
on what's in front of you and spot and
shoot<00:02:59.200> at<00:02:59.350> players<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.890> lot<00:02:59.920> more<00:03:00.459> efficiently

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
shoot at players a lot more efficiently

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.920 
shoot at players a lot more efficiently
another<00:03:02.470> key<00:03:03.010> advantage<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:03.850> if<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.390> know<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
another key advantage is if you know the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.500 
another key advantage is if you know the
maps<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.800> can<00:03:05.830> better<00:03:06.280> move<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.269> from

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
maps you can better move to and from

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.809 
maps you can better move to and from
cover<00:03:07.870> for<00:03:08.560> example<00:03:09.040> if<00:03:09.160> I'm<00:03:09.340> in<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.519> firefight

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
cover for example if I'm in a firefight

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.670 
cover for example if I'm in a firefight
with<00:03:10.269> somebody<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.660> front<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.019> me<00:03:11.110> but<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.590> know

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
with somebody in front of me but I know

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.009 
with somebody in front of me but I know
the<00:03:12.010> map<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.489> know<00:03:12.549> it's<00:03:12.790> behind<00:03:13.120> me<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.630> can

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
the map and I know it's behind me I can

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.560 
the map and I know it's behind me I can
be<00:03:14.049> focusing<00:03:14.739> on<00:03:14.829> fighting<00:03:15.220> him<00:03:15.519> but<00:03:16.000> still<00:03:16.360> be

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
be focusing on fighting him but still be

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.569 
be focusing on fighting him but still be
retreating<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.350> situation<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:18.160> can<00:03:18.340> get<00:03:18.459> away

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
retreating to a situation I can get away

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.759 
retreating to a situation I can get away

lot longer and if you know the map you

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.080 
lot longer and if you know the map you

about<00:06:09.530> using<00:06:09.680> their<00:06:10.220> secondary<00:06:10.640> weapon

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
about using their secondary weapon

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.640 
about using their secondary weapon
because<00:06:11.330> they<00:06:11.420> feel<00:06:11.660> it's<00:06:11.690> a<00:06:11.840> lot<00:06:11.990> weaker<00:06:12.290> than

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
because they feel it's a lot weaker than

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.410 
because they feel it's a lot weaker than
their<00:06:12.800> primary<00:06:13.340> weapon<00:06:13.700> and<00:06:13.880> they'd<00:06:14.210> rather

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
their primary weapon and they'd rather

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.450 
their primary weapon and they'd rather
try<00:06:14.720> to<00:06:14.780> reload<00:06:15.200> their<00:06:15.410> primary<00:06:15.890> weapon<00:06:16.250> and

try to reload their primary weapon and

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.570 
try to reload their primary weapon and
that<00:06:16.940> is<00:06:17.090> true<00:06:17.420> but<00:06:17.840> in<00:06:18.170> some<00:06:18.440> situations<00:06:19.160> the

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
that is true but in some situations the

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.320 
that is true but in some situations the
handgun<00:06:20.180> becomes<00:06:21.170> very<00:06:21.740> very<00:06:21.860> efficient<00:06:22.610> for
