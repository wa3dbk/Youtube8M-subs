all like 10 people at once it's awesome
and<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.410> lot<00:01:25.560> better<00:01:25.740> than<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
and I like it a lot better than a

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.430 
and I like it a lot better than a
sleeping<00:01:26.820> dog<00:01:26.940> think<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.330> hated<00:01:27.630> their<00:01:27.960> combat

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
sleeping dog think I hated their combat

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.990 
sleeping dog think I hated their combat
system<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.100> did<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.430> how<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.850> actually

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
system I did like how you can actually

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.200 
system I did like how you can actually
do<00:01:30.840> finishers<00:01:31.410> but<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:32.160> think<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.030> really

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
do finishers but I think it's really

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.210 
do finishers but I think it's really
just<00:01:33.690> repetitive<00:01:34.110> doing<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.680> stuff<00:01:34.979> but

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
just repetitive doing this stuff but

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
just repetitive doing this stuff but
hopefully<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.880> too<00:01:36.090> much<00:01:36.210> repetitiveness

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
hopefully is not too much repetitiveness

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:46.030 
hopefully is not too much repetitiveness
