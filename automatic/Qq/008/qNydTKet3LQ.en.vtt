 hi how are you in this video we are going to 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.220
 talk about pets I'll tell you a tip 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.730
 a homemade trick you can do to 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.980
 neutralize the bad smell of your dog or 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.780
 your cat because we already know that after 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.180
 It's been a week or two since the 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.910
 we have bathed because they have a smell not very 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.189
 nice dogs or cats but I 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.930
 I'll tell you that homemade crush trick 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.480
 that I do all the time for 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.369
 neutralize the smell of my dogs as 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.800
 you know I have three dogs although they are 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.500
 chiquititos are always a mess them 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.570
 like to walk in the garden on the street in 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.150
 the mud in the water and then more is 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.420
 impossible to be bathing the each 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.960
 week or every so often that's why 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 that I resort to doing this trick that 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.580
 It works wonderfully, let's prepare it 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.230
 and I tell you what we need and how 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.750
 we are going to use because what we are going to 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.550
 need is quite simple of course in 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.530
 This is not our dog which 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.750
 we need first of all that we are going to 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.970
 need a container with clean water 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.800
 at an ambient temperature that is not 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.760
 very cold for your dog and we are going to 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.860
 need 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.120
 the white vinegar this vinegar that 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.640
 we can find in any 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.980
 supermarket in the vinegars section or 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.800
 dressings for kitchen is the vinegar 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.050
 white is the same as that used for 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.120
 cleaning to clean the vegetables or 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.850
 for salads or even for cooking 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.340
 we will use that same vinegar and 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.570
 we are going to put a more amount or 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:33.620
 less to this nor too little either 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.560
 there is more or less and a rag or a 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.090
 towel whatever we are going to submerge it 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.640
 water with the vinegar that we have put there 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.940
 there it is since it is wet we are going to 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.030
 squeeze 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.080
 and we're just going to leave moisture that 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.510
 work as for 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.980
 to put it on our dog and what 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.660
 what are we going to do is this let's go up 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.330
 the fur of our body from our 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.250
 Our dog's hair forgiveness or body 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.030
 well complete from our dog's 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.340
 our cat completely all very well 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.280
 and we're going to do this as a bathroom guy 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.740
 but not so much so bathroom with 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.630
 this mixture of white vinegar and water 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.620
 completely 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.909
 you can squeeze a little more 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.349
 the towel so it is not so wet and 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.030
 we continue doing it for all the 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.069
 coat of your pet 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.240
 since you have done all this simply 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.459
 it's dry and you can finish 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.250
 spraying perfume for your pet that 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.260
 the more it looks the same that easy 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.630
 we can neutralize the odors of 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.900
 our pet and not have those dogs 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.819
