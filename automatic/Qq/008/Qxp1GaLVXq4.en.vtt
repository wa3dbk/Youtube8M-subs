it's called a coin star to do the coin
star<00:00:12.120> you're<00:00:12.269> going<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.480> need<00:00:12.599> four<00:00:12.870> chips<00:00:13.230> I

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
star you're going to need four chips I

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.379 
star you're going to need four chips I
would<00:00:13.769> highly<00:00:14.070> recommend<00:00:14.099> two<00:00:14.880> chips<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.269> one

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
would highly recommend two chips of one

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.880 
would highly recommend two chips of one
color<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.839> two<00:00:15.960> chips<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.320> another<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:16.770> you

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
color and two chips of another so you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.099 
color and two chips of another so you
can<00:00:17.070> keep<00:00:17.670> track<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.480> your<00:00:18.630> hand<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.930> what's

going on

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.500 
going on
I'd<00:00:20.340> also<00:00:20.490> consider<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.300> very

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
I'd also consider this to be a very

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.840 
I'd also consider this to be a very
difficult<00:00:21.689> move<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.580> grab<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
difficult move to do you can grab the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.970 
difficult move to do you can grab the
chips<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.359> from<00:00:24.570> opposite<00:00:25.050> ends<00:00:25.320> with

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
chips like this from opposite ends with

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.130 
chips like this from opposite ends with
the<00:00:26.099> middle<00:00:26.369> finger<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.789> thumb<00:00:27.119> you'll<00:00:28.019> hold

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the middle finger and thumb you'll hold

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.740 
the middle finger and thumb you'll hold
its<00:00:28.320> pretty<00:00:28.500> firmly<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:30.300> other<00:00:30.449> two<00:00:30.570> fingers

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
its pretty firmly the other two fingers

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.939 
its pretty firmly the other two fingers
are<00:00:30.929> gonna<00:00:30.990> trap<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.289> along<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> other<00:00:31.769> two

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
are gonna trap it along the other two

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.410 
are gonna trap it along the other two
sides<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.730> should<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.030> able<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> hold<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
sides they should be able to hold it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.250 
sides they should be able to hold it
independently<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.020> well<00:00:35.899> pretty<00:00:36.899> cool<00:00:37.110> around

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
independently as well pretty cool around

the<00:00:37.710> thumb<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> come<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the thumb is going to come up to the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.810 
the thumb is going to come up to the
side<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.690> try<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> remove<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.920> two<00:00:41.280> chips

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
side and try to remove just two chips

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.369 
side and try to remove just two chips
we're<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> pretty

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
we're going to do this in a pretty

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.029 
we're going to do this in a pretty
interesting<00:00:43.530> way<00:00:44.030> thumb<00:00:45.030> slides<00:00:45.329> forward<00:00:46.039> it

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
interesting way thumb slides forward it

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.560 
interesting way thumb slides forward it
overtakes<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.640> finger<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.510> finger

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
overtakes this finger this finger

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.229 
overtakes this finger this finger
releases<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> moment<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.000> take

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
releases for a moment so you can take

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.880 
releases for a moment so you can take
just<00:00:51.480> two<00:00:51.719> chips<00:00:52.050> you're<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.649> kind<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
just two chips you're just gonna kind of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.939 
just two chips you're just gonna kind of
do<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> edge<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.030> phone<00:00:54.949> slide

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
do this with the edge of the phone slide

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.680 
do this with the edge of the phone slide
that<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.550> underneath<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.239> finger<00:00:57.539> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that out for underneath this finger it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.920 
that out for underneath this finger it
takes<00:00:57.870> back<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> position<00:00:59.359> on<00:01:00.359> top<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.809> this

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
takes back to position on top of this

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.420 
takes back to position on top of this
chip<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.410> kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.859> triangle

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
chip so you have kind of like a triangle

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.810 
chip so you have kind of like a triangle
right<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> phone<00:01:05.100> continues<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> fine

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
right here the phone continues is fine

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.690 
right here the phone continues is fine
back<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.270> these<00:01:06.570> two<00:01:06.780> fingers<00:01:07.310> apply<00:01:08.310> equal

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
back as these two fingers apply equal

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.750 
back as these two fingers apply equal
pressure<00:01:08.729> across<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.540> middle<00:01:10.760> separating

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
pressure across the middle separating

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.570 
pressure across the middle separating
the<00:01:11.850> two<00:01:12.030> sets<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.689> chips<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.250> pinkie

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the two sets of chips and your pinkie

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
the two sets of chips and your pinkie
moves<00:01:14.760> into<00:01:14.970> position<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.960> overtake<00:01:16.290> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
moves into position to overtake this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410 
moves into position to overtake this
chip<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.130> these<00:01:17.970> two<00:01:18.210> fingers

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
chip so you have these two fingers

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.960 
chip so you have these two fingers
helping<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> support<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> front<00:01:19.500> chip<00:01:19.970> these

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
helping to support the front chip these

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.249 
helping to support the front chip these
two<00:01:21.150> fingers<00:01:21.330> helping<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.750> support<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> back

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
two fingers helping to support the back

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.710 
two fingers helping to support the back
chips<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.640> these<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:23.970> holding<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> back<00:01:24.509> two

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
chips and these two holding the back two

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.140 
chips and these two holding the back two
chips<00:01:24.990> now<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.310> point<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:26.820> things<00:01:27.030> are

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
chips now at this point two things are

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
chips now at this point two things are
gonna<00:01:27.210> happen<00:01:27.500> simultaneously<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.310> going

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
gonna happen simultaneously so I'm going

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.649 
gonna happen simultaneously so I'm going
to<00:01:29.490> remove<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> stacks<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> chips

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
to remove one of the stacks of chips

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.030 
to remove one of the stacks of chips
just<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> make<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.470> easier<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
just to make this easier for you to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.410 
just to make this easier for you to
follow<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.670> we'll<00:01:32.759> come<00:01:32.909> back<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
follow and we'll come back to it in a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.319 
follow and we'll come back to it in a
minute<00:01:34.400> these<00:01:35.400> front<00:01:35.700> two<00:01:35.759> chips<00:01:36.119> are<00:01:36.210> going

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
minute these front two chips are going

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.230 
minute these front two chips are going
to<00:01:36.390> separate<00:01:37.850> they're<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:39.000> separate

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to separate they're gonna separate

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.219 
to separate they're gonna separate
because<00:01:39.390> these<00:01:39.600> two<00:01:39.750> fingers<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:40.049> going<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
because these two fingers are going to

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.240 
because these two fingers are going to
move<00:01:40.380> apart<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.970> back<00:01:42.270> chip<00:01:43.100> because<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
move apart this back chip because of the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
move apart this back chip because of the
angle<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.759> finger<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.270> writing<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:45.990> on

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
angle of this finger is writing more on

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
angle of this finger is writing more on
this<00:01:46.350> finger<00:01:46.740> than<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> front<00:01:47.369> chip<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.729> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
this finger than the front chip is so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.280 
this finger than the front chip is so
when<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.750> separate<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.840> chip<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.140> gonna

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
when you separate this chip is gonna

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.760 
when you separate this chip is gonna
follow<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.750> don't<00:01:54.930> mind<00:01:55.110> try<00:01:55.560> just

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
follow so if you don't mind try just

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.670 
follow so if you don't mind try just
doing<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.100> part<00:01:57.320> we're<00:01:58.320> gonna<00:01:58.409> get<00:01:58.560> rid<00:01:58.649> of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
doing this part we're gonna get rid of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.289 
doing this part we're gonna get rid of
these<00:01:58.799> two<00:01:59.130> top<00:01:59.369> chips<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.060> make<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
these two top chips just to make it

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.350 
these two top chips just to make it
easier<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.750> moment<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:03.000> thumb<00:02:03.210> is

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
easier for the moment the thumb is

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.880 
easier for the moment the thumb is
actually<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.810> sneak<00:02:04.380> down<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
actually going to sneak down to the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.370 
actually going to sneak down to the
pinky<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.280> far<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.759> go<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.229> click<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
pinky as far as it can go and click the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.040 
pinky as far as it can go and click the
edge<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.250> back<00:02:08.489> chip<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.209> here

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
edge of this back chip right here

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.710 
edge of this back chip right here
with<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.830> edge<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.310> thumb<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.570> can

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
with the edge of your thumb and you can

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.010 
with the edge of your thumb and you can
pull<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:12.990> chip<00:02:13.230> free<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.840> now<00:02:15.960> the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
pull this chip free like this so now the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.330 
pull this chip free like this so now the
thumb<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.590> first<00:02:16.740> finger<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:17.190> this

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
thumb and the first finger have this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.760 
thumb and the first finger have this
chip<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:19.080> ring<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> pinky<00:02:19.500> have

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
chip and the ring and the pinky have

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.950 
chip and the ring and the pinky have
that<00:02:19.920> chip<00:02:20.100> completely<00:02:20.580> separate<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.840> these

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
that chip completely separate so these

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.620 
that chip completely separate so these
two<00:02:22.170> chips<00:02:22.470> are<00:02:22.680> gonna<00:02:22.770> be<00:02:22.950> moved<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.280> apart

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
two chips are gonna be moved and apart

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.840 
two chips are gonna be moved and apart
like<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.920> before<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.010> had<00:02:26.130> two<00:02:26.310> chips<00:02:26.550> here

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
like so before you had two chips here

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.270 
like so before you had two chips here
now<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.690> two<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.860> doing<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.190> all

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
now you have two here so doing it all

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.410 
now you have two here so doing it all
together<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:30.060> would<00:02:30.180> look<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.360> this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
together it would look like this

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.070 
together it would look like this
separate<00:02:33.420> them<00:02:33.510> getting<00:02:33.750> back<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.990> this

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
separate them getting back to this

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
separate them getting back to this
position<00:02:35.270> with<00:02:36.270> one<00:02:36.300> finger<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:36.840> top<00:02:36.900> two<00:02:37.770> here

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
position with one finger on top two here

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.850 
position with one finger on top two here
and<00:02:38.460> two<00:02:38.610> at<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.760> bottom<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.650> you're<00:02:40.770> gonna

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
and two at the bottom and you're gonna

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.280 
and two at the bottom and you're gonna
do<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.250> thumb<00:02:41.460> move<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:43.110> ready<00:02:43.200> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
do the thumb move and get ready to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.440 
do the thumb move and get ready to
separate<00:02:43.620> these<00:02:43.770> two<00:02:44.010> almost<00:02:44.450> simultaneously

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
separate these two almost simultaneously

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.360 
separate these two almost simultaneously
the<00:02:45.660> thumb<00:02:45.870> will<00:02:46.170> be<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.860> first<00:02:47.100> thing<00:02:47.280> to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
the thumb will be the first thing to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.440 
the thumb will be the first thing to
happen<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.760> thumb<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> come<00:02:48.300> down

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
happen the thumb is going to come down

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.570 
happen the thumb is going to come down
start<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.500> remove<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:49.890> chip<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.400> it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
start to remove this chip and as it

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.640 
start to remove this chip and as it
removes<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.690> top<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.230> middle<00:02:52.320> fingers

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
removes the top and the middle fingers

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.740 
removes the top and the middle fingers
go<00:02:52.770> apart<00:02:53.100> at<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> exact<00:02:53.490> same<00:02:53.700> time<00:02:53.970> once

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
go apart at the exact same time once

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.670 
go apart at the exact same time once
again<00:02:54.930> we'll<00:02:55.740> do<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.220> little<00:02:56.370> bit<00:02:56.520> slower

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
again we'll do this a little bit slower

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.610 
again we'll do this a little bit slower
pull<00:02:58.680> back<00:02:58.830> with<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.100> thumb<00:03:00.290> trap<00:03:01.290> all<00:03:01.500> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
pull back with the thumb trap all the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.280 
pull back with the thumb trap all the
chips<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.400> thumb<00:03:02.610> goes<00:03:02.820> down<00:03:03.090> these<00:03:03.690> two<00:03:03.960> slip

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
chips the thumb goes down these two slip

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.740 
chips the thumb goes down these two slip
apart<00:03:04.620> at<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.980> same<00:03:05.220> time<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:06.270> separate<00:03:06.600> all

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
apart at the same time to separate all

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.170 
apart at the same time to separate all
the<00:03:06.840> chips<00:03:07.490> this<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.700> what<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.940> would<00:03:09.030> look

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the chips this is what it would look

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.100 
the chips this is what it would look
like<00:03:09.240> Anna<00:03:09.690> more<00:03:09.900> normal<00:03:10.320> speed<00:03:11.750> one<00:03:12.750> more<00:03:12.930> tip

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
like Anna more normal speed one more tip

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.080 
like Anna more normal speed one more tip
on<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.320> butterfly<00:03:13.710> when<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.700> start<00:03:14.970> off

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
on the butterfly when you start off

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.370 
on the butterfly when you start off
there<00:03:15.240> is<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.360> fair<00:03:15.600> amount<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.870> pressure<00:03:16.110> but

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
there is a fair amount of pressure but

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.420 
there is a fair amount of pressure but
it<00:03:16.470> once<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.740> get<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.040> point<00:03:17.160> where<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
it once you get to the point where the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.370 
it once you get to the point where the
chips<00:03:17.610> are<00:03:17.730> separated<00:03:18.209> it's<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.930> very<00:03:19.140> very

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
chips are separated it's a very very

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.070 
chips are separated it's a very very
light<00:03:20.270> there's<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.330> couple<00:03:21.510> flourishes<00:03:21.959> I'd

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
light there's a couple flourishes I'd

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.890 
light there's a couple flourishes I'd
like<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.350> show<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.590> using<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.100> butterfly

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
like to show you using the butterfly

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.080 
like to show you using the butterfly
well<00:03:24.900> once<00:03:25.020> you<00:03:25.110> get<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.290> butterfly<00:03:25.650> down

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090
