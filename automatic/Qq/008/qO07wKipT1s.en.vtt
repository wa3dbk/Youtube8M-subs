without any further ado here's my
impression<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:38.469> reason<00:00:38.770> for<00:00:38.890> this<00:00:39.010> review<00:00:39.399> is

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
impression the reason for this review is

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.220 
impression the reason for this review is
that<00:00:39.820> I<00:00:40.000> wants<00:00:40.329> to<00:00:40.450> get<00:00:40.629> a<00:00:40.660> new<00:00:40.870> checkered

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
that I wants to get a new checkered

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.170 
that I wants to get a new checkered
screen<00:00:41.469> that<00:00:41.980> goes<00:00:42.160> with<00:00:42.340> my<00:00:42.460> old<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:42.879> all<00:00:43.090> the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
screen that goes with my old and all the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.380 
screen that goes with my old and all the
time<00:00:43.360> so<00:00:44.050> I<00:00:44.350> wanted<00:00:44.980> another<00:00:45.129> 24<00:00:45.820> inch<00:00:46.030> that's

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
time so I wanted another 24 inch that's

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.380 
time so I wanted another 24 inch that's
supported<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:46.960> 60<00:00:47.260> by<00:00:47.379> 10x<00:00:47.800> back<00:00:48.010> ratio<00:00:48.460> which

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
supported the 60 by 10x back ratio which

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.119 
supported the 60 by 10x back ratio which
ultimately<00:00:49.780> led<00:00:50.530> me<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.010> Dell<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.809> 24:15

fourth like I said previously the 60 by
10<00:01:23.289> aspect<00:01:23.709> ratio<00:01:24.069> it<00:01:24.310> just<00:01:24.849> gives<00:01:25.060> a<00:01:25.149> little

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
10 aspect ratio it just gives a little

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.089 
10 aspect ratio it just gives a little
bit<00:01:25.450> more<00:01:25.660> height<00:01:25.810> which<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.140> very<00:01:26.530> nice<00:01:26.740> when

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:27.099 
bit more height which is very nice when

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.100

editing so when about this monitor I

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.339 
editing so when about this monitor I
felt<00:01:34.149> like<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.509> was<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.750> right<00:01:34.899> choice

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:35.349 
felt like it was the right choice

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.380 
felt like it was the right choice
it<00:01:35.410> had<00:01:35.649> everything<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.099> I<00:01:36.340> needed<00:01:36.580> after

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
it had everything that I needed after

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.359 
it had everything that I needed after
installing<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.289> monitor<00:01:38.679> I<00:01:38.709> found<00:01:39.039> out<00:01:39.220> that

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
installing the monitor I found out that

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.389 
installing the monitor I found out that
one<00:01:39.849> major<00:01:40.030> downside<00:01:40.300> which<00:01:41.200> ultimately<00:01:41.619> made

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
one major downside which ultimately made

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.109 
one major downside which ultimately made
me<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.640> decide<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.090> return<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.509> monitor<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
me to decide to return the monitor the

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.169 
me to decide to return the monitor the
reason<00:01:46.390> for<00:01:46.539> this<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:47.530> Dell<00:01:47.739> you

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
reason for this is that the Dell you

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.029 
reason for this is that the Dell you
24:15<00:01:49.209> just<00:01:49.660> a<00:01:49.750> supporting<00:01:50.319> 16<00:01:50.709> by<00:01:50.830> 9<00:01:50.860> aspect

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
24:15 just a supporting 16 by 9 aspect

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.790 
24:15 just a supporting 16 by 9 aspect
ratio<00:01:51.569> what<00:01:52.569> this<00:01:52.720> means<00:01:52.959> is<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.140> when<00:01:53.770> you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
ratio what this means is that when you

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.529 
ratio what this means is that when you
hook<00:01:53.979> up<00:01:54.130> your<00:01:54.160> game<00:01:54.459> console<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:55.209> image<00:01:55.390> will

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
hook up your game console the image will

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.900 
hook up your game console the image will
get<00:01:55.690> stretched<00:01:55.989> to<00:01:56.140> 16<00:01:56.530> by<00:01:56.649> 10<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.550> everything

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
get stretched to 16 by 10 so everything

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.790 
get stretched to 16 by 10 so everything
looks<00:01:58.030> kind<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.450> weird<00:01:58.690> although<00:01:59.500> it's<00:01:59.649> not

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
looks kind of weird although it's not
