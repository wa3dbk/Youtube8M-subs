minutes following these wee little

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.320 
minutes following these wee little
reflectors<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.640> put<00:00:23.789> your<00:00:23.910> torch<00:00:24.150> at

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
reflectors you just put your torch at

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.179 
reflectors you just put your torch at
head<00:00:24.480> height<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:25.880> these<00:00:26.880> little<00:00:27.090> guys<00:00:27.210> you

actually<00:00:33.630> also<00:00:33.960> makes<00:00:34.410> them<00:00:34.590> reflect<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
actually also makes them reflect a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.459 
actually also makes them reflect a
little<00:00:36.260> that's<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.469> we're<00:00:37.590> looking<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:39.469> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
little that's what we're looking for and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
there's a bunch of them just on trees so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.639 
there's a bunch of them just on trees so
you<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.480> literally<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.200> showing<00:00:43.500> your

anything like this and you know the
winter<00:01:01.170> months<00:01:01.469> are<00:01:01.590> drawing<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:03.710> this

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710

winter nights are drawing in you know he
can<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.700> Dargis<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> minute<00:01:13.409> it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
can get Dargis of the minute it's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.289 
can get Dargis of the minute it's
getting<00:01:13.740> dark<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.159> half<00:01:14.610> past<00:01:14.850> 6:00<00:01:15.090> 7:00

drawing it can be gain dark at 4 p.m.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.870 
drawing it can be gain dark at 4 p.m.
and<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.159> there's<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.430> much<00:01:20.670> fun

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and you know there's not much fun

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.130 
and you know there's not much fun
cashing<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> dark<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:21.990> is

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
cashing in the dark well this is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.050 
cashing in the dark well this is
something<00:01:22.560> certainly<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.759> little<00:01:23.970> bit

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
something certainly a little bit

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.429 
something certainly a little bit
different<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.479> unique<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.080> thought<00:01:25.290> I'd

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
different and unique so I thought I'd

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
different and unique so I thought I'd
share<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.009> guys<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.540> we<00:01:27.540> keep

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
share it with you guys and we keep

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
share it with you guys and we keep
following<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> reflectors<00:01:28.880> until<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:29.970> come

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
following the reflectors until we come

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.620 
following the reflectors until we come
to<00:01:30.210> three<00:01:30.659> reflectors<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.380> row<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:33.030> then<00:01:33.600> we

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to three reflectors in a row and then we

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.999 
to three reflectors in a row and then we
know<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:33.960> found<00:01:34.140> Ground<00:01:34.439> Zero<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:34.860> look

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
know we found Ground Zero and we look

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.380 
know we found Ground Zero and we look
for<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> cache<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.670> I'll<00:01:35.880> check<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
for the cache so I'll check in with you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.010 
for the cache so I'll check in with you
guys<00:01:36.600> shortly

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.260 

so<00:01:46.020> we've<00:01:46.230> been<00:01:46.380> walking<00:01:46.560> for<00:01:47.010> approach<00:01:47.970> ten

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
so we've been walking for approach ten

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.660 
so we've been walking for approach ten
ten<00:01:48.900> minutes<00:01:49.140> now<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.830> is<00:01:50.010> a<00:01:50.040> fantastic

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
ten minutes now and this is a fantastic

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.200 
ten minutes now and this is a fantastic
idea

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
idea

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940 
idea
you<00:01:51.570> see<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.050> one<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> tree<00:01:52.680> there

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
you see the one on the tree there

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.640 
you see the one on the tree there
there's<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.370> tree<00:01:53.700> over<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.990> then

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
there's one tree over there and then

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.730 
there's one tree over there and then
even<00:01:56.040> further<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> distance<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.680> see

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
even further in the distance you can see

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.410 
even further in the distance you can see
another<00:01:59.220> one<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.730> camera<00:02:00.030> picks<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.360> up

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
another one it's camera picks them up

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660 
another one it's camera picks them up
quality<00:02:01.260> in<00:02:01.320> night<00:02:01.470> vision<00:02:01.590> mode<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.550> these

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
quality in night vision mode but these
