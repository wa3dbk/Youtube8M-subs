to replace this vacuum petcock while I'm
in<00:00:54.440> here<00:00:54.739> with<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:56.000> manual<00:00:56.360> petcock<00:00:57.129> so<00:00:58.129> it's

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
in here with a manual petcock so it's

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.280 
in here with a manual petcock so it's
just<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.670> switch<00:00:58.970> you<00:00:59.299> can<00:00:59.629> turn<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.900> fuel<00:01:00.049> on

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
just a switch you can turn the fuel on

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.460 
just a switch you can turn the fuel on
and<00:01:00.500> off<00:01:00.729> manually<00:01:01.960> instead<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.110> what<00:01:03.290> this

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
and off manually instead of what this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.100 
and off manually instead of what this
does<00:01:03.769> is<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.760> needs<00:01:04.940> a<00:01:05.059> vacuum<00:01:05.510> signal<00:01:05.780> from

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
does is it needs a vacuum signal from

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.960 
does is it needs a vacuum signal from
the<00:01:06.260> engine<00:01:06.680> it's<00:01:06.950> connected<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:07.490> your<00:01:07.640> intake

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
the engine it's connected to your intake

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.359 
the engine it's connected to your intake
manifold<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:08.780> it<00:01:09.380> will<00:01:09.470> only<00:01:09.590> supply<00:01:09.950> fuel

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
manifold and it will only supply fuel

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.030 
manifold and it will only supply fuel
when<00:01:10.610> there's<00:01:10.820> vacuum<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:12.590> that's<00:01:12.800> good<00:01:13.010> for

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
when there's vacuum so that's good for

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.210 
when there's vacuum so that's good for
safety<00:01:13.670> in<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.300> way<00:01:14.480> because<00:01:15.050> as<00:01:15.800> long<00:01:15.980> as<00:01:16.100> your

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
safety in a way because as long as your

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.680 
safety in a way because as long as your
whenever<00:01:16.400> your<00:01:16.700> engine<00:01:16.970> isn't<00:01:17.120> running<00:01:17.420> it's

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
whenever your engine isn't running it's

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.330 
whenever your engine isn't running it's
not<00:01:17.750> going<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.080> be<00:01:18.200> allowed<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.620> pump<00:01:18.800> any<00:01:18.980> fuel

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
not going to be allowed to pump any fuel

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.780 
not going to be allowed to pump any fuel
but<00:01:20.180> these<00:01:20.390> do<00:01:20.600> tend<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.930> go<00:01:21.080> bad<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.790> they're

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
but these do tend to go bad and they're

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.340 
but these do tend to go bad and they're
a<00:01:22.820> little<00:01:23.090> tougher<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.450> prime<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.900> carburetor

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
a little tougher to prime the carburetor

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.050 
a little tougher to prime the carburetor
if<00:01:24.590> you're<00:01:24.740> doing<00:01:24.950> jet<00:01:25.160> changes<00:01:25.640> or<00:01:25.790> on<00:01:25.970> your

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
if you're doing jet changes or on your

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.760 
if you're doing jet changes or on your
first<00:01:26.330> start<00:01:26.630> or<00:01:26.750> anything<00:01:26.900> like<00:01:27.140> that<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.410> just

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
first start or anything like that I just

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.620 
first start or anything like that I just
prefer<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.190> manual<00:01:28.610> up<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.480> can

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
prefer the manual up to you you can

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.540 
prefer the manual up to you you can
leave<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:30.140> place<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:31.250> I'm<00:01:31.370> going<00:01:31.490> to

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
decided that I go ahead and cut it off

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.589

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
and your manual petcock I like to put

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.270 
and your manual petcock I like to put
the<00:04:02.159> manual<00:04:02.489> shutoff<00:04:02.729> valve<00:04:03.180> first<00:04:04.280> just

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
the manual shutoff valve first just

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.009 
the manual shutoff valve first just
after<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.760> fuel<00:04:05.970> tank<00:04:06.269> that<00:04:06.389> way<00:04:06.629> if<00:04:06.750> I've<00:04:06.870> got

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
after the fuel tank that way if I've got

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.319 
after the fuel tank that way if I've got
to<00:04:07.109> change<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.470> fuel<00:04:07.680> filter<00:04:08.069> later<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.669> can

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
to change the fuel filter later I can

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.479 
to change the fuel filter later I can
just<00:04:09.599> shut<00:04:09.810> this<00:04:09.959> off<00:04:10.199> and<00:04:10.620> change<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.190> filter

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
just shut this off and change the filter

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.039 
just shut this off and change the filter
without<00:04:11.729> worrying<00:04:12.000> about<00:04:12.120> fuel<00:04:12.599> running<00:04:12.840> out

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
without worrying about fuel running out

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.619 
without worrying about fuel running out
or<00:04:13.169> having<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.409> clamp<00:04:13.620> off<00:04:13.829> any<00:04:14.040> lines<00:04:14.629> if

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
or having to clamp off any lines if

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:16.879 
or having to clamp off any lines if
you're<00:04:15.870> installing<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.349> manual<00:04:16.680> fuel

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
you're installing the manual fuel

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.180 
you're installing the manual fuel
shutoff<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:18.180> should<00:04:18.419> find<00:04:18.690> on<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.829> has<00:04:20.010> an

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
shutoff you should find on it it has an

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.830 
shutoff you should find on it it has an
arrow<00:04:20.370> showing<00:04:20.849> you<00:04:21.030> which<00:04:21.180> way<00:04:21.359> fuel<00:04:21.659> would

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
arrow showing you which way fuel would

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.570 
arrow showing you which way fuel would
flow<00:04:22.049> so<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.440> arrows<00:04:22.680> pointing<00:04:22.979> this<00:04:23.099> way

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
flow so the arrows pointing this way

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.189 
flow so the arrows pointing this way
so<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.729> want<00:04:23.909> the<00:04:23.970> fuel<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.270> flow<00:04:24.449> that<00:04:24.659> way<00:04:24.900> with

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
so I want the fuel to flow that way with

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.200 
so I want the fuel to flow that way with
the<00:04:25.229> direction<00:04:25.740> of<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.889> arrow<00:04:26.099> so<00:04:27.060> you'll

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
the direction of the arrow so you'll

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.399 
the direction of the arrow so you'll
just<00:04:27.240> want<00:04:27.419> to<00:04:27.569> slide<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.930> hose<00:04:28.080> over<00:04:28.229> the

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
just want to slide the hose over the

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.869 
just want to slide the hose over the
shutoff<00:04:28.620> valve<00:04:28.979> and<00:04:29.220> secure<00:04:29.490> with<00:04:29.639> your<00:04:29.729> hose

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
shutoff valve and secure with your hose

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.930 
shutoff valve and secure with your hose
clamp<00:04:30.270> just<00:04:30.960> like<00:04:31.139> you<00:04:31.229> did<00:04:31.409> on<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.789> outlet<00:04:32.789> of

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
clamp just like you did on the outlet of

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.330 
clamp just like you did on the outlet of
the<00:04:33.000> fuel<00:04:33.240> tank<00:04:33.590> so<00:04:34.590> I've<00:04:34.680> attached<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:35.099> shutoff

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
the fuel tank so I've attached a shutoff

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.640 
the fuel tank so I've attached a shutoff
valve<00:04:35.729> here<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.360> also<00:04:36.900> went<00:04:37.259> ahead<00:04:37.349> and

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
valve here and also went ahead and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.409 
valve here and also went ahead and
attached<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.220> rest<00:04:38.729> of<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:38.909> length<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.270> hose

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
attached the rest of the length of hose

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.999 
attached the rest of the length of hose
to<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.810> other<00:04:39.930> side<00:04:40.199> of<00:04:40.229> it<00:04:40.560> again<00:04:40.800> with<00:04:40.979> a

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
to the other side of it again with a

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.529 
to the other side of it again with a
hose<00:04:41.220> clamp<00:04:41.250> when<00:04:41.849> you're<00:04:41.970> installing<00:04:42.150> whose

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
hose clamp when you're installing whose

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.839 
hose clamp when you're installing whose
clamps<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.590> want<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.800> be<00:04:43.919> careful<00:04:44.190> note<00:04:44.669> your

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
clamps you want to be careful note your

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.520 
clamps you want to be careful note your
position<00:04:45.330> of<00:04:45.479> them<00:04:45.629> and<00:04:45.810> try<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.110> put<00:04:46.319> them<00:04:46.440> in

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
position of them and try to put them in

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.600 
position of them and try to put them in
a<00:04:46.560> position<00:04:46.710> that's<00:04:47.129> going<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.400> be<00:04:47.490> the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
a position that's going to be the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.149 
a position that's going to be the
easiest<00:04:47.909> for<00:04:48.180> you<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.360> get<00:04:48.539> to<00:04:48.720> later<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.319> have

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
easiest for you to get to later and have

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.730 
easiest for you to get to later and have
them<00:04:50.310> all<00:04:50.460> oriented<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.060> same<00:04:51.090> way<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:52.620> now

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
them all oriented the same way so now

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.960 
them all oriented the same way so now
the<00:04:52.800> next<00:04:52.979> thing<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.310> want<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.490> do<00:04:53.639> is<00:04:53.789> figure

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
the next thing I want to do is figure

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.209 
the next thing I want to do is figure
out<00:04:54.120> where<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.419> want<00:04:54.479> my<00:04:54.659> fuel<00:04:54.930> filter<00:04:55.349> your

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
out where I want my fuel filter your

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.529 
out where I want my fuel filter your
fuel<00:04:56.460> filter<00:04:56.819> is<00:04:56.849> going<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.090> be<00:04:57.180> just<00:04:57.389> like<00:04:57.449> a

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
fuel filter is going to be just like a

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.149 
fuel filter is going to be just like a
shutoff<00:04:57.840> valve<00:04:58.229> you<00:04:58.440> should<00:04:58.680> have<00:04:58.860> something

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
shutoff valve you should have something

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.920 
shutoff valve you should have something
on<00:04:59.430> there<00:04:59.639> an<00:04:59.729> arrow<00:04:59.909> marking<00:05:00.449> which<00:05:00.629> way<00:05:00.810> the

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
on there an arrow marking which way the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.600 
on there an arrow marking which way the
flow<00:05:01.139> goes<00:05:01.409> so<00:05:01.680> make<00:05:01.889> sure<00:05:01.919> you<00:05:02.190> put<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.430> in

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
flow goes so make sure you put that in

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.360 
flow goes so make sure you put that in
properly<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:04.110> repeat<00:05:04.409> that<00:05:04.560> process<00:05:04.800> attach

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
properly so repeat that process attach

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.680 
properly so repeat that process attach
it<00:05:05.550> just<00:05:05.729> like<00:05:05.879> you<00:05:05.969> did<00:05:06.150> for<00:05:06.180> your<00:05:06.389> shutoff

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
it just like you did for your shutoff

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.909 
it just like you did for your shutoff
valve<00:05:08.629> so<00:05:09.629> now<00:05:09.780> I've<00:05:09.900> attached<00:05:10.199> fuel<00:05:10.500> lows<00:05:10.710> to

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
valve so now I've attached fuel lows to

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.980 
valve so now I've attached fuel lows to
both<00:05:11.069> sides<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.610> fuel<00:05:11.819> filter<00:05:12.240> with<00:05:12.810> hose

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
both sides of the fuel filter with hose

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.320 
both sides of the fuel filter with hose
clamps<00:05:13.469> on<00:05:13.590> each<00:05:13.710> side<00:05:14.009> and<00:05:14.430> I've<00:05:15.030> got<00:05:15.210> the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
clamps on each side and I've got the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.700 
clamps on each side and I've got the
hose<00:05:15.479> coming<00:05:15.810> off<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.229> connect<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:16.620> the

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
hose coming off to connect to the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.189 
hose coming off to connect to the
carburetor<00:05:17.069> I'll<00:05:17.819> need<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> hose<00:05:18.690> clamp<00:05:19.050> on

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
carburetor I'll need a hose clamp on

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.480 
carburetor I'll need a hose clamp on
that<00:05:19.289> as<00:05:19.530> well<00:05:19.710> but<00:05:19.889> I'm<00:05:19.979> not<00:05:20.099> going<00:05:20.250> to<00:05:20.280> worry

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
that as well but I'm not going to worry

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.619 
that as well but I'm not going to worry
about<00:05:20.699> that<00:05:20.879> just<00:05:20.909> yet

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:21.629 
about that just yet

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:22.999 
about that just yet
because<00:05:22.139> I<00:05:22.229> will<00:05:22.409> be<00:05:22.530> removing<00:05:22.919> the

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
because I will be removing the

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.520 
because I will be removing the
carburetor<00:05:23.539> for<00:05:24.539> now<00:05:24.750> what<00:05:25.080> I'm<00:05:25.199> going<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.379> do

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
carburetor for now what I'm going to do

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.629 
carburetor for now what I'm going to do
is<00:05:25.919> put<00:05:26.550> my<00:05:27.080> fuel<00:05:28.080> line<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:28.770> components<00:05:29.520> in

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
place and secure them with zip ties to

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.180 
place and secure them with zip ties to
the<00:05:32.969> frame<00:05:33.380> you<00:05:34.380> don't<00:05:34.529> want<00:05:34.710> to<00:05:34.770> secure<00:05:34.979> these

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
the frame you don't want to secure these

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.309 
the frame you don't want to secure these
so<00:05:35.430> much<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:36.300> you're<00:05:36.479> pinching<00:05:36.750> off<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:36.960> fuel

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
so much that you're pinching off a fuel

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.830 
so much that you're pinching off a fuel
line<00:05:37.529> you<00:05:37.680> just<00:05:37.710> want<00:05:38.009> to<00:05:38.099> keep<00:05:38.219> them<00:05:38.370> in<00:05:38.460> place

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
line you just want to keep them in place

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.999 
line you just want to keep them in place
again<00:05:39.840> trying<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.229> remember<00:05:40.469> that<00:05:40.740> you<00:05:40.889> want

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
again trying to remember that you want

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.610 
again trying to remember that you want
to<00:05:41.159> steady<00:05:41.400> downhill<00:05:41.880> slope<00:05:42.210> so<00:05:43.110> now<00:05:43.289> you<00:05:43.349> want

to steady downhill slope so now you want

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.200 
to steady downhill slope so now you want
to<00:05:43.650> replace<00:05:43.979> your<00:05:44.159> vacuum<00:05:44.219> hoses<00:05:44.729> one<00:05:45.060> at<00:05:45.150> a
