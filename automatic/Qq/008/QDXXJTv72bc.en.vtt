00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.179
 odds to whites bad moves 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.119
 there are also bad engines before Russia there is no joy 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.860
 endless sine die it is to them are rare and that returns the engine 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.060

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.400
 and the crankshaft 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.880
 to leverage 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.320
 patting the people 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.320
 it's not easy because they do not come out the first time 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.090
 it would have been easier it is nearly 10 million passengers 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.049
 he are sitting in front of each other 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.049
 otherwise 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 for ipad 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.540
 here 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.440
 this same period 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.320
 I want to talk about facal 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.250
 travel formulas 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 it is obvious that pumpkins in pounds 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.660
 only a party at six at the level of choice you make a hole each 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.329
 side then baby think you're disappointed for sure that's mourning 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.040
 the area is obvious 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.799
 you are already living in bordeaux a port city 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.900
 by that it must be that people are dismantled first choice was fast 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.240
 did a little time and evolve the stable interbox and tim hortons of the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.980
 seal that stays to remove them 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.610
 to prevent things from moving 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.580
 the orifices quite 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.580
 degreasing level 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 that's the back of the cries now 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.190
 for his 30 years 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.349
 brandao 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.349
 so we will continue 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.949
 in the newspaper before 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.489
 because to avoid also if yesterday 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.369
 the players you have a small spring 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.569
 inside

 when are you putting the players 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:29.199
 the player will turn back to the point of blowing up the 10% that stands out then for 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.379
 avoid that 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.839
 you take a small screwdriver unbolt 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.839
 outside to get in 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.509
 besides it is placed on the bench but for the moment art 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.619

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.099
 karuru places a plastic sheath 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.379

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.770
 Dalai Lama you have the internal plan to the ump 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.660
 the flat part of the outside m 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.660
 the neighborhood has been crowded and well you go no further 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.559
 because after that time it is too far and undermines our pastors a passenger 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:16.209
 back 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.099
 you thought too much outside 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.999
 their output 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.809
 it's the same thing on the other side a mine dufferin bout 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.529
 we register the engine 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.469
 allah you always take worrying even if you push on the ugly to 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.959
 interior 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.659
 to do this we treat it also assume directly over it turns 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.199
 and launch in spa 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.199

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.709
 come 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.719
