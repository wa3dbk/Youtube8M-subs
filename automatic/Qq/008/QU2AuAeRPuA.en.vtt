00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
the things that the GT pause is once you

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.229 
the things that the GT pause is once you
start<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.129> turn<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.400> boost<00:00:36.610> up<00:00:36.820> would<00:00:37.000> start

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
start to turn the boost up would start

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.780 
start to turn the boost up would start
to<00:00:37.329> run<00:00:37.480> out<00:00:37.600> of<00:00:37.629> fuel<00:00:37.900> so<00:00:38.470> you<00:00:38.860> want<00:00:39.730> to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
to run out of fuel so you want to

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.119 
to run out of fuel so you want to
increase<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.329> injector<00:00:40.659> sizing<00:00:41.129> generally

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
increase the injector sizing generally

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.560 
increase the injector sizing generally
when<00:00:42.250> you<00:00:42.339> increase<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.760> injector<00:00:43.089> sizing

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
when you increase the injector sizing

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.860 
when you increase the injector sizing
the<00:00:43.930> impedence<00:00:44.379> is<00:00:44.469> a<00:00:44.579> problem<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.780> B

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
the impedence is a problem with the B

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.049 
the impedence is a problem with the B
500<00:00:47.410> we<00:00:47.500> can<00:00:47.620> go<00:00:47.739> down<00:00:47.920> as<00:00:48.070> far<00:00:48.340> as<00:00:48.370> 0.8<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:48.969> an

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
500 we can go down as far as 0.8 of an

not an issue another bonus to the GT

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.799 
not an issue another bonus to the GT
force<00:00:54.609> is<00:00:54.850> that<00:00:54.969> we<00:00:55.059> can<00:00:55.210> remove<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.660> old

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
force is that we can remove the old

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.889 
force is that we can remove the old
mechanical<00:00:56.109> air<00:00:57.070> flow<00:00:57.789> meter<00:00:57.969> and<00:00:58.449> put<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.660> pipe

in<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.199> replacement<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.829> it<00:00:59.949> this<00:01:00.250> allows<00:01:00.430> more

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
in in replacement of it this allows more

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.880 
in in replacement of it this allows more
flow<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.239> turbo<00:01:01.600> more<00:01:02.079> flow<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.379> a<00:01:02.469> turbo

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
with the wolf

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.200 
with the wolf
now<00:02:41.600> after<00:02:42.600> plugging<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.380> V<00:02:43.470> 500<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.130> we<00:02:45.030> want

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
now after plugging the V 500 in we want

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.340 
now after plugging the V 500 in we want
to<00:02:45.270> turn<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> key<00:02:46.020> on

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
to turn the key on

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.210 
to turn the key on
make<00:02:46.530> sure<00:02:46.710> all<00:02:47.010> powers<00:02:47.400> up<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.820> starts<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.680> we

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
make sure all powers up and starts so we

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.630 
make sure all powers up and starts so we
have<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> green<00:02:53.610> light<00:02:53.850> which<00:02:54.390> indicates<00:02:55.640> that

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
have a green light which indicates that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.330 
have a green light which indicates that
we<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:56.820> power

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.220 

we<00:03:01.849> have<00:03:01.970> blue<00:03:02.180> light<00:03:02.390> while<00:03:02.900> it's<00:03:03.080> running

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
we have blue light while it's running

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.509 
we have blue light while it's running
indicates<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:04.880> everything's<00:03:05.270> perfect

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.699 

so<00:03:10.519> now<00:03:10.700> we've<00:03:10.909> installed<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.450> V<00:03:11.629> 500<00:03:12.290> we've

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
so now we've installed the V 500 we've

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.220 
so now we've installed the V 500 we've
checked<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.459> starts<00:03:13.909> it<00:03:14.060> runs<00:03:14.299> now<00:03:15.170> the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
checked it it starts it runs now the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.570 
checked it it starts it runs now the
next<00:03:15.620> step<00:03:15.830> is<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:16.159> check<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.459> ignition

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
next step is to check the ignition

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.030 
next step is to check the ignition
timing<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.390> get<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.409> ready<00:03:18.590> for<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.799> diner

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
timing and get it ready for the diner

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.979 
timing and get it ready for the diner
when<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:19.849> say<00:03:20.090> get<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.299> ready<00:03:20.540> for<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:20.750> dyno

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
when I say get it ready for the dyno

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.589 
when I say get it ready for the dyno
what<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:21.830> mean<00:03:22.069> is<00:03:22.220> check<00:03:22.489> hose<00:03:22.760> clamps<00:03:23.299> water

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
what I mean is check hose clamps water

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.390 
what I mean is check hose clamps water
leaks<00:03:23.900> make<00:03:24.739> sure<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.160> all<00:03:25.370> your

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
leaks make sure that all your

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.280 
leaks make sure that all your
intercooler<00:03:25.879> piping<00:03:26.239> is<00:03:26.390> tight<00:03:26.629> there's

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
intercooler piping is tight there's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.780 
intercooler piping is tight there's
nothing<00:03:27.620> worse<00:03:27.799> than<00:03:27.830> getting<00:03:28.220> onto<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.519> dyno

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
nothing worse than getting onto a dyno

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:45.350 
nothing worse than getting onto a dyno
and<00:03:29.180> having<00:03:29.780> problems

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360
