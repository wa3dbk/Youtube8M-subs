okay what's gonna pause give that a
moment<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.329> try<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.509> again

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.980 

okay<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:26.980> primed<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.550> lines<00:02:27.730> actually<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:28.870> tried

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
okay I primed the lines actually I tried

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.740 
okay I primed the lines actually I tried
to<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.260> pumped<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.740> couple<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.070> times<00:02:30.250> but

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
to I pumped it a couple of times but

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.910 
to I pumped it a couple of times but
diesel<00:02:31.750> started<00:02:32.170> spilling<00:02:32.380> out<00:02:32.560> at<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.740> top

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
diesel started spilling out at the top

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.110 
diesel started spilling out at the top
there<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.340> may<00:02:33.460> actually<00:02:33.610> have<00:02:33.820> to<00:02:33.880> replace

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
there so I may actually have to replace

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.490 
there so I may actually have to replace
the<00:02:34.330> primer<00:02:34.600> which<00:02:34.840> is<00:02:34.960> not<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> big<00:02:35.290> deal<00:02:35.440> I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the primer which is not a big deal I

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.900 
the primer which is not a big deal I
have<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> spare<00:02:36.280> one<00:02:36.460> so<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:39.340> fuel<00:02:39.730> that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
have a spare one so and the fuel that

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.300 
have a spare one so and the fuel that
came<00:02:40.060> out<00:02:40.270> obviously<00:02:40.810> looked<00:02:41.020> really<00:02:41.500> old

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
came out obviously looked really old

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.980 
came out obviously looked really old
it<00:02:42.730> wasn't<00:02:43.000> black<00:02:43.180> but<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.480> was<00:02:43.600> definitely

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
it wasn't black but it was definitely

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.040 
it wasn't black but it was definitely
green<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:45.210> fuel<00:02:46.210> system<00:02:46.510> definitely<00:02:46.870> needs

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
green so fuel system definitely needs

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.100 
green so fuel system definitely needs
some<00:02:47.110> attention<00:02:48.300> try<00:02:49.300> this<00:02:49.360> again<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.810> if<00:02:49.930> not

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
some attention try this again and if not

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.480 
some attention try this again and if not
I'll<00:02:50.320> hook<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.680> block<00:02:50.860> heater<00:02:51.160> I'll

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
I'll hook up the block heater I'll

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.370 
I'll hook up the block heater I'll
charge<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.910> battery<00:02:52.209> again<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.750> see<00:02:53.290> what

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
charge the battery again and see what

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:08.820 
charge the battery again and see what
happens<00:03:06.570> okay<00:03:07.570> I've<00:03:07.959> been<00:03:07.990> glowing<00:03:08.380> for<00:03:08.650> about

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
happens okay I've been glowing for about

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.120 
happens okay I've been glowing for about
30<00:03:09.100> seconds<00:03:09.550> now<00:03:09.730> I'm<00:03:10.800> plus<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.950> block

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
30 seconds now I'm plus the block

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.520 
30 seconds now I'm plus the block
heaters<00:03:12.490> running<00:03:12.730> that's<00:03:13.209> really<00:03:13.870> related<00:03:14.260> to

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
heaters running that's really related to

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.050 
heaters running that's really related to
the<00:03:14.740> clicking<00:03:15.130> you're<00:03:15.310> hearing<00:03:15.670> but<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:15.850> don't

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
the clicking you're hearing but I don't

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.370 
the clicking you're hearing but I don't
think<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.330> clicking<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.750> coming<00:03:17.050> out<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.200> a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
think the clicking is coming out of a

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.860 
think the clicking is coming out of a
heater<00:03:17.650> itself<00:03:18.100> so<00:03:18.580> I'm<00:03:19.480> going<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.690> try

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
heater itself so I'm going to try

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.470 
heater itself so I'm going to try
glowing<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.410> for<00:03:20.740> a<00:03:21.340> little<00:03:22.030> over<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.239> minute

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
glowing it for a little over a minute

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:34.290 
glowing it for a little over a minute
and<00:03:22.780> see<00:03:23.260> what<00:03:23.380> happens

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:44.010

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.530 
although really doesn't sound too bad if
it<00:04:38.230> is<00:04:38.320> going<00:04:38.530> pretty<00:04:38.680> even<00:04:39.130> but<00:04:40.000> obviously<00:04:40.390> it

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
it is going pretty even but obviously it

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.220 
it is going pretty even but obviously it
needs<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.900> valve<00:04:41.080> adjustment<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:43.230> probably

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
needs the valve adjustment and probably

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:55.590 
needs the valve adjustment and probably
a<00:04:44.260> bunch<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:51.330> maybe<00:04:52.330> we<00:04:52.450> can<00:04:52.750> go<00:04:52.870> out<00:04:52.900> there
