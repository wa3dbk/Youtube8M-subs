your headsets our headset uses a larger

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.760 
your headsets our headset uses a larger
one<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.630> won't<00:01:36.750> fit<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.740> use

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
one that won't fit in here you can use

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.069 
one that won't fit in here you can use
this<00:01:37.979> adapter<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:39.030> make<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> connection<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
this adapter to make the connection so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.770 
this adapter to make the connection so
let's<00:01:40.740> focus<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> battery<00:01:41.759> itself<00:01:41.939> you'll

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
let's focus on the battery itself you'll

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.719 
let's focus on the battery itself you'll
plug<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.290> via<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> USB<00:01:44.070> port<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.610> there

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
plug it in via the USB port right there

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.060 
plug it in via the USB port right there
the<00:01:45.119> micro<00:01:45.420> USB<00:01:45.810> port<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.079> charge<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.619> there

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the micro USB port to charge it up there

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.830 
the micro USB port to charge it up there
are<00:01:47.159> LEDs<00:01:47.610> hair<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.149> illuminate<00:01:48.360> while

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
are LEDs hair that will illuminate while

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
are LEDs hair that will illuminate while
it's<00:01:49.049> charging<00:01:49.320> once<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.310> good<00:01:50.520> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it's charging once it's good you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's charging once it's good you
separate<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> two<00:01:51.390> pieces<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
separate the two pieces like that you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
separate the two pieces like that you
have<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.770> back<00:01:53.040> plate<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:53.759> back<00:01:54.030> frame

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
have this back plate or back frame

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330 
have this back plate or back frame
that's<00:01:55.079> where<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> battery<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.159> take

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that's where the battery is and you take

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.090 
that's where the battery is and you take
your<00:01:56.460> phone<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.140> simply<00:01:58.140> slide<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.649> over<00:01:58.950> on

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
your phone and simply slide it over on

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.090 
your phone and simply slide it over on
to<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> Lightning<00:02:00.000> port<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.170> once<00:02:01.920> it's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
to the Lightning port like so once it's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
to the Lightning port like so once it's
on<00:02:02.250> there<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.360> frame<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
on there you then take the frame and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.630 
on there you then take the frame and
just<00:02:04.140> click<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.350> into<00:02:04.649> place<00:02:04.860> by<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.369> over

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
just click it into place by going over

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.880 
just click it into place by going over
the<00:02:05.759> buttons<00:02:06.060> first<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.750> then<00:02:07.229> snapping<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the buttons first and then snapping the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.639 
the buttons first and then snapping the
bottom<00:02:08.310> part<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.789> place<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.509> has<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> satisfying

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
bottom part in place it has a satisfying

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.680 
bottom part in place it has a satisfying
click<00:02:11.220> when<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.640> all<00:02:11.819> kind<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.239> locks<00:02:12.450> together

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
click when it all kind of locks together

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.400 
click when it all kind of locks together
so

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.660 
so
you<00:02:13.500> know<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.460> going<00:02:14.580> to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
you know it's on and it's not going to
