00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:11.370
 each work has its own internal 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:17.240
 rhythm is very important to keep from the rhythm in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.240
 during the day about it helps technology 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.540
 but there is one feeling that we all 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.540
 face daily 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.900
 This process takes 2 minutes we do 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 it's every day every week every 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.720
 a month and a year it's about a thousand 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.720
 man hours 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:12.080
 there is a solution using refil for 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.210
 automatic topping up water from his mouth 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.290
 you people can first significantly 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.600
 save your time 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.280
 avoid the same routine 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.320
 operations get any 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.869
 the pleasure of being just not 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.869
 you need to do by hand is doing. 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.299
 we have them hundreds of coffee machines which 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.340
 before it is unknown when it is necessary to service 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.159
 do exactly this question now 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.149
 automate what to minimize 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.070
 wait a century 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.909
 Zoom all the negative emotions that 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.909
 that for some reason does not work 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.369
 he is behind the kotova project and for those who 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.170
 serves these machines they see 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.810
 statistics of the use of devices and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 can balance the load during 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.250
 carry out prevention and we are less likely 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:05.070
 will stumble on not functioning 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.470
 the device is that you are every man's name 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.970
 his condition 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.970
 health level radiators already 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.040
 use words that 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.450
 vary with state 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.450
 cars more accurately changing mood 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.390
 when accessing the main page of the profile 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.920
 we can see a list of all coffee machines 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.170
 which are established by the company and 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.250
 registered in the referral system 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.770
 have equipment installed on them 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.930
 filed conclusions every car shows 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.490
 here is your specific status and 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.860
 some of their main characteristics 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.200
 enough to conclude 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.780
 is the coffee machine running or is it broken 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.540
 and does not need maintenance when clicking on 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.280
 coffee machine name we will be able to go and 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.800
 already see its detailed page 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.740
 which consists of three main parts 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.350
 above we see more in-depth 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.960
 statistics on cafe wearing how much 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.270
 water left for example on the left graph 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.090
 the load of the coffee machine on the right 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.950
 list of recent incidents in which 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.690
 occurred with a coffee machine as well 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.880
 opportunity to register your 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.000
 incident in case the coffee machine is not in 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.460
 order when registering an incident 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.710
 user will be provided very 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.510
 simple and accessible modal window where 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.820
 I will just need to enter my name and 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.760
 contact number 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.730
 with him and also indicate the type of problem with 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.390
 coffee machine if necessary to give a short 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.370
 description 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.520
 after the user clicks 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.690
 problem registration button will happen 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.630
 automatic notification 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.830
 responsible technology which we 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.110
 used for the project 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.520
 quite extensive to gather information 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.110
 from sensors 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.180
 about coffee machine water used 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.600
 arduino processor processed 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.430
 information is already stored on booking with 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.220
 using java and spring 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.340
 north then the client part which 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:06.390
 engaged in displaying a website this 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:08.280
 an act with colleagues pellets ate at all 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.950
 poured son coffee machine 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.790
 all that was needed what they want 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.540
 plot 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.540
