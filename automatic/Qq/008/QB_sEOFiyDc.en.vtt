then I'm gonna play them as though
there's<00:00:41.989> just<00:00:42.140> one<00:00:42.320> instrument<00:00:43.239> after

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
there's just one instrument after

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.720 
there's just one instrument after

were<00:00:48.800> built<00:00:49.010> into<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.399> instrument<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
were built into the instrument the

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.079 
were built into the instrument the
Richter<00:00:50.780> diatonic<00:00:51.320> harmonica<00:00:51.910> when<00:00:52.910> it<00:00:53.000> was

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
Richter diatonic harmonica when it was

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.759 
Richter diatonic harmonica when it was
first<00:00:53.329> invented<00:00:53.780> in<00:00:54.670> 1826<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:55.850> believe<00:00:56.769> okay

or<00:03:36.720> brass<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:38.140> usually<00:03:38.530> use<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.860> brass<00:03:39.510> because

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
or brass I usually use the brass because

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.490 
or brass I usually use the brass because
if<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.930> need<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.260> file<00:03:42.130> something<00:03:43.319> it's<00:03:44.319> a

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
if you need to file something it's a

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.620 
if you need to file something it's a
softer<00:03:45.069> metal<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:47.760> it's<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.880> lot<00:03:49.030> easier<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.390> do

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
softer metal and it's a lot easier to do

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.460 
softer metal and it's a lot easier to do
with<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.620> brass<00:03:51.599> okay<00:03:52.599> you<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:53.049> tighten<00:03:53.290> it

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
with the brass okay you just tighten it

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.710 
with the brass okay you just tighten it
loosely<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:57.819> way<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.030> can<00:03:58.299> get<00:03:58.510> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
loosely and that way you can get the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:12.580 
loosely and that way you can get the
other<00:03:59.220> side<00:04:00.220> done

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.289 

okay<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.520> know<00:04:13.640> I'm<00:04:13.790> gonna<00:04:14.000> thread<00:04:14.330> this<00:04:14.390> bolt

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
okay you know I'm gonna thread this bolt

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:29.960 
okay you know I'm gonna thread this bolt
into<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.419> last<00:04:17.720> note<00:04:17.989> here

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.760 

and<00:04:30.970> there<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.390> have<00:04:31.420> it<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.870> cost<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.650> these

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
and there you have it the cost of these

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.790 
and there you have it the cost of these
bolts<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.280> nuts<00:04:33.490> is<00:04:33.760> anywhere<00:04:34.540> from<00:04:34.840> 50<00:04:35.440> cents

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
bolts and nuts is anywhere from 50 cents

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:49.580 
bolts and nuts is anywhere from 50 cents
to<00:04:35.920> $1<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:45.240> very<00:04:47.100> economical<00:04:48.100> way

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
to $1 so this is a very economical way

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.720 
to $1 so this is a very economical way
there<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.710> have<00:04:50.890> it<00:04:51.180> there's<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:55.620> completed

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
there you have it there's the completed

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.290 
there you have it there's the completed
conversion<00:04:57.730> and<00:04:59.520> once<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.640> do<00:05:00.760> this<00:05:00.940> then<00:05:01.150> you

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
conversion and once you do this then you

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.190 
conversion and once you do this then you
have<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.480> permanent<00:05:02.790> fastening<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.200> they

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
have a permanent fastening and they

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.110 
have a permanent fastening and they
won't<00:05:05.440> move<00:05:05.560> on<00:05:05.800> you<00:05:05.950> using<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.490> method<00:05:06.850> will

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
won't move on you using the method will

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.570 
won't move on you using the method will
be<00:05:07.150> much<00:05:07.840> easier<00:05:08.260> than<00:05:08.500> using<00:05:09.100> the<00:05:09.370> rubber

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
be much easier than using the rubber

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.100 
be much easier than using the rubber
bands<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.120> tape<00:05:10.300> like<00:05:10.570> I've<00:05:10.750> done<00:05:10.930> in<00:05:11.050> the

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
bands and tape like I've done in the

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.880 
bands and tape like I've done in the
past<00:05:11.290> and<00:05:12.930> I'd<00:05:13.930> recommend<00:05:14.110> something<00:05:14.770> like

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
past and I'd recommend something like

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.450 
past and I'd recommend something like
this

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
this

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.160 
this
there's<00:05:15.640> more<00:05:15.940> than<00:05:16.090> one<00:05:16.150> mechanical<00:05:16.990> way<00:05:17.110> to

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
there's more than one mechanical way to

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.900 
there's more than one mechanical way to
fasten<00:05:17.650> these<00:05:17.800> things<00:05:18.130> but<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:18.580> what<00:05:18.880> I

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
fasten these things but this is what I

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.610 
fasten these things but this is what I
found<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.510> be<00:05:19.540> most<00:05:19.660> efficient<00:05:20.350> and<00:05:20.440> so<00:05:20.530> I'm

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
found to be most efficient and so I'm

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.800 
found to be most efficient and so I'm
sharing<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:21.010> with<00:05:21.070> you<00:05:21.480> okay<00:05:24.330> okay<00:05:25.330> now<00:05:25.660> that

sharing it with you okay okay now that

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.750 
sharing it with you okay okay now that
we<00:05:25.900> have<00:05:25.930> these<00:05:26.230> two<00:05:26.290> diatonic<00:05:27.160> harmonicas

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
we have these two diatonic harmonicas

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.640 
we have these two diatonic harmonicas
coupled<00:05:28.240> together<00:05:28.420> a<00:05:28.690> full<00:05:29.020> step<00:05:29.260> apart<00:05:29.590> on

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
coupled together a full step apart on

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.800 
coupled together a full step apart on
the<00:05:29.710> chromatic<00:05:30.130> scale<00:05:30.160> I'd<00:05:31.060> like<00:05:31.390> to<00:05:31.510> give<00:05:31.690> you

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
the chromatic scale I'd like to give you

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.660 
the chromatic scale I'd like to give you
a<00:05:31.870> little<00:05:32.230> demonstration<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.580> new

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
a little demonstration of the new

00:05:33.670 --> 00:07:31.000 
a little demonstration of the new
capability<00:05:34.330> this<00:05:34.720> Springs<00:05:35.050> so<00:05:35.980> here<00:05:36.340> we<00:05:36.430> go

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.010 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.139
