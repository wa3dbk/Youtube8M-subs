hi<00:00:04.410> I'm<00:00:04.620> Terry<00:00:04.859> from<00:00:05.009> across<00:00:05.310> Technology<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
hi I'm Terry from across Technology and

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.760 
hi I'm Terry from across Technology and
we're<00:00:06.450> looking<00:00:06.720> at<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.930> sky<00:00:07.170> scan<00:00:07.529> eight

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
we're looking at the sky scan eight

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.030 
we're looking at the sky scan eight
eight<00:00:08.069> nine<00:00:08.099> zero<00:00:08.370> one<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.090> time<00:00:09.389> o'clock<00:00:10.040> when

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
eight nine zero one a time o'clock when

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.950 
eight nine zero one a time o'clock when
you<00:00:11.130> open<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.490> box<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.059> main<00:00:12.420> units<00:00:12.809> you'll

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
you open the box the main units you'll

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.620 
you open the box the main units you'll
find<00:00:13.259> are<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.679> clock<00:00:13.889> itself<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.630> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
find are the clock itself and the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.300 
find are the clock itself and the
outdoor<00:00:16.400> remote<00:00:17.400> sensor<00:00:18.740> you<00:00:19.740> want<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> remove

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
outdoor remote sensor you want to remove

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.420 
outdoor remote sensor you want to remove
and<00:00:20.699> discard<00:00:21.050> the<00:00:22.640> plastic<00:00:23.640> layer<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:25.430> we'll

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and discard the plastic layer and we'll

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.310 
and discard the plastic layer and we'll
set<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> clock<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.720> start<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
set up the clock we start with the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.310 
set up the clock we start with the
sensor<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.890> we'll<00:00:29.010> move<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.310> way<00:00:30.080> to<00:00:31.080> start

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
sensor so we'll move this way to start

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.560 
sensor so we'll move this way to start
the<00:00:31.470> sensor<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.070> set<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.700> slide<00:00:33.420> the
