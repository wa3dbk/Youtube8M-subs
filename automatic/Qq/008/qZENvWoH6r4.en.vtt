for<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.970> little<00:00:18.619> side<00:00:19.619> quest<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:21.170> found<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
for a little side quest so I found it

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.259 
for a little side quest so I found it
much<00:00:22.650> easier<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.070> clear<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.490> now<00:00:23.670> because<00:00:24.119> when

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
much easier to clear it now because when

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.150 
much easier to clear it now because when
you<00:00:24.330> go<00:00:24.449> back<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.930> second<00:00:25.320> time<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.830> kind<00:00:26.070> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
you go back the second time it's kind of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.750 
you go back the second time it's kind of
filled<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.699> them<00:00:27.080> more<00:00:28.080> enemies<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:29.490> top

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
filled with them more enemies and on top

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.060 
filled with them more enemies and on top
of<00:00:29.910> what's<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.179> there<00:00:30.420> already<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.590> makes<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.009> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
of what's in there already it makes it a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.709
