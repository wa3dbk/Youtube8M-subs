in this summer I've been surfing

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.760 
in this summer I've been surfing
skateboarding<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.350> also<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.889 
hospital for a couple days um a little
bit<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.910> can't<00:00:45.840> remember<00:00:45.989> how<00:00:46.230> long<00:00:46.440> exactly

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
bit I can't remember how long exactly

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.310 
bit I can't remember how long exactly
but<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.579> screwed<00:00:50.579> things<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:51.320> say

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
but that kind of screwed things up say

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.170 
but that kind of screwed things up say
the<00:00:52.440> least<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.579> don't<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.059> into

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the least but I don't want to get into

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
the least but I don't want to get into
that<00:00:54.480> because<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:55.680> feel<00:00:55.829> like

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that because I just don't feel like

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.770 
that because I just don't feel like
repeating<00:00:56.340> myself<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> oh<00:00:58.199> well<00:00:59.270> okay<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:01.649> um

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.790 
there's curly brackets so just make sure
of<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.530> but<00:02:40.530> before<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> end<00:02:42.560> so<00:02:43.560> now<00:02:43.680> we're

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
of that but before the end so now we're

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.290 
of that but before the end so now we're
gonna<00:02:43.920> start<00:02:44.130> coding<00:02:44.520> first<00:02:44.880> we<00:02:45.000> need<00:02:45.150> an

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
gonna start coding first we need an

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.590 
gonna start coding first we need an
outlet<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:47.490> switch<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.300> connect

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
outlet for the switch so we can connect

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.260 
outlet for the switch so we can connect
the<00:02:48.780> switch<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.530> switch<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:51.060> we're<00:02:51.180> going

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
the switch to the switch so we're going

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.640 
the switch to the switch so we're going
to<00:02:51.360> type<00:02:51.720> IB<00:02:52.200> outlet<00:02:52.940> UI<00:02:53.940> switch<00:02:55.130> call<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.280> a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
to type IB outlet UI switch call it a

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.090 
to type IB outlet UI switch call it a
the<00:02:58.650> switch<00:03:00.470> whatever<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.560> like<00:03:01.710> whatever

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
the switch whatever you like whatever

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.770 
the switch whatever you like whatever
you<00:03:02.400> want<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.610> call<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.060> always<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:03.630> your

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
you want to call it and always in your

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.630 
you want to call it and always in your
lines<00:03:04.050> with<00:03:04.320> code<00:03:04.500> with<00:03:05.240> lid<00:03:06.240> a<00:03:06.270> little

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.560 
semicolon let's make one for the label
now<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.640> just<00:03:11.790> for<00:03:11.880> demonstration

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
now this is just for demonstration

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.020 
now this is just for demonstration
purposes<00:03:13.070> I<00:03:14.070> can<00:03:14.820> think<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:17.370> don't<00:03:17.970> know

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
purposes I can think of I don't know

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.280 
purposes I can think of I don't know
there's<00:03:18.239> thousands<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.690> different<00:03:18.989> ways<00:03:19.110> you

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
there's thousands of different ways you

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.440 
there's thousands of different ways you
just<00:03:19.320> got<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.709> be<00:03:19.800> creative<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.970> use<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.239> in

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
just got to be creative to use this in

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.030 
just got to be creative to use this in
your<00:03:21.480> app<00:03:21.780> making<00:03:22.320> more<00:03:22.560> use<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.770> funds<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:25.040> I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
your app making more use of funds so I

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.320 
your app making more use of funds so I
personally<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:29.640> really<00:03:29.910> helps<00:03:30.180> out

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
personally have so it really helps out

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.300 
personally have so it really helps out
so<00:03:30.570> we're<00:03:30.989> gonna<00:03:31.080> do<00:03:31.260> an<00:03:31.380> IB<00:03:31.650> outlet<00:03:31.950> for<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
so we're gonna do an IB outlet for the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.770 
so we're gonna do an IB outlet for the
UI<00:03:32.459> label<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.870> we're<00:03:34.350> gonna<00:03:34.440> call<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.739> label

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
UI label and we're gonna call it label

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.860 
UI label and we're gonna call it label
and<00:03:36.780> now<00:03:37.230> we<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.830> make<00:03:38.040> an<00:03:38.160> action

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
and now we just have to make an action

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.220 
and now we just have to make an action
telling<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.890> what<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.550> switch<00:03:41.820> is<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.720> do<00:03:42.900> I'm

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
telling the what the switch is to do I'm

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.470 
telling the what the switch is to do I'm
going<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.920> find<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.610> am<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.239> we're<00:03:45.360> gonna

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
going to find it and I am so we're gonna

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:54.920 
going to find it and I am so we're gonna
do<00:03:45.890> IB<00:03:46.890> action<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:48.769> switch<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:51.000> switch<00:03:53.930> ID

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
do IB action a switch the switch ID

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.340 
do IB action a switch the switch ID
sender<00:03:55.880> semicolon<00:03:56.880> we're<00:03:57.750> done<00:03:57.930> here<00:03:58.110> let's

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
sender semicolon we're done here let's

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.199 
sender semicolon we're done here let's
go<00:03:58.860> into<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.250> dot<00:03:59.430> in<00:04:01.310> family<00:04:02.310> Z<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.760> I'm<00:04:02.880> just

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
go into the dot in family Z so I'm just

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.520 
go into the dot in family Z so I'm just
gonna<00:04:03.480> copy<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.400> paste<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.950> IV<00:04:08.310> action

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
gonna copy and paste in the IV action

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.390 
gonna copy and paste in the IV action
opening<00:04:10.530> curly<00:04:10.739> brackets

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
opening curly brackets

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.449 
opening curly brackets
now<00:04:11.700> we're<00:04:11.850> gonna<00:04:11.940> do<00:04:12.180> an<00:04:12.330> if<00:04:12.540> statement<00:04:12.780> so

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
now we're gonna do an if statement so

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.590 
now we're gonna do an if statement so
basically<00:04:14.459> what<00:04:14.790> we're<00:04:14.880> gonna<00:04:15.000> be<00:04:15.180> doing<00:04:15.450> is

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
basically what we're gonna be doing is

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.740 
basically what we're gonna be doing is
if<00:04:16.730> if<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:18.419> switch<00:04:18.840> says<00:04:19.560> on<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:21.330> label<00:04:21.359> is

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
if if the switch says on the label is

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.230 
if if the switch says on the label is
gonna<00:04:21.930> be<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:23.100> text<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.490> gonna<00:04:23.640> be<00:04:23.789> this<00:04:23.970> and

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
gonna be the text is gonna be this and

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.930 
gonna be the text is gonna be this and
if<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.479> off<00:04:24.720> it's<00:04:25.260> going<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.410> be<00:04:25.500> that

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
if it's off it's going to be that

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.970 
if it's off it's going to be that
doesn't<00:04:27.660> have<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.780> be<00:04:27.990> just<00:04:28.020> labels<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.710> can<00:04:28.830> be

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
doesn't have to be just labels it can be

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.240 
doesn't have to be just labels it can be
like<00:04:29.790> I<00:04:29.970> don't<00:04:30.240> know<00:04:30.450> what<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.770> can<00:04:31.920> be<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.040> lot

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
like I don't know what it can be a lot

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.460 
like I don't know what it can be a lot
of<00:04:32.430> different<00:04:32.730> things<00:04:34.520> very<00:04:35.520> helpful<00:04:36.470> like

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
of different things very helpful like

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.790
