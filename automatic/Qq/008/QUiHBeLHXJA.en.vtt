like I said one of the sickest figures I

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.300 
like I said one of the sickest figures I
own<00:04:37.870> except<00:04:38.870> probably<00:04:39.289> I<00:04:39.319> like<00:04:39.529> the<00:04:39.919> blue<00:04:40.129> hair

own except probably I like the blue hair
one<00:04:40.520> better<00:04:40.789> I<00:04:40.879> think<00:04:40.999> just<00:04:41.539> because<00:04:41.629> it's<00:04:41.810> so

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
one better I think just because it's so

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.559 
one better I think just because it's so
rare<00:04:42.229> and<00:04:42.469> like<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:43.400> said<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.639> paid<00:04:43.879> 80<00:04:44.060> bucks<00:04:44.150> for

both of them I think that's a pretty

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:48.999 
both of them I think that's a pretty
good<00:04:47.810> deal<00:04:48.080> considering<00:04:48.680> these<00:04:48.860> are

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009
