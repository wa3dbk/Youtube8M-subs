00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.550
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.840
 this new with m here on battlefield 3 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.750
 today I want to talk about what 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.210
 will be the new dlc or aftermath or 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.590
 better to give an overview in general than 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.270
 those that will be the innovations introduced 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.100
 from this package 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.670
 in short I saw a lot of video read 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.710
 lots of articles about 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.570
 aftermath then more or less an idea in 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.090
 general package I made it 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.980
 obviously I do not hesitate to propose it 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.140
 this idea in general does not hesitate from 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.390
 comment on what I think will be 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.370
 this dlc even if you know that anyway 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.170
 I'm not a person who judges 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.690
 only from the information he has 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.290
 got say let's first try 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.380
 what will be the actual package 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.369
 before giving an opinion 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.640
 however let's say I saw a lot 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.250
 of stuff so I can already have a little something 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.560
 tell you but first I wanted to talk to you about 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.540
 a modification of the patch that will be released 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.960
 point in conjunction with the release of 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.180
 after matt for premiums on ps3 and it's one 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.740
 change that really made me a 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.229
 casino pleasure that is the possibility 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.780
 at least for us pcists through a command 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.209
 on the game console to remove the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.490
 blue filter then you know that I today 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:34.190
 the blue filter of battlefield 3 if it were 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.380
 for me I would take him and mine and 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.140
 I would throw him into space just one 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.819
 something really useless that not only 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.310
 Worsens what the game's graphics do 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.319
 but that in general 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.119
 takes you to a disadvantage as far as 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.750
 concerns the induced lakes in fact the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.000
 blue filter like any other filter in a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.709
 any video game 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.330
 who carries a slight input lag 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.030
 very light we talk about some 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.209
 millisecond indeed perhaps some 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.740
 nanosecond because we talk anyway 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:09.319
 indeed of a ridiculous delay however is a 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.660
 late than when you play 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.220
 let's say you feel like maybe you're in 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.410
 very light but still successful 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.849
 to perceive what this delay is 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.550
 the possibility to remove precisely the 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.530
 blue filter maybe will allow one 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.200
 better enjoyment in general than 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.100
 what will be the game and not only 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.440
 enjoyment with regard to seeing 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.870
 the game but also in playing the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.920
 so let's say it's a thing 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.080
 which makes me very happy 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.990
 and then above all why the hell he was 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.330
 such perfect graphics in alpha and 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.280
 from the alpha to the full version have 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.710
 wanted to insert this filter which 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.350
 worsens everything makes no sense it seems that 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.750
 they almost did it on purpose because they didn't 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.660
 I know that the graphics of debates seems to me 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.760
 on the 3 with this filter is almost 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.810
 monochrome everything so blue I don't 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.480
 like it 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.510
 anyway apart from that we move on to 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.990
 what is the real topic of this 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.270
 comments and precisely aftermath and after 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.920
 matt let's just say i can tell you a 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.630
 nice bit of things being an informed 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.660
 enough then let's start first 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.760
 with the talk of this infamous 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.280
 crossbow presented to us 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.670
 in virtually every trailer of this 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.920
 dlc and with this gym practically 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.020
 we could break our asses in the true sense 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.690
 of the word because it is precisely this 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.070
 gym from what I could see 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.290
 will shock enemies even in long range 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.720
 like not even a sniper rifle can 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.970
 do despite the bullet drop anyway 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.120
 of the latter is decidedly high 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.980
 because precisely as far as it can 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.880
 accept people even without hitting them 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.440
 in my head anyway from what I understood 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.960
 to balance it will be precisely the bull a 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.270
 in fact, long range will be very difficult 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.090
 being able to hit an opponent because 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.040
 really there will be a 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.269
 a really higher bullet than 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.500
 that of a sniper rifle and therefore 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.239
 it will be enough to get used to another 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.069
 feature of this package consists of 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.959
 in the new mode introduced that yes 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.840
 will call scavenger translated into Italian 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.310
 sweeper which is a terrible thing to da 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.799
 to pronounce is the name of a mode 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.479
 called scavengers do not like 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.560
 let's say I'm not at all well anyway 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.669
 apart from this in this new mode 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.449
 our only purpose will be to 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.240
 to survive 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.940
 so you basically work like this 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.000
 parties set up a grenade with a gun 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.169
 a specialization and we say that there 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.210
 they are weapons from what I understand 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.639
 scattered around the map and then you will have to 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.880
 build a class 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.160
 as you live or obviously every 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.229
 once you die you always spawned 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.330
 with a gun a grenade is one 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.760
 ssis specialization the reset was always 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.840
 so it doesn't matter if you play a lot 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.460
 of time you will not have anything more 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.260
 compared to the one I never played 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.300
 to this mode because it is not 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.760
 you will be able to hold back areas with the weapons you had 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.800
 collected before your death and then 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.560
 we say that it is confirmed as something 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.900
 interesting a survival against the 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.930
 real people and not against bot 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.729
 let's say something I don't think is 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.979
 I still don't want to say bullshit 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.389
 because maybe we have already seen it in 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.599
 some other game maybe not 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.820
 I know though this really 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.430
 modality were thus that is not 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.080
 had nothing to do with some 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.540
 other modality however from some other 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.950
 game similar things would be something 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.500
 interesting at least something that I don't 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.860
 I still saw especially if 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.930
 consider which battlefield between 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.210
 quotes is evolving to become 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.970
 a game that can range over many more 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.760
 mode rather than mode 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.280
 purely concerning the conquest or 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.580
 however, team play in this 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.080
 case be alone with a gun one 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.600
 grenade a specialization 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.290
 I don't know whether to take it as a change 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.660
 however, positive or negative is in December 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:05.100
 my judgment for now cannot yet 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.600
 say nothing however one last 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.640
 consideration should also be given to 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.920
 maps maps will talk a lot about it 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.630
 quickly from what I saw they have 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.980
 more or less the size of the maps of 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.990
 kroos cortes 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:22.240
 regarding the size in 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:24.220
 generally the extension however have a ci 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.200
 are open maps are not closed maps 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.200
 so maybe they'll leave a little more 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.620
 freedom of action, however, I cannot yet 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.240
 say a lot having not seen anyway 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.130
 lots of maps though not having them 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.070
 seen all here I saw only one 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.570
 so far so what they say 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.430
 developers will have exactly the same 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.870
 size of those miklos corte r's 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.020
 with the only difference that they will be 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.090
 just open anyway guys I hope 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.680
 that this comment in general 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.620
 generally sorry that the video is 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.170
 was your liking

 I thank you for your attention 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:00.520
 leave me from what I told you 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.170
 an opinion on aftermath if sites 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.700
 interested if you take it or not if 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.650
 you have the premium you are forced to 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.040
 take it but you wo n't play it let me 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.770
 know 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.300
 I thank you for your attention
