the vehicle right now

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.370 
the vehicle right now
we<00:02:54.590> need<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.860> different<00:02:55.040> angle<00:02:55.460> of<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.940> run<00:02:56.480> the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
we need a different angle of the run the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.630 
we need a different angle of the run the
show<00:02:57.620> here<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.160> can<00:02:58.280> do<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.370> bunch<00:02:58.580> of

show here so you can do a bunch of

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.550 
show here so you can do a bunch of
different<00:02:58.940> things<00:02:59.090> with<00:02:59.210> it<00:02:59.260> really<00:03:00.260> pushing

the bodies of connectivity with these

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.510 
the bodies of connectivity with these
pieces<00:03:02.000> were<00:03:02.300> really<00:03:02.600> trying<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.900> gain<00:03:03.520> moving

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
pieces were really trying to gain moving

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.150 
pieces were really trying to gain moving
in<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.850> new<00:03:05.150> direction<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.530> normally<00:03:06.710> see
