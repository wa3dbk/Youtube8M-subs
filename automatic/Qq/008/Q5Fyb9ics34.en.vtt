some stupid stuff and capitalize on that
little<00:00:49.320> bit<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.100> his<00:00:50.399> jab<00:00:50.700> pressure<00:00:51.090> once<00:00:51.420> he

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
little bit and his jab pressure once he

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240 
little bit and his jab pressure once he
does<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.960> her<00:00:52.079> down<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.680> actually<00:00:53.070> really

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
does get her down is actually really

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.709 
does get her down is actually really
strong<00:00:53.610> Viper<00:00:53.910> camp<00:00:54.239> doesn't<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.600> too<00:00:54.690> many

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
strong Viper camp doesn't have too many

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
strong Viper camp doesn't have too many
options<00:00:54.899> again<00:00:55.440> better<00:00:55.649> now<00:00:55.860> than<00:00:56.039> ever<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
options again better now than ever in

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.040 
options again better now than ever in
any<00:00:56.820> previous<00:00:57.090> game<00:00:57.449> yeah<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.870> more

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
any previous game yeah it's more

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.779 
any previous game yeah it's more
effective<00:00:58.289> she<00:00:58.620> has<00:00:58.710> less<00:00:59.100> options<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.609> try

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
effective she has less options to try

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.619 
effective she has less options to try
and<00:00:59.879> deal<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.239> than<00:01:00.390> she<00:01:00.510> had<00:01:00.600> before

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and deal with that than she had before

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.450 
and deal with that than she had before
so<00:01:01.140> food<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.770> worth<00:01:02.010> saying<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.340> this

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so food is worth saying that this

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.250 
so food is worth saying that this
matchup<00:01:02.760> has<00:01:02.789> probably<00:01:03.300> improved<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.719> bit<00:01:03.750> he

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
matchup has probably improved a bit he

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.479 
matchup has probably improved a bit he
got<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> lot<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> back<00:01:04.830> dash<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.460> I

like<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:03.940> focus<00:03:04.360> attackers<00:03:04.840> looks<00:03:05.200> like<00:03:05.320> it

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
like that focus attackers looks like it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.780 
like that focus attackers looks like it
was<00:03:05.500> going<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.709> be<00:03:05.799> out<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:05.920> range<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.640> even

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
was going to be out of range just even

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.880 
was going to be out of range just even
if<00:03:06.970> he<00:03:07.060> had<00:03:07.150> released<00:03:07.450> fully<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.680> worst

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
if he had released fully so the worst

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.930 
if he had released fully so the worst
case<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.310> mean<00:03:09.430> he<00:03:09.519> was<00:03:09.640> just<00:03:09.760> basically

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
case I mean he was just basically

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.090 
case I mean he was just basically
begging<00:03:10.420> for<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> bash<00:03:10.989> bunch<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.769> with<00:03:11.980> him

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
begging for a bash bunch and with him

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.740 
begging for a bash bunch and with him
with<00:03:12.250> super<00:03:12.459> full<00:03:12.610> super<00:03:12.940> it's<00:03:13.120> really<00:03:13.390> danger

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
with super full super it's really danger

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.210 
with super full super it's really danger
that<00:03:13.870> was<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.079> game<00:03:14.260> yeah<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:14.829> I<00:03:14.860> think<00:03:15.070> he<00:03:15.130> would

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
that was a game yeah so I think he would

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.650 
that was a game yeah so I think he would
just<00:03:15.400> frankly<00:03:15.850> out<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.060> position<00:03:16.209> with<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
just frankly out of position with the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.530 
just frankly out of position with the
viper<00:03:16.840> or<00:03:17.140> with<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.850> focus<00:03:18.850> attack<00:03:19.000> there<00:03:19.269> the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
viper or with the focus attack there the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.850 
viper or with the focus attack there the
teef<00:03:19.750> thinking<00:03:20.049> really<00:03:20.230> hard<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.680> see

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
teef thinking really hard you can see

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.490 
teef thinking really hard you can see
him<00:03:21.150> rubbing<00:03:22.150> his<00:03:22.390> forehead<00:03:22.600> as<00:03:23.049> hard<00:03:23.290> as<00:03:23.380> he

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
him rubbing his forehead as hard as he

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.759 
him rubbing his forehead as hard as he
can<00:03:23.680> yeah<00:03:24.930> as<00:03:25.930> he<00:03:26.140> know<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.290> he<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.680> got

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
can yeah as he know that he just got

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.080 
can yeah as he know that he just got
shut<00:03:26.980> down<00:03:27.040> it's<00:03:27.370> like<00:03:27.519> what<00:03:27.910> kind<00:03:28.060> of

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
shut down it's like what kind of

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.340 
shut down it's like what kind of
adjustment<00:03:28.510> do<00:03:28.570> i<00:03:28.600> need<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.840> make<00:03:28.959> here<00:03:29.200> and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
adjustment do i need to make here and

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.470 
adjustment do i need to make here and
again<00:03:29.890> i<00:03:29.920> think<00:03:30.130> if<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.940> count<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.299> burn

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
again i think if you count the burn

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.780 
again i think if you count the burn
kicks<00:03:31.750> per<00:03:31.959> match<00:03:32.200> their<00:03:32.640> dramatically<00:03:33.640> down

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
kicks per match their dramatically down

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.750 
kicks per match their dramatically down
and<00:03:34.239> got<00:03:34.390> around<00:03:34.630> versus<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.230> previous

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and got around versus the previous

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.580 
and got around versus the previous
winning<00:03:36.760> efforts<00:03:37.060> from<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.329> teeth<00:03:37.510> i<00:03:37.750> agree

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
winning efforts from the teeth i agree

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.009 
winning efforts from the teeth i agree
and<00:03:38.829> that's<00:03:39.790> not<00:03:40.150> just<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.450> consequence<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
and that's not just a consequence of the

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.420 
and that's not just a consequence of the
fact<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.260> he<00:03:41.410> lost<00:03:41.560> but<00:03:41.920> he<00:03:41.980> was<00:03:42.100> really<00:03:42.340> just

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
fact that he lost but he was really just

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
fact that he lost but he was really just
not<00:03:42.579> able<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.850> get<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.060> kind<00:03:43.239> of<00:03:43.269> pressure

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
not able to get that kind of pressure

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.630 
not able to get that kind of pressure
going<00:03:43.690> he<00:03:43.959> did<00:03:44.079> not<00:03:44.230> force<00:03:44.500> Balrogs<00:03:45.070> make<00:03:45.400> any

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
going he did not force Balrogs make any

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.880 
going he did not force Balrogs make any
it<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.750> really<00:03:46.959> guess<00:03:47.140> in<00:03:47.260> any<00:03:47.410> kind<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:47.620> mix-up

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
it to really guess in any kind of mix-up

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.220 
it to really guess in any kind of mix-up
situation<00:03:48.430> maybe<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:49.090> think<00:03:49.299> once<00:03:49.540> might<00:03:50.109> have

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
situation maybe I think once might have

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.680 
situation maybe I think once might have
been<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:51.310> he<00:03:51.400> had<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.609> block<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.820> really<00:03:52.660> a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
been the that he had to block a really a

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.539 
been the that he had to block a really a
mix-up<00:03:53.019> kind<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.290> burn<00:03:53.470> kick<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.370> that's

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
mix-up kind of burn kick and that's

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.830 
mix-up kind of burn kick and that's
obviously<00:03:54.790> not<00:03:55.120> going<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.390> be<00:03:55.450> able<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.660> get<00:03:55.750> it

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
obviously not going to be able to get it

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.539 
obviously not going to be able to get it
done<00:03:55.959> but<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.470> think<00:03:56.560> he<00:03:56.799> might<00:03:56.950> need<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.310> just

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
done but I think he might need to just

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.370 
done but I think he might need to just
turn<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:57.880> up<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.120> little<00:03:58.299> bit<00:03:58.450> more<00:03:58.780> even<00:03:59.200> though

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
turn it up a little bit more even though

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.880 
turn it up a little bit more even though
he<00:03:59.530> did<00:03:59.709> get<00:03:59.799> shut<00:04:00.040> down<00:04:00.070> he

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
he did get shut down he

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.800 
he did get shut down he
need<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.280> make<00:04:01.520> it<00:04:01.670> happen<00:04:02.000> no<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:02.480> got<00:04:02.600> if<00:04:02.690> you

the time that's when you can push them
towards<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.270> corner<00:04:11.530> that's<00:04:12.530> when<00:04:12.740> you<00:04:12.800> can

towards the corner that's when you can

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.440 
towards the corner that's when you can

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
start advancing on the ground open up

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.180 
start advancing on the ground open up
those<00:04:14.569> kind<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:14.870> other<00:04:15.020> possibilities<00:04:15.650> but<00:04:15.980> if

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
those kind of other possibilities but if

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.170 
those kind of other possibilities but if
you're<00:04:16.340> willing<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.640> just<00:04:16.820> surrender<00:04:17.030> that

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
you're willing to just surrender that

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.819 
you're willing to just surrender that
and<00:04:17.390> be<00:04:17.450> like<00:04:17.600> oh<00:04:17.810> he's<00:04:18.019> got<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.320> air<00:04:18.440> covered

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
and be like oh he's got the air covered

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.670 
and be like oh he's got the air covered
what<00:04:19.669> can<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:19.910> do<00:04:19.970> yeah<00:04:20.450> then<00:04:20.810> then<00:04:21.470> you're

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
what can I do yeah then then you're

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.230 
what can I do yeah then then you're
going<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:21.859> get<00:04:22.040> stuck<00:04:22.520> on<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.730> ground<00:04:22.970> and

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
going to get stuck on the ground and

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.640 
going to get stuck on the ground and
that's<00:04:23.390> obviously<00:04:23.660> not<00:04:24.080> where<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.470> Viper

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
that's obviously not where the Viper
