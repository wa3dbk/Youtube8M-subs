00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.750
 whiskey de meeting point fine spirits 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.040
 Welcome to the Risk is a 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.730
 meeting place of the ghosts and today 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.539
 I have American whiskey again 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 brought and indeed the and fitzgerald 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.449
 very special twelve years old twelve years old 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.039
 is for a bit much 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.130
 because most American whiskeys 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.899
 By law, you only have two years in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.149
 oak trees in spite of tires and most 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.370
 mature now three to four years 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.640
 he has been twelve years behind this 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.649
 a whole lot is then very much 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.710
 strong flavors because the rich as 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.899
 p.diddy use are through this 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.160
 Stock exchanges first filled so there is one 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.079
 a lot of freight out yes and here 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.219
 is now on it destille at olt 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.530
 fitzgerald distillery incorporated 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.629
 distillery has no franking nja or 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:21.750
 no burning does not burn because 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:22.890
 this itself in laws so advertising 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.020
 you do not have to be together here now 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.030
 make and I have already totally 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.490
 full and here you can exactly 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.229
 is looking up at the top of the cards 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.659
 had taken a hit and there but 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.890
 Seen and therefore we have now 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.790
 not sent to our customers 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.060
 but we open it here now 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.040
 and yes, if I am here now 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.570
 take better because this plastic there 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.600
 is violent drumrum 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.640
 Now let's hope I'm here 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.640
 get on properly 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.390
 Here is what it injects 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.619
 Thank god not to my please 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.810
 but only span will be on this 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.569
 and if I then with one 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.569
 corkscrew must make up for the cards 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.069
 Corkscrew to this screw cap 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.410
 there was somebody in the production process 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.300
 He was not really on it 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.190
 make like that and put it on a diagonal 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.760
 then you can only say 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.200
 screw cap commodity the broke 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.340
 his machine has been twisted 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.680
 maybe one of them is something 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.799
 bored is the screw connection 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.080
 screwed 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:58.670
 who now close the special on the all 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:00.110
 fitz is that he has 21 percent wheat 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.269
 mission has been in the grain mix 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.400
 Kentucky Straight Bourbon is different than 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.989
 sweaty marty not that one 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.329
 Cereal made from several 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.459
 operate there is typically mostly 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.640
 and at least half 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.920
 so you say he has to wheat 51 percent 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.269
 they usually have it in there 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.030
 have so she knows at all 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.090
 may be mentioned and the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.670
 remaining 49 percent then divide 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.420
 mostly on corn again on this but 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.120
 barley and wheat 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.160
 Tomorrow must always be there in the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.530
 Grain mix secret recipes 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.040
 20 % of them are part of it 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.140
 in 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.940
 usually through then typically at 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.310
 60 or 70 percent lie and the 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.460
 remaining 10 15 percent are likely 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.110
 then filled up with barley 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.910
 typically if you have one 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.620
 Whiskey has wheat or a whiskey then 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.870
 Do not you give so many eyes because 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.110
 you want to do something with the wheat 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.230
 you want a bad tenderness 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.090
 effect 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.350
 and if at the same time, rock too 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.640
 would put if you at the same time the 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.140
 produce root 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.240
 so you typically either set 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.790
 rye or wheat to and that makes the 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:15.070
 whiskey will be without soft this 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:20.650
 whiskey half so that's twelve years 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:23.170
 for a grateful an eternity and 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.670
 of the installation-date the 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:31.140
 patches what we have right now 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.140
 that was on 29 09 1990 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:43.580
 a lot of caramel apple fruitiness 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.820
 behind it underneath 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:58.450
 light up yesterday's note on this 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.560
 adhesive some people say but 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:05.760
 not too strong now only very lightly 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.390
 wonderfully reconnects and to 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.500
 maybe stop 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:25.720
 from the armchair with leather properly after 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:29.140
 It is made of plastic but to 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.580
 yesterday in the flower street as not so 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.920
 easy on flowers but one 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.810
 heavy bouquet of the bouquet of the 15th 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.540
 percent how many stay that have it 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.470
 So really steam with it and 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.470
 Horn already try it 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:10.150
 vanilla honey the background of his 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.940
 ease 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.940
 these are the twelve years in oak barrels 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.949
 that has its influence even if 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.360
 that once no one is wise that was that 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.849
 It is not that bitter 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.690
 but dates also has twelve years 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.729
 There are a few beautiful ones she is asked 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:32.530
 departure is now slowly beginning 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:37.380
 fade and arrive with louis is here 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.380
 because there is a little bit everything about it 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:45.509
 and this is the red passes 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:07:01.740
 then comes a bunch of flowers again 

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:06.289
 more interesting one of the old and 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:09.749
 at the same time still affordable it 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:12.779
 just over 30 euros or not even 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:16.680
 35 euros before so there you get it 

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:18.689
 offered for his money unfortunately so that at 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.120
 the kentucky straight burtons us 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:23.129
 to do something difficult with the replenishment 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.270
 somehow I realized that the 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:26.039
 want to stay German north 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.259
 there is not so much about it 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:30.569
 would like to have and if you can find and 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:32.370
 want to have and at the same time to otherwise 

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:35.550
 It can take a lot of time in which to do it 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:37.889
 and of course in the certificate he says 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.899
 has tried everything clearly 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:41.339
 Well, I'm glad that with spectators 

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:44.959
 i am happy if you stay here again 

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:44.959
