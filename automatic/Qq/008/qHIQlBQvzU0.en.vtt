00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
one evidently box so for Japan I think

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.580 
one evidently box so for Japan I think
they<00:01:46.740> had<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> buy<00:01:47.689> like<00:01:48.689> each<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.049> was<00:01:49.470> like

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
