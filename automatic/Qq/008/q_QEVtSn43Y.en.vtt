00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.940
 since I've been asked many times how 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.990
 Sewing a heater, I show it 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.960
 now time first you need two 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.050
 stretchable fabrics scissors or rolf 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.770
 Tailor and pen and possibly also 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.269
 a sewing pattern 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.269
 I have to go without the fabrics 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:45.430
 wallpaper nonwovens berlin i introduced 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:54.310
 me off and once jersey for 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:56.160
 outside and always two sides so 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:02.530
 a lot of pieces of fabric weeks in total 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.260
 I want to put it on each other for a short time 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.680
 you did not slip when 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.680
 to cut 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.440
 so 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.080
 then you should also cut patterns 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.380
 I link in the Sunday morning in the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.380
 infobox 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.030
 he is out 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.600
 so 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.970
 then take the fabrics once 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.270
 fleece and ahlmann jersey right on 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.270
 right 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.569
 and so long as you are up here 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.230
 here the dogs stay the pages 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.230
 both up 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:29.270
 even turned on the wall as the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.270
 Components components when looking to the right 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.300
 and then you 're so intertwined 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.019
 that the fabrics in is the star fabric 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.349
 the street 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.910
 and who flies that the team because 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.910
 lie on each other like that 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.370
 So flows the jersey flows but looks 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.909
 that the next one exactly 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.909
 lie 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.370
 so 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.250
 we have this in jersey and so many times 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:39.860
 the tile on the nonwoven fabric and have 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:45.510
 quasi yet we take now once 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.930
 around the now take once 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.960
 all around on the other side exactly 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.120
 the same only that I may side 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.190
 by flowing a small turning opening 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.190
 you can even can turn good 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:22.090
 that I have a small opening now 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:24.870
 if hope through this little turn 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.870
 we all now 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.340
 can 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.340
 a 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.230
 whether we are all right with us 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:57.940
 let's close the little turn here 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.940
 I want to open the machine 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.360

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:32.700

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:35.630
