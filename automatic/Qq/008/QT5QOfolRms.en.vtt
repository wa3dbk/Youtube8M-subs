okay<00:03:16.730> doesn't<00:03:17.360> look<00:03:17.480> good<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:17.959> far<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:20.319> we<00:03:21.319> could

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
okay doesn't look good so far I we could

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.050 
okay doesn't look good so far I we could
see<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> lot<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:21.980> these<00:03:22.190> black<00:03:22.760> squares<00:03:23.180> let's

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
see a lot of these black squares let's

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.149 
see a lot of these black squares let's
doesn't<00:03:26.060> look<00:03:26.269> too<00:03:26.959> too<00:03:27.290> bad<00:03:29.590> now<00:03:30.590> remember<00:03:30.860> I

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
doesn't look too too bad now remember I

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.720 
doesn't look too too bad now remember I
backed<00:03:31.970> off<00:03:32.120> my<00:03:32.330> settings<00:03:32.810> from<00:03:33.019> shader

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
backed off my settings from shader

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.289 
backed off my settings from shader
five-point<00:03:34.810> 02<00:03:35.810> shader<00:03:36.110> three-point<00:03:37.299> shooter

five-point<00:03:39.230> oh<00:03:39.349> this<00:03:39.590> black<00:03:39.980> squares<00:03:40.400> are

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
five-point oh this black squares are

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.119 
five-point oh this black squares are
still<00:03:40.910> here<00:03:41.470> by<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.530> way<00:03:42.680> I'm<00:03:42.769> running<00:03:42.829> a

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
still here by the way I'm running a

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.399 
still here by the way I'm running a
crossfire<00:03:43.610> setup<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:44.420> this<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:44.780> probably<00:03:45.079> only

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
crossfire setup so this is probably only

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.160 
crossfire setup so this is probably only
applicable<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:46.220> crossfire<00:03:46.640> users<00:03:47.090> not<00:03:47.900> really

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
applicable to crossfire users not really

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:57.490 
applicable to crossfire users not really
to<00:03:48.319> anyone<00:03:48.680> else<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:51.940> 8.1<00:03:52.940> seems<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:54.200> have<00:03:56.500> fix

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
to anyone else so 8.1 seems to have fix

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.789 
to anyone else so 8.1 seems to have fix
the<00:03:57.769> problem<00:03:58.510> I'm<00:03:59.510> not<00:03:59.660> sure<00:03:59.720> though<00:04:00.170> let's

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
the problem I'm not sure though let's

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.199 
the problem I'm not sure though let's
see<00:04:01.040> let's<00:04:01.579> start<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:02.030> battle<00:04:04.060> I'm<00:04:05.060> getting

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
see let's start this battle I'm getting

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:12.180 
see let's start this battle I'm getting
pretty<00:04:05.480> good<00:04:05.599> frames<00:04:06.079> 100<00:04:06.859> Oh<00:04:07.129> what<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.299> this<00:04:08.660> I

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.430 

spoke<00:04:13.190> too<00:04:13.370> soon<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:14.890> saw<00:04:15.890> these<00:04:16.039> blacks

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
spoke too soon I saw these blacks

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.000 
spoke too soon I saw these blacks
squares<00:04:18.440> in<00:04:19.599> the<00:04:20.599> shader<00:04:21.260> five<00:04:21.620> point<00:04:21.919> 0

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.500 
squares in the shader five point 0
setting<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:24.370> then<00:04:25.370> I<00:04:25.639> realized<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.270> they

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
setting and then I realized that they

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.350 
setting and then I realized that they
had<00:04:26.539> fixed<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.080> for<00:04:27.229> shader<00:04:27.470> 3.0<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:28.490> i<00:04:28.760> made

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
had fixed it for shader 3.0 so i made

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.300 
had fixed it for shader 3.0 so i made
this<00:04:29.479> video<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:32.020> i<00:04:33.020> changed<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.650> or<00:04:33.830> i<00:04:33.889> change

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
this video and i changed it or i change

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.580 
this video and i changed it or i change
it<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.550> shader<00:04:34.880> 3.1<00:04:35.510> i<00:04:35.539> made<00:04:35.780> this<00:04:35.930> video<00:04:36.169> not

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
it to shader 3.1 i made this video not

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.290 
it to shader 3.1 i made this video not
really<00:04:36.620> expecting<00:04:37.160> not<00:04:37.610> really<00:04:37.849> knowing<00:04:38.030> what

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
really expecting not really knowing what

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.670 
really expecting not really knowing what
to<00:04:38.450> expect<00:04:39.220> but<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:41.780> looks<00:04:42.050> like<00:04:42.139> it's<00:04:42.440> still

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
to expect but it looks like it's still

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.909 
to expect but it looks like it's still
there<00:04:42.919> it's<00:04:43.099> not<00:04:43.400> nearly<00:04:43.940> as<00:04:44.150> bad<00:04:44.570> as<00:04:44.900> what<00:04:45.740> it

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
there it's not nearly as bad as what it

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.150 
there it's not nearly as bad as what it
was<00:04:46.070> before<00:04:46.930> that's<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:48.200> that's<00:04:48.410> an<00:04:48.620> absolute

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
was before that's a that's an absolute

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.240 
was before that's a that's an absolute
fact<00:04:50.349> game<00:04:51.349> plays<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.620> lot<00:04:51.889> smoother<00:04:54.220> again<00:04:55.220> I

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
fact game plays a lot smoother again I

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.029 
fact game plays a lot smoother again I
don't<00:04:55.400> have<00:04:55.780> thousands<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:56.990> units<00:04:57.349> on<00:04:57.620> screen

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
don't have thousands of units on screen

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.250 
don't have thousands of units on screen
but<00:04:58.150> hey<00:04:59.150> look<00:04:59.630> there's<00:04:59.930> another<00:05:00.169> one<00:05:02.260> it's

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
but hey look there's another one it's

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.540 
but hey look there's another one it's
not<00:05:03.590> that<00:05:03.919> bad

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.740 

so<00:05:11.180> we've<00:05:11.360> got<00:05:11.570> all<00:05:11.720> kinds<00:05:11.750> of<00:05:13.450> arrows<00:05:14.450> being

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
so we've got all kinds of arrows being

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.920 
so we've got all kinds of arrows being
thrown<00:05:15.170> it's<00:05:15.950> pretty<00:05:16.250> smooth<00:05:16.610> I<00:05:16.970> gotta<00:05:17.690> say

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
thrown it's pretty smooth I gotta say

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
thrown it's pretty smooth I gotta say
it's<00:05:18.620> a<00:05:18.710> lot<00:05:18.920> smoother<00:05:19.340> than<00:05:20.950> they've

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
it's a lot smoother than they've

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.890 
it's a lot smoother than they've
definitely<00:05:22.280> made<00:05:22.940> huge<00:05:23.450> strides<00:05:23.810> in<00:05:25.900> fixing

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
definitely made huge strides in fixing

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:35.890 
definitely made huge strides in fixing
the<00:05:28.900> performance

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.790 

now<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:36.930> don't<00:05:37.199> have<00:05:37.409> the<00:05:37.590> blood<00:05:38.189> and<00:05:38.220> gore<00:05:38.490> pack

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
now I don't have the blood and gore pack

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:48.529 
now I don't have the blood and gore pack
installed<00:05:43.189> um<00:05:45.979> but<00:05:46.979> yeah<00:05:47.189> it's<00:05:47.520> it's<00:05:48.090> looking

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
installed um but yeah it's it's looking

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:55.129 
installed um but yeah it's it's looking
it's<00:05:48.930> not<00:05:49.139> looking<00:05:49.500> at<00:05:49.650> that<00:05:50.330> so<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.810> mean<00:05:54.139> okay

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
it's not looking at that so I mean okay

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:01.309 
it's not looking at that so I mean okay
I<00:05:55.379> guess<00:05:55.800> this<00:05:55.979> is<00:05:56.189> a<00:05:56.219> victory<00:05:56.490> for<00:05:56.810> CA<00:05:58.819> I<00:06:00.319> have

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
I guess this is a victory for CA I have

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.360 
I guess this is a victory for CA I have
to<00:06:01.469> commend<00:06:01.650> them<00:06:02.159> they've<00:06:02.699> made<00:06:03.979> strides<00:06:04.979> in

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
to commend them they've made strides in

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.040 
to commend them they've made strides in
the<00:06:05.400> right<00:06:05.610> direction<00:06:05.789> they're<00:06:06.659> not<00:06:06.810> quite

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
the right direction they're not quite
