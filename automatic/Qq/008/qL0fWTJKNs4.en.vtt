hopefully I can reach it yeah it looks

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.640 
hopefully I can reach it yeah it looks
like<00:00:11.610> I'll<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:11.969> able<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:16.080> purpose<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
like I'll be able to the purpose of a

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.720 
like I'll be able to the purpose of a
swarm<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.400> reproduce<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.140> method

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
swarm is to reproduce it's the method

swarm is to reproduce it's the method
the<00:00:20.730> bees<00:00:20.939> used<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.980> split<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.189> half<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
the bees used to split in half and

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.550 
the bees used to split in half and
create<00:00:25.680> more<00:00:25.830> colonies<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.470> quarter<00:00:28.470> to

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
create more colonies and so quarter to

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.679 
create more colonies and so quarter to
half<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> bees<00:00:29.130> will<00:00:29.550> leave<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.300> old<00:00:30.390> hive

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
half of the bees will leave the old hive

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.170 
half of the bees will leave the old hive
with<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> old<00:00:31.380> Queen<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> they<00:00:32.759> will<00:00:32.940> they'll

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
with the old Queen and they will they'll

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.740 
with the old Queen and they will they'll
move<00:00:33.360> into<00:00:33.570> another<00:00:33.989> tree<00:00:34.469> or<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.489> wall<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
move into another tree or a wall or a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.479 
move into another tree or a wall or a
mailbox<00:00:37.260> or<00:00:37.530> someplace<00:00:37.890> they<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
mailbox or someplace they think is a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.630 
mailbox or someplace they think is a
nice<00:00:38.730> cozy<00:00:39.300> dry<00:00:39.600> home<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.280> then<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.399> will

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
nice cozy dry home and then they will

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
nice cozy dry home and then they will
start<00:00:42.270> building<00:00:42.570> new<00:00:42.600> combs<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.379> they'll

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
start building new combs and they'll

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.350 
start building new combs and they'll
start<00:00:44.160> raising<00:00:44.399> young<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.000> they'll<00:00:45.180> start

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
start raising young and they'll start

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.990 
start raising young and they'll start
over<00:00:45.600> again<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.430> like<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> spray<00:00:47.850> them<00:00:47.969> with

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
over again I like to spray them with

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.479 
over again I like to spray them with
water<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.809> sugar<00:00:49.350> water<00:00:49.649> or<00:00:49.920> something<00:00:50.280> first

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
water or sugar water or something first

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.970 
water or sugar water or something first
so<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> when<00:00:51.120> when<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> knock<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.680> into<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so that when when I knock them into the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.229 
so that when when I knock them into the
box<00:00:53.219> they're<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.610> gonna<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.820> able<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> fly

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
box they're not gonna be able to fly

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.660 
box they're not gonna be able to fly
very<00:00:54.539> easily<00:00:54.780> otherwise<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.980> end<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.520> half

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
very easily otherwise I end up with half

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.849 
very easily otherwise I end up with half
the<00:00:56.820> colony<00:00:57.539> flying<00:00:57.989> around<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.680> takes

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the colony flying around and it takes

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.790 
the colony flying around and it takes
twice<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.129> long<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.640> them<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> buck

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
twice as long to get them in the buck

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.540 
twice as long to get them in the buck
generally<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.100> they're<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.280> going<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
generally that they're not going to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
generally that they're not going to
swarm<00:01:02.879> unless<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.329> spring<00:01:04.049> unless<00:01:04.409> there's

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
swarm unless it's spring unless there's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.039 
swarm unless it's spring unless there's
just<00:01:04.799> forage<00:01:05.159> available<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.150> now<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
just forage available so right now in in

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
just forage available so right now in in
Portland<00:01:07.500> Oregon<00:01:07.619> there's<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> lot<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.610> flowers

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
Portland Oregon there's a lot of flowers

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.609 
Portland Oregon there's a lot of flowers
blooming<00:01:09.689> there's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> lot<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.290> food<00:01:10.470> available

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
blooming there's a lot of food available

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
blooming there's a lot of food available
and<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.909> also<00:01:12.060> need<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.689> sunny<00:01:12.930> they

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and they also need it to be sunny they

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530 
and they also need it to be sunny they
need<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:14.700> at<00:01:14.790> least<00:01:14.909> 55

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
need it to be you know at least 55

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
need it to be you know at least 55
degrees<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.560> today<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> think<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.280> around<00:01:17.490> 60

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
degrees so today I think it's around 60

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.510 
degrees so today I think it's around 60
low<00:01:18.630> 60s<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.950> today's<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> very<00:01:20.340> good

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
low 60s right now so today's a very good

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.080 
low 60s right now so today's a very good
day<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.240> swarm

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
day for them to swarm

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.940 
day for them to swarm
so<00:01:24.090> next<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.570> gonna<00:01:24.840> drop<00:01:25.439> him<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.740> for

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
so next I'm just gonna drop him in for

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
so next I'm just gonna drop him in for
the<00:01:26.009> box<00:01:27.530> it's<00:01:28.530> only<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:28.979> taller

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:52.370 

here<00:01:40.600> we<00:01:40.660> go

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.560 

so<00:01:52.920> hopefully<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.369> Queens<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:53.970> we'll

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
so hopefully the Queens in here we'll

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.090 
so hopefully the Queens in here we'll
know<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.930> couple<00:01:55.080> minutes<00:01:55.290> whether<00:01:55.680> she<00:01:55.979> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
know in a couple minutes whether she is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.810 
know in a couple minutes whether she is
and<00:01:57.229> if<00:01:58.229> she<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.650> they<00:01:59.220> should<00:01:59.400> stay<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.729> this

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
and if she is they should stay in this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.210 
and if she is they should stay in this
box<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:01.049> she's<00:02:01.259> not<00:02:01.409> they're<00:02:01.680> gonna<00:02:01.770> fly<00:02:02.040> right

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
box if she's not they're gonna fly right

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.340 
box if she's not they're gonna fly right
back<00:02:02.400> up<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> branch<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.479> we'll<00:02:04.110> start

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
back up to that branch and we'll start

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.530 
back up to that branch and we'll start
over<00:02:04.530> again<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:05.729> scouts<00:02:06.000> are<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.240> flying

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
over again the scouts are all flying

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.210 
over again the scouts are all flying
around<00:02:06.780> right<00:02:06.960> now<00:02:07.229> looking<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.890> new<00:02:07.920> home

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
around right now looking for a new home

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.660 
around right now looking for a new home
and<00:02:09.470> they<00:02:10.470> didn't<00:02:10.770> get<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.979> memo<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.280> their

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
and they didn't get the memo that their

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.090 
and they didn't get the memo that their
colony<00:02:12.120> was<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.420> dropped<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> box<00:02:13.140> so

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
colony was just dropped in a box so

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.559 
colony was just dropped in a box so
they're<00:02:14.310> gonna<00:02:14.400> return<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.300> branch

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
they're gonna return to that branch

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.510 
they're gonna return to that branch
where<00:02:15.930> they<00:02:16.050> had<00:02:16.140> left<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.890> hopefully

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
where they had left and hopefully

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.920 
where they had left and hopefully
they'll<00:02:17.730> catch<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.000> whiff<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.870> that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
they'll catch the whiff of that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.170 
they'll catch the whiff of that
pheromone<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:20.340> bees<00:02:20.489> below<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.030> they'll

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
pheromone of the bees below and they'll

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.170 
pheromone of the bees below and they'll
they'll<00:02:21.510> move<00:02:21.660> down<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.819> see<00:02:23.940> some<00:02:24.150> of

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
they'll move down you can see some of

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.110 
they'll move down you can see some of
the<00:02:24.300> bees<00:02:25.160> with<00:02:26.160> their<00:02:26.310> rear<00:02:26.489> ends<00:02:26.790> up<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the bees with their rear ends up in the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.720 
the bees with their rear ends up in the
air<00:02:27.239> like<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:28.050> one<00:02:28.260> they<00:02:29.069> have<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> pheromone

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
air like that one they have a pheromone

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.000 
air like that one they have a pheromone
and<00:02:30.090> their<00:02:30.269> rear<00:02:30.480> end<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.200> pumping<00:02:31.890> that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
and their rear end and it's pumping that

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.220 
and their rear end and it's pumping that
pheromone<00:02:32.459> up<00:02:32.670> into<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.000> air<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.900> tells<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
pheromone up into the air it tells the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.580 
pheromone up into the air it tells the
other<00:02:34.350> bees<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.489> are<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.989> think<00:02:36.989> we<00:02:37.230> got

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
other bees here we are I think we got

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.530 
other bees here we are I think we got
them<00:02:37.709> though<00:02:37.860> because<00:02:38.300> there's<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.390> many

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
them though because there's that many

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.309 
them though because there's that many
bees<00:02:40.100> up<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.430> branch<00:02:42.080> we<00:02:43.080> would<00:02:43.230> have

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
bees up on that branch we would have

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.620 
bees up on that branch we would have
known<00:02:43.440> very<00:02:43.470> quickly<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.269> know<00:02:45.390> all

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
known very quickly that you know all

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.120 
known very quickly that you know all
those<00:02:45.870> bees<00:02:46.049> would<00:02:46.319> be<00:02:46.380> back<00:02:46.530> up<00:02:46.709> there<00:02:46.920> if<00:02:47.010> we

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
those bees would be back up there if we

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.370 
those bees would be back up there if we
didn't<00:02:47.370> get<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.640> Queen<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.390> that's<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.230> good

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
didn't get that Queen so that's a good

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.800 
didn't get that Queen so that's a good
sign<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.890> once<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.910> swarm<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.299> settled<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
sign so once this swarm is settled and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.600 
sign so once this swarm is settled and
once<00:02:52.019> they<00:02:52.170> start<00:02:52.410> building<00:02:52.739> some<00:02:52.920> combs<00:02:53.190> I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
once they start building some combs I

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.150 
once they start building some combs I
will<00:02:54.180> inspect<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.989> combs<00:02:55.200> I'll<00:02:55.470> look<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:55.830> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
will inspect the combs I'll look for the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.890 
will inspect the combs I'll look for the
signs<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> laying<00:02:57.000> Queen<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.600> healthy

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
signs of a laying Queen and a healthy

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.470 
signs of a laying Queen and a healthy
colony<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> will<00:02:59.610> let<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.910> next

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
colony and then I will let the next

colony and then I will let the next
person<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:00.989> my<00:03:01.140> swarm<00:03:01.470> queue<00:03:01.739> know<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.220> their

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
person in my swarm queue know that their

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.009 
person in my swarm queue know that their
bees<00:03:03.060> are<00:03:03.239> ready<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.600> they'll<00:03:03.840> come<00:03:03.989> pick

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
bees are ready and they'll come pick

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.360 
bees are ready and they'll come pick
them<00:03:04.230> up<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.590> put<00:03:04.769> them<00:03:04.829> in<00:03:04.980> their<00:03:05.100> own<00:03:05.130> hive

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
them up and put them in their own hive

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.699 
them up and put them in their own hive
I'm<00:03:06.150> doing<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.540> because<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.959> have<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.440> lot<00:03:07.620> of

these<00:03:32.489> bees<00:03:32.730> for<00:03:32.970> instance<00:03:33.269> have<00:03:33.480> been<00:03:33.510> living

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
these bees for instance have been living

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.140 
these bees for instance have been living
in<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.350> log<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:34.890> their<00:03:35.250> own<00:03:35.370> for<00:03:35.670> at<00:03:35.730> least<00:03:35.850> two

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
in a log on their own for at least two

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.390 
in a log on their own for at least two
or<00:03:36.269> three<00:03:36.299> years<00:03:36.620> they've<00:03:37.620> had<00:03:37.650> no<00:03:37.980> medication

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
or three years they've had no medication

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.520 
or three years they've had no medication
they've<00:03:38.760> had<00:03:38.880> no<00:03:39.030> treatments<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.410> it

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
they've had no treatments and so it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.990 
they've had no treatments and so it
makes<00:03:40.650> them<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:40.890> very<00:03:41.130> good<00:03:41.220> candidate<00:03:41.790> to

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
makes them a very good candidate to

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.699 
makes them a very good candidate to
actually<00:03:42.660> start<00:03:42.930> your<00:03:43.079> own<00:03:43.140> hive<00:03:43.410> because

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
actually start your own hive because

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.440 
actually start your own hive because
they're<00:03:43.920> not<00:03:44.040> gonna<00:03:44.310> be<00:03:44.459> reliant<00:03:44.790> on<00:03:45.030> all<00:03:45.239> of

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
they're not gonna be reliant on all of

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.289 
they're not gonna be reliant on all of
those<00:03:45.660> might<00:03:46.650> asides<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.430> insecticides<00:03:48.150> that

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
those might asides and insecticides that

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.000 
those might asides and insecticides that
most<00:03:48.870> beekeepers<00:03:49.350> are<00:03:49.440> pouring<00:03:49.739> into<00:03:49.859> their

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
most beekeepers are pouring into their

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.400 
most beekeepers are pouring into their
hives<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:51.150> I've<00:03:51.299> personally<00:03:51.810> found<00:03:52.170> that

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
hives so I've personally found that

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.400 
hives so I've personally found that
swarms<00:03:52.859> for<00:03:53.400> me<00:03:53.519> do<00:03:53.819> much<00:03:54.120> better<00:03:54.390> than<00:03:54.480> any

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
swarms for me do much better than any

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.400 
swarms for me do much better than any

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
packages or bees purchased from breeders

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.830 
packages or bees purchased from breeders
down<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.819> southern<00:04:00.090> United<00:04:00.449> States

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
down in the southern United States

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.380 
down in the southern United States
I<00:04:03.380> think<00:04:04.380> hobbyist<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.430> sideline<00:04:05.850> beekeepers

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
I think hobbyist and sideline beekeepers

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.020 
I think hobbyist and sideline beekeepers
like<00:04:06.540> myself<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.230> about<00:04:07.410> 25<00:04:07.800> Ives<00:04:08.069> I<00:04:08.370> think

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
like myself I have about 25 Ives I think

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.690 
like myself I have about 25 Ives I think
we<00:04:09.120> have<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.270> unique<00:04:09.569> opportunity<00:04:09.720> to

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
we have a unique opportunity to

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.580 
we have a unique opportunity to
experiment<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:12.360> try<00:04:12.569> different<00:04:12.780> methods<00:04:13.260> to

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
experiment to try different methods to

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.310 
experiment to try different methods to
try<00:04:13.830> not<00:04:14.520> using<00:04:14.970> these<00:04:15.090> medications<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:16.139> see

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
try not using these medications to see

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.020 
try not using these medications to see
if<00:04:16.380> we<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:16.590> create<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.889> stronger<00:04:17.280> gene<00:04:17.609> pool<00:04:17.820> to

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
if we can create a stronger gene pool to

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.879 
if we can create a stronger gene pool to
create<00:04:18.450> better<00:04:18.720> genetics<00:04:19.230> in<00:04:19.500> our<00:04:19.650> bees

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
create better genetics in our bees

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.830 
create better genetics in our bees
because<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:20.820> think<00:04:21.000> that's<00:04:21.120> gonna<00:04:21.239> be<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.450> only

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
because I think that's gonna be the only

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.090 
because I think that's gonna be the only
you<00:04:22.560> know<00:04:22.790> sustainable<00:04:23.790> solution<00:04:24.980> to<00:04:25.980> help

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
you know sustainable solution to help

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.680 
you know sustainable solution to help
beekeeping<00:04:26.610> without<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.450> we're<00:04:27.570> gonna

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
beekeeping without it we're gonna

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.680 
beekeeping without it we're gonna
continue<00:04:28.260> down<00:04:28.650> this<00:04:28.770> path<00:04:28.830> of<00:04:29.690> medication

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
continue down this path of medication

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.360 
continue down this path of medication
and<00:04:30.870> treatments<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.470> we're<00:04:32.040> gonna<00:04:32.130> continue

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
and treatments and we're gonna continue

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.000 
and treatments and we're gonna continue
to<00:04:32.580> watch<00:04:32.760> these<00:04:33.030> tremendous<00:04:33.570> losses<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.200> I

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
to watch these tremendous losses and I

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.530 
to watch these tremendous losses and I
mean<00:04:35.160> beekeepers<00:04:35.580> just<00:04:35.760> pump<00:04:35.940> millions<00:04:36.390> of

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
mean beekeepers just pump millions of

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.340 
mean beekeepers just pump millions of
dollars<00:04:36.900> every<00:04:36.930> year<00:04:37.460> into<00:04:38.540> these<00:04:39.540> treatments

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
dollars every year into these treatments

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.430 
dollars every year into these treatments
and<00:04:40.650> I<00:04:41.550> don't<00:04:42.090> need<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.419> use<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.230> saves

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
and I don't need to use it and it saves

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.040 
and I don't need to use it and it saves
me<00:04:43.590> money<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.980> saves<00:04:44.100> me<00:04:44.280> time<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.960> know

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
me money it saves me time and you know

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.320 
me money it saves me time and you know
now<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.410> have<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.650> honeybee<00:04:47.310> population<00:04:47.910> in<00:04:48.210> my

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
now I have a honeybee population in my

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.570 
now I have a honeybee population in my
own<00:04:48.450> apiary<00:04:48.870> that<00:04:49.140> is<00:04:49.740> much<00:04:50.040> stronger<00:04:50.340> than

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
own apiary that is much stronger than

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.460 
own apiary that is much stronger than
three<00:04:50.850> years<00:04:51.000> ago<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.510> mean<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.840> first<00:04:52.080> season

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
three years ago I mean the first season

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.850 
three years ago I mean the first season
when<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.680> started<00:04:53.220> with<00:04:54.210> twenty<00:04:54.540> hives<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:55.140> had

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
when I started with twenty hives I had

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.340 
when I started with twenty hives I had
about<00:04:56.100> 50%<00:04:56.430> loss<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.210> first<00:04:57.419> winter<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:58.169> the

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
about 50% loss the first winter and the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.310 
about 50% loss the first winter and the
second<00:04:58.680> winter<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:58.919> had<00:04:59.220> about<00:04:59.520> 25%<00:05:00.030> loss<00:05:00.540> and

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
second winter I had about 25% loss and

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.500 
second winter I had about 25% loss and
this<00:05:01.530> past<00:05:01.770> winter<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.100> had<00:05:02.280> 10%<00:05:02.490> loss<00:05:02.910> I've

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
this past winter I had 10% loss I've

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.180 
this past winter I had 10% loss I've
never<00:05:03.750> treated<00:05:03.990> any<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.440> my<00:05:04.530> hives<00:05:04.740> with<00:05:05.040> any

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
never treated any of my hives with any

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.270 
never treated any of my hives with any
medication<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.330> think<00:05:06.540> it's<00:05:07.380> difficult<00:05:07.919> to

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
medication and I think it's difficult to

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.760 
medication and I think it's difficult to
experience<00:05:08.550> 50%<00:05:09.360> loss<00:05:09.510> it's<00:05:09.990> never<00:05:10.320> fun<00:05:10.620> to

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
experience 50% loss it's never fun to

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.550 
experience 50% loss it's never fun to
watch<00:05:10.979> that<00:05:11.040> many<00:05:11.490> of<00:05:11.640> your<00:05:11.729> creatures<00:05:12.150> die

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
watch that many of your creatures die

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.350 
watch that many of your creatures die
but<00:05:13.560> now<00:05:13.710> I'm<00:05:14.040> looking<00:05:14.340> at<00:05:14.640> they're<00:05:15.120> able<00:05:15.240> to

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
but now I'm looking at they're able to

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.510 
but now I'm looking at they're able to
do<00:05:15.510> it<00:05:15.540> on<00:05:15.720> their<00:05:15.810> own<00:05:15.870> they<00:05:16.229> don't<00:05:17.010> need<00:05:17.280> me

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
do it on their own they don't need me

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.370 
do it on their own they don't need me
and<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.479> think<00:05:18.539> that's<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.840> really<00:05:19.050> good<00:05:19.169> thing

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
and I think that's a really good thing

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.140 
and I think that's a really good thing
but<00:05:19.770> for<00:05:19.979> commercial<00:05:20.250> beekeepers<00:05:20.820> they<00:05:20.970> can't

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
but for commercial beekeepers they can't

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.620 
but for commercial beekeepers they can't
afford<00:05:21.240> it

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
afford it

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.350 
afford it
these<00:05:21.810> guys<00:05:21.990> have<00:05:22.640> 10,000<00:05:23.640> hives<00:05:23.789> and<00:05:24.150> lose

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
these guys have 10,000 hives and lose

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.450 
these guys have 10,000 hives and lose
5,000<00:05:25.140> of<00:05:25.260> them<00:05:25.320> as<00:05:25.530> many<00:05:25.860> millions<00:05:26.370> of

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
5,000 of them as many millions of

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.430 
5,000 of them as many millions of
dollars<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:27.030> they<00:05:27.960> can't<00:05:28.140> feed<00:05:28.320> their

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
dollars and they can't feed their

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.900 
dollars and they can't feed their
families<00:05:28.770> and<00:05:28.800> they<00:05:29.160> can't<00:05:29.370> Valen<00:05:29.640> ate<00:05:29.760> our

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
families and they can't Valen ate our

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.730 
families and they can't Valen ate our
foods<00:05:30.240> our<00:05:30.870> crops<00:05:31.169> that<00:05:31.950> we<00:05:32.460> as<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.640> nation<00:05:32.910> need

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
foods our crops that we as a nation need

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.740 
foods our crops that we as a nation need
so<00:05:34.740> I<00:05:34.770> think<00:05:34.919> sideline<00:05:35.669> hobbyist<00:05:36.270> beekeepers

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
so I think sideline hobbyist beekeepers

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.480 
so I think sideline hobbyist beekeepers
need<00:05:36.990> to<00:05:37.080> be<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:37.289> ones<00:05:37.470> that<00:05:37.770> try<00:05:37.979> these<00:05:38.190> new

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
need to be the ones that try these new

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.290 
need to be the ones that try these new
methods<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:39.810> all<00:05:39.900> there<00:05:40.080> is<00:05:40.140> to<00:05:40.320> it

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
methods so all there is to it

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.270 
methods so all there is to it
box<00:05:41.630> of<00:05:41.750> bees<00:05:41.900> so<00:05:42.410> that<00:05:42.530> we<00:05:42.620> can<00:05:42.830> try<00:05:43.100> and<00:05:43.160> help

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
box of bees so that we can try and help

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:52.380 
box of bees so that we can try and help
beekeeping

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.450
