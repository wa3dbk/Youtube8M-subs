00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.139
 the citizens of Damanhur consider the earth a living being to be respected and 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.239
 to protect 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:15.269
 from the first day of its foundation the federation has dedicated itself 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.369
 agriculture is organic food 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.210
 investing in land if the facilities to start growing crops 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.210
 transformation in harmony with the natural environment 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.910
 some important elements that the climate of Piedmont does not allow to produce 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.519
 they are cultivated 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.300
 in high quality of life 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.490
 of anything on TV - travel to Florence 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.390
 from which an organic oil of the highest quality is produced 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.590
 in damanhur you don't even smoke outdoors as a form of disrespect 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.170
 only for humans 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.690
 but also for plants 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.790
 the animals 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.790
 and the subtle forces of nature 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.930
 substantial resources are also invested in research 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.910
 and in the implementation of energy sources with low environmental impact 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.410
 adava amor we have chosen to use renewable energy 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.990
 this choice means being able to find solutions ecologically 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.990
 and economically convenient 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.410
 the technologies we use go together solar thermal voltaic 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.920
 biomass, that is the wood we get from the police and the care 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.570
 of our woods and absolution also + technologically driven as the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.439
 geothermal energy that exploits 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.119
 soil heat cogeneration that intelligent use of sources 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.020
 traditional fossils the most important result achieved and the finding 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.269
 practice that this energy works and is 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.629
 within the reach of all of our experiment and reproducible and this there 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.629
 it will be a victory 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.099
 job offers is very important to be made only different strong in the field 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.329
 of molecular biology regarding clinical analysis analyzes 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.459
 environmental 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.930
 hydroponic cultivations are carried out nina quake aeroponica in 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.979
 presence of ciodue and nutrients 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:50.759
 and then, also located the land studies cultivating white for the purpose of 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.809
 produce hydrogen
