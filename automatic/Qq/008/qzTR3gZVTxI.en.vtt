novel<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.100> I<00:00:56.060> pretty<00:00:56.480> much<00:00:56.600> respond<00:00:57.320> that

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
novel and I pretty much respond that

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.190 
novel and I pretty much respond that
that's<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.310> wrong<00:00:58.490> question<00:00:58.960> it's<00:00:59.960> not<00:01:00.170> a

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
that's the wrong question it's not a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.229 
that's the wrong question it's not a
question<00:01:00.560> of<00:01:00.830> length<00:01:01.130> you're<00:01:01.610> going<00:01:01.880> to<00:01:02.060> see

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
question of length you're going to see

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.970 
question of length you're going to see
middle<00:01:02.510> grade<00:01:02.690> novels<00:01:03.080> that<00:01:03.410> are<00:01:03.620> maybe

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
middle grade novels that are maybe

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.790 
middle grade novels that are maybe
forty-five<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.970> fifty<00:01:05.330> thousand<00:01:05.780> words<00:01:05.810> but

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
forty-five to fifty thousand words but

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.440 
forty-five to fifty thousand words but
I've<00:01:06.920> also<00:01:07.100> seen<00:01:07.430> middle<00:01:07.700> grade<00:01:07.910> novels<00:01:08.270> that

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
I've also seen middle grade novels that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.000 
I've also seen middle grade novels that
were<00:01:08.570> closer<00:01:08.870> to<00:01:09.080> seventy<00:01:09.530> thousand<00:01:10.010> words

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.280 

and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:16.240> same<00:01:16.450> is<00:01:16.630> true<00:01:16.660> in<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.110> young<00:01:17.260> adult

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
and the same is true in the young adult

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.680 
and the same is true in the young adult
realm<00:01:17.920> I've<00:01:18.400> seen<00:01:18.850> shorter<00:01:19.270> young<00:01:19.420> adult

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
realm I've seen shorter young adult

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.410 
realm I've seen shorter young adult
novels<00:01:20.050> at<00:01:20.260> 65,000<00:01:21.250> words<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.760> I've<00:01:22.210> seen

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
novels at 65,000 words and I've seen

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.030 
novels at 65,000 words and I've seen
novels<00:01:22.810> like<00:01:22.930> Breaking<00:01:23.380> Dawn<00:01:23.410> that<00:01:23.950> were

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
novels like Breaking Dawn that were

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.920 
novels like Breaking Dawn that were
definitely<00:01:24.460> over<00:01:24.730> a<00:01:24.760> hundred<00:01:25.210> thousand<00:01:25.690> words

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
definitely over a hundred thousand words

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.930 
definitely over a hundred thousand words
so<00:01:26.290> that's<00:01:27.130> not<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.820> right<00:01:28.030> question<00:01:29.940> the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
so that's not the right question the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.020 
so that's not the right question the
right<00:01:31.330> question<00:01:32.110> is<00:01:32.380> how<00:01:33.190> important<00:01:33.820> is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
right question is how important is

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.630 
right question is how important is
pacing<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.960> my<00:01:35.530> middle<00:01:35.770> grade<00:01:36.040> or<00:01:36.160> young<00:01:36.310> adult

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
pacing in my middle grade or young adult

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.039 
pacing in my middle grade or young adult
novel

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.200 

so<00:01:45.049> what<00:01:45.229> do<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.439> mean<00:01:45.469> by<00:01:45.680> pacing<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.640> why<00:01:46.939> do<00:01:47.000> I

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
so what do I mean by pacing and why do I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.090 
so what do I mean by pacing and why do I
think<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:47.899> much<00:01:48.079> more<00:01:48.289> important<00:01:48.829> than

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
think it's so much more important than

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.029 
think it's so much more important than
work<00:01:49.460> length<00:01:49.899> for<00:01:50.899> me<00:01:51.110> pacing<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
work length for me pacing is the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.789 
work length for me pacing is the
momentum<00:01:52.549> of<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.759> novel<00:01:53.180> it<00:01:53.990> is<00:01:54.229> how<00:01:54.470> quickly

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
momentum of a novel it is how quickly

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.550 
momentum of a novel it is how quickly
the<00:01:55.280> scenes<00:01:55.610> develop<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.479> move<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.350> story

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
the scenes develop and move the story

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.399 
the scenes develop and move the story
forward<00:01:58.000> based<00:01:59.000> on<00:01:59.179> action<00:01:59.719> character

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
forward based on action character

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.270 
forward based on action character
development<00:02:01.280> good<00:02:02.030> dialogue<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.280> little

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
development good dialogue and little

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.340 
development good dialogue and little
bits<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.670> backstory<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:06.020> all<00:02:06.200> that's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
bits of backstory that is all that's

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.620 
bits of backstory that is all that's
really<00:02:06.619> needed<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.310> let<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.209> reader<00:02:08.509> know

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
really needed to let the reader know

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.050 
really needed to let the reader know
where<00:02:09.289> we<00:02:09.530> are<00:02:09.679> in<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.920> story<00:02:10.220> but<00:02:10.729> still

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
where we are in the story but still

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.170 
where we are in the story but still
allows<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.690> momentum<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.500> carry<00:02:12.680> forward<00:02:13.280> if

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
allows the momentum to carry forward if

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.850 
allows the momentum to carry forward if
you<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.870> middle-grade<00:02:15.140> novel<00:02:15.319> that's

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
you have a middle-grade novel that's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.460 
you have a middle-grade novel that's
coming<00:02:16.220> in<00:02:16.340> fairly<00:02:16.700> short<00:02:16.730> like<00:02:17.510> 30,000<00:02:18.319> words

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
coming in fairly short like 30,000 words

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.559 
coming in fairly short like 30,000 words
it<00:02:18.830> might<00:02:19.370> simply<00:02:19.790> mean<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.000> your<00:02:20.330> world

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
it might simply mean that your world

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.690 
it might simply mean that your world
isn't<00:02:20.810> complex<00:02:21.380> enough<00:02:21.709> or<00:02:22.010> your<00:02:22.130> story<00:02:22.459> isn't

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
isn't complex enough or your story isn't

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.059 
isn't complex enough or your story isn't
big<00:02:23.000> enough<00:02:23.120> if<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:24.590> have<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.769> young<00:02:24.950> adult

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
big enough if you have a young adult

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.100 
big enough if you have a young adult
novel<00:02:25.310> that's<00:02:25.819> coming<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.239> too<00:02:26.450> long<00:02:26.720> like

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
novel that's coming in too long like

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.600 
novel that's coming in too long like
maybe<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.500> hundred<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:27.980> twenty<00:02:28.220> thousand

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
maybe a hundred and twenty thousand

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.729 
maybe a hundred and twenty thousand
words<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.120> may<00:02:29.599> mean<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.110> you've<00:02:30.470> kind<00:02:30.709> of

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
words it may mean that you've kind of

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.130 
words it may mean that you've kind of
lost<00:02:31.040> your<00:02:31.250> focus

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.110
