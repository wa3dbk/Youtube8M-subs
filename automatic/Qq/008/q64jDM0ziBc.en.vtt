of our minds and now we're just thinking
more<00:02:31.410> about<00:02:32.410> our<00:02:32.530> goals<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:33.040> where<00:02:33.130> we<00:02:33.250> need

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
more about our goals and where we need

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.670 
more about our goals and where we need
to<00:02:33.520> get<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.120> when<00:02:34.870> we're<00:02:35.050> there<00:02:35.260> it'll<00:02:35.560> be

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
to get to and when we're there it'll be

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.010 
to get to and when we're there it'll be
like<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.550> end<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.820> our<00:02:36.940> pathway<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.540> it'll<00:02:37.900> be

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
like the end of our pathway and it'll be

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.680 
like the end of our pathway and it'll be
the<00:02:38.530> success<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.160> everything<00:02:39.850> we've<00:02:40.000> done<00:02:40.180> to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
the success of everything we've done to

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.140 
the success of everything we've done to
get<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.870> them
