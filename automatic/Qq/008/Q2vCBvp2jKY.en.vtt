to<00:00:01.140> solve<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.560> cube<00:00:01.800> counting<00:00:02.159> question

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
to solve this cube counting question

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.430 
to solve this cube counting question
first<00:00:02.820> Hallie<00:00:03.120> up<00:00:03.330> each<00:00:03.540> cube<00:00:03.929> based<00:00:04.080> on<00:00:04.319> the

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
first Hallie up each cube based on the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.160 
first Hallie up each cube based on the
number<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.740> sides<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.220> are<00:00:05.400> exposed<00:00:05.990> we<00:00:06.990> will

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
number of sides that are exposed we will

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.770 
number of sides that are exposed we will
start<00:00:07.440> from<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.770> left<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.940> right<00:00:08.970> moving

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
start from the left to the right moving

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.999 
start from the left to the right moving
up<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.380> then<00:00:10.769> backwards<00:00:12.559> first<00:00:13.559> start<00:00:13.889> with

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
up and then backwards first start with

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.029 
up and then backwards first start with
this<00:00:14.130> cube<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:15.480> cube<00:00:15.780> has<00:00:15.960> its<00:00:16.139> front<00:00:16.410> left

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
this cube this cube has its front left

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.320 
this cube this cube has its front left
and<00:00:17.310> right<00:00:17.730> sides<00:00:17.970> exposed<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:20.490> cuba<00:00:20.850> above

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
and right sides exposed the cuba above

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.920 
and right sides exposed the cuba above
it<00:00:21.510> has<00:00:21.869> its<00:00:22.140> front<00:00:22.439> left<00:00:23.010> right<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.970> top<00:00:24.689> side

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
it has its front left right and top side

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.640 
it has its front left right and top side
exposed<00:00:28.220> now<00:00:29.220> move<00:00:29.490> back<00:00:29.990> this<00:00:30.990> column<00:00:31.470> has

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
exposed now move back this column has

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.160 
exposed now move back this column has
two<00:00:31.920> cubes<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.780> bottom

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
two cubes in it one is at this bottom

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.260 
two cubes in it one is at this bottom
level<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.130> exposed<00:00:35.550> only<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.120> its

front<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.719> left<00:00:37.079> sides<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:38.190> -<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:39.780> cube<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
front and left sides so - this cube is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.889 
front and left sides so - this cube is
exposed<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.040> its<00:00:41.219> front<00:00:41.460> left<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.180> top<00:00:42.540> sides

on its top side only now moving over
this<00:01:30.810> column<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.820> cubes<00:01:32.820> does<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:33.840> have

this column of cubes does not have

this column of cubes does not have
another<00:01:34.890> column<00:01:35.220> behind<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.020> because<00:01:37.020> we

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
another column behind it because we

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
another column behind it because we
cannot<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.040> visible<00:01:38.340> column<00:01:38.970> behind<00:01:39.390> this

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
cannot see a visible column behind this

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.590 
cannot see a visible column behind this
tall<00:01:39.900> column<00:01:40.470> here<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.579> assume<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.360> no

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
tall column here we will assume that no

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.249 
tall column here we will assume that no
cubes<00:01:43.049> exist<00:01:43.619> behind<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:45.000> column<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.930> cubes

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
cubes exist behind this column of cubes

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.330 
cubes exist behind this column of cubes
so<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.460> cube<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:49.049> one<00:01:49.229> below<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.710> will

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
so this cube and the one below it will

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.600 
so this cube and the one below it will
actually<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.939> exposed<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.509> their<00:01:51.659> backsides

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
actually be exposed on their backsides

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.069 
actually be exposed on their backsides
so<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.759> cube<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> bottom<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.570> exposed<00:01:54.960> on

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
so this cube at the bottom is exposed on

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.580 
so this cube at the bottom is exposed on
the<00:01:55.200> front<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.680> back<00:01:56.100> -<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:58.079> cube<00:01:58.469> is

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the front in the back - and this cube is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.149 
the front in the back - and this cube is
exposed<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> front<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.969> top<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> back

3 moving over to this tall column we

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.880 
3 moving over to this tall column we

by<00:02:53.469> itself<00:02:54.120> remember<00:02:55.120> there<00:02:55.299> are<00:02:55.329> no<00:02:55.449> cubes

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
by itself remember there are no cubes

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.629 
by itself remember there are no cubes
that<00:02:56.199> exist<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.859> the<00:02:56.980> back<00:02:57.099> in<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.579> position

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
that exist in the back in this position

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.809 
that exist in the back in this position
because<00:02:58.449> they<00:02:58.569> are<00:02:58.659> not<00:02:58.840> visible<00:02:59.819> because

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
because they are not visible because

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.050 
because they are not visible because
this<00:03:01.030> huge<00:03:01.329> column<00:03:01.689> is<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.049> way<00:03:02.909> so<00:03:03.909> we

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
this huge column is in the way so we

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.720 
this huge column is in the way so we
will<00:03:04.209> count<00:03:04.389> these<00:03:05.349> cubes<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:06.310> one<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.639> is

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
will count these cubes the one that is

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.819 
will count these cubes the one that is
below<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.269> cube<00:03:07.599> is<00:03:07.780> actually<00:03:08.260> exposed<00:03:08.650> on
