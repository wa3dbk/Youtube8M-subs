00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.540
 complete in addition to the radio tape recorder

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.960
 let's go to the radio itself as 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.340
 she is one denova and here are two slots 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.940
 micro sd volume control here is 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.470
 by devi 10 drive and of course 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.470
 can be done like this 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.590
 all 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.920
 and so here besides that you can 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.520
 connect optionally for example 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.520
 digital tuner 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.960
 now across the country there is a right 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:37.800
 broadcast is a very convenient thing so 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.890
 I advise besides a digital tuner here 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.210
 Of course there are such things as an example 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.990
 analog tuner 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.850

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.290
 searches 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.960
 from 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.729
 quality display can be assembled 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:14.319
 principle at different angles picture 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.319
 acceptable remains 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:26.070
 too much extra player fast 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.280
 looking very consider acceptable besides 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.180
 This is of course gps now for example 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.180
 installed Navitel 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.770
 here also 2 workers got up 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.090

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.090
 and 2 what fly navigation systems 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.380
 here, in principle, there is almost all 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.380
 Russiaâ€™s countries are here in general 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.739
 I recommend installing conveniently 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.739
 lay the shortest routes 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:23.940

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:28.950

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.220
 on 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.220
