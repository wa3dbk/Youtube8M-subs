this<00:00:44.280> issue<00:00:44.550> by<00:00:45.449> making<00:00:45.479> a<00:00:46.170> small<00:00:46.440> adapter

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
this issue by making a small adapter

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.789 
this issue by making a small adapter
that<00:00:47.429> will<00:00:47.550> screw<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.149> instead<00:00:48.839> of<00:00:49.049> the<00:00:49.530> large

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:49.799 
that will screw in instead of the large

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.689 
that will screw in instead of the large
screw<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.870> allow<00:00:52.139> you<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.589> use<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
screw and it will allow you to use a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.489 
screw and it will allow you to use a
body<00:00:54.120> clip<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:56.489> hold<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.819> roll<00:00:56.999> cage<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.229> and

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
body clip to hold the roll cage on and

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.059 
body clip to hold the roll cage on and
it<00:00:58.920> makes<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.429> much<00:01:00.269> much<00:01:00.539> quicker<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.289> take<00:01:01.829> on

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
it makes it much much quicker to take on

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:04.729 
it makes it much much quicker to take on
and<00:01:02.339> off<00:01:02.879> instead<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.929> having<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.350> completely

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and off instead of having to completely

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
and off instead of having to completely

on the rear and two shorter units that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
on the rear and two shorter units that
go<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> front<00:01:21.260> installation<00:01:22.260> couldn't<00:01:22.560> be

go on the front installation couldn't be

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.370 
go on the front installation couldn't be
any<00:01:22.830> simpler<00:01:23.240> very<00:01:24.240> simply<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.050> put

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
any simpler very simply going to put

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.880 
any simpler very simply going to put
some<00:01:25.740> thread<00:01:26.010> lock<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.910> coarse<00:01:27.330> threads

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
some thread lock on the coarse threads

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.750 
some thread lock on the coarse threads
go<00:01:28.890> ahead<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> start<00:01:30.030> them<00:01:30.180> into<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.660> holes

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
go ahead and start them into the holes

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.760 
go ahead and start them into the holes
screw<00:01:32.760> it<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.080> gonna<00:01:34.170> use<00:01:34.410> a<00:01:34.440> ten

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
screw it in and you're gonna use a ten

see<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.190> can<00:01:38.340> do<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.550> in<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:38.820> camera<00:01:39.180> here

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
see if I can do this in the camera here

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.150 
see if I can do this in the camera here
and<00:01:39.960> very<00:01:40.680> simply<00:01:42.350> tighten<00:01:43.350> them<00:01:43.440> up<00:01:43.560> it's

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
and very simply tighten them up it's

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.670 
and very simply tighten them up it's
just<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> easy<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:45.720> instead<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.140> having<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
just that easy now instead of having to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.280 
just that easy now instead of having to
bolt<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.190> unbolt<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:48.330> cage<00:01:48.570> from<00:01:48.780> underneath

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
bolt and unbolt the cage from underneath

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.899 
bolt and unbolt the cage from underneath
the<00:01:50.220> cage<00:01:50.460> will<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:50.909> simply<00:01:51.770> slide<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the cage will very simply slide in and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.960 
the cage will very simply slide in and
you'll<00:01:54.480> clip<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> body<00:01:55.620> clip<00:01:56.010> so

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
you'll clip it on with a body clip so

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.360 
you'll clip it on with a body clip so
another<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.240> simple<00:01:58.080> but<00:01:58.740> well<00:01:59.040> thought-out
