kinda look like with this scale is my
footing<00:01:42.220> full<00:01:42.400> blocks<00:01:42.640> on<00:01:42.760> these<00:01:42.850> faster<00:01:43.240> get

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
footing full blocks on these faster get

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.910 
footing full blocks on these faster get
there<00:01:43.720> that's<00:01:44.410> okay

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
there that's okay

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.100 
there that's okay
connect<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:45.400> properly<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:46.450> can<00:01:46.690> do<00:01:46.900> it<00:01:46.990> like

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
connect in properly you can do it like

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.020 
connect in properly you can do it like
this<00:01:47.260> where<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.130> don't<00:01:48.190> have<00:01:48.400> full<00:01:48.610> pocket<00:01:48.970> it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
this where you don't have full pocket it

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.100 
this where you don't have full pocket it
just<00:01:49.240> doesn't<00:01:49.480> look<00:01:49.600> quite<00:01:49.750> right<00:01:49.840> way

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
just doesn't look quite right way

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.580 
just doesn't look quite right way
connects<00:01:50.620> in<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.850> these<00:01:52.000> are<00:01:52.180> just<00:01:52.330> kind<00:01:52.450> of

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
connects in so these are just kind of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.530 
connects in so these are just kind of
one<00:01:53.590> block<00:01:53.770> in<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.250> end<00:01:54.370> of<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.520> wing<00:01:54.670> same

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
one block in the end of the wing same

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.780 
one block in the end of the wing same
just<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.810> couple<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.140> those<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:57.280> place<00:01:57.580> your

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
just a couple of those and place your

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.000 
just a couple of those and place your
never<00:01:58.060> expense<00:01:58.390> on<00:01:58.570> those<00:01:58.750> then<00:01:59.530> what<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.710> do

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
never expense on those then what you do

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.920 
never expense on those then what you do
is<00:02:00.190> on<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.940> next<00:02:01.210> slide<00:02:01.390> we<00:02:01.540> just<00:02:01.570> gonna<00:02:01.780> bring

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
is on the next slide we just gonna bring

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.770 
is on the next slide we just gonna bring
this<00:02:02.080> across<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:03.070> middle<00:02:03.310> section<00:02:03.520> here<00:02:03.729> just

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.590 

like<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.350> then<00:02:08.709> also<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.160> outside

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
like this and then also on the outside

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.020 
like this and then also on the outside
and<00:02:10.600> just<00:02:10.780> put<00:02:10.929> one<00:02:10.959> in<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:11.320> gap<00:02:11.530> here<00:02:12.030> so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and just put one in this gap here so

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.550 
and just put one in this gap here so
it's<00:02:13.150> not<00:02:13.270> perfect<00:02:13.750> or<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.080> I'll<00:02:14.200> probably

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
it's not perfect or just I'll probably

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.150 
it's not perfect or just I'll probably
only<00:02:14.739> do<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.400> bigger<00:02:15.880> version<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:16.690> well

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
only do a bigger version of this as well

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.960 
only do a bigger version of this as well
just<00:02:18.160> like<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.520> then<00:02:18.610> just<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.850> finish

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
just like that and then just to finish

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.340 
just like that and then just to finish
off<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.330> wings<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:19.780> what<00:02:19.930> we're<00:02:20.020> gonna<00:02:20.140> do

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
off the wings here what we're gonna do

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.640 
off the wings here what we're gonna do
is<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:21.690> come<00:02:22.690> across<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.110> then<00:02:23.200> come<00:02:23.410> from

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
is just come across and then come from

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.510 
is just come across and then come from
coming<00:02:23.980> out<00:02:24.160> by<00:02:24.340> an<00:02:24.580> extra<00:02:24.910> one<00:02:26.459> brings<00:02:27.459> across

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.610 

I<00:02:30.550> come<00:02:31.270> out<00:02:31.390> by<00:02:31.540> next<00:02:31.690> from<00:02:31.930> one<00:02:32.080> here<00:02:32.380> just

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
I come out by next from one here just

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.160 
I come out by next from one here just
like<00:02:33.580> that<00:02:33.760> bank<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.930> fact<00:02:35.110> that

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
like that bank going to the fact that

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.660 
like that bank going to the fact that
young<00:02:35.350> do<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.770> just<00:02:36.190> fill<00:02:36.340> up<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.520> cockpit

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
young do is you just fill up the cockpit

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.060 
young do is you just fill up the cockpit
so<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.360> come<00:02:37.930> up<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.170> get<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.650> down<00:02:38.830> to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
so just come up and get the down to

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.970 
so just come up and get the down to
slabs<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:40.870> upside<00:02:41.320> down<00:02:41.470> stair

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
slabs like this going upside down stair

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.850 
slabs like this going upside down stair
it's<00:02:42.910> going<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> be<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.210> bit<00:02:43.360> tricky<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.930> want<00:02:44.800> to

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
it's going to be a bit tricky I want to

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.180 
it's going to be a bit tricky I want to
make<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.010> one<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.190> four<00:02:45.400> block<00:02:45.550> just<00:02:45.760> er<00:02:47.190> built

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
make this one a four block just er built

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.070 
make this one a four block just er built
two<00:02:48.400> parts<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.850> then<00:02:48.940> take<00:02:49.570> it<00:02:49.690> out<00:02:49.810> and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
two parts and then take it out and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.730 
two parts and then take it out and
convince<00:02:50.530> metal<00:02:51.340> slab<00:02:52.380> I'm<00:02:53.380> actually<00:02:53.530> gonna

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
convince metal slab I'm actually gonna

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.290 
convince metal slab I'm actually gonna
build<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.010> up<00:02:54.070> mr.<00:02:54.400> Sykes<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.970> trip<00:02:55.180> you

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
build it up mr. Sykes it like a trip you

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.350 
build it up mr. Sykes it like a trip you
say<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:55.630> up<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.900> upside<00:02:56.170> down<00:02:56.290> stairs<00:02:57.360> just

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
say just up to upside down stairs just

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.190 
say just up to upside down stairs just
like<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:58.540> kind<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.780> building<00:02:59.110> up<00:02:59.170> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
like this kind of building up the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.340 
like this kind of building up the
cockpit<00:02:59.470> plop<00:03:00.270> then<00:03:01.270> you've<00:03:01.360> got<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.750> upside

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
cockpit plop then you've got a upside

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.120 
cockpit plop then you've got a upside
down<00:03:02.500> stair<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.090> back<00:03:04.240> part<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:05.130> two

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
down stair on the back part and two

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.880 
down stair on the back part and two
slabs<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.630> you're<00:03:07.930> gonna<00:03:08.050> put<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.260> stand<00:03:08.620> on

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
slabs and you're gonna put a stand on

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.190 
slabs and you're gonna put a stand on
top<00:03:09.070> of<00:03:09.190> those<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.360> sides<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.840> these<00:03:10.930> when

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
top of those on the sides of these when

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.920 
top of those on the sides of these when
I<00:03:11.230> put<00:03:11.470> two<00:03:12.430> slabs<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.480> I'm<00:03:13.660> really<00:03:13.810> really

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
I put two slabs so I'm really really

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.500 
I put two slabs so I'm really really
easy<00:03:14.580> gonna<00:03:15.580> build<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:15.910> one<00:03:16.120> if<00:03:16.270> you<00:03:16.330> want<00:03:16.360> to
