00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.130
 plus 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.270
 to me 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.140
 What's up with kids here in general? 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.510
 I bring a couple of curiosities about the 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.610
 check this hack for the call of duty 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.410
 black ops 2 for what the games are 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.500
 customized to get out of all the 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.029
 maps through teleportation is a 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.590
 hack that you can have it all without 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.660
 need to add men and nothing left you 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.110
 in the description two videos the tutorial 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.000
 of the hack and how to get it and nothing has 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.250
 brought that is to your curiosities and you 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.540
 bring as play third person 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.190
 from the hack 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.019
 the first thing you need to download and 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.579
 once you are here in the previous room in 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.610
 Custom games and be it 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.949
 loaded you have to give r1 l1 up 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.480
 be in the mercenary team you see that 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.309
 our name comes out in yellow and the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.480
 back bar also in yellow that 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.210
 it's the first thing we need to do 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.330
 I'm going to play in the third person 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.130
 once done that we will start the game 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.080
 and when we start we have to give the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.580
 circle without taking any class and giving it 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.350
 to the triangle you see that a 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.479
 sort of zoom after I would have to 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.640
 give the start and take the class in that 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.159
 moment we seem will appear like this in the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.170
 air with him being in third person and 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.140
 now you notice that we can play like this in 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.330
 third person one thing that put I'm going 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.420
 to do so easily with the hack and 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.180
 you see that you can shoot shoot 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.270
 bird throwing grenades and even making 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.399
 all fit dolphin dais but also os 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.270
 I say the bad point is that once you 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.710
 kill not or once you die you take off 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.929
 the third person insecure for the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.229
 normal so this serves more like to 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.240
 make some click like this for a montage oo 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.520
 even if you want to have your own 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.960
 friends to make a one-on-one duel 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.000
 in third person the first as was 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.280
 obviously he has lost because if 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.340
 takes away the third person 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.960
 and then another curiosity is that if you 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.970
 you put mercenaries on the team as well 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.700
 is the same case as the previous one you have 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.100
 to give al l 1 or 1 until it 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.400
 expose in yellow and you give to the map of 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.530
 green and you take class which will make you a 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.150
 out of my or it will be removed from the map 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.860
 directly automatically without 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.400
 need to do teleportation and 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.200
 or anything bone on this map as choosing 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.989
 mercenaries leaves you directly outside 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.989
 the map also serves for the new dlc 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.910
 prising where on the magma map where 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.590
 will be the supply of that if you do so 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.360
 also if you put you will emerge digital 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.940
 will also leave us a spot like this 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.680
 off the map and such and nothing has no more 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.150
 It will be just a couple of curiosities 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.700
 about the hack and nothing I think that has 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.930
 liked him dislike favorite south and vice 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.930
 and see you in the next video
