00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.679 
second gotcha
so<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> want<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> make<00:01:41.460> sure<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.789> so<00:01:41.939> quick<00:01:42.210> yes

pop<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.469> treat<00:01:43.799> alright<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.329> idea<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
pop that treat alright so the idea is to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.419 
pop that treat alright so the idea is to
is<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> get<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.679> dog<00:01:46.859> to<00:01:47.039> look<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
is to get the dog to look you in the

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.069 
is to get the dog to look you in the
eyes<00:01:47.609> so<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.840> kind<00:01:49.020> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
eyes so that you have that kind of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.419 
eyes so that you have that kind of
rapport<00:01:49.469> that<00:01:49.499> connections<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:52.159> can<00:01:53.159> give<00:01:53.310> them

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
rapport that connections I can give them

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:54.679 
rapport that connections I can give them
another<00:01:53.609> command<00:01:54.060> once<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.539> their

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
another command once I have their

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.380 
another command once I have their
attention<00:01:55.490> yep<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.939> build<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.359> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
attention yep then you can build on that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.209 
attention yep then you can build on that
so<00:01:57.749> this<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.899> really<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> foundation<00:01:58.560> of

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
so this is really the foundation of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.819 
so this is really the foundation of
their<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.609> their<00:02:00.060> training<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.679> we're

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
their of their training for what we're
