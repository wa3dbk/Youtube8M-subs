00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
well we've heard from some witnesses at

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.110 
well we've heard from some witnesses at
that<00:03:59.660> area<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.740> Volga<00:04:01.100> is<00:04:01.190> actually<00:04:01.700> known

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
that area of the Volga is actually known

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.150 
that area of the Volga is actually known
for<00:04:02.420> being<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.780> quite<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.260> dangerous<00:04:03.680> spot<00:04:03.920> for

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
for being a quite a dangerous spot for

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.830 
for being a quite a dangerous spot for
boats<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.700> they've<00:04:05.180> had<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.540> storm

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
boats that they've had the storm

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.570 
boats that they've had the storm
conditions<00:04:06.110> there's<00:04:06.740> strong<00:04:07.010> currents<00:04:07.490> and

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
conditions there's strong currents and

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.820 
conditions there's strong currents and
strong<00:04:07.850> winds<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.959> it<00:04:09.170> possibly<00:04:09.590> that

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
strong winds and it possibly that

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.160 
strong winds and it possibly that
contributed<00:04:10.490> now<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:10.730> bait<00:04:10.970> itself<00:04:11.390> is

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
contributed now the bait itself is

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.410 
contributed now the bait itself is
actually<00:04:12.560> about<00:04:12.890> 55<00:04:13.490> years<00:04:13.700> old<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.300> there's

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
actually about 55 years old and there's

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.330 
actually about 55 years old and there's
been<00:04:14.600> some<00:04:14.870> people<00:04:15.050> who<00:04:15.740> said<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.130> perhaps

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
been some people who said that perhaps

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.890 
been some people who said that perhaps
the<00:04:16.640> age<00:04:16.790> of<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.060> boats<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.480> some<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:17.780> the

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
the age of the boats and some of the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.110 
the age of the boats and some of the
design<00:04:18.340> structures<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.609> boat<00:04:19.790> could<00:04:20.000> have

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
design structures of the boat could have

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.600 
design structures of the boat could have
contributed<00:04:20.480> to<00:04:20.989> this<00:04:21.109> happening<00:04:21.680> we've<00:04:22.430> also

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
contributed to this happening we've also

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.310 
contributed to this happening we've also
heard<00:04:22.940> reports<00:04:23.360> from<00:04:23.450> those<00:04:23.630> on<00:04:23.840> board<00:04:24.050> that

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
heard reports from those on board that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.990 
heard reports from those on board that
perhaps<00:04:24.590> it's<00:04:24.950> something<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> crew<00:04:25.760> and

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
perhaps it's something that the crew and

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.740 
perhaps it's something that the crew and
the<00:04:26.930> captain<00:04:27.110> himself<00:04:27.770> did<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.660> help<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
the captain himself did to help the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.840 
the captain himself did to help the
situation<00:04:30.100> deteriorate<00:04:31.100> as<00:04:31.280> rapidly<00:04:31.610> as<00:04:31.790> it

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
situation deteriorate as rapidly as it

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.310 
situation deteriorate as rapidly as it
did<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.120> boat<00:04:32.300> going<00:04:32.480> down<00:04:32.570> in<00:04:32.840> just<00:04:32.960> three

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
did the boat going down in just three

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.690 
did the boat going down in just three
minutes<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:33.860> some<00:04:34.070> people<00:04:34.190> have<00:04:34.370> said<00:04:34.669> that

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
minutes so some people have said that

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.570 
minutes so some people have said that
the<00:04:34.970> way<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.600> situation<00:04:35.810> was<00:04:36.200> handled

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the way the situation was handled

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.070 
the way the situation was handled
contributed<00:04:37.580> to<00:04:38.060> that<00:04:38.090> happening<00:04:38.419> people<00:04:38.810> on

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
contributed to that happening people on

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.980 
contributed to that happening people on
board<00:04:39.260> having<00:04:40.190> very<00:04:40.460> very<00:04:40.550> little<00:04:41.150> time<00:04:41.419> to

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
board having very very little time to

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.260 
board having very very little time to
react<00:04:42.290> so<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:43.130> unknown<00:04:43.580> as<00:04:43.700> yet<00:04:43.910> exactly

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
react so it's unknown as yet exactly

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.060 
react so it's unknown as yet exactly
what's<00:04:44.630> happened<00:04:45.050> one<00:04:45.169> of<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.380> crew<00:04:45.650> members

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
what's happened one of the crew members

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.060 
what's happened one of the crew members
also<00:04:46.280> said<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.330> before<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:48.020> boat<00:04:48.200> even<00:04:48.380> set

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
also said that before the boat even set

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.220 
also said that before the boat even set
sail<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.730> there<00:04:50.540> was<00:04:50.660> actually<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.020> problem

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
sail that there was actually a problem

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.870 
sail that there was actually a problem
with<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.560> engine<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:52.340> possibly<00:04:52.669> this

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
with the engine and that possibly this

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.090 
with the engine and that possibly this
is<00:04:53.060> going<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.390> come<00:04:53.600> down<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.530> technical

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.190 
is going to come down to a technical
fault<00:04:55.400> so<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:56.120> investigation<00:04:56.690> into<00:04:56.990> that

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
fault so the investigation into that

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.740 
fault so the investigation into that
will<00:04:57.380> be<00:04:57.530> ongoing<00:04:57.680> but<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.400> huge<00:04:58.970> concerns<00:04:59.480> now

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
will be ongoing but a huge concerns now

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.900 
will be ongoing but a huge concerns now
as<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.290> rescue<00:05:01.010> mission<00:05:01.130> goes<00:05:01.460> on<00:05:01.640> as<00:05:01.880> it

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
as the rescue mission goes on as it

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.550 
as the rescue mission goes on as it
turns<00:05:02.360> into<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.720> night<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.140> conditions

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
turns into the night and the conditions

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.320 
turns into the night and the conditions
only<00:05:04.010> get<00:05:04.310> harder<00:05:04.640> to<00:05:04.790> find<00:05:05.030> these<00:05:05.150> people

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
only get harder to find these people

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.450 
only get harder to find these people
amongst<00:05:05.930> them<00:05:06.229> a<00:05:06.410> large<00:05:06.860> number<00:05:07.070> of<00:05:07.190> children
