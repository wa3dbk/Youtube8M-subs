00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
issue such as hay fever which is the

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.040 
issue such as hay fever which is the
very<00:00:21.740> first<00:00:21.800> one<00:00:22.550> I<00:00:22.580> developed<00:00:23.180> when<00:00:23.330> I<00:00:23.420> was<00:00:23.570> 32

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
very first one I developed when I was 32

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.720 
very first one I developed when I was 32
years<00:00:24.080> old<00:00:24.500> I<00:00:25.660> continued<00:00:26.660> to<00:00:26.710> research<00:00:27.730> and

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
years old I continued to research and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.420 
years old I continued to research and
try<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.210> find<00:00:29.690> a<00:00:30.110> way<00:00:30.680> to<00:00:30.740> regain<00:00:31.010> my<00:00:31.400> health

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
try to find a way to regain my health

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.810 
try to find a way to regain my health
and<00:00:32.290> just<00:00:33.290> like<00:00:33.469> everybody<00:00:33.920> else<00:00:34.100> I<00:00:34.309> would<00:00:34.640> go

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
and just like everybody else I would go

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.000 
and just like everybody else I would go
to<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:37.280> pharmacy<00:00:37.820> or<00:00:38.320> CVS<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:39.710> just

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
to the pharmacy or CVS and just

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.889 
to the pharmacy or CVS and just
purchased<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.899> over-the-counter

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
purchased the over-the-counter

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.560 
purchased the over-the-counter
medication<00:00:42.859> for<00:00:43.129> it<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:43.999> it<00:00:44.179> was<00:00:44.359> just

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
medication for it but it was just

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.110 
medication for it but it was just
helping<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.350> alleviate<00:00:45.589> my<00:00:46.010> systems<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:46.820> year

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
helping to alleviate my systems and year

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.270 
helping to alleviate my systems and year
after<00:00:47.300> year<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:48.409> hay<00:00:48.589> fever<00:00:48.949> would<00:00:49.100> always

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
after year the hay fever would always

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.459 
after year the hay fever would always
come<00:00:49.670> back<00:00:49.909> so<00:00:50.719> I<00:00:50.749> started<00:00:51.170> doing<00:00:51.350> some

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
come back so I started doing some

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.309 
come back so I started doing some
research<00:00:51.649> on<00:00:52.190> my<00:00:52.219> own<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:53.480> I<00:00:53.629> discovered<00:00:54.170> that

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
research on my own and I discovered that

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.430 
research on my own and I discovered that
bee<00:00:54.499> pollen<00:00:55.089> really<00:00:56.089> helped<00:00:56.479> with<00:00:57.319> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
bee pollen really helped with the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
bee pollen really helped with the
symptoms<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:58.129> chose<00:00:58.609> to<00:00:58.909> take<00:00:59.690> that<00:01:00.019> and<00:01:00.460> it

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
symptoms so I chose to take that and it

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.860 
symptoms so I chose to take that and it
kept<00:01:01.729> these<00:01:01.940> little<00:01:02.479> bacteria<00:01:03.100> do<00:01:04.100> is<00:01:04.870> what

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
kept these little bacteria do is what

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.789 
kept these little bacteria do is what
they<00:01:06.020> do<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.790> they<00:01:07.790> help<00:01:08.000> populate<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:09.590> lower

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
they do is they help populate the lower

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.639 
they do is they help populate the lower
intestinal<00:01:10.520> tract<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:11.240> all<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.320> friendly

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
intestinal tract of all the friendly

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.149 
intestinal tract of all the friendly
bacteria<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.750> once<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.079> intestinal<00:01:15.860> tract

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
bacteria and once the intestinal tract

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.730 
bacteria and once the intestinal tract
is<00:01:16.340> properly<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.600> know<00:01:18.700> populated<00:01:20.560> so<00:01:21.560> the

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
is properly you know populated so the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.190 
is properly you know populated so the
way<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:23.200> make<00:01:24.200> your<00:01:24.439> own<00:01:25.060> kefir<00:01:26.060> is<00:01:26.329> first<00:01:27.049> of

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
way you make your own kefir is first of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.060 
way you make your own kefir is first of
all<00:01:27.320> I<00:01:27.560> recommend<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:28.189> you<00:01:28.250> buy<00:01:28.460> raw<00:01:29.060> milk

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
all I recommend that you buy raw milk

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.679 
all I recommend that you buy raw milk
please<00:01:31.070> don't<00:01:31.490> get<00:01:31.759> homogenized<00:01:32.539> no<00:01:33.130> because

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
please don't get homogenized no because

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.639 
please don't get homogenized no because
the<00:01:35.689> cells<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.200> homogenized<00:01:36.740> milk<00:01:37.009> have<00:01:37.280> been

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
the cells of homogenized milk have been

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.200 
the cells of homogenized milk have been
changed<00:01:39.649> during<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.159> homogeneous<00:01:40.880> Asian

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
changed during the homogeneous Asian

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.010 
changed during the homogeneous Asian
process<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.350> cell<00:01:42.619> is<00:01:42.799> much<00:01:43.070> smaller<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.020> so

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
process the cell is much smaller and so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.169 
process the cell is much smaller and so
the<00:01:45.229> body<00:01:45.469> is<00:01:45.829> not<00:01:46.039> able<00:01:46.219> to<00:01:46.399> digest<00:01:46.640> it

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
the body is not able to digest it

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.560 
the body is not able to digest it
completely<00:01:47.869> it<00:01:48.770> doesn't<00:01:49.250> recognize<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.420> as<00:01:50.539> a

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
completely it doesn't recognize it as a

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.810 
completely it doesn't recognize it as a
food<00:01:50.869> because<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.619> cell<00:01:51.890> is<00:01:51.920> floor<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.640> it's

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
food because the cell is floor and it's

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.849 
food because the cell is floor and it's
just<00:01:53.240> not<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.780> cell<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.229> was<00:01:54.380> found<00:01:54.679> in

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
just not the cell that was found in

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.149 
just not the cell that was found in

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
drink it every three days and I'll put

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.140 
drink it every three days and I'll put
enough<00:02:29.079> here<00:02:29.349> for<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.650> first<00:02:29.890> day<00:02:30.189> and<00:02:30.670> then

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
enough here for the first day and then

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.140 
enough here for the first day and then
as<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.569> begins<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.079> change<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:33.370> keep

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
as it begins to change you just keep

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.970 
as it begins to change you just keep
adding<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.720> for<00:02:34.930> each<00:02:35.049> day<00:02:35.439> and<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.189> way<00:02:37.980> you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
adding it for each day and that way you

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.190 
adding it for each day and that way you
don't<00:02:39.099> have<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.489> drink<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.879> every<00:02:40.150> day<00:02:40.329> these

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
don't have to drink it every day these

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.759 
don't have to drink it every day these
little<00:02:41.829> bacteria<00:02:42.510> cultures<00:02:43.510> will<00:02:43.810> die<00:02:44.049> in<00:02:44.530> a

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
little bacteria cultures will die in a

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.740 
little bacteria cultures will die in a
couple<00:02:45.099> of<00:02:45.159> days<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.790> don't<00:02:46.030> add<00:02:46.329> a<00:02:46.359> new

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
couple of days if you don't add a new

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.530 
couple of days if you don't add a new
milk<00:02:47.049> so<00:02:47.980> when<00:02:48.129> you<00:02:48.220> add<00:02:48.430> new<00:02:48.700> milk<00:02:48.970> such<00:02:49.359> as

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
milk so when you add new milk such as

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.330 
milk so when you add new milk such as
this<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:50.709> begins<00:02:51.129> to<00:02:51.370> change<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.909> gets<00:02:52.090> thicker

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
this it begins to change it gets thicker

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.210 
this it begins to change it gets thicker
and<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.659> add<00:02:55.870> new<00:02:56.230> milk<00:02:56.650> each<00:02:56.829> day<00:02:57.159> you

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
and as you add new milk each day you

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.099 
and as you add new milk each day you
make<00:02:57.549> sure<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:58.120> shake<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.569> jar<00:02:58.599> just

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
make sure that you shake the jar just

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.119 
make sure that you shake the jar just
like<00:02:59.379> that<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.930> bacteria<00:03:02.139> that<00:03:02.739> it

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
like that so that the bacteria that it

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.319 
like that so that the bacteria that it
always<00:03:03.280> settles<00:03:03.670> at<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.819> bottom<00:03:03.939> because

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
always settles at the bottom because

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.300 
always settles at the bottom because
it's<00:03:04.569> heavier<00:03:05.819> can<00:03:06.819> feed<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.329> the<00:03:07.540> new<00:03:07.720> milk<00:03:08.310> so

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
it's heavier can feed on the new milk so

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.110 
it's heavier can feed on the new milk so
I<00:03:09.340> usually<00:03:09.639> drink<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.359> glass<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:11.340> or<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.400> smoothie

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
I usually drink a glass of or a smoothie

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.289 
I usually drink a glass of or a smoothie
with<00:03:13.500> my<00:03:14.500> keep<00:03:14.709> made<00:03:14.889> with<00:03:15.099> kefir<00:03:15.579> every<00:03:16.000> three

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
with my keep made with kefir every three

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.890 
with my keep made with kefir every three
days<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:18.040> make<00:03:18.670> sure<00:03:18.909> you<00:03:19.120> put<00:03:19.329> this<00:03:19.510> in<00:03:19.750> a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
days and make sure you put this in a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.479 
days and make sure you put this in a
dark<00:03:20.199> cabinet<00:03:20.470> just<00:03:20.919> put<00:03:21.129> it<00:03:21.190> inside<00:03:21.430> your

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
dark cabinet just put it inside your

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.629 
dark cabinet just put it inside your
cabinet<00:03:22.030> close<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.419> door<00:03:22.629> and<00:03:23.430> make<00:03:24.430> sure

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
cabinet close the door and make sure

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.569 
cabinet close the door and make sure
that<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.970> lid<00:03:25.180> is<00:03:25.209> just<00:03:25.660> on<00:03:25.840> top<00:03:26.139> do<00:03:26.440> not<00:03:26.680> close

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
that the lid is just on top do not close

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.780 
that the lid is just on top do not close
the<00:03:28.000> lid<00:03:28.180> all<00:03:28.449> the<00:03:28.629> way<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.859> in<00:03:30.129> the<00:03:30.250> jar

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the lid all the way and in the jar

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.699 
the lid all the way and in the jar
otherwise<00:03:31.209> you'll<00:03:31.449> suffocate<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.230> bacteria

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
otherwise you'll suffocate the bacteria

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.599 
otherwise you'll suffocate the bacteria
and<00:03:32.799> they'll<00:03:32.949> die<00:03:34.739> they'll<00:03:35.739> continue<00:03:36.159> to<00:03:36.370> grow

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
and they'll die they'll continue to grow

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.699 
and they'll die they'll continue to grow
as<00:03:39.609> they<00:03:39.940> eat<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.329> course<00:03:40.359> and<00:03:40.870> they<00:03:41.169> keep

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
as they eat of course and they keep

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.649 
as they eat of course and they keep
getting<00:03:42.340> larger<00:03:42.669> and<00:03:42.909> larger<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.389> what<00:03:43.540> you

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
getting larger and larger so what you

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.270 
getting larger and larger so what you
can<00:03:43.870> do<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.079> can<00:03:44.260> freeze<00:03:44.530> them<00:03:44.739> for<00:03:44.769> up<00:03:44.979> to<00:03:45.159> a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
can do you can freeze them for up to a

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.030 
can do you can freeze them for up to a
month<00:03:45.489> but<00:03:46.239> try<00:03:46.479> to<00:03:46.540> give<00:03:46.780> them<00:03:46.930> away<00:03:47.229> if<00:03:47.530> you

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
month but try to give them away if you

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.189 
month but try to give them away if you
can<00:03:48.280> they<00:03:48.909> usually<00:03:49.090> will<00:03:49.510> die<00:03:49.629> after<00:03:49.989> about<00:03:50.139> a

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
can they usually will die after about a

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.180 
can they usually will die after about a
month<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.769> freezer<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.650> that's<00:03:54.040> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
month in the freezer so that that's the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.949 
month in the freezer so that that's the
only<00:03:54.220> thing<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:54.609> can<00:03:54.879> do<00:03:55.090> with<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.479> extra

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
only thing you can do with the extra

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.780 
only thing you can do with the extra
keeper<00:03:56.409> and<00:03:56.560> if<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.739> join<00:03:56.919> the<00:03:57.099> website<00:03:57.549> where

keeper and if you join the website where
I<00:03:57.819> got<00:03:58.329> these<00:03:58.540> because<00:03:59.229> somebody<00:03:59.680> donated

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
I got these because somebody donated

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.619 
I got these because somebody donated
them<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.579> me<00:04:00.909> but<00:04:01.150> given<00:04:01.419> to<00:04:01.540> me<00:04:03.449> you<00:04:04.449> know<00:04:04.569> you

them to me but given to me you know you

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.080 
them to me but given to me you know you
can<00:04:04.930> also<00:04:05.079> volunteer<00:04:05.290> so<00:04:06.220> anybody<00:04:06.669> may<00:04:06.849> call

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
can also volunteer so anybody may call

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.500 
can also volunteer so anybody may call
me<00:04:07.239> Hank<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:07.750> ask<00:04:07.900> them<00:04:08.079> your<00:04:08.229> keeper<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:09.510> it

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
me Hank and ask them your keeper and it

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.879 
me Hank and ask them your keeper and it
would<00:04:10.629> be<00:04:10.750> great<00:04:10.900> if<00:04:11.109> you<00:04:11.229> could<00:04:11.409> share<00:04:11.709> them

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
would be great if you could share them

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:17.270 
would be great if you could share them
too<00:04:12.099> and<00:04:12.280> thick<00:04:12.579> and<00:04:12.729> also<00:04:13.709> benefit<00:04:14.709> from<00:04:14.949> it

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.379 

so<00:04:18.280> after<00:04:20.159> the<00:04:21.159> kefir<00:04:21.579> is<00:04:21.609> ready<00:04:21.909> to<00:04:22.000> be<00:04:22.120> poured

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
so after the kefir is ready to be poured

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.029 
so after the kefir is ready to be poured
out<00:04:22.630> into<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.930> jar<00:04:23.229> I<00:04:23.260> always<00:04:23.620> put<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.919> in

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
out into a jar I always put it in

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.250 
out into a jar I always put it in
something<00:04:24.400> like<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.760> or<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.180> smaller<00:04:25.840> doesn't

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
something like this or a smaller doesn't

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.180 
something like this or a smaller doesn't
matter<00:04:26.440> and

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
matter and

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.030 
matter and
the<00:04:28.760> longer<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.300> sits<00:04:29.660> in<00:04:30.020> this<00:04:30.350> condition<00:04:30.860> the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
the longer it sits in this condition the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.100 
the longer it sits in this condition the
more<00:04:31.930> b-vitamins

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
more b-vitamins

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.200 
more b-vitamins
will<00:04:33.410> continue<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.100> grow<00:04:34.340> so<00:04:34.730> you'll<00:04:34.970> get<00:04:35.150> a

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210
