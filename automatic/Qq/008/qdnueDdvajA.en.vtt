00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.370
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.530
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello together we want something broken 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.910
 do not really do that though 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.320
 bit i have a usb here 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.359
 turntable and so we better 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.330
 must be able to see the hood to lose weight there 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.140
 you have to back a feather artifact 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.320
 press together 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.990
 that 's it then usb turntable why 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.480
 Now we clear our records 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.099
 want to save our old treasures 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 we have to play over in the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.480
 computers make mp3s out of it just like they do 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.840
 We did that with a USB disk player like that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.140
 I brought an old thing with me 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.210
 it runs with 45 turns 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.910
 we need here this wore he is 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.350
 now it will be out of hand 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 provided with it the right one 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.879
 Otherwise , you can center the and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.079
 that really very bad at such and 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.850
 that was it's speed 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.210
 set clear old shellac records 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.969
 I can adjust here with 78 45 for 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.600
 the small singles and a third for 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.369
 the long-playing records and now namely 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.240
 the tonearm set over standing on 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.040
 automatic set up as finished 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.909
 I do the things in my computer too 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.290
 quite simply over the usb connection and 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.479
 now I need nothing else than that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 supplied program this too 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.659
 to start city but that's already working 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.850
 and here to go recording so and so 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.350
 You see, he takes on something at the moment 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.740
 runs like this and when we recorded it 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.110
 then have it in the computer and there 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.310
 can i change the mp3 or someday else 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.060
 Save format 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.829
 that was s then stop normal recording 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.100
 again 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:53.100
 Also included is this one 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.829
 program that's called restaurator pro 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.500
 5 and this restorer of the help me 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.630
 old records maybe 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.869
 have scratches and how to patter and otherwise 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.909
 Fits to fix after you 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.190
 so only the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.800
 Recording that works in principle 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.930
 very well 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.780
 There are preset filters and stuff 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.129
 you can just shove it 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.310
 adjust how you need it and off 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.530
 so fun so they can their old 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.980
 not only listening to records but also for 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.950
 to transform the future digitally and in the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.010
 calculator on usb then later or in 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.879
 your iphone or whatever 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.840
 listen to 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.840
 until then and for
