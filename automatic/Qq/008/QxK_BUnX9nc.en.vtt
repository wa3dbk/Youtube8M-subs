00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459 
although I don't really like to do

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.120 
although I don't really like to do
research<00:01:31.640> what<00:01:32.420> I've<00:01:32.539> heard<00:01:32.780> is<00:01:33.080> they<00:01:33.979> will

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
research what I've heard is they will

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.270

only<00:01:34.399> ship<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.330> regions<00:01:36.289> where<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.770> beef<00:01:36.979> I

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
only ship to regions where the beef I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.680 
only ship to regions where the beef I
guess<00:01:37.459> the<00:01:37.580> beef<00:01:37.729> comes<00:01:38.030> from<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.390> west<00:01:38.569> coast

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
guess the beef comes from the west coast

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.570 
guess the beef comes from the west coast
where<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.560> beef<00:01:39.739> can<00:01:39.950> be<00:01:40.069> shipped<00:01:40.340> there

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
where the beef can be shipped there

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.669 
where the beef can be shipped there
without<00:01:40.880> freezing<00:01:41.330> it<00:01:41.660> it's<00:01:42.050> like<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.259> burger

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679
