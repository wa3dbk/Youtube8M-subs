n 103 and the shark Evo line both those
models<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:34.890> very<00:00:35.160> good<00:00:35.399> choices<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
models are very good choices but the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780 
models are very good choices but the
multitec<00:00:37.140> does<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.559> few<00:00:37.800> things<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.430> my<00:00:38.550> opinion

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
multitec does a few things in my opinion

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.130 
multitec does a few things in my opinion
a<00:00:39.000> little<00:00:39.090> bit<00:00:39.270> better<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> thought<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> would

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
a little bit better so I thought I would

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.569 
a little bit better so I thought I would
share<00:00:40.290> those<00:00:40.469> things<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.040> we'll<00:00:41.129> also<00:00:41.280> talk

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
share those things and we'll also talk

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.330 
share those things and we'll also talk
about<00:00:41.840> where<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.079> multi<00:00:43.530> tech<00:00:43.800> actually

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
about where the multi tech actually

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.610 
about where the multi tech actually
misses<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> mark<00:00:45.059> slightly<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.379> without

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
misses the mark slightly so without

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
misses the mark slightly so without
further<00:00:46.800> ado<00:00:47.190> let's<00:00:47.879> talk<00:00:48.120> about<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
further ado let's talk about the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.650 
further ado let's talk about the
mechanism<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.710> modular<00:00:50.430> itself<00:00:51.030> very

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
mechanism of the modular itself very

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.779 
mechanism of the modular itself very
very<00:00:51.899> smooth<00:00:52.140> opening<00:00:52.440> very<00:00:53.039> easy<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.520> open

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
very smooth opening very easy to open

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.819 
very smooth opening very easy to open
with<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.030> safety<00:00:54.570> mechanism<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.620> does

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
with the safety mechanism and it does

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.700 
with the safety mechanism and it does
hold<00:00:56.129> very<00:00:56.850> strong<00:00:57.239> at<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> top<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
hold very strong at the top of the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.689 
hold very strong at the top of the
helmet<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.100> not<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> come<00:00:59.550> flying

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
helmet it's not going to come flying

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.180 
helmet it's not going to come flying
down<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.690> you've<00:01:00.840> had<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> model<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.949> past

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
down so you've had a model the past

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
down so you've had a model the past
where<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.760> top<00:01:03.030> would<00:01:03.210> fall<00:01:03.390> down<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
where the top would fall down the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.329 
where the top would fall down the
cheaper<00:01:04.290> models<00:01:04.589> sometimes<00:01:04.920> are<00:01:05.129> prone<00:01:05.309> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
cheaper models sometimes are prone to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.600 
cheaper models sometimes are prone to
that<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.180> multitec<00:01:06.630> does<00:01:06.930> stay<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.610> quite

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that the multitec does stay up quite

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.899 
that the multitec does stay up quite
strong<00:01:09.000> alright<00:01:09.810> talk<00:01:10.320> me<00:01:10.470> about<00:01:10.680> safety<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
strong alright talk me about safety the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.920 
strong alright talk me about safety the
fear<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.229> modular<00:01:14.189> helmet<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.930> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
fear with a modular helmet is that the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.080 
fear with a modular helmet is that the
helmet<00:01:16.259> might<00:01:16.530> unexpectedly<00:01:17.280> open<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.000> the

helmet might unexpectedly open in the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.700 
helmet might unexpectedly open in the
event<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.390> an<00:01:18.450> accident<00:01:18.570> well

event of an accident well

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
event of an accident well
Shoei<00:01:20.130> has<00:01:20.310> addressed<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.540> have

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
Shoei has addressed that they do have

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.539 
Shoei has addressed that they do have

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
of the chin bar to help keep that nice

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
of the chin bar to help keep that nice
strong<00:01:26.070> connection<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.090> they've<00:01:27.180> also<00:01:27.360> gone

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
strong connection but they've also gone

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.490 
strong connection but they've also gone
one<00:01:27.810> step<00:01:27.840> further

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
one step further

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.030 
one step further
many<00:01:29.310> modulars<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:31.590> opening

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
many modulars out there use a an opening

many modulars out there use a an opening
this<00:01:32.549> more<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> thumb<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> push

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
this more of a thumb that you push

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
this more of a thumb that you push
forward<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.409> out<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> multitec<00:01:35.700> has

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
let's talk about the fit and sizing

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.289 
let's talk about the fit and sizing
sizing<00:03:41.079> does<00:03:41.560> run<00:03:41.890> pretty<00:03:42.459> true<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.760> size<00:03:42.910> if

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
sizing does run pretty true to size if

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.479 
sizing does run pretty true to size if
you've<00:03:43.420> measured<00:03:43.600> your<00:03:43.959> head<00:03:44.310> pretty<00:03:45.310> much

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
you've measured your head pretty much

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
trust a showy sizing chart you're going

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:47.610 
trust a showy sizing chart you're going
to<00:03:47.019> be<00:03:47.110> okay

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620

to be okay
the<00:03:48.160> shape<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.730> helmet<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.420> does<00:03:49.750> tend<00:03:50.079> to

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
the shape of the helmet it does tend to

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.580 
the shape of the helmet it does tend to

looking into for you now one of the

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
points where I think showing maybe

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.600 
points where I think showing maybe
slightly<00:04:22.630> missed<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.200> mark<00:04:23.380> was<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.340> liner

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
slightly missed the mark was the liner

the<00:04:27.810> helmet<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.260> you<00:04:28.350> can<00:04:28.470> change<00:04:28.740> these<00:04:28.950> two

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.420 
different sizes the top liner actually
is<00:04:32.250> fixed<00:04:32.820> inside<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.960> shell<00:04:34.230> which<00:04:35.010> means<00:04:35.250> it

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
is fixed inside the shell which means it

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.180 
is fixed inside the shell which means it
is<00:04:35.460> not<00:04:35.700> removable<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:37.350> does<00:04:37.770> miss<00:04:38.160> a

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
is not removable so it does miss a
