some people fall gonna get it all get it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.830 
some people fall gonna get it all get it
at<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.090> you're<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.659> going

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
at all because you're not really going

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
at all because you're not really going
for<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.500> yeah<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> guess<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
for it but yeah I guess you just have to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.460 
for it but yeah I guess you just have to
try<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.390> eventually<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:18.990> get<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.290> within

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
try and eventually will get it within

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
try and eventually will get it within
the<00:01:19.680> day<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> don't<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.670> take<00:01:20.909> too

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the day because it don't really take too

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.910 
the day because it don't really take too
long<00:01:21.659> time<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.110> kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.500> depends<00:01:22.830> on

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
long time it kind of just depends on

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
long time it kind of just depends on
what<00:01:23.040> you're<00:01:23.189> doing<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:24.270> bit<00:01:24.420> based<00:01:24.630> on

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
what you're doing a little bit based on

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.260 
what you're doing a little bit based on
look<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> from<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.820> kind<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
look I think and from there it's kind of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.660 
look I think and from there it's kind of
just<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.470> goes<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.860> guess<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.340> do

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
just going as it goes I guess I do

another one I forgot which one it was

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.609 
another one I forgot which one it was
but<00:02:02.159> basically<00:02:02.640> agility<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:03.840> agility<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
but basically agility it was agility and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.260

with<00:02:05.100> all<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.340> these<00:02:05.490> stats<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:05.969> get<00:02:06.090> one

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
with all of these stats you can get one

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 
with all of these stats you can get one
of<00:02:06.299> these<00:02:06.509> special<00:02:07.380> capes<00:02:07.799> as<00:02:08.009> well<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.520> I

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
of these special capes as well and I

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.369 
of these special capes as well and I
think<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.360> get<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.780> as<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.140> combi

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
think that I can get that as a combi

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.040 
think that I can get that as a combi
three<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:10.830> soon<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.670> combi<00:02:12.030> three<00:02:12.239> male

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
three or soon to be combi three male

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.190 
three or soon to be combi three male
that<00:02:13.440> it's<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:14.090> cape<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.120> only<00:02:15.510> requires<00:02:15.990> me

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
that it's a cape that only requires me

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.540 
that it's a cape that only requires me
to<00:02:16.230> use<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.530> recoil<00:02:16.830> rings<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.340> Slayer

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
to use to recoil rings of Slayer

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.090 
to use to recoil rings of Slayer
monsters<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.600> I'm<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.050> sure<00:02:19.380> which

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
monsters but I'm not really sure which

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.130 
monsters but I'm not really sure which
Slayer<00:02:20.520> monsters<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.210> requires<00:02:21.570> me<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.810> kill

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
Slayer monsters that requires me to kill

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.180 
Slayer monsters that requires me to kill
so<00:02:22.320> I'm<00:02:22.380> not<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.620> sure<00:02:22.830> if<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.100> actually

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
so I'm not really sure if it actually

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.910 
so I'm not really sure if it actually
can<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.690> support<00:02:24.960> cape<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.710> think

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
can get the support cape but I think

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.620 
can get the support cape but I think
that<00:02:26.040> would<00:02:26.160> be<00:02:26.190> cool<00:02:26.520> but<00:02:27.000> even<00:02:27.300> if<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.480> could

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
that would be cool but even if it could

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.120 
that would be cool but even if it could
get<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.140> don't<00:02:28.200> really<00:02:28.680> think<00:02:28.800> I'm<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.070> to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
get it I don't really think I'm going to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.130 
get it I don't really think I'm going to
wear<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.550> much<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.180> my<00:02:30.450> circuit<00:02:31.110> is

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
wear it that much because my circuit is

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.380 
wear it that much because my circuit is
kind<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:32.070> part<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.610> my<00:02:32.820> outfit<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.360> I

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
kind of the part of my outfit that I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.330 
kind of the part of my outfit that I
want<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.900> keep<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.500> guess<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> won't<00:02:35.190> really

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
want to keep I guess so I won't really

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.580 
want to keep I guess so I won't really
use<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.330> it's<00:02:36.570> kind<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.780> fun<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.170> and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
use it but it's kind of fun to have and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.410 
use it but it's kind of fun to have and
I<00:02:37.620> guess<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.310> would<00:02:38.460> be<00:02:38.490> nice<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.240> to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
I guess it would be nice to have just to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.030 
I guess it would be nice to have just to
show<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.780> off<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:40.080> whatever<00:02:40.320> reason<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.860> I

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
show it off for whatever reason that I

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.400 
show it off for whatever reason that I
might<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.880> guess<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.780> everyone<00:02:43.200> likes

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
might have I guess not everyone likes

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.290 
might have I guess not everyone likes
these<00:02:43.680> caves<00:02:44.010> however<00:02:44.400> because<00:02:44.850> it's<00:02:45.060> more

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
these caves however because it's more

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.970 
these caves however because it's more
caves<00:02:45.570> being<00:02:45.870> added<00:02:46.080> into<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.500> game<00:02:46.710> not

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
caves being added into the game not

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.430 
caves being added into the game not
really<00:02:47.280> everyone<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.150> very<00:02:48.600> comfortable<00:02:49.140> or

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
really everyone is very comfortable or

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.770 
really everyone is very comfortable or
things<00:02:49.770> that's<00:02:49.980> okay<00:02:50.460> because<00:02:50.700> if<00:02:51.120> kind<00:02:51.630> of

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
things that's okay because if kind of

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.660 
things that's okay because if kind of
what<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.740> lot<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.070> people<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.580> can

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
what a lot of people that I can

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.220 
what a lot of people that I can
understand<00:02:54.210> as<00:02:54.360> well<00:02:54.600> think<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.050> it's

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
understand as well think that it's

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.330 
understand as well think that it's
enough<00:02:55.470> capes<00:02:55.710> in<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.950> game<00:02:56.100> at<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.310> moment

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
enough capes in the game at the moment

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.610 
enough capes in the game at the moment
because<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:57.030> gets<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.240> confusing<00:02:57.810> but<00:02:58.410> all

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
because it gets so confusing but all

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.470 
because it gets so confusing but all
these<00:02:58.830> kinds<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.340> capes<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.910> accomplishment

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the game which I think it's a really

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.010 
the game which I think it's a really
good<00:03:17.459> thing<00:03:17.520> because<00:03:17.820> outfit<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.570> completely

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020
