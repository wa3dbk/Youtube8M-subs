00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
so we're going to continue on what we

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.570 
so we're going to continue on what we
started<00:00:02.280> on<00:00:02.460> on<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:03.510> previous<00:00:04.080> previous<00:00:05.009> DVDs

started on on the previous previous DVDs
we're<00:00:06.330> going<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.509> expand<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.990> little<00:00:07.020> bit<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.710> on

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
we're going to expand a little bit on on

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.860 
we're going to expand a little bit on on
phrasing<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.670> we're<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.150> explore<00:00:09.450> some

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
phrasing and we're going to explore some

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.759 
phrasing and we're going to explore some
outside<00:00:10.800> phrasing<00:00:11.519> concept<00:00:12.380> playing<00:00:13.380> outside

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
outside phrasing concept playing outside

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.000 
outside phrasing concept playing outside
is<00:00:14.330> basically<00:00:15.330> playing<00:00:15.660> outside<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
is basically playing outside of the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
is basically playing outside of the
original<00:00:17.460> key<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:18.240> you're<00:00:18.480> supposed<00:00:19.020> to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
original key that you're supposed to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.370 
original key that you're supposed to
plan<00:00:19.789> still<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:21.060> sound<00:00:21.300> really<00:00:21.600> good<00:00:21.779> if<00:00:22.020> done

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
plan still can sound really good if done

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.380 
plan still can sound really good if done
tastefully<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.279> that's<00:00:23.970> what<00:00:24.119> we're<00:00:24.269> going

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
tastefully and that's what we're going

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.359 
tastefully and that's what we're going
to<00:00:24.449> explore<00:00:24.779> today<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.380> some<00:00:25.619> some<00:00:25.980> scales

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
to explore today with some some scales

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.570 
to explore today with some some scales
and<00:00:26.760> some<00:00:26.939> ideas<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.769> want<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> take

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and some ideas that I want you to take

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.200 
and some ideas that I want you to take
and<00:00:30.170> explore<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.830> develop<00:00:32.340> remember

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and explore and and develop remember

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
and explore and and develop remember
that<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:34.110> own<00:00:34.230> voice<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.829> these

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that you have your own voice and these

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.430 
that you have your own voice and these
are<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:35.910> tools<00:00:36.360> really<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.200> take

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
are just tools really so you take

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
are just tools really so you take
whatever<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.280> whatever<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.180> appealing

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
whatever you like whatever is appealing

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.720 
whatever you like whatever is appealing
to<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.110> try<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> incorporate<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.460> into

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
to you and try to incorporate that into

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.869 
to you and try to incorporate that into
your<00:00:42.030> own<00:00:42.350> playing<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.620> don't<00:00:44.340> forget<00:00:44.489> about

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
your own playing and don't forget about

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.910 
your own playing and don't forget about
the<00:00:45.059> elements<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:46.170> already<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.739> your

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the elements that are already in your

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.180 
the elements that are already in your
playing<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.670> adding<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
playing you're just adding to it and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.560 
playing you're just adding to it and
basically<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.460> want<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.059> take<00:00:51.300> these

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
basically I want you to take these

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.020 
basically I want you to take these
elements<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.530> make<00:00:52.649> them<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:52.980> own<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.820> order

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
elements and make them your own in order

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.540 
elements and make them your own in order
to<00:00:54.090> play<00:00:54.420> outside<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> use<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
to play outside we're going to use a

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.540 
to play outside we're going to use a
concept<00:00:56.550> called<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> tritone<00:00:57.750> substitution

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
concept called the tritone substitution

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.009 
concept called the tritone substitution
the<00:00:59.550> tritone<00:01:00.000> substitution<00:01:00.170> is<00:01:01.190> basically

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
the tritone substitution is basically

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.740 
the tritone substitution is basically
replacing<00:01:04.019> an<00:01:04.739> element<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.750> another

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
replacing an element with another

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.710 
replacing an element with another
element<00:01:07.170> found<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.740> tritone<00:01:08.070> above<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:09.420> all

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
element found a tritone above on all

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.210 
element found a tritone above on all
that<00:01:09.900> made<00:01:10.110> any<00:01:10.229> sense<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:10.680> well<00:01:10.979> really

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that made any sense very well really

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.830 
that made any sense very well really
soon<00:01:11.659> let's<00:01:12.659> define<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> tritone<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
soon let's define what a tritone is a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.530 
soon let's define what a tritone is a
tritone<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.460> interesting<00:01:17.729> interval

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
tritone is a very interesting interval

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.130 
tritone is a very interesting interval
that<00:01:18.890> is<00:01:19.890> found<00:01:20.100> right<00:01:20.450> exactly<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.750> in

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that is found right exactly in in

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.060 
that is found right exactly in in
between<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> root<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.420> octave<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.560> let's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
between a root and it's octave so let's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280 
between a root and it's octave so let's
take<00:01:26.220> an<00:01:26.340> example<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:28.049> playing

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
take an example here so that I'm playing

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.179 
take an example here so that I'm playing
an<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.400> low<00:01:29.579> E<00:01:29.850> string<00:01:29.880> 5th<00:01:30.479> fret<00:01:31.189> that's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
an a on the low E string 5th fret that's

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
an a on the low E string 5th fret that's
my<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.079> my<00:01:34.079> octave<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.250> found<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.960> here

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
my a and my octave is found right here

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.399 
my a and my octave is found right here
on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> 4th<00:01:37.590> string<00:01:37.950> seventh<00:01:38.340> fret<00:01:39.409> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
on the 4th string seventh fret the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.859 
on the 4th string seventh fret the
distance<00:01:40.860> between<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.430> note<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.630> one

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
distance between this note and that one

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
distance between this note and that one
is<00:01:43.259> an<00:01:43.860> octave<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.890> split<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> active<00:01:47.430> in

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
is an octave if I split that active in

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.359 
is an octave if I split that active in
to<00:01:48.119> right<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.869> middle<00:01:50.990> I'm<00:01:51.990> gonna<00:01:52.140> have

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
to right in the middle I'm gonna have

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.980 
to right in the middle I'm gonna have
this<00:01:53.369> note<00:01:53.610> right<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> 5th<00:01:54.450> string

this note right here on the 5th string
6th<00:01:55.590> fret<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.360> visually<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.810> see

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
6th fret and visually you can really see

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.300 
6th fret and visually you can really see
that<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.350> right<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> middle<00:01:59.009> it's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that it's right in the middle it's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.520 
that it's right in the middle it's
between<00:01:59.670> strength<00:02:00.659> 6<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.290> 4

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
between strength 6 and 4

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.890 
between strength 6 and 4
and<00:02:02.890> it's<00:02:03.220> right<00:02:03.549> in<00:02:03.820> between<00:02:04.090> those<00:02:04.540> spreads

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
and it's right in between those spreads

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.140 
and it's right in between those spreads
between<00:02:05.080> frets<00:02:05.530> five<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.100> seven<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.700> we're

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
between frets five and seven and we're

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.300 
between frets five and seven and we're
going<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.299> substitute<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:08.200> dominant<00:02:08.860> seventh

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
going to substitute a dominant seventh

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.830 
going to substitute a dominant seventh
chord<00:02:09.670> with<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.830> similar<00:02:12.700> cord<00:02:13.240> another

chord with a similar cord another

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.040 
chord with a similar cord another
dominant<00:02:14.530> seventh<00:02:14.890> chord<00:02:15.160> played<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> tritone

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
dominant seventh chord played a tritone

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.620 
dominant seventh chord played a tritone
above<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.580> I'm<00:02:19.060> substituting<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.050> a7<00:02:21.630> I'm

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
above so if I'm substituting the a7 I'm

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.870 
above so if I'm substituting the a7 I'm
going<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> take<00:02:23.140> from<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.069> eight<00:02:24.340> I'm<00:02:24.640> going

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
going to take from that eight I'm going

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.410 
going to take from that eight I'm going
to<00:02:24.940> find<00:02:25.120> my<00:02:25.239> tritone<00:02:25.840> above<00:02:27.030> which<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.060> in

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
to find my tritone above which is in

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.440 
to find my tritone above which is in
this<00:02:28.540> case<00:02:28.810> d<00:02:29.500> sharp<00:02:29.800> or<00:02:30.100> E<00:02:30.160> flat<00:02:30.580> depending<00:02:31.360> on

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
this case d sharp or E flat depending on

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.229 
this case d sharp or E flat depending on
how<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.600> want<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.900> see<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.709> from<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.459> d

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
how you want to see it and from that d

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.030 
how you want to see it and from that d
sharp<00:02:34.480> or<00:02:34.720> E<00:02:34.750> flat<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.260> can<00:02:35.440> play<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.830> dominant

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
sharp or E flat I can play a dominant

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.720 
sharp or E flat I can play a dominant
seventh<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> I'm<00:02:39.790> replacing<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.390> a7<00:02:41.730> with

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
seventh so I'm replacing the a7 with

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.160 
seventh so I'm replacing the a7 with
this<00:02:42.940> cord<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.350> play<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:49.239> succession

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
this cord and if I play in succession

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.370 
this cord and if I play in succession
these<00:02:50.500> two<00:02:50.709> chords<00:02:51.130> one<00:02:51.280> after<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.670> other

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
these two chords one after the other

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.400 
these two chords one after the other
over<00:02:53.380> an<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.370> loop<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.510> I'm<00:02:55.720> going<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.930> loop<00:02:56.110> a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
over an a loop just I'm going to loop a

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.980 
over an a loop just I'm going to loop a
base<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.250> a<00:03:02.069> here's<00:03:03.069> an<00:03:03.220> a7

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
base of a here's an a7

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.030 
base of a here's an a7
here's<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.830> ducharme<00:03:06.250> 7<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:08.560> still<00:03:08.800> kind<00:03:09.010> of

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
here's a ducharme 7 it still kind of

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:17.980 
here's a ducharme 7 it still kind of
works

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.420 

so<00:03:18.990> it<00:03:19.140> might<00:03:19.290> sound<00:03:19.500> like<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:19.830> musically

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
so it might sound like this musically

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.880 
so it might sound like this musically
I'm<00:03:20.550> going<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.790> focus<00:03:21.150> more<00:03:21.600> on<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:22.020> a7<00:03:22.680> and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
I'm going to focus more on the a7 and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.890 
I'm going to focus more on the a7 and
then<00:03:23.220> play<00:03:23.460> outside<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.880> little<00:03:24.150> bit<00:03:24.390> using

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
then play outside a little bit using

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.800 
then play outside a little bit using
that<00:03:25.020> substitution
