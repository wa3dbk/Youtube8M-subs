00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
rotate around Karen County's dancing

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.340 
rotate around Karen County's dancing
forward<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.730> she'll<00:00:35.880> explain<00:00:36.270> soon<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.200> I've

around that line of dance so it's very
important<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.110> allow<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> left<00:00:43.770> leg<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
important here to allow the left leg to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.459

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
leg is starting the rotation I'm now

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
leg is starting the rotation I'm now
going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> continue<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> rise<00:00:53.579> onto<00:00:54.030> my<00:00:54.390> left

a very still position so I'll show you
it<00:04:34.469> that<00:04:34.500> way<00:04:34.949> as<00:04:35.219> well

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.689

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
over my left shoulder the choice is

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.830 
over my left shoulder the choice is
yours<00:04:45.930> really<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:47.060> then<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.090> take<00:04:48.449> my<00:04:48.599> head

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
yours really and then I take my head

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.260

turn<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.319> the<00:04:49.469> right<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.919> very<00:04:50.159> conscious<00:04:50.909> but

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
turn to the right and very conscious but

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.390 
turn to the right and very conscious but
I<00:04:51.330> still<00:04:51.690> keep<00:04:51.840> my<00:04:51.900> right<00:04:52.319> front<00:04:52.710> moving

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
I still keep my right front moving

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.180 
I still keep my right front moving
forwards<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.300> Marcus<00:04:54.810> quite<00:04:55.409> difficult<00:04:55.710> when

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
forwards to Marcus quite difficult when

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.279 
forwards to Marcus quite difficult when
I<00:04:56.310> turn<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.759> head<00:04:56.909> to<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.090> right<00:04:57.210> if<00:04:57.599> I<00:04:58.050> take

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
I turn the head to the right if I take

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.409 
I turn the head to the right if I take
my<00:04:58.469> right<00:04:58.680> side<00:04:59.039> away<00:04:59.219> I<00:04:59.580> could<00:05:00.090> be<00:05:00.240> a<00:05:00.270> little

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
my right side away I could be a little

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.820 
my right side away I could be a little
bit<00:05:00.719> heavy<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:02.300> we'll<00:05:03.300> try<00:05:03.479> that<00:05:03.750> again<00:05:03.930> also

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
bit heavy but we'll try that again also

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.950 
bit heavy but we'll try that again also
at<00:05:04.979> this<00:05:05.129> point<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.729> running<00:05:06.000> weave<00:05:06.210> the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
at this point the running weave the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.839 
at this point the running weave the
smooth<00:05:07.259> action<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.039> beautiful<00:05:08.669> and

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
smooth action is so beautiful and

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.570 
smooth action is so beautiful and
sometimes<00:05:09.210> if<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.349> leg<00:05:10.650> patterning<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
sometimes if the leg patterning and the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.010 
sometimes if the leg patterning and the
leg<00:05:11.789> tracking<00:05:12.360> is<00:05:12.509> a<00:05:12.539> little<00:05:12.900> bit

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
leg tracking is a little bit

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.200 
leg tracking is a little bit
undisciplined<00:05:13.469> it<00:05:14.159> can<00:05:14.580> look<00:05:14.789> a<00:05:14.909> little<00:05:14.940> bit

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
undisciplined it can look a little bit

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.659 
undisciplined it can look a little bit
wild<00:05:15.599> so<00:05:16.289> we're<00:05:16.439> trying<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.800> keep<00:05:16.979> this<00:05:17.159> in<00:05:17.370> one

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
wild so we're trying to keep this in one

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.570 
wild so we're trying to keep this in one

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
and make sure that I don't take the step

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.129 
and make sure that I don't take the step
too<00:06:01.770> big<00:06:02.069> on<00:06:02.250> my<00:06:02.550> right<00:06:02.849> foot<00:06:02.879> because<00:06:03.810> if<00:06:03.930> I<00:06:04.080> do

I'll<00:06:04.469> end<00:06:04.710> up<00:06:04.919> underneath<00:06:05.339> Marcus's<00:06:06.270> right

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
I'll end up underneath Marcus's right

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.420 
I'll end up underneath Marcus's right
arm<00:06:06.779> and<00:06:06.990> the<00:06:07.139> next<00:06:07.560> step<00:06:07.770> could<00:06:08.009> be<00:06:08.069> quite

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
arm and the next step could be quite

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.640 
arm and the next step could be quite
complicated<00:06:08.849> so<00:06:09.419> if<00:06:09.839> we<00:06:09.960> show<00:06:10.169> you<00:06:10.229> this<00:06:10.500> on

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
complicated so if we show you this on

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.850 
complicated so if we show you this on
another<00:06:10.889> camera<00:06:11.370> angle<00:06:12.440> from<00:06:13.440> this<00:06:13.650> direction

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
another camera angle from this direction

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.660 
another camera angle from this direction
so<00:06:16.860> we're<00:06:17.039> dancing<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:17.550> one-two

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
so we're dancing the one-two

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.290 
so we're dancing the one-two
three<00:06:19.330> and<00:06:19.830> as<00:06:20.830> you'll<00:06:21.070> notice<00:06:21.460> here<00:06:21.790> I'm<00:06:22.030> just

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
three and as you'll notice here I'm just

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.750 
three and as you'll notice here I'm just
placing<00:06:22.870> my<00:06:23.020> right<00:06:23.350> foot<00:06:23.710> right<00:06:24.310> underneath

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
placing my right foot right underneath

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.540 
placing my right foot right underneath
my<00:06:25.120> mop<00:06:25.390> body<00:06:25.660> I'm<00:06:26.110> not<00:06:26.170> tempted<00:06:26.830> to<00:06:27.250> try<00:06:27.490> to

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
my mop body I'm not tempted to try to

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.590 
my mop body I'm not tempted to try to
step<00:06:27.970> outside<00:06:28.530> partner<00:06:29.530> so<00:06:30.130> greatly<00:06:30.490> so<00:06:31.480> the

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
step outside partner so greatly so the

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.300 
step outside partner so greatly so the
balance<00:06:31.780> points<00:06:32.380> are<00:06:32.500> still<00:06:32.710> connected

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
balance points are still connected

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.490 
balance points are still connected
together
