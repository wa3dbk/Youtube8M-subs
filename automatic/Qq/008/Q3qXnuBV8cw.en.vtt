situation and it allows 10 or more views
of<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.400> same<00:05:23.639> situation<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:24.720> when<00:05:25.260> you<00:05:25.380> read

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
of the same situation and when you read

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.860 
of the same situation and when you read
through<00:05:25.919> it<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.310> study<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.699> you<00:05:26.940> say<00:05:27.150> I<00:05:27.330> can't

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
through it and study it you say I can't

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.330 
through it and study it you say I can't
believe<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.349> never<00:05:28.409> even<00:05:28.770> thought<00:05:28.919> of<00:05:29.099> that

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
believe I never even thought of that

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.339 
believe I never even thought of that
approach<00:05:29.669> and<00:05:30.030> what<00:05:30.419> I<00:05:30.449> think<00:05:30.720> it's<00:05:30.870> done<00:05:31.080> over

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
approach and what I think it's done over

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.920 
approach and what I think it's done over
the<00:05:31.440> years<00:05:31.470> is<00:05:31.740> we<00:05:32.669> really<00:05:32.909> credit<00:05:33.330> ourselves

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
the years is we really credit ourselves

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.899 
the years is we really credit ourselves
and<00:05:34.080> in<00:05:34.199> business<00:05:34.620> life<00:05:34.830> of<00:05:35.099> thinking<00:05:35.490> outside

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
and in business life of thinking outside

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.510 
and in business life of thinking outside
the<00:05:35.940> box<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.659> by<00:05:37.409> being<00:05:37.620> able<00:05:38.039> to<00:05:38.190> see<00:05:38.340> all

the box and by being able to see all

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.730 
the box and by being able to see all
these<00:05:38.699> different<00:05:39.030> points<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.690> view<00:05:39.930> whenever

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
these different points of view whenever

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.100 
these different points of view whenever
we<00:05:41.310> look<00:05:41.490> at<00:05:41.639> a<00:05:41.729> situation<00:05:41.970> there's<00:05:42.690> always

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
we look at a situation there's always

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.700 
we look at a situation there's always
the<00:05:43.919> most<00:05:44.070> obvious<00:05:44.370> answer<00:05:45.409> but<00:05:46.409> there<00:05:46.590> are

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
the most obvious answer but there are

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.469 
the most obvious answer but there are
many<00:05:46.800> answers<00:05:47.280> on<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.639> periphery<00:05:47.940> that<00:05:48.330> may

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
many answers on the periphery that may

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.749 
many answers on the periphery that may
make<00:05:48.659> more<00:05:48.720> sense<00:05:48.990> right<00:05:49.710> interesting<00:05:50.460> maybe

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
make more sense right interesting maybe

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:51.980 
make more sense right interesting maybe
I<00:05:50.820> should<00:05:51.030> start<00:05:51.210> telling<00:05:51.509> studying<00:05:51.900> that

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
I should start telling studying that

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.779 
I should start telling studying that
