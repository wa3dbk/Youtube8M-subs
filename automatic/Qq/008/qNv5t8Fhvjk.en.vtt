again and continue that way until you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.060 
again and continue that way until you
have<00:01:17.400> wrapped<00:01:17.700> four<00:01:18.270> beads<00:01:21.650> after<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> fourth

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
have wrapped four beads after the fourth

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.420 
have wrapped four beads after the fourth
bead<00:01:23.430> wrap<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.390> wire<00:01:24.630> once<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.799> add<00:01:26.100> three

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
bead wrap the wire once then add three

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.830

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
beads one after the other so that's a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.289 
beads one after the other so that's a
seed<00:01:31.110> bead<00:01:31.409> followed<00:01:32.280> by<00:01:32.490> your<00:01:32.700> large<00:01:32.939> bead

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299

then<00:01:33.960> another<00:01:34.320> seed<00:01:34.680> bead<00:01:35.810> then<00:01:36.810> continue<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
then another seed bead then continue to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.380 
then another seed bead then continue to
wrap<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.860> wire<00:01:37.890> twice<00:01:38.640> around<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> hoop

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
wrap the wire twice around the hoop

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:51.210 
wrap the wire twice around the hoop
after<00:01:40.049> each<00:01:40.229> bead<00:01:40.619> until<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:41.700> finished

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.750 

next<00:01:52.220> make<00:01:52.670> two<00:01:53.180> three<00:01:54.110> quarter-inch<00:01:54.920> coils

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
next make two three quarter-inch coils

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.880 
next make two three quarter-inch coils
and<00:01:56.120> separate<00:01:56.690> them<00:01:56.870> in<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.110> middle<00:01:57.500> by

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
and separate them in the middle by

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.830 
and separate them in the middle by
gently<00:01:58.310> pulling<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.820> middle<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.360> little<00:01:59.540> bit

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
gently pulling the middle a little bit

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.870 
gently pulling the middle a little bit
apart<00:02:01.600> fold<00:02:02.600> each<00:02:02.810> coil<00:02:03.229> over<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.979> place<00:02:04.670> them

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
apart fold each coil over and place them

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.529 
apart fold each coil over and place them
over<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.300> ends<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.840> your<00:02:06.080> earring<00:02:06.470> hoops<00:02:07.539> if

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
over the ends of your earring hoops if

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.779 
over the ends of your earring hoops if
the<00:02:08.810> call<00:02:09.050> you've<00:02:09.320> made<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.920> not<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.280> snug<00:02:10.759> fit

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
the call you've made is not a snug fit

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.690 
the call you've made is not a snug fit
you<00:02:11.690> should<00:02:11.720> there<00:02:12.080> be<00:02:12.110> little<00:02:12.530> metal<00:02:13.220> glue<00:02:13.430> on

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
you should there be little metal glue on

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.150 
you should there be little metal glue on
the<00:02:13.910> ends<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.150> your<00:02:14.209> hoops<00:02:14.600> before<00:02:15.380> inserting

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the ends of your hoops before inserting

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.680

them<00:02:16.370> into<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.640> coils<00:02:19.120> now<00:02:20.120> because<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
them into the coils now because you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.080 
them into the coils now because you
separated<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.440> coil<00:02:21.740> earlier<00:02:22.220> you'll<00:02:22.850> see<00:02:23.060> a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
separated the coil earlier you'll see a

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.150

single coil in the middle through which

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.910 
single coil in the middle through which
you<00:02:25.340> can<00:02:25.520> thread<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.150> jump<00:02:26.510> ring<00:02:26.750> just<00:02:27.680> like

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
you can thread a jump ring just like

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.670
