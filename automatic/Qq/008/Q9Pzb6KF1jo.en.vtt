00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:24.079
 today I'm going to make a good carrot puree 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.720
 instead of putting practice carrot cooking 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.759
 It is with water that I decided to make a 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.599
 A little different, I'll have one. 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.690
 little butter some splinters 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.000
 you can see that it 's not much 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.170
 r with a little oil also to not 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.809
 stick on 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.700
 I put a little pepper 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:49.240
 kingdom is us nutmeg and then I go 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:57.020
 to play or not to play now 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:01:02.350
 carrot and then I'll get it back and 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.509
 I'll take this to the man oven. 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.960
 hot 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.850
 Good folks, I came here that afternoon. 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.030
 language, but in fact I voted 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:20.540
 oven is not covered and then look only if you can see 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:28.340
 the car is already is already entering 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:36.190
 easy neo is already well but would get the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.190
 hamas the pain and I'm going to threaten this carrot 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.549

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.750
 over here okay I will now take the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:59.969
 mixer and I go unprocessed to stay less 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.969

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.650
 an and min 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.940
 good now it has a better texture 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.320
 I processed the carrot and it gets 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.320
 soft but tasty
