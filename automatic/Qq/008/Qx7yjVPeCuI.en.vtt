00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.120
 today have a wonderful rack of lamb 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.609
 Germany found 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.279
 the pretty bones they are not beautiful 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.710
 so big when the bones are bigger there 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.699
 we are almost at the hameln I 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.099
 I will sign you in my long 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.910
 so there are two three can parry 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.969
 possibilities 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.410
 I tell you I'll take the lamb 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.649
 Here I cut a bit of that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:49.289
 front silver skin and then simply with 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:55.230
 down a meat knife so completely 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.969
 Just when you can do it I know 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:04.489
 try the other possibility is if 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.489
 they were so hard to do something like that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.920
 these wastes from the lamb not 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:22.429
 throw away the we will need for 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.429
 The sauce I'll show you next time 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.400
 done with it
