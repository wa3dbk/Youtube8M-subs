 Y 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.270
 or snakes are characterized by the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.480
 absence of limbs and your body 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.269
 lengthened its origin goes back to the era 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.059
 where the dinosaurs existed is a 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.170
 pretty docile word pretty 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:52.160
 harmless and pretty 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.160
 where I did not go to men 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.309
 two 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:16.229
 must paralyze quietly and what the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.299
 characterizes are the colors that form 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.640
 easier to differentiate it after I 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.210
 the word branch that is red yellow 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.429
 black yellow its attractive colors and 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.610
 bright are warning symbol 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.860
 because they are very poisonous this 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.140
 species has teeth located in the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.209
 back of his jaw and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.920
 connected with poison glands that 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:42.179
 perform a pre-digestion of the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.369
 food a coral snake for 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.130
 that you could really kill her 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.090
 I bite my fingers or part of the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.250
 hand because their mouth does not tend to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.500
 open up as much as other snakes 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.210
 and on the other hand the teeth that it has 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.130
 although if you have to go with them that 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.590
 they inject venom are very small and 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.729
 fragile they attack the system 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.729
 nervous his venom is neurotoxic 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.729
 so 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.590
 she death to you what is going to go 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.560
 provoking is a numbness to their 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.989
 prisoners what it does is sleep I'm going to 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.380
 sleep is that they are easier to 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.170
 digest a human what yes the bite 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.650
 it's totally deadly they can die from a 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.470
 cardiorespiratory infarction 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.159
 the coral snake is found from 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.560
 mexico guatemala belize costa rica up 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.510
 Colombia 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.090
 how are they from the coast to the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.150
 high areas have been found in toluca 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.390
 which is on the beach of freedom in 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.720
 cinquera that is for the reservoir and in the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.590
 mountain that is pine forest oak is 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.300
 Pretty cool up 800 meters 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.900
 above sea level one can 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.489
 find on a floor like this one true 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.790
 obviously with some shadow you can 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.800
 found in open areas and cornfields 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.030
 the shore of a river 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.590
 in a single moisture the head is small 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.930
 the eyes are also relatively 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.260
 small of all the snakes 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.850
 they have a very short vision or they are almost 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.590
 blind 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.790
 this is even more because they are based more 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.129
 in its smell to hunt 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.469
 this resident species of the zones 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.170
 sandy and rocky feeds 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:40.400
 lizards rodents and snakes more 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.459
 small ones like the mazacuata lanera cocina 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.430
 keeps false coral paths and the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.730
 King snake known as false coral 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.730
 of the Atlantic 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.420
 depending on how much they eat and eat 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.950
 Approximate 3 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.620
 defeated the week 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.890
 we would be receiving a fashion almost to 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.890
 month 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.740
 are quite elusive tend to 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.410
 hide 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.160
 people say they have two heads 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.200
 but it is simply the tail that makes 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.230
 like I was supporting you 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.770
 but it does not cause anything they are just are 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.400
 flakes is cartilage 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.310
 this snake is oviparous has from 2 to 4 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.810
 eggs and the time of its reproduction is 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.990
 from March when there 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.389
 warmer temperatures this species 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.230
 often confuse it with another known 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.450
 like false coral 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.910
 False corals can measure up to 3 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.170
 meters and can be six times more 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.170
 fat this 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.669
 the corals are not aggressive the false ones 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:05:00.210
 corals if they are aggressive tend to 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.390
 attack and look for how to bite despite 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.120
 that are not poisonous 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.760
 according to the official list of species 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.860
 threatened and in danger of extinction 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.590
 Ministry of the Environment and Resources 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.380
 natural the coral snake will 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.120
 is threatened is one of the 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.350
 snakes we went more finds dead 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.290
 because of human in people kill her 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.180
 indiscriminately and without knowing without 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.540
 perceive the benefits that go to the 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.540
 scam 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.430
 no no no 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.600
 class 7 coral like all the others 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.220
 snakes are important as a villa 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.990
 predatory profession they are 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.090
 pest controllers corals 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.330
 jingle bells that abound in the 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:56.240
 cornfields are there because they control the 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.910
 rat populations of mice that are 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.490
 they eat the corn so that when they double the 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.889
 corn the largest has to be several 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.340
 days 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.979
 weeks then dry in a 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.639
 feast the snakes also make a 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.889
 feast of those rolls for rodents this 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.099
 specimen of the rapids family 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:21.509
 It is also called chili tail and can 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.509
 live up to 20 years
