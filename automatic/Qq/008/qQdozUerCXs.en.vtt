 Well, we did a fine job ourselves. 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.119
 someone got caught again 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.720

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:59.350
 Wide Web and can be great enough to handle 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.350
 yes most importantly without adults 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.090
 but also x 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:32.200

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.680

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.080
 it turned out but it turned out to break 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.350
 the web will turn off the light in the hole 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.130
 and our drum spoil we just wanted 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.160
 yourself cope yes without adults but 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.330
 remove such a branch not every adult 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.930
 the strength yes here we all have 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.150
 to work 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.150
 let's cut the branch into pieces 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.660
 Well 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:25.410
 pupils to their little house of it and without our 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:27.510
 help will sometimes be difficult 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.670
 to figure out when to be in 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.700
 independent and when to call on 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.700
 adult care is important 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.090
 think and do not rush to do everything 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.090
 by myself 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.200
 all in my opinion turned out well
