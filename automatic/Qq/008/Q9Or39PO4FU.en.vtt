this article they've always thought that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.920 
this article they've always thought that
the<00:01:45.899> annual<00:01:46.409> Geminid<00:01:47.399> meteor<00:01:47.909> shower<00:01:50.930> was

the annual Geminid meteor shower was

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200 
the annual Geminid meteor shower was
caused<00:01:52.170> by<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> comet<00:01:52.829> tail<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.790> actually

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
caused by a comet tail well it actually

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.740 
caused by a comet tail well it actually
isn't

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
isn't

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.910 
isn't
it's<00:01:55.020> caused<00:01:55.290> from<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.710> asteroid<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:57.920> they

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it's caused from this asteroid and they

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
it's caused from this asteroid and they
keep<00:01:59.399> saying<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.060> asteroid<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.840> each

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
keep saying that this asteroid with each

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
keep saying that this asteroid with each
pass<00:02:01.350> by<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> Sun<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> goes<00:02:02.610> past<00:02:02.969> the

pass by the Sun which it goes past the

pass by the Sun which it goes past the
Sun<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.719> once<00:02:03.899> every<00:02:04.110> 18<00:02:04.439> months<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.950> was

Sun I think once every 18 months I was

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.789 
Sun I think once every 18 months I was
looking<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.610> JPL<00:02:06.290> their<00:02:07.290> content

looking at it on the JPL their content

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.490 
looking at it on the JPL their content
comparing<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.959> pottery<00:02:09.959> when<00:02:10.379> it's

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
comparing it to like pottery when it's

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.860

heated too fast the mud cracks

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.200 
heated too fast the mud cracks
and<00:02:14.350> it's<00:02:14.590> got<00:02:14.800> like<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.980> dry<00:02:15.280> lakebed<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:16.030> it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
and it's got like a dry lakebed on it

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.410 
and it's got like a dry lakebed on it
and<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.900> tail<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.350> symptom<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:18.090> its<00:02:19.090> small

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
and the tail is a symptom of its small

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.300 
and the tail is a symptom of its small

you<00:02:31.870> wonder<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:32.440> know<00:02:32.920> we're<00:02:33.220> seeing<00:02:33.490> an<00:02:33.580> uptick

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
you wonder I know we're seeing an uptick

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.350 
you wonder I know we're seeing an uptick
in<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:35.320> meteors<00:02:35.890> meteorites<00:02:36.520> here<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.150> earth

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
turn on the JPL we're headed right for

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.970 
turn on the JPL we're headed right for
the<00:02:46.480> tail<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.989> this<00:02:47.110> thing<00:02:47.320> look<00:02:47.470> how<00:02:47.560> fast<00:02:47.830> it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
the tail of this thing look how fast it

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.210 
the tail of this thing look how fast it
goes<00:02:48.120> right<00:02:49.120> there<00:02:51.120> second<00:02:52.120> week<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.330> December

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
goes right there second week of December

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.440 
goes right there second week of December
we're<00:02:54.220> gonna<00:02:54.370> go<00:02:54.519> right<00:02:54.850> through<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.209> tail

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
we're gonna go right through the tail

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.120 
we're gonna go right through the tail
again<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.940> it's<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.239> annual<00:02:58.900> Geminid<00:02:59.650> meteor

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
again and it's the annual Geminid meteor

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.060 
again and it's the annual Geminid meteor
shower<00:03:00.190> well<00:03:00.760> it's<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.090> Pantheon<00:03:02.070> asteroid

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
shower well it's the Pantheon asteroid

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.820 
shower well it's the Pantheon asteroid
with<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> tail<00:03:03.700> shower<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:05.310> mean<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.550> is<00:03:06.760> crazy

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
with a tail shower I mean it is crazy

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.759 
with a tail shower I mean it is crazy
and<00:03:08.830> right<00:03:09.100> now<00:03:09.310> earth<00:03:09.519> is<00:03:09.850> underneath<00:03:10.769> its

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
and right now earth is underneath its

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.640 
and right now earth is underneath its
orbit<00:03:12.220> if<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.580> back<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.940> up<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:14.410> where<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.560> just

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
orbit if I back it up to where I just

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.280 
orbit if I back it up to where I just
was<00:03:16.950> right<00:03:17.950> around<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.370> here<00:03:19.019> earth<00:03:20.019> is

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
was right around in here earth is

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.620 
was right around in here earth is
underneath<00:03:20.709> it's<00:03:21.459> orbiting<00:03:21.880> path<00:03:22.090> that's<00:03:22.480> dis

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
underneath it's orbiting path that's dis

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.509 
underneath it's orbiting path that's dis
orbit<00:03:22.900> path<00:03:23.079> right<00:03:23.320> there<00:03:23.380> asteroid<00:03:24.190> with<00:03:24.400> the

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
orbit path right there asteroid with the

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.590 
orbit path right there asteroid with the
tail<00:03:24.989> pay<00:03:25.989> thought<00:03:26.260> how<00:03:26.890> cool<00:03:27.549> is<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.269> inner

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
tail pay thought how cool is that inner

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.750 
tail pay thought how cool is that inner
solar<00:03:29.019> system<00:03:29.049> by<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.560> way<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.370> don't<00:03:30.579> know

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
solar system by the way so I don't know

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.340 
solar system by the way so I don't know
if<00:03:30.850> this<00:03:30.970> thing<00:03:31.180> with<00:03:31.390> all<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.720> passes<00:03:32.079> around

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
if this thing with all the passes around

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.990 
if this thing with all the passes around
the<00:03:32.440> Sun<00:03:32.680> if<00:03:32.829> it's<00:03:32.950> getting<00:03:33.220> more<00:03:33.370> brittle

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
the Sun if it's getting more brittle

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.420 
the Sun if it's getting more brittle
I<00:03:34.030> mean<00:03:34.930> it's<00:03:35.079> shucking<00:03:35.470> more<00:03:35.650> rocks<00:03:35.980> and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
I mean it's shucking more rocks and

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.810 
I mean it's shucking more rocks and
debris<00:03:36.519> dust<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.720> don't<00:03:37.750> know<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.440> don't<00:03:39.400> know

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
debris dust I don't know I don't know

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.550 
debris dust I don't know I don't know
guys<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:41.320> is<00:03:41.530> crazy<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:43.390> some<00:03:43.959> fireball
