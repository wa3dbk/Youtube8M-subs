some<00:03:23.720> concerns<00:03:24.140> for<00:03:24.410> me<00:03:24.590> all<00:03:24.829> of<00:03:25.190> which<00:03:25.340> went

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
some concerns for me all of which went

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.240 
some concerns for me all of which went
away<00:03:25.670> after<00:03:26.269> using<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.870> magista<00:03:27.110> opus<00:03:27.709> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.920 
away after using the magista opus the
ability<00:03:28.579> was<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.730> slight<00:03:29.030> concern<00:03:29.239> at<00:03:29.600> first

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
ability was a slight concern at first

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.630 
ability was a slight concern at first
but<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.320> kangalite<00:03:30.739> top<00:03:31.010> layer<00:03:31.280> for<00:03:31.519> the

upper<00:03:31.910> is<00:03:32.090> strong<00:03:32.390> enough<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.750> keep<00:03:32.900> your<00:03:33.079> foot

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.350 
and quick changes of direction
durability<00:03:39.799> was<00:03:39.950> also<00:03:40.340> concerned<00:03:40.790> as<00:03:41.030> the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
durability was also concerned as the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.840 
durability was also concerned as the
mesh<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.780> directly<00:03:42.320> exposed<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:43.070> between<00:03:43.670> the

mesh is directly exposed in between the
kangalite<00:03:44.329> cutouts<00:03:44.840> but<00:03:45.380> after<00:03:45.650> 30<00:03:45.920> plus

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
kangalite cutouts but after 30 plus

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.550 
kangalite cutouts but after 30 plus
hours<00:03:46.579> of<00:03:46.610> wear<00:03:46.910> time<00:03:47.180> I've<00:03:47.420> had<00:03:47.810> no<00:03:48.079> issues

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
hours of wear time I've had no issues

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.250 
hours of wear time I've had no issues
with<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.829> durability<00:03:49.360> whatsoever<00:03:50.360> exposed

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
with the durability whatsoever exposed

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.990 
with the durability whatsoever exposed
mesh<00:03:51.530> also<00:03:51.829> begs<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.340> question<00:03:52.730> as<00:03:52.910> to

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
mesh also begs the question as to

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.069 
mesh also begs the question as to
whether<00:03:53.299> or<00:03:53.390> not<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.690> shoe<00:03:53.900> is

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
whether or not the shoe is

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.080 
whether or not the shoe is
water-resistant<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.549> simple<00:03:55.850> answer<00:03:56.060> to

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
water-resistant and the simple answer to

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.290 
water-resistant and the simple answer to
that<00:03:56.150> question<00:03:56.660> is<00:03:56.780> yes

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
that question is yes

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.390 
that question is yes
it<00:03:57.510> seems<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.840> be<00:03:57.960> just<00:03:58.290> as<00:03:58.470> water-resistant

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
it seems to be just as water-resistant

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.700 
it seems to be just as water-resistant
as<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.850> average<00:04:00.000> synthetic<00:04:00.750> be<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.560> only

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
as the average synthetic be the only

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.290 
as the average synthetic be the only
downside<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.460> that<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.700> lightly<00:04:03.090> colored

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
downside is that the lightly colored

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.780 
downside is that the lightly colored
portions<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.200> mesh<00:04:04.380> will<00:04:04.950> get<00:04:05.190> dirty<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
portions of the mesh will get dirty and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.760 
portions of the mesh will get dirty and
eventually<00:04:06.300> stained<00:04:06.660> permanently<00:04:07.350> which

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
eventually stained permanently which

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.050 
eventually stained permanently which
doesn't<00:04:08.130> affect<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.490> overall<00:04:08.850> performance

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
doesn't affect the overall performance

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.330 
doesn't affect the overall performance
or<00:04:09.570> feel<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:09.990> the<00:04:10.110> shoe<00:04:10.320> but<00:04:10.800> does<00:04:10.980> make<00:04:11.160> it

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
or feel of the shoe but does make it

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.550 
or feel of the shoe but does make it
look<00:04:11.550> not<00:04:12.090> quite<00:04:12.450> as<00:04:12.660> nice<00:04:12.930> from<00:04:13.230> right<00:04:13.380> out<00:04:13.500> of

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
look not quite as nice from right out of

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.410 
look not quite as nice from right out of
the<00:04:13.650> box<00:04:13.830> but<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.550> more<00:04:14.760> or<00:04:14.850> less<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.270> be

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
the box but that is more or less to be

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.990 
the box but that is more or less to be
expected<00:04:15.930> with<00:04:16.110> any<00:04:16.320> shoe<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:17.310> just<00:04:17.580> seems<00:04:17.850> to

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
expected with any shoe it just seems to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.340 
expected with any shoe it just seems to
be<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.299> little<00:04:18.600> bit<00:04:18.720> more<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.110> problem

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
be a little bit more of a problem

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.470 
be a little bit more of a problem
because<00:04:19.830> of<00:04:19.860> that<00:04:20.250> exposed<00:04:20.700> mesh<00:04:20.970> but<00:04:21.390> of

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
because of that exposed mesh but of

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.270 
because of that exposed mesh but of
course<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:21.959> will<00:04:22.170> vary<00:04:22.440> depending<00:04:22.560> on<00:04:23.130> the

course this will vary depending on the
