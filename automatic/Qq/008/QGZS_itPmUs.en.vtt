even though we've turned his birth into
a<00:03:04.100> time<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.700> selfishness<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.600> greed<00:03:05.690> he<00:03:06.530> still

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
a time of selfishness and greed he still

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.430 
a time of selfishness and greed he still
died<00:03:07.250> for<00:03:07.580> us<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.940> He<00:03:08.240> loves<00:03:08.270> us<00:03:08.870> even<00:03:09.110> though
