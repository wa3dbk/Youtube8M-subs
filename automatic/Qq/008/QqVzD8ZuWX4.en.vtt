00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.140
 from n tv my name is as always the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.940
 largest miller and insightful tunes the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.740
 sometimes they plant out of the basin 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.320
 you can see it grow well too 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.519
 skating and looking really beautiful 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.269
 because of the appearance or the under 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.279
 to grow water 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.470
 we'll show you that again 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.680
 difference and how you do that much 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.680
 fun 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.070
 Often you can see the beautiful something capes 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.840
 Moses or others plant the wood 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.140
 or other objects about the water 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.480
 out grow this looks beautiful and 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.409
 Of course you can also do it in nature 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.570
 to watch that 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.820
 Today we show you the difference 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.780
 between the first and subversion 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.940
 water plants 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.220
 First, we have to understand that it is 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.610
 one for most aquatic plants 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.909
 immense and so wersen state applies 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.770
 e-mails means over water and sea 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.479
 interrupted 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.070
 I can transplant a plant at the same time 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.430
 and under water in the same condition 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.590
 However, a subzzle can grow 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.630
 stems of a plant in an e mason 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.579
 convert and vice versa if you want to 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.860
 example here at this site plant 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.020
 looks at the e mails to state a 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.820
 Plant the leaves are much firmer and 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.400
 even have one in some species 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.560
 other color and shape often explains this 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.479
 Also the reason why you load in the zoo 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.640
 plants sometimes buy these 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.619
 leaves loose and new other leaves 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.840
 does not scare this lies 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.640
 that aquatic plants are mostly over 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.829
 water and then in the zoo 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.049
 Only load as proper aquatic plants 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.670
 sometimes sold under water 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.780
 it can look nice when planting 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.359
 to grow over water 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.999
 this usually makes the plant complete 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.829
 automatically without human intervention 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.959
 the only condition is the location 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.090
 plant and a strong lighting 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.740
 The plant should be just below the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.310
 water surface can be planted like 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.889
 you see here 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.719
 in mohsen, that just has to be close 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:07.909
 under the water surface at one 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.610
 outstanding root be tied 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.980
 Often it then grows automatically out of the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.870
 water out that nevertheless all water 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.690
 plants need the over water 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.550
 grow mobile water many rods 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.310
 Plant worry yourself with water 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.270
 but when osk dehydration often a 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.800
 be a problem 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.230
 Here can be done by spraying water 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.000
 To be helped often also succeeds 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.020
 needs to drink enough with water 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.420
 as you can see here 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.280
 there are only plants that bloom 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.319
 outside the water and some 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.269
 plants there is no substitute 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.269
 as for example, stood bacteria 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.720
 I liked the video there are 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.640
 a thumbs up without two 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.280
 do you have that partly on instagram later 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.230
 in any shapes and so on 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.910
 down here in the corner cash register 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.210
 subscribe so no videos missed 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.440
 more 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.770
 Here's another video 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.020
 We'll show you the snail 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.520
 here she has a stock investment 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.340
 as I make a change of water there 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.320
 it will all be here again 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.510
 Social media sometime as a facebook 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.130
 instagram optional is the name is 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.160
 even net tv we also have twitter 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.840
 grab the tv can now be happy
