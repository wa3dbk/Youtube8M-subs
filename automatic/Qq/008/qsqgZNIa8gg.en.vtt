00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
dough ball and it's already formed and I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.350 
dough ball and it's already formed and I
just<00:02:15.600> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> flatten<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:18.060> that

it<00:02:21.390> doesn't<00:02:21.660> really<00:02:21.750> matter<00:02:21.990> I'm<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.350> using

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
it doesn't really matter I'm just using

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.670 
it doesn't really matter I'm just using
the<00:02:22.680> back<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.830> my<00:02:24.140> mallet<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.230> guess<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.560> could

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the back of my mallet I guess you could

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.949 
the back of my mallet I guess you could
call<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.220> press<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.940> down<00:02:26.970> firmly<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
call it and press it down firmly in the

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.780 
call it and press it down firmly in the
center<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.350> these<00:02:28.620> next<00:02:29.280> few<00:02:29.459> steps<00:02:29.610> are

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
center of these next few steps are

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.310 
center of these next few steps are
completely<00:02:30.240> optional<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.170> want

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320

just to make a little pretty petal shape

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.100 
just to make a little pretty petal shape
but<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.490> said<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.880> part<00:02:48.240> is<00:02:48.360> completely

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
but like I said this part is completely

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.350 
but like I said this part is completely
optional<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.890> then<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.430> want<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> take<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
like that and I thought it would be

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.360
