 at the base to start with the first 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.030

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.200
 cut the cooking taken out of the water 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.260
 frost of born

 other birds affirming the advance claim 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:16.000
 it is important to affirm that with the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:19.900
 mass you can do everything next to the 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.920

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.159
 in a few minutes when you finish 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.680
