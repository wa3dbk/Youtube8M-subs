00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.919
 after failing but my problem has not lost 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.230
 weight nothing 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.290
 localized fat that does not go away 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.990
 Then I have a personal friend that I 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.789
 I really like that the pharmacist I live 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.490
 disturbing i also speak in miami 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.439
 account of any technological advance 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.140
 in this area there for example now by 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.119
 double cream lotion that really is 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.560
 working for localized fat 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.269
 Let's see what she's going to answer here. 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.160
 not only for me but for you also have 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.290
 tamayo is responsible for the pharmacy of 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.420
 new shape handling creates a lot of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.120
 cool things a kiss here looking with 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.640
 Thank you for the invitation I want. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.760
 know everything you brought there today 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.090
 includes I brought a template to work 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.030
 With us and Doctor AcÃ¡cio, she's going 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.489
 example to your viewer as 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.640
 really will use this packaging is a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.980
 packaging that works from 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.670
 head down to achieve more peace 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.990
 The most difficult, if ever, was Sergio. 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.180
 a conventional apposition it would be 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.780
 more difficult then we seek a 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.020
 packaging really to hit the spot 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.310
 in the affected area is what is new 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.060
 here is the mode of action of the asset 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.530
 this active that enters this formulation 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.520
 we have developed a really 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 to treat localized sanity 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.430
 this particular asset does not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.229
 It's natural, something is not right for us. 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.509
 selling product even because it is from 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.610
 pharmacy and this program forms the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.729
 by a doctor then it's only for you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.560
 understand what's new in the industry 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.200
 pharmaceutical industry for this 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.110
 exactly a formulation that we put 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.689
 this asset is new 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.840
 What will it do to break the cell? 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.320
 grease will empty the contents of the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.170
 cell will wilt and will prevent 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.140
 mechanism by reactions will prevent 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.430
 this fat cell multiplies is 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.319
 everything we want 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.720
 new greetings from the outside in 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.360
 so from the outside in the box goes 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.060
 simplify wiring with the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.629
 movements will be a high drainage 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.310
 at home but after passing the home examination 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.659
 stay wherever you think she goes 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.690
 stand on the stool here 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.530
 So you can stay and it's good to 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.879
 you 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.220
 so the product comes with this material 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:42.849
 that we call bandage and with that 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.209
 luggage the class will make moves 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.760
 in the affected regions to help 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.510
 mobilize to break this cell of 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.430
 fat and the movement will be done 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.680
 while the class I feel that still 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.859
 has product time that she realizes that 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.760
 ensures that the product has been absorbed 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.510
 OK 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.150
 we have a technology for 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.510
 transform particulate matter 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.819
 much smaller than either the vehicle or 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.430
 assets to ensure the perfect 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:19.239
 absorption is nanotechnology 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.799
 then the new assets that people 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.389
 put in the formula still base is and is the 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.750
 technique that people dominate as 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.700
 nanotechnology how it works and there 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.190
 this product will be handled in the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.609
 right dosage had by then already see 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.120
 killed shopkeeper who prescribes is a product 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.849
 natural can be used by children 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.430
 essay and password, it is natural for him to 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.609
 will inhibit all this mechanism 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.799
 all the reactions that exist as accumulate 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.440
 fat crab Namibe but for example 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.199
 for who already has a cellulite he 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.910
 cellulite is already an inflammation of the 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.280
 fat deposit telling room 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.180
 localized fats that should not 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.680
 be there 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.680
 It was not hot, I was sitting. 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.169
 okay is that down there the goal is active 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.510
 thermogenics are usually in the 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.280
 that there is really an agreement that would 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.590
 hot win can try here in the 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.289
 my arm even think it 's a cosmos is 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.370
 Of course here is upside down It reminds one of 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.699
 packing 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.240
 know that here you go without going any further 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.669
 huh 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.310
 now that I do then as I 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.790
 you are pressing but generating heat 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.750
 and this heat helps in absorption yet 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.750
 more on this subject 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.280
 there you will make this closer until 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.430
 You realize that you're after 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.540
 Purse understands now let's think 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.970
 Claudio does not want anyone in a few 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.000
 change a body that is 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.900
 result of a lifetime there 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.539
 habits 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.910
 so it is not only using the product 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.949
 doing this self drainage that the rate 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.740
 is exemplifying that you will 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.110
 achieve the expected result 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.650
 but the final word in technology but 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.400
 the final word however associated with good 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.889
 eating habits and an activity 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.810
 physical because you think where does this 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.180
 fat that is coming out of the 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.639
 fat you are emptying a cell 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.260
 is preventing it from multiplying 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.660
 and that fat that we are 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.870
 tearing of her sales where it goes 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.510
 it can not be accumulated again or 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.419
 or collect in vital organs not 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:45.110
 So what do we do an activity? 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:47.479
 to burn this fat. 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.479
 fat that we mobilized from the localities 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:53.780
 where she is accumulated she will have to 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:57.650
 be broken and have to provide energy 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.990
 and it will be in a gym even though 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.389
 feeling hot, right? 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.960
 this formulation is not just with a little 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.500
 yea 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.479
 we put thermogenic is why 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.599
 have to be under the guidance of a doctor 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.430
 to know the concentration and if you can 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.900
 there are some side effects 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.750
 huh 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.539
 but what I brought with it is new 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.090
 the mechanism of action that most 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.639
 ethical libraries are the assets that 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.940
 break the fat 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:31.760
 usually only empty the cell is this 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.250
 besides emptying is a double mechanism is 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.530
 a double reaction as well as emptying it 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.969
 prevents the simus fat cell 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.099
 click here 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:41.719
 Ana I liked it and I was so happy that I 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.669
 I see the researchers bringing news 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.199
 novelty I think there will come a day 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:48.499
 What are you going to push the button will go? 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:52.039
 To stay now is like a friend of mine. 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:53.989
 idea will not fiddle until it goes 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.869
 make this comment she said that a 

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:59.749
 Brigadier stays two minutes in the mouth. 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:02.269
 20 - in the stomach and two years in the waist 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:04.309
 Ah wait, besides a kiss for you. 

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:07.039
 now you can eat brigadeiro that 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:09.889
 How is it and does the makeup on the mouth? 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:12.829
 20 minutes takes two years in ESA culote 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:15.289
 on the waist now he's a little yes for 

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:17.989
 end this taboo but then look at this 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:19.489
 book you have to research with your doctor 

00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:21.439
 because it has to be formulated by a 

00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:22.759
 doctor and how I told you, we're not 

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:24.259
 selling one more product using a 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:27.409
 technology a new industry 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:30.679
 and she is a pharmacist. 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:33.949
 responsible for the new form and the site is the 

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:35.599
 www conti new way with ph dot com 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:37.519
 Do you want a doctor who is more information? 

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:42.979
 the product may contact you and the 

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:46.489
 phone 0 for the hard 11 5052 3933 right 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:48.709
 Good luck people, I like to learn one. 

00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:50.779
 little and laughs among good 

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:52.909
 learn to know what's new there 

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:55.519
 sometimes someone says that I have not seen 

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:56.959
 Evenings speak in novelty even I see 

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:59.869
 always on the best day 

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:02.769
 all you have again is the top snake 

00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:02.769
 dead people
