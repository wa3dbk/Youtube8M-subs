00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.360 

I<00:01:07.810> don't<00:01:08.810> think<00:01:08.900> tennis<00:01:09.590> takes<00:01:09.890> adult

recreational<00:01:10.550> players<00:01:11.360> seriously<00:01:12.080> enough

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
recreational players seriously enough

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.940 
recreational players seriously enough
even<00:01:12.890> though<00:01:13.160> they<00:01:14.000> are<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:15.050> demographic

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
even though they are the demographic

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.040 
even though they are the demographic
that<00:01:15.979> is<00:01:16.340> growing<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.030> game<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.810> most<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:20.050> had

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
that is growing the game the most I had

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.150 
that is growing the game the most I had
a<00:01:21.080> pro<00:01:21.940> tell<00:01:22.940> me<00:01:23.150> one<00:01:23.300> time<00:01:23.540> he<00:01:24.500> said<00:01:24.710> Amy<00:01:24.950> you

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
because to me I model what the pros do

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.880 
because to me I model what the pros do
not<00:01:40.280> with<00:01:40.520> any<00:01:40.700> idea<00:01:41.119> that<00:01:41.180> I'm<00:01:41.600> ever<00:01:42.020> going<00:01:42.770> to

not with any idea that I'm ever going to

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.370 
not with any idea that I'm ever going to
touch<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.820> hem<00:01:44.000> of<00:01:44.030> their<00:01:44.330> tennis<00:01:45.110> skirt

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
right but they pattern for me a level of

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.850 
right but they pattern for me a level of
commitment<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.720> game<00:01:50.899> that<00:01:51.350> I<00:01:51.380> want<00:01:51.680> to
