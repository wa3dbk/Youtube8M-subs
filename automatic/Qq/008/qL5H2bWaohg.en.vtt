00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
about the lobster roll I will do that it

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.760 
about the lobster roll I will do that it
is<00:02:00.940> excellent<00:02:01.420> it<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:01.810> packed<00:02:02.140> with<00:02:02.259> lobster

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
is excellent it is packed with lobster

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.550 
is excellent it is packed with lobster
it's<00:02:03.460> done<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:04.450> little<00:02:04.690> toasty<00:02:05.259> bread

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
it's done in this little toasty bread

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.410 
it's done in this little toasty bread
thing<00:02:05.920> that's<00:02:06.160> it<00:02:06.399> looks<00:02:06.640> like<00:02:06.820> two<00:02:07.060> halves<00:02:07.300> of

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
thing that's it looks like two halves of

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.910 
thing that's it looks like two halves of
bread<00:02:07.600> but<00:02:07.720> we're<00:02:07.840> really<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.200> think<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.770> as

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
bread but we're really I think it is as

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.560 
bread but we're really I think it is as
a<00:02:08.950> bun<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.789> sides<00:02:10.060> have<00:02:10.239> been<00:02:10.330> cut<00:02:10.479> off

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
a bun that the sides have been cut off

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.090 
a bun that the sides have been cut off
so<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.899> looks<00:02:11.110> like<00:02:11.170> toast<00:02:11.620> but<00:02:11.950> it's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
so it looks like toast but it's

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.740 
so it looks like toast but it's
connected<00:02:12.430> at<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.790> bottom<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.270> your<00:02:13.420> lobster

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
connected at the bottom so your lobster

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.150 
connected at the bottom so your lobster
doesn't<00:02:14.020> go<00:02:14.080> flying<00:02:14.350> all<00:02:14.500> over<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.739> place

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
doesn't go flying all over the place

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.270 
doesn't go flying all over the place
which<00:02:16.000> i<00:02:16.120> think<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.360> nice<00:02:16.510> although<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.350> am<00:02:18.010> kind

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
which i think is nice although I am kind

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.199
