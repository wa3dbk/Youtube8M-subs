00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
not a couple of issues with the Hello
cupcake<00:01:47.280> app<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.180> has<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.899> with

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
cupcake app and this has to do with

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.889 
cupcake app and this has to do with
users<00:01:49.530> outside<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> US<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.090> only<00:01:51.450> lists

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
users outside the US it only lists

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.109 
users outside the US it only lists
American<00:01:52.439> sources<00:01:52.740> finding<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> Canadian

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
American sources finding the Canadian

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.030 
American sources finding the Canadian
equivalent<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> American<00:01:55.320> candies<00:01:55.680> can

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
equivalent and the American candies can

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.980 
equivalent and the American candies can
be<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> challenge<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.000> terms<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> name<00:01:57.780> of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
be a challenge in terms of the name of

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.289 
be a challenge in terms of the name of
the<00:01:58.049> candy<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.590> also<00:01:59.399> where<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.670> find<00:02:00.090> them

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the candy and also where to find them

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.359 
the candy and also where to find them
but<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.170> same<00:02:01.560> issue<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
but this is the same issue with the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.609 
but this is the same issue with the
ebooks<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.820> well<00:02:03.060> if<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.750> can't<00:02:04.079> find<00:02:04.439> an

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
ebooks as well if you can't find an

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
ebooks as well if you can't find an
alternative<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.430> could<00:02:05.790> order<00:02:06.270> from<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.570> US

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
alternative you could order from the US

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.979 
alternative you could order from the US
but<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.680> really<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> cheap<00:02:08.819> option<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
but that's really not a cheap option the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.170 
but that's really not a cheap option the
other<00:02:10.170> thing<00:02:10.470> Laura<00:02:10.679> found<00:02:11.039> was<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.370> swiping

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
other thing Laura found was that swiping

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.930 
other thing Laura found was that swiping
was<00:02:12.330> back<00:02:12.569> for

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
was back for

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.150 
was back for
she<00:02:13.360> would<00:02:13.510> swipe<00:02:13.960> left<00:02:14.230> wanting<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.980> go<00:02:15.100> to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
she would swipe left wanting to go to

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.550 
she would swipe left wanting to go to
the<00:02:15.220> next<00:02:15.580> page<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.660> go<00:02:16.960> backwards<00:02:17.410> instead

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the next page but go backwards instead

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.280 
the next page but go backwards instead
this<00:02:18.430> takes<00:02:18.850> some<00:02:19.060> getting<00:02:19.390> used<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:19.810> it's

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
this takes some getting used to but it's

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.630 
this takes some getting used to but it's
fine<00:02:20.590> once<00:02:20.830> you've<00:02:20.950> figured<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.310> out

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
fine once you've figured it out

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.880 
fine once you've figured it out
I<00:02:21.670> had<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.120> hard<00:02:22.480> time<00:02:22.570> believing<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.470> because

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
I had a hard time believing this because

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.210 
I had a hard time believing this because
it's<00:02:24.100> non<00:02:24.870> touchscreen<00:02:25.870> gesture<00:02:26.410> like<00:02:26.590> but

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
it's non touchscreen gesture like but

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.410 
it's non touchscreen gesture like but
it's<00:02:27.520> true<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:28.750> backwards<00:02:29.530> now<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:31.000> be<00:02:31.120> fair

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
it's true it is backwards now to be fair

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.300 
it's true it is backwards now to be fair
if<00:02:31.690> you're<00:02:32.020> following<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.680> steps<00:02:32.950> along<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
if you're following the steps along the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.670 
if you're following the steps along the
top<00:02:33.640> you'll<00:02:33.880> see<00:02:33.940> there<00:02:34.270> as<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.450> dot<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.080> to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
top you'll see there as a dot and to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.950 
top you'll see there as a dot and to
move<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.100> next<00:02:36.250> step<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.000> drag<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.720> dot

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
move to the next step you drag the dot

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.990 
move to the next step you drag the dot
to<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.320> next<00:02:38.740> step<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.640> why<00:02:39.940> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
to the next step and this is why the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.750 
to the next step and this is why the
swiping<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.750> backwards<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.890> if<00:02:42.160> you're<00:02:42.490> just

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
swiping is backwards but if you're just

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.360 
swiping is backwards but if you're just
going<00:02:43.060> by<00:02:43.270> text<00:02:43.780> instructions<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.680> can<00:02:45.130> be

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
going by text instructions this can be

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.970 
going by text instructions this can be
confusing<00:02:45.820> at<00:02:46.180> first<00:02:46.320> again<00:02:47.320> making<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
confusing at first again making the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.400 
confusing at first again making the
cupcakes<00:02:48.460> isn't<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.330> difficult<00:02:49.780> but<00:02:50.290> they

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
cupcakes isn't that difficult but they

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.980 
cupcakes isn't that difficult but they
do<00:02:50.470> take<00:02:51.040> time<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.460> put<00:02:51.640> together<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:52.570> with

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
do take time to put together but with

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.260
