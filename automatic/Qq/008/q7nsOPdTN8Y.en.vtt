actually<00:06:09.580> it's<00:06:09.940> very<00:06:10.120> simple<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:11.470> airplane

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
actually it's very simple the airplane

systems enhancements that only should
the<00:06:39.090> new<00:06:39.240> airplanes<00:06:39.720> get<00:06:40.020> done<00:06:40.260> but<00:06:40.980> we

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
the new airplanes get done but we

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.520 
the new airplanes get done but we
recognize<00:06:41.400> that<00:06:41.610> our<00:06:42.150> very<00:06:42.660> loyal<00:06:42.900> customers

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
should not be left out of that so it's

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.030 
should not be left out of that so it's
really<00:06:48.390> no<00:06:48.690> more<00:06:48.930> than<00:06:49.140> just<00:06:49.380> doing<00:06:49.560> the<00:06:49.830> right
