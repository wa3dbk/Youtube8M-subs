there's<00:00:08.050> a<00:00:08.170> pole<00:00:08.380> saw

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
there's a pole saw

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.879 
there's a pole saw
we<00:00:09.759> suck<00:00:09.940> at<00:00:10.120> this<00:00:10.179> so<00:00:10.599> this<00:00:11.170> someone<00:00:11.620> does

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
we suck at this so this someone does

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.820 
we suck at this so this someone does
here<00:00:12.280> so<00:00:12.400> you<00:00:12.490> can<00:00:12.610> take<00:00:12.789> out<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:14.080> this<00:00:14.590> is<00:00:14.650> a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
here so you can take out and this is a

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.160 
here so you can take out and this is a
collie<00:00:15.490> here<00:00:15.789> with<00:00:15.940> Shem<00:00:16.240> don't<00:00:16.930> put<00:00:17.080> your

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
collie here with Shem don't put your

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.999 
collie here with Shem don't put your
finger<00:00:17.439> in<00:00:17.470> there<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.630> this<00:00:20.439> is<00:00:20.619> quite<00:00:20.770> useful

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
finger in there so this is quite useful

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.790 
finger in there so this is quite useful
piece<00:00:21.340> of<00:00:21.460> equipment<00:00:21.939> and<00:00:22.869> so<00:00:23.200> that<00:00:23.380> doubles

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
piece of equipment and so that doubles

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.659 
piece of equipment and so that doubles
up<00:00:23.890> as<00:00:24.099> a<00:00:24.130> lopper<00:00:24.579> as<00:00:24.730> well<00:00:24.970> as<00:00:25.119> a<00:00:25.150> good<00:00:25.899> sort

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
up as a lopper as well as a good sort

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.420 
up as a lopper as well as a good sort
that's<00:00:27.669> right<00:00:27.939> so<00:00:28.329> I'm<00:00:28.599> a<00:00:28.930> missus<00:00:29.800> from<00:00:30.210> pronin

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that's right so I'm a missus from pronin

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:52.290 
that's right so I'm a missus from pronin
far<00:00:35.040> quite<00:00:36.180> reasonably<00:00:37.410> thick<00:00:51.300> not

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
far quite reasonably thick not

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.030 
far quite reasonably thick not
particularly<00:00:52.630> neat<00:00:53.079> cuts<00:00:53.410> I'll<00:00:53.680> make<00:00:53.860> it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
particularly neat cuts I'll make it

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.460 
particularly neat cuts I'll make it
adjustable<00:00:54.780> dismantling<00:00:55.780> this<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:56.260> some

adjustable dismantling this to some

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.610 
adjustable dismantling this to some
extent<00:00:56.610> before<00:00:57.610> I<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.890> further<00:01:00.160> up<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:02.320> beats

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
extent before I go further up this beats

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.910 
extent before I go further up this beats
the<00:01:03.010> living<00:01:03.370> daylights<00:01:03.730> out<00:01:04.269> of<00:01:04.439> getting<00:01:05.439> up<00:01:05.680> a

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
the living daylights out of getting up a

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.050 
the living daylights out of getting up a
ladder<00:01:07.110> especially<00:01:08.219> if<00:01:09.219> you<00:01:09.520> are<00:01:09.700> sort<00:01:10.000> of

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
ladder especially if you are sort of

ladder especially if you are sort of
agent<00:01:10.740> size

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.300 

what<00:01:16.540> I'm<00:01:16.659> doing<00:01:17.020> with<00:01:17.229> this<00:01:17.439> tree<00:01:17.890> is<00:01:18.100> just

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
what I'm doing with this tree is just

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:41.899 
what I'm doing with this tree is just
tightening<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.490> up<00:01:21.640> really

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.630 

right<00:01:42.909> now<00:01:43.119> I<00:01:43.149> wanted<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.630> take<00:01:44.369> two<00:01:45.369> bigger

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
right now I wanted to take two bigger

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.460 
right now I wanted to take two bigger
pieces<00:01:46.030> off<00:01:46.450> here<00:01:46.780> so<00:01:47.619> I'll<00:01:47.890> use<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.340> saw

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
pieces off here so I'll use the saw

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:03.990 
pieces off here so I'll use the saw
competitive<00:01:59.159> all<00:02:00.159> right<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:00.759> we'll<00:02:02.880> see<00:02:03.880> if<00:02:03.939> we

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
competitive all right so we'll see if we

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.130 
competitive all right so we'll see if we
can<00:02:04.179> pay<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:04.509> bit<00:02:04.780> out<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:10.000> I'm<00:02:10.360> just<00:02:10.420> cutting

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
can pay this bit out so I'm just cutting

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.610 
can pay this bit out so I'm just cutting
up<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.530> lead<00:02:11.769> here<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:14.260> window<00:02:15.000> for<00:02:16.620> way

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
up the lead here to the window for way

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:29.000 
up the lead here to the window for way
too<00:02:17.680> much<00:02:24.989> okay

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.150 

and<00:02:31.230> willing<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.349> do<00:02:32.530> now<00:02:32.709> I'm<00:02:32.860> going<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.069> go

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
and willing to do now I'm going to go

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.750 
and willing to do now I'm going to go
off<00:02:33.310> into<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:35.099> center<00:02:36.099> of<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.310> trailer<00:02:36.610> go

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
off into the center of the trailer go

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.100 
off into the center of the trailer go
climb<00:02:37.000> out<00:02:37.180> going<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.420> use<00:02:37.599> this<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.930> haven't

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110

climb out going to use this you haven't
percent<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.620> tree

percent of the tree

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.309 
percent of the tree
I<00:02:39.099> just<00:02:40.000> snip<00:02:40.360> out<00:02:40.569> some<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.050> branches

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
I just snip out some of the branches

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.360 
I just snip out some of the branches
whether<00:02:42.130> too<00:02:42.430> thick<00:02:43.739> well<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:45.099> lot<00:02:45.459> of<00:02:45.489> these

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
whether too thick well a lot of these

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.280 
whether too thick well a lot of these
right<00:02:48.370> growths<00:02:48.700> or<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.180> think<00:02:50.910> silly<00:02:51.910> some<00:02:52.330> way

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
right growths or to think silly some way

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.380 
right growths or to think silly some way
now<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.769> why<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.010> tend<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.370> do<00:02:57.269> does<00:02:58.269> that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
now this is why I tend to do does that

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.770 
now this is why I tend to do does that
make<00:02:58.630> sense<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.700> with<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:00.910> piece<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.269> kit

make sense and with this piece of kit

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.720 
make sense and with this piece of kit
and<00:03:02.470> go<00:03:02.620> further<00:03:02.890> up<00:03:08.069> if<00:03:09.069> you<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.430> bit<00:03:09.700> more

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
and go further up if you a bit more

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.750 
and go further up if you a bit more
sprightly<00:03:10.600> than<00:03:10.780> me<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:12.370> up<00:03:12.519> there<00:03:14.730> with<00:03:15.730> a

sprightly than me get up there with a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.550 
sprightly than me get up there with a

ladder doing anyway just thinning out
same<00:03:23.560> principles<00:03:24.340> as<00:03:25.269> if<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:25.660> were<00:03:25.720> working<00:03:25.900> on

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
same principles as if we were working on

overcrowded wood tree imbalance and if
you<00:03:40.690> doubt<00:03:41.220> better<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.459> do<00:03:42.640> slightly<00:03:43.269> too

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
you doubt better to do slightly too

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:58.039 
you doubt better to do slightly too

wood I'm just going to take that pick

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.670 
wood I'm just going to take that pick
out<00:04:39.200> there<00:04:39.620> for<00:04:39.980> example<00:04:40.600> right<00:04:41.600> over<00:04:41.680> reason
