00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.180
 hello andrew work open and 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.350
 today tell you how to 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.660
 start jumping rope 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.730
 I'll show you two basic techniques if 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.240
 your goal is to lose weight or improve your 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.090
 fitness 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.380
 then these techniques are enough 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.260
 before we start jump show you 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.940
 the main mistakes that people make 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.840
 the first is the position of your hand 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.880
 when you jump 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.490
 most people make these huge 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.570
 circular movements of the arms are wrong 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.739
 when jump your basis of your groups 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.079
 must be very close to your body and 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.090
 rotate you only need a brush they don't 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.270
 arms in general that is it looks like this 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:53.719
 the second way common error 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.110
 this is what many people jump very much 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:00.010
 high this too wrong i need 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.780
 jump like that high 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.719
 condition of the local surface of the earth and 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.969
 your shoes need your feet 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.789
 be no more than five centimeters then 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:13.340
 there is a pump you can jump workbench 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:16.329
 so the rope can get through it 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.969
 the space between the legs and the surface 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.380
 another very common mistake is something 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.439
 that people when you jump it does not look 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.870
 down this you do not need you 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.760
 watch 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.380
 and the last mistake is that people 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.250
 who are just starting to jump they 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 hurry 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.350
 and by and try to jump very fast 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.940
 make mistakes here at the height of the beginning you 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.970
 interfere with the jump you will get lost that is 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.470
 do it slowly and slowly and you have everything 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.640
 succeed and over time you will be able to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:56.590
 increase speed 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:00.100
 that is, first, so now we move on 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.280
 to our skipping rope is very important to know a 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.410
 what should be the length of your rope then 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.740
 is there if you are just a beginner i advise 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.869
 you have them and keep the length of the shoulder girdle 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.350
 our esgarot will explain now that I have 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.660
 mind 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:19.200
 you need to stand in the middle of your 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.580
 the ropes straighten up and raise your hand 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.790
 handles your ears with a skipping rope should 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.740
 be at the level of the shoulder girdle as 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.440
 well yes if you are a beginner if you can 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.600
 see my arms a little lower this 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.250
 because the rope is shorter when you have 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.050
 shorter rope this allows you to jump 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.530
 faster because circular motions 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.959
 shorter but since you are a beginner you this 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.270
 do not need that is, first practice with 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.310
 level of the shoulder girdle and when you 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.950
 can do it masterfully 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.360
 start shortening forward so 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.920
 last stage before we start 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.590
 jump rope we will 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.000
 practice jumping rope but with 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.980
 the parties that is called the shadow 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.980
 jump looks like this 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.500
 what is it for because 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.750
 lets you learn to jump to the rhythm 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.780
 with a rope that is if you can 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.180
 jump with the same rhythm that steep 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.250
 jump rope you can jump jumping with 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.530
 rope already that is, you jump over 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.440
 as he and so respectively now 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.800
 turn yourself jump pyrotechnics 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:31.160
 who know it usually they usually 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:33.590
 friend that is, I looked like this now 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.170
 I will break this jump in parts where 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.959
 I will explain how his body price means so 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.330
 first of all take you gotta be 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.780
 behind you magnet spirit knees 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:51.550
 you are Glinka hands 3 look ahead and you 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.550
 need to make one right jump i 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.820
 again 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.819
 richard without no why did this because 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.860
 that jumping rope is basically 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.670
 one jump only you repeats it 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.010
 many times 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.950
 that is, if you can do one 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.010
 the jump is excellent means versatility 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.849
 delta pro costs when you can do 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.150
 one jump 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:21.310
 right start make three then 5 and 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.950
 so on when you can do 10 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.600
 increase our allison increase 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.729
 your his 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:32.010
 you no longer need to do immediately 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.010
 100 jumps, do so gradually 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.379
 the second technique is called the whole were one 

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:44.019
 from English then just sort of 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.019
 walking looks and there next the sauce 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.939
 the structure of this jump is the same 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:56.769
 hockey usual jump that is like this 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:05:00.499
 but I hope the initial stance 

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:02.959
 position and find can not knees look 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:07.329
 forward into your hands forward and understand one 

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:07.329
 leg and you need to do one jump 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.499
 repeat one jump 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.139
 when you can do one jump 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.139
 superbly start making 5 guns and 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.229
 so on there 1020 and again if you 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.940
 noticed i jump very low no need 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.659
 jump high i mean such movements 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.659
 we don't need 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.280
 the lower you jump the faster you 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.800
 jump and when you jump very 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.169
 high it could cause your injury 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.180
 knees because when you land 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.289
 it's a lot of stress for your knee 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.569
 joint when you can perform 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:57.810
 everyone doesn't live separately afterwards 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:06:01.380
 can be combined when you can 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:08.669
 make it slow without mistakes you can 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:10.349
 gradually increase the speed and so we 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.969
 finished it were two main techniques 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.409
 jumps and jumps I hope you 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.449
 liked this video and now you 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.610
 will be able to jump correctly nevertheless 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.560
 if you already know how to jump rope and 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.630
 you want to learn more difficult techniques 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.669
 different kinds of way as the aboriginal husband 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.039
 jump rope watch this video there i 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.690
 telling and showing 26 distinguish

 options as you can jump rope 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.889
 and if you want to know why jumping on

 jump rope useful and what are the benefits 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.550
 from jumping rope look it 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.550
