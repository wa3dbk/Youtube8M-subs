00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.130 
pros are the studio's it's plastic it's
just<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> mixers<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.689> pops<00:01:33.869> in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
just like the mixers that just pops in

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.760 
just like the mixers that just pops in
and<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:40.409> wouldn't<00:01:40.650> necessarily

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and out like so you wouldn't necessarily

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740 
and out like so you wouldn't necessarily
want<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> DJ<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.850> them<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.450> you'd

want to DJ with them just because you'd

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.840

probably snag them or something so

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.190 
probably snag them or something so
that's<00:01:45.030> something<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> look<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:45.960> all

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200

know works really really well so you
might<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:57.299> yourself<00:01:57.930> well<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> pros

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
might think yourself well if the pros

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.319 
might think yourself well if the pros
are<00:01:58.950> foreigner<00:01:59.280> dollars<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.759> should<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.119> go

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
are foreigner dollars I should just go

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.060 
are foreigner dollars I should just go
with<00:02:00.360> those<00:02:00.630> they're<00:02:01.320> automatically<00:02:01.799> better

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
with those they're automatically better

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.030 
with those they're automatically better
but<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> mean<00:02:02.820> I've<00:02:03.540> done<00:02:04.290> traveling<00:02:04.890> with

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
but I mean I've done traveling with

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.170 
but I mean I've done traveling with
these<00:02:05.159> headphones<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.729> they're<00:02:05.850> not<00:02:05.969> that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
these headphones and they're not that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
these headphones and they're not that
great<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.659> mean<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.990> does<00:02:07.140> cancel<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.680> some

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
great I mean it does cancel out some

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.630 
great I mean it does cancel out some
ambient<00:02:08.429> noise

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
ambient noise

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850 
ambient noise
but<00:02:09.210> it's<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.569> little<00:02:09.780> heavy<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.500> bit

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
but it's a little heavy a bit

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.330 
but it's a little heavy a bit
uncomfortable<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.920> that's<00:02:13.920> something<00:02:14.250> to

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
uncomfortable so that's something to

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.980 
uncomfortable so that's something to
take<00:02:14.370> note<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.240> then<00:02:15.420> again<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.810> wouldn't

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
take note of but then again you wouldn't

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.540 
take note of but then again you wouldn't
really<00:02:16.200> want<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.560> deejay<00:02:16.740> with<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.100> studios

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
really want to deejay with the studios

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
really want to deejay with the studios
even<00:02:17.850> though<00:02:17.940> people<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.690> still<00:02:19.050> as

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
even though people do it still as

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.870 
even though people do it still as
possible<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:21.860> battery-powered

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
possible but it is a battery-powered

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.800 
possible but it is a battery-powered
headphone<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.209> if<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.510> don't<00:02:24.690> like

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
headphone so if you don't like

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.690 
headphone so if you don't like
battery-powered<00:02:25.230> headphones<00:02:25.830> whatsoever<00:02:26.459> I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
battery-powered headphones whatsoever I

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.930 
battery-powered headphones whatsoever I
won't<00:02:27.240> necessarily<00:02:27.420> go<00:02:28.350> for<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> pros<00:02:29.040> look

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
won't necessarily go for the pros look

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.180 
won't necessarily go for the pros look
in<00:02:30.090> them<00:02:30.270> maybe<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.750> mixers<00:02:31.140> or<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.440> solo<00:02:31.680> HDS

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
in them maybe the mixers or the solo HDS

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.430 
in them maybe the mixers or the solo HDS
but<00:02:33.120> if<00:02:33.480> you're<00:02:33.630> willing<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.959> spend<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.290> for

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
but if you're willing to spend that for

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.260 
but if you're willing to spend that for
underdogs<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.010> pros<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:36.000> don't

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
underdogs for the pros and you don't

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.479 
underdogs for the pros and you don't
want<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.570> batteries<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.739> know<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.280> go<00:02:38.370> with

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
want the batteries you know just go with

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.900 
want the batteries you know just go with
the<00:02:38.550> pros<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.480> cables<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.370> use<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.610> pros

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
the pros the cables I use the pros

the pros the cables I use the pros
actual<00:02:42.600> deejay<00:02:43.530> cable<00:02:43.920> when<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.130> walk<00:02:44.310> around

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
actual deejay cable when I walk around

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.570 
actual deejay cable when I walk around
you<00:02:45.209> know<00:02:45.270> it's<00:02:45.390> got<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> coil<00:02:46.130> it's<00:02:47.130> gotta<00:02:47.370> be

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
you know it's got the coil it's gotta be

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.250 
you know it's got the coil it's gotta be
l-shaped<00:02:48.090> jack<00:02:48.360> which<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.930> really

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
l-shaped jack which is really

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.949 
l-shaped jack which is really
high-quality<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:50.190> all<00:02:50.400> metal<00:02:50.750> really<00:02:51.750> good

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
high-quality it's all metal really good

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.810 
high-quality it's all metal really good
stuff<00:02:52.200> it's<00:02:52.470> got<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.739> like<00:02:52.920> lanyard<00:02:53.550> thing

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
stuff it's got this like lanyard thing

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.630 
stuff it's got this like lanyard thing
that<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:55.080> can<00:02:55.260> hook<00:02:55.440> around<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:58.430> 1/8<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
that you can hook around the 1/8 the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.130 
that you can hook around the 1/8 the
adapter<00:03:00.510> well<00:03:01.220> somewhat<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.930> works

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
adapter well somewhat so that works

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.199 
adapter well somewhat so that works
really<00:03:04.380> well<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.860> about<00:03:04.950> 4<00:03:05.280> foot<00:03:05.430> cable<00:03:05.730> and

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
really well it's about 4 foot cable and

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.020 
really well it's about 4 foot cable and
what's<00:03:06.390> cool<00:03:06.660> about<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.959> pros<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.620> one<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.910> a

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
what's cool about the pros is one it's a

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.810 
what's cool about the pros is one it's a
dual<00:03:09.239> employed<00:03:09.750> input<00:03:10.739> jack<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.610> can

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
dual employed input jack so you can

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.340 
dual employed input jack so you can
daisy<00:03:12.060> chain<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.860> can<00:03:13.890> also<00:03:15.049> put<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.170> in

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
daisy chain and you can also put it in

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.259 
daisy chain and you can also put it in
twist<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.130> now<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.459> doesn't<00:03:17.760> come<00:03:17.910> out<00:03:18.030> so

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
twist it and now it doesn't come out so

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.270 
twist it and now it doesn't come out so
that's<00:03:18.390> really<00:03:18.750> good<00:03:19.019> that's<00:03:19.350> all<00:03:19.620> metal<00:03:20.040> no

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
that's really good that's all metal no

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280 
that's really good that's all metal no
plastic<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.299> only<00:03:21.480> thing<00:03:21.690> that's<00:03:21.930> plastic

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
plastic the only thing that's plastic

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.870 
plastic the only thing that's plastic
and<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.799> actually<00:03:23.250> has<00:03:23.400> me<00:03:23.579> kind<00:03:23.790> of

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
and that actually has me kind of

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.340 
and that actually has me kind of
concerned<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:26.720> this<00:03:29.900> these<00:03:30.900> are<00:03:31.110> plastic

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
concerned is the this these are plastic

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.440 
concerned is the this these are plastic
these<00:03:31.860> two<00:03:32.160> little<00:03:32.459> end<00:03:32.820> deals<00:03:33.060> they're

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
these two little end deals they're

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.030 
these two little end deals they're
plastic<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.110> that's<00:03:34.200> got<00:03:34.470> me<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> little<00:03:34.920> bit

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
plastic and that's got me a little bit

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.740 
plastic and that's got me a little bit
worried<00:03:35.370> what<00:03:35.640> happens<00:03:35.940> if<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.209> breaks<00:03:36.420> I

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
worried what happens if it breaks I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.460 
worried what happens if it breaks I
don't<00:03:37.500> know<00:03:38.030> but<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.180> cable<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.989> probably<00:03:40.350> the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
don't know but the cable is probably the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.190 
don't know but the cable is probably the
best<00:03:40.680> out<00:03:40.860> of<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.040> beats<00:03:41.220> line<00:03:41.489> up<00:03:42.200> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
best out of the beats line up the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.910 
best out of the beats line up the
studio's<00:03:43.620> cable<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.280> just<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.570> standard

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
studio's cable is just the standard

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.440 
studio's cable is just the standard
inline<00:03:46.920> mic<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.519> does<00:03:47.640> come<00:03:47.820> with<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.060> blank

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
inline mic and it does come with a blank

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.560 
inline mic and it does come with a blank
cable<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.640> studio's<00:03:51.060> their<00:03:51.299> comfort

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
cable but the studio's their comfort

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.840 
cable but the studio's their comfort
ability<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.959> absolutely<00:03:52.620> phenomenal<00:03:52.850> the

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
ability is absolutely phenomenal the

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.080 
ability is absolutely phenomenal the
style<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.540> iconic<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:56.430> know<00:03:56.519> just<00:03:56.850> take<00:03:57.000> the

style is iconic you know just take the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.060 
style is iconic you know just take the
batteries<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.780> if<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.709> don't<00:03:58.860> have<00:03:58.950> the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
battery you don't have sound so that's I

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.350

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.009 
guess some of them take note of it
doesn't<00:04:03.630> bother<00:04:03.750> me

look<00:06:09.350> towards<00:06:09.740> the<00:06:09.919> mixers<00:06:10.690> just<00:06:11.690> because

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
look towards the mixers just because

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.090 
look towards the mixers just because
that<00:06:12.470> heavy<00:06:12.800> bass<00:06:13.669> heavy<00:06:13.910> music<00:06:15.070> would<00:06:16.070> be

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
that heavy bass heavy music would be

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.570 
that heavy bass heavy music would be
good<00:06:16.490> for<00:06:16.730> the<00:06:16.850> mixers<00:06:17.979> so<00:06:18.979> I<00:06:19.010> mean<00:06:19.250> this<00:06:19.400> is

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
good for the mixers so I mean this is

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.250 
good for the mixers so I mean this is
the<00:06:19.699> beats<00:06:19.880> Pro<00:06:20.150> in<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:20.360> beat<00:06:20.540> studio<00:06:20.990> and

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
the beats Pro in the beat studio and

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.930 
the beats Pro in the beat studio and
this<00:06:21.350> is<00:06:21.560> their<00:06:21.740> comparison<00:06:22.310> I<00:06:22.430> hope<00:06:22.610> you<00:06:22.760> guys

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
this is their comparison I hope you guys

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.800 
this is their comparison I hope you guys
or<00:06:23.479> I<00:06:23.540> hope<00:06:23.840> I<00:06:24.050> gave<00:06:24.110> you<00:06:24.350> guys<00:06:24.680> what<00:06:25.660> fits<00:06:26.660> you

most<00:06:27.110> so<00:06:27.650> you<00:06:27.710> don't<00:06:27.979> have<00:06:28.070> to<00:06:28.250> necessarily

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
most so you don't have to necessarily

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.400 
most so you don't have to necessarily
think<00:06:29.090> you<00:06:29.240> have<00:06:29.419> to<00:06:29.510> automatically<00:06:29.990> upgrade

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
think you have to automatically upgrade

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.680 
think you have to automatically upgrade
to<00:06:30.530> the<00:06:30.650> pros<00:06:31.030> even<00:06:32.030> though<00:06:32.150> it's<00:06:32.360> not<00:06:32.479> that

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
to the pros even though it's not that

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.040 
to the pros even though it's not that
bad<00:06:32.840> of<00:06:32.990> an<00:06:33.169> upgrade<00:06:33.639> so<00:06:34.639> that's<00:06:34.910> my<00:06:35.060> video<00:06:35.240> all

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
bad of an upgrade so that's my video all

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.229 
bad of an upgrade so that's my video all
