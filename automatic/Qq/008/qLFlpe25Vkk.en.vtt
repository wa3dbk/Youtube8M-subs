00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:11.870
 Yes hi high school math tv but let's follow the store on the same plane 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:17.660
 I because the place where peach Center test is love of insanely die 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.529
 And a firm grasp check with all means at you come out full even with the other any taste 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.599
 Let's get up 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 Anyway, the most important knowledge here is this, but it's a bit long, but read 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:33.300
 Please 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.610
 If there are two vectors it Yes any point even through the United States of two of that is on the same plane as it 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.510
 Can be expressed by using 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.530
 We will take a look at to do is I specifically was important head say 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.339
 For example, there is a vector buf dollar Tteyuu Oe and ob to Fu say 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.450
 If you 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.270
 Only if 10 p For example, in this day 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.740
 The sun on 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:57.630
 This is on this side that can be represented using this a vector and bb 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:01.140
 10 p even if it is possible to push roughness in any place, even 10 p in this side 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.980
 No , I think it might be thought by the bus if I withdrew too but 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.020
 It is as you are writing here 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:15.200
 I think that the trower soa + tob to make op 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.670
 The guy's Tteyuu vector lent many cups the ob vector lend many cups a Oe vector 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.500
 If you add 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.000
 I sense that I will be ob 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.220
 For example, oo poooo a + ob 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.800
 If s is too tired 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:35.690
 It becomes like this kind of vector and you can see that there is t around here 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:40.220
 If you double ob with oh 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.770
 You can see that there is a point p in this area . 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:49.640
 if ob 4 1 time 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:53.270
 The ob Toka in such Fu around here is the point p in the opposition Oe in the -2 times 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.929
 -If you try to have the sun doubled in this area 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:01.369
 You can represent even where the sun is 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.179
 In fact, I'm doing this once on the plane , and I want to know something in detail. 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.790
 Please give me 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.950
 Stand here 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.810
 That 's a reaffirmation of this knowledge If there are two vectors, it's on the same plane 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.150
 Even if there is a point p in any place 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.480
 It can be expressed absolutely by holding a few cups of Oe and a few cups of ob 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.690
 It was important to say 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.170
 Jarger 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.239
 Ne 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.780
 Like this, there is always a plane abc determined by 3 stores abc. 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:35.490
 This is also the expression that it is all on the same plane after all 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:39.690
 If there are 3 points abc and there is a plane determined by this 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:43.730
 Timing This was a little like this Fu to no such wind but with God it is hard to write 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.190
 There is a time when you think that there is, there are three points on it 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.910
 So further on that underlaying 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.770
 Anywhere it's good 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:58.319
 If there is a point p in this side of the stone in this side, but in this side, in this side, in this side or in this side 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.579
 It is good here and here and anywhere 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:09.749
 I can say that on the same plane is with this in absolute 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:10.170
 You can absolutely represent it by using this ab vector and ac vector 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.200
 Ne 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.430
 Because it is sending out completely with this 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.310
 The Tteyuu ap vector obtained is aba Kotoro s by then to be c 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.600
 Vector big 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.770
 by but I can represent it absolutely 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.780
 It is important that this knowledge of 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:34.640
 It is the place to confirm how to actually use it in a problem 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:40.400
 Re-confirmed because there is a knowledge Dont threads in one another when solving this problem 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.140
 Let's keep it. It's how to take the United States when the spatial coordinates are known . 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.760
 It is how to ask 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.120
 The components of the space vector are sweaty in detail 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.599
 If you don't call, please watch the video 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.750
 I'm only here officially released here 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:04:01.360
 that Britain and the United States if we abcdef guess it was there before catching a star 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:04.270
 d -8 e -1 fc It seems like this component will be 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.190
 Is as we did in the last video 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:14.560
 Then let's see the problem based on more than that problem 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:17.170
 3.231 b Comes on 50 c 512 and is defined as having point p 1-2 on the plane 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.680
 It is such a feeling that we are going to stop correspondence 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.260
 At this time there are 3 abc 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.790
 The person who tries to write his head very accurately also says 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.570
 It's it is important to say exactly write the head but it is that amazing wonderful with it 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.360
 It is 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:41.189
 It's just hard to write 10 spaces in space 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:42.560
 There are many things that can be done at all even four days at the center support level and the space vector diagram. 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:47.870
 is not it 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:53.120
 So like this abc suitably pompon temporary It is on the same plane as this 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:56.840
 The Ekore Nde I think I wonder if I if I think even the image that there are two points p 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.669
 This is also quite appropriate writing ab 4 pom pom 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.199
 It is important to have this image, so there is abc here and the nose nose is here 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.229
 Try to water 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:10.060
 And there is only one other person 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:14.830
 Because four points abcd are on the same plane 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.550
 Who can do this by myself ? Ap s by ab 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:23.190
 Mon'ya and kneaded the scene was t by 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:28.200
 If there is a vector here and there is also a vector here, using this vector 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:32.550
 If you use a vector, you can always represent this ab vector you want to obtain 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.720
 Be expressed always have that Fit It's this guy's name did was to what cups of guy 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:39.450
 You can 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.020
 Whether you receive this formula or not If you have this, you just need to find the ingredients 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.250
 Ne 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:48.600
 or ap or vector only be made Naa Naa ab is Boda is also a projection, such 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:53.100
 You know the coordinates, but you can ask for everything. The end of this is the Japanese bill. 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.710
 Calculate and have it motown firm Oite to check in I think everyone can 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.740
 Please give me 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.490
 I 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.220
 If I ask for something like this, I'll just assign it here 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.310
 With pom pom 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:08.560
 If it is just calculation of the component from here 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:10.240
 State et al. Flow 1 little people I think that I wish I do not know meaning there is on here in the same plane body 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:16.390
 Not not mean difficult 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:20.920
 Please be why review the calculation of the components of the space just not familiar with the calculation of the components of the space 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:27.130
 I'm only going to calculate this again. 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:32.560
 Well then I'll compare on both sides- 1 voice star so dk low is to s-2 tier 4- 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:36.409
 3 guess I can have a negative Esther Institute and door three equations 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.129
 Solvable always this man equation because the character 3 Tsunishiki three there 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:40.219
 The 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:43.969
 After we're going to polish in the fact that the other this is 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:47.179
 Please put say I think I confirmed and can be 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:49.529
 I tried to be on the same plane with the Holy Child 

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:51.080
 The most important thing here 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:55.610
 What is this 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:07:00.319
 If there are two vectors, any point can be broken down on the same plane 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:01.069
 It is like this 3 abc difference Tamahira bc always tpp that changed the expression 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:06.680
 And 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:10.490
 The same ape goal s bar like this when 4 points are on the same plane 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.070
 Of ab + t bar Hey you say that you can be conscious as you say 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.090
 Let's get up 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:19.220
 On their own to find and request that to be that English-only by say net 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.220
 Please check carefully
