00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
more power more grit so let's see how we

00:00:43.230 --> 00:02:57.650 
more power more grit so let's see how we
get<00:00:43.379> on

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.760

lights<00:03:24.880> up<00:03:25.060> here<00:03:25.270> are<00:03:25.420> your<00:03:25.570> shift<00:03:25.870> lights<00:03:26.080> so

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
lights up here are your shift lights so

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
you get a display of LEDs notes so you

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.080 
you get a display of LEDs notes so you
know<00:03:29.230> when<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.440> shift<00:03:29.650> up<00:03:29.830> now<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.490> gearbox<00:03:30.940> is

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
know when to shift up now the gearbox is

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.120 
know when to shift up now the gearbox is
a<00:03:31.120> 6-speed<00:03:31.660> sequential<00:03:32.080> system<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:32.860> it<00:03:33.010> means

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
a 6-speed sequential system so it means

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.010 
a 6-speed sequential system so it means
that<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.460> have<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.640> big<00:03:34.180> lever<00:03:34.390> here<00:03:34.690> when

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
that you have a big lever here when

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.150 
that you have a big lever here when
you're<00:03:35.140> up<00:03:35.290> shifting<00:03:35.710> you<00:03:35.770> keep<00:03:35.920> your<00:03:36.040> foot

you're up shifting you keep your foot
flat<00:03:36.370> on<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.640> throttle<00:03:36.970> just<00:03:37.480> pull<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.750> lever

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
flat on the throttle just pull the lever

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.510 
flat on the throttle just pull the lever
back<00:03:38.050> and<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.530> shifts<00:03:38.770> up<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.980> gear<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.400> when
