basically<00:00:24.189> a<00:00:24.339> little<00:00:24.789> flap<00:00:25.089> of<00:00:25.269> skin<00:00:25.300> from

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
basically a little flap of skin from

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.720 
basically a little flap of skin from
your<00:00:25.990> inner<00:00:26.199> ear<00:00:26.499> that's<00:00:26.830> pushed<00:00:27.189> out<00:00:27.429> the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
your inner ear that's pushed out the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.319 
your inner ear that's pushed out the
back<00:00:27.939> when<00:00:28.329> you're<00:00:28.480> doing<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:28.960> stretch<00:00:29.289> so<00:00:30.329> the

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
back when you're doing a stretch so the

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.300 
back when you're doing a stretch so the
most<00:00:31.509> common<00:00:31.630> way<00:00:31.990> this<00:00:32.349> happens<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:33.010> that

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
most common way this happens is that

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.390 
most common way this happens is that
people<00:00:34.239> are<00:00:34.329> stretching<00:00:34.690> way<00:00:34.989> too<00:00:35.050> fast<00:00:35.470> so<00:00:35.980> if

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
people are stretching way too fast so if

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.490 
people are stretching way too fast so if
you're<00:00:36.850> skipping<00:00:37.150> sizes<00:00:37.900> or<00:00:38.200> if<00:00:38.320> you're<00:00:38.470> just

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
you're skipping sizes or if you're just

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.580 
you're skipping sizes or if you're just
shoving<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.400> bigger<00:00:39.760> size<00:00:40.030> plug<00:00:40.420> in<00:00:40.660> there<00:00:40.870> it

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
shoving a bigger size plug in there it

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.350 
shoving a bigger size plug in there it
doesn't<00:00:41.830> want<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.130> go<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:42.520> you<00:00:42.610> just<00:00:42.820> shove<00:00:43.330> it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
doesn't want to go and you just shove it

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.730 
doesn't want to go and you just shove it
in<00:00:43.570> it<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:44.710> generally<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.690> generally<00:00:47.380> kind<00:00:47.650> of

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
in it it generally it generally kind of

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.940 
in it it generally it generally kind of
just<00:00:47.980> pushes<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.490> back<00:00:48.700> of<00:00:49.410> your<00:00:50.410> inner<00:00:50.650> ear

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
just pushes the back of your inner ear

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.100 
just pushes the back of your inner ear
out<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.520> back<00:00:51.730> of<00:00:51.940> your<00:00:52.120> uh<00:00:52.150> you<00:00:52.810> know<00:00:52.900> out

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
out to the back of your uh you know out

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.710 
out to the back of your uh you know out
to<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.350> back<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.680> you<00:00:53.800> here<00:00:54.010> whatnot<00:00:54.400> so<00:00:55.240> and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720

to the back of you here whatnot so and
it's<00:00:56.200> really<00:00:56.410> not<00:00:56.560> that<00:00:56.620> big<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:56.950> an<00:00:57.070> issue<00:00:57.250> but

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
it's really not that big of an issue but

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
that uh everybody looks at and you know

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.029 
that uh everybody looks at and you know
and<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:09.850> can<00:01:09.999> feel<00:01:10.240> all<00:01:10.270> day<00:01:10.659> and<00:01:11.039> another

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
the first going to do is to downsize

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.639 
the first going to do is to downsize
even<00:01:39.579> though<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.759> sucks<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.420> know<00:01:40.539> you<00:01:40.600> uh<00:01:40.780> you

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
you're at zero gauge and you just

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.550 
you're at zero gauge and you just
stretch<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:01.119> zero<00:02:01.359> gauge<00:02:01.600> down<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:02.139> size<00:02:02.319> to

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.410 
stretch the zero gauge down the size to
a<00:02:02.590> four<00:02:02.889> gauge<00:02:03.130> like<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:03.759> said<00:02:03.999> even<00:02:04.179> though<00:02:04.329> it

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
a four gauge like I said even though it

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.749 
a four gauge like I said even though it
sucks<00:02:04.719> you'll<00:02:05.439> thank<00:02:05.679> yourself<00:02:05.829> a<00:02:06.159> long<00:02:06.459> run

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
sucks you'll thank yourself a long run

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.080 
sucks you'll thank yourself a long run
so<00:02:07.679> downsize<00:02:08.679> leave<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.429> like<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:09.640> for<00:02:10.000> about

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
so downsize leave it like that for about

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.380 
so downsize leave it like that for about
a<00:02:10.209> month<00:02:10.479> or<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.200> then<00:02:11.860> stretch<00:02:12.610> back<00:02:12.879> up<00:02:13.150> a

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
a month or so and then stretch back up a

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.559 
a month or so and then stretch back up a
lot<00:02:14.290> slower<00:02:14.650> obviously

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
lot slower obviously

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.910 
lot slower obviously
so<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:17.400> generally<00:02:17.909> will<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:19.110> doesn't<00:02:19.739> always

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
so that generally will it doesn't always

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.399 
so that generally will it doesn't always
work<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:21.719> stretched<00:02:22.079> the

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
work but if you just stretched the

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.349 
work but if you just stretched the
chances<00:02:22.829> are<00:02:22.920> pretty<00:02:23.069> good<00:02:23.219> that<00:02:23.400> it'll<00:02:24.030> it'll

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
chances are pretty good that it'll it'll

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.899 
chances are pretty good that it'll it'll
your<00:02:24.719> ear<00:02:24.930> will<00:02:25.019> heal<00:02:25.200> itself<00:02:25.530> after<00:02:25.859> that<00:02:26.159> so

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
your ear will heal itself after that so

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.599 
your ear will heal itself after that so
so<00:02:27.420> what<00:02:27.870> happens<00:02:28.230> if<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.769> if<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.159> leave<00:02:29.430> it

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
so what happens if you if you leave it

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.080 
so what happens if you if you leave it
and<00:02:29.879> just<00:02:30.090> don't<00:02:30.269> fix<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.920> if<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.700> say<00:02:33.030> you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and just don't fix it if you say you

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.410 
and just don't fix it if you say you
leave<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.079> blowout<00:02:35.000> Healing<00:02:36.000> on<00:02:36.120> your<00:02:36.239> ear<00:02:36.390> for

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
leave a blowout Healing on your ear for

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
a month or two the chances are that it's

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.339 
a month or two the chances are that it's
going<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.849> heal<00:02:39.090> up<00:02:39.299> like<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.689> and<00:02:39.989> kind<00:02:40.230> of

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
going to heal up like that and kind of

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.670 
going to heal up like that and kind of
just<00:02:40.590> totally<00:02:41.189> be<00:02:41.370> there<00:02:41.519> for<00:02:41.730> life<00:02:41.909> so<00:02:42.870> you
