00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.660 

a<00:00:16.410> reader<00:00:17.410> of<00:00:17.500> our<00:00:17.680> website<00:00:18.070> asked<00:00:18.550> the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
a reader of our website asked the

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.430 
a reader of our website asked the
question<00:00:19.000> of<00:00:19.150> whether<00:00:19.390> you<00:00:19.690> can<00:00:19.720> lay<00:00:20.080> down<00:00:20.260> an

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
question of whether you can lay down an

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.710 
question of whether you can lay down an
audio<00:00:20.710> track<00:00:20.920> before<00:00:21.279> you<00:00:21.700> add<00:00:21.880> images<00:00:22.150> or

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
audio track before you add images or

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.800 
audio track before you add images or
video<00:00:23.110> in<00:00:23.440> an<00:00:23.650> iMovie<00:00:24.000> project<00:00:25.000> so<00:00:25.720> we're

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
video in an iMovie project so we're

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.240 
video in an iMovie project so we're
gonna<00:00:25.900> take<00:00:26.110> a<00:00:26.140> look<00:00:26.320> at<00:00:26.560> doing<00:00:26.890> that<00:00:27.010> now

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
gonna take a look at doing that now

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.280 
gonna take a look at doing that now
usually<00:00:27.580> I<00:00:28.000> recommend<00:00:28.480> laying<00:00:28.960> down<00:00:29.170> the

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
usually I recommend laying down the

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.900 
usually I recommend laying down the
video<00:00:29.500> first<00:00:29.770> if<00:00:30.160> you<00:00:30.310> lay<00:00:30.460> down<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.670> video

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
video first if you lay down the video

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.910 
video first if you lay down the video
first<00:00:31.270> you<00:00:31.390> have<00:00:31.509> more<00:00:31.689> precise<00:00:32.050> control<00:00:32.080> over

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
first you have more precise control over

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.549 
first you have more precise control over
where<00:00:33.129> the<00:00:33.340> audio<00:00:33.820> goes<00:00:34.090> but<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:34.870> is<00:00:34.900> possible

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
where the audio goes but it is possible

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.140 
where the audio goes but it is possible
to<00:00:35.590> do<00:00:35.800> that<00:00:35.830> so<00:00:36.250> we're<00:00:36.460> gonna<00:00:36.580> start<00:00:36.820> off<00:00:36.970> by

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
to do that so we're gonna start off by

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.210 
to do that so we're gonna start off by
going<00:00:37.330> underneath<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.780> file<00:00:38.050> menu<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.620> from

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
going underneath the file menu and from

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.530 
going underneath the file menu and from
the<00:00:39.309> file<00:00:39.460> menu<00:00:39.489> I'm<00:00:39.879> going<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.059> choose<00:00:40.120> new

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
the file menu I'm going to choose new

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.900 
the file menu I'm going to choose new
project<00:00:40.840> and<00:00:41.290> I'm<00:00:41.920> gonna<00:00:42.070> call<00:00:42.370> this<00:00:42.580> my

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
project and I'm gonna call this my

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.070 
project and I'm gonna call this my
friend<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:44.379> pigeon<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.780> I'm<00:00:46.930> gonna

friend the pigeon and I'm gonna

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.170 
friend the pigeon and I'm gonna
automatically<00:00:47.800> add<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:47.980> cross-dissolve<00:00:48.610> even

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
automatically add a cross-dissolve even

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.970 
automatically add a cross-dissolve even
though<00:00:49.270> that's<00:00:49.390> not<00:00:49.630> entirely<00:00:50.140> necessary<00:00:50.380> for

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
though that's not entirely necessary for

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.709 
though that's not entirely necessary for
this<00:00:51.070> example<00:00:51.430> so<00:00:52.270> now<00:00:52.300> we<00:00:52.450> have<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.600> new

that you've added some music the reason

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.560

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
is expanding its drop those cross

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.140 
is expanding its drop those cross
dissolves<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.579> for<00:01:45.759> me<00:01:45.850> at<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.060> beginning

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
dissolves and for me at the beginning

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.819 
dissolves and for me at the beginning
and<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.630> end<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.290> could<00:01:47.470> add<00:01:47.590> some

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
and the end of that so I could add some

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.770 
and the end of that so I could add some
other<00:01:47.950> frames<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.549> here<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:48.909> you'll<00:01:49.570> notice

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
other frames in here and you'll notice

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.050 
other frames in here and you'll notice
that<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.290> audio<00:01:50.650> shows<00:01:51.130> three<00:01:51.490> dots<00:01:51.700> at<00:01:51.939> the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
that the audio shows three dots at the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.130 
that the audio shows three dots at the
end<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.420> means<00:01:52.689> that<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.930> song

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
end and that means that the song

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.990 
end and that means that the song
continues<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.250> audio<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.880> I've

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
continues and so the audio that I've

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.690 
continues and so the audio that I've
laid<00:01:55.180> down<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.689> longer<00:01:56.470> than<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.740> video<00:01:56.860> so<00:01:57.670> I

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
laid down is longer than the video so I

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.249 
laid down is longer than the video so I
could<00:01:57.880> do<00:01:57.970> something<00:01:58.000> like<00:01:58.360> start<00:01:58.930> off<00:01:59.049> with<00:01:59.229> a

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
could do something like start off with a

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.380 
could do something like start off with a
little<00:01:59.470> bit<00:01:59.680> of<00:01:59.799> fireworks<00:02:00.670> for<00:02:00.939> this<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.329> I'm

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
little bit of fireworks for this and I'm

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.880 
little bit of fireworks for this and I'm
going<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.570> drop<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.930> fireworks<00:02:02.320> here<00:02:02.680> in<00:02:02.799> the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
going to drop the fireworks here in the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.690 
going to drop the fireworks here in the
beginning<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.759> now<00:02:04.420> I'm<00:02:04.869> going<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.170> insert

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
beginning and now I'm going to insert

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.859 
beginning and now I'm going to insert
and<00:02:06.700> when<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:06.880> do<00:02:06.970> this<00:02:07.210> you're<00:02:07.390> gonna<00:02:07.479> see<00:02:07.720> that

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
and when I do this you're gonna see that

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.960 
and when I do this you're gonna see that
I've<00:02:08.019> got<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.290> presentation<00:02:08.829> that<00:02:09.220> now<00:02:09.670> runs

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
I've got a presentation that now runs

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.789 
I've got a presentation that now runs
the<00:02:10.179> length<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.869> audio<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.350> so<00:02:11.500> if<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.680> hit

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
the length of the audio and so if I hit

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.199 
the length of the audio and so if I hit
play<00:02:12.010> I'm<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.670> be<00:02:12.760> able<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.940> see<00:02:13.090> the
