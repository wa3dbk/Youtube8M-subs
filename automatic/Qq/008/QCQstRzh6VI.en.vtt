I<00:00:15.040> passed<00:00:16.040> the<00:00:16.190> unit<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:16.670> start<00:00:16.940> with<00:00:17.119> I'm

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
I passed the unit to start with I'm

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.109 
I passed the unit to start with I'm
super<00:00:17.930> intense<00:00:18.260> that<00:00:18.439> it's<00:00:18.590> in<00:00:18.740> line<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.700> then

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
super intense that it's in line so then

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.690 
super intense that it's in line so then
you<00:00:20.420> can<00:00:20.570> disconnect<00:00:20.960> it<00:00:21.520> once<00:00:22.520> it's

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
you can disconnect it once it's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.639 
you can disconnect it once it's
disconnected<00:00:23.150> one<00:00:23.840> screw<00:00:24.110> top<00:00:24.439> of<00:00:24.619> this<00:00:24.710> thing

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:26.649 
disconnected one screw top of this thing

hit<00:00:28.759> the<00:00:28.880> one<00:00:29.000> side<00:00:36.489> now<00:00:37.489> most<00:00:38.000> units<00:00:38.360> will

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
hit the one side now most units will

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:49.240 
hit the one side now most units will
have<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.660> distributor<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:47.330> inside<00:00:47.920> just<00:00:48.920> pull

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
have a distributor the inside just pull

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.760 
have a distributor the inside just pull
that<00:00:49.280> out<00:00:49.490> and<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.810> will<00:00:50.960> barely<00:00:51.200> get<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.620> one

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
that out and it will barely get to one

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.240 
that out and it will barely get to one
side

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
now it's just a matter of 15 Hank so you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.960 
now it's just a matter of 15 Hank so you
can<00:01:02.780> push<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.050> up<00:01:03.170> let<00:01:03.380> this<00:01:03.739> sort<00:01:04.220> on<00:01:04.549> it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
distributor height so at the cuff

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.670 
distributor height so at the cuff
equipment<00:02:22.959> so<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.140> don't<00:02:23.320> trust<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:28.680> should

equipment so you don't trust it should
be<00:02:29.860> just<00:02:30.250> about<00:02:40.050> put<00:02:41.050> tape<00:02:41.290> on<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.680> top<00:02:41.830> of

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
be just about put tape on the top of

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.720 
be just about put tape on the top of
this<00:02:42.130> distributor<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.709> let<00:02:44.920> me<00:02:45.220> fill<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.550> we

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
this distributor so let me fill it we

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.670 
this distributor so let me fill it we
don't<00:02:45.940> force<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.480> down<00:02:46.750> with<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.080> Kaiser<00:02:47.290> to

don't force that down with the Kaiser to

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.520 
don't force that down with the Kaiser to
this<00:02:48.220> were<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.820> original<00:02:49.330> behavior<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:50.350> need

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
this were the original behavior you need

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.160 
this were the original behavior you need
to<00:02:50.590> wash<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.890> out<00:02:51.190> real<00:02:51.459> good<00:02:51.900> with<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.019> hose

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
to wash it out real good with the hose

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.259 
to wash it out real good with the hose
before<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.160> start<00:02:54.400> putting<00:02:54.700> stuff<00:02:54.850> in<00:02:55.090> here

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
before you start putting stuff in here

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.630 
before you start putting stuff in here
so<00:02:55.480> there's<00:02:55.780> no<00:02:55.900> particles<00:02:56.560> inside<00:02:56.920> if<00:02:57.580> you

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
so there's no particles inside if you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.670 
so there's no particles inside if you
don't<00:02:57.760> get<00:02:58.120> them<00:02:58.269> out<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.079> could<00:02:59.290> possibly

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
don't get them out and it could possibly

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.080 
don't get them out and it could possibly
come<00:02:59.920> through<00:03:00.100> and<00:03:00.220> get<00:03:00.310> into<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.610> system<00:03:00.970> and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
come through and get into the system and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.770 
come through and get into the system and
plug<00:03:01.299> up<00:03:01.329> a<00:03:01.570> faucet<00:03:01.989> or<00:03:02.019> something<00:03:02.350> like<00:03:02.470> that

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
that doesn't have to be very tight just

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.490 
that doesn't have to be very tight just
long<00:03:09.210> as<00:03:09.300> it'll<00:03:09.480> say<00:03:09.630> on<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:11.030> okay<00:03:12.320> first<00:03:13.320> of

it once the heads back on but if you put
the<00:05:01.220> water<00:05:01.370> in<00:05:01.490> now<00:05:01.759> it<00:05:02.060> saves<00:05:02.270> you<00:05:02.389> problems

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
the water in now it saves you problems

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.520 
the water in now it saves you problems
later<00:05:02.930> on<00:05:04.180> new<00:05:05.180> resin<00:05:05.599> will<00:05:06.080> have<00:05:06.259> to<00:05:06.409> be

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
later on new resin will have to be

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.689 
later on new resin will have to be
backwashed<00:05:07.039> thoroughly<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:08.870> then<00:05:09.050> rinse

for a few minutes that way three to five
minutes<00:06:32.560> should<00:06:32.650> we<00:06:32.800> find<00:06:33.150> then<00:06:34.150> turn<00:06:34.419> it

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
minutes should we find then turn it

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.810 
minutes should we find then turn it

around to a forward rinse that would be

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.580 
around to a forward rinse that would be
over<00:06:40.060> here<00:06:40.090> just<00:06:40.840> before<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.260> end<00:06:41.410> of<00:06:41.470> the

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
little bit that way then you can put it

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.610 
little bit that way then you can put it
in<00:06:48.340> service<00:06:48.700> when<00:06:49.600> you<00:06:49.750> put<00:06:49.930> it<00:06:50.020> in<00:06:50.140> service
