be a different animal but you know
that's<00:01:36.150> that's<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.100> nature<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
that's that's that that nature of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.330 
that's that's that that nature of
covering<00:01:39.780> sport<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.770> feel

covering sport you know you just feel
this<00:01:41.549> need<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.899> first<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.409> or<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
this need to be the first one or the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.300 
this need to be the first one or the
best<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.270> most<00:01:45.390> outrageous<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:46.310> but

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
best one or the most outrageous one but

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.330 
best one or the most outrageous one but
that<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.549> was<00:01:47.729> way<00:01:48.060> over<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.540> yeah<00:01:49.350> i<00:01:49.380> agree<00:01:49.920> i

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
that one was way over one yeah i agree i

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.100 
that one was way over one yeah i agree i
think<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.820> other<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.240> will<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.899> here

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
think the other thing that will see here

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.510 
think the other thing that will see here
is<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.770> freezing<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.369> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
is a kind of a freezing of that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.429 
is a kind of a freezing of that
relationship<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.720> probably<00:01:54.930> won't<00:01:55.350> be

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
relationship and it probably won't be

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.709 
relationship and it probably won't be
