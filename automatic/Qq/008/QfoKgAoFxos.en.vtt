hey everybody I'm here today to show you
how<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.360> bundle<00:00:04.230> wood<00:00:04.710> whore<00:00:05.279> branches<00:00:06.210> with

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
how to bundle wood whore branches with

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.890 
how to bundle wood whore branches with
rope<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:08.130> what<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> have<00:00:08.519> here<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:09.000> about<00:00:09.420> 12

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
rope so what I have here is about 12

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.070 
rope so what I have here is about 12
feet<00:00:10.500> give<00:00:10.920> or<00:00:10.950> take<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.460> rope<00:00:12.330> okay<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:12.990> I'm

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
feet give or take of rope okay and I'm

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.930 
feet give or take of rope okay and I'm
going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.349> using<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.799> rope<00:00:14.460> right<00:00:14.639> here

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
going to be using this rope right here

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.019 
going to be using this rope right here
to<00:00:15.360> bundle<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.900> branches<00:00:16.560> up<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.910> know

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
to bundle the branches up that you know

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.019 
to bundle the branches up that you know
have<00:00:18.180> fallen<00:00:18.510> from<00:00:18.869> me<00:00:19.170> trimming<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.949> tree<00:00:20.029> so

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
have fallen from me trimming a tree so

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.900 
have fallen from me trimming a tree so
the<00:00:21.150> first<00:00:21.390> step<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.260> get<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.220> end<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
the first step is to get one end of the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.450 
the first step is to get one end of the
rope<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.269> you're<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> sort<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.160> make<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
rope and you're going to sort of make a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609 
rope and you're going to sort of make a
loop<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.230> come<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
loop with it so I'm going to go come a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.589 
loop with it so I'm going to go come a
little<00:00:28.800> bit<00:00:28.980> closer<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> camera<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.420> allow

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
little bit closer to the camera to allow

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.930 
little bit closer to the camera to allow
you<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:31.019> exactly<00:00:31.410> what<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.099> am<00:00:32.399> doing<00:00:32.430> so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
you to see exactly what I am doing so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630 
you to see exactly what I am doing so
basically<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:35.160> end<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
basically I have this this end of the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
basically I have this this end of the
rope<00:00:35.820> right<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.239> I'm<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> take<00:00:37.140> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
rope right here I'm going to take it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.619 
rope right here I'm going to take it
just<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.280> I'm<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> tie<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
just like that and I'm going to tie a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.959 
just like that and I'm going to tie a
knot<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.920> okay<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
knot just like that okay so I have a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.610 
knot just like that okay so I have a
knot<00:00:42.180> right<00:00:42.210> there<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:43.110> I'm<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> tie

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
knot right there then I'm going to tie

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.520 
knot right there then I'm going to tie
one<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.160> knot<00:00:44.399> over<00:00:45.000> top<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.320> previous

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
one more knot over top of the previous

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.500 
one more knot over top of the previous
not<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:49.070> that<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:51.030> let<00:00:51.210> me<00:00:51.300> try<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
not just like that just let me try that

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
not just like that just let me try that
one<00:00:51.660> more<00:00:51.809> time<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.590> hang<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> tie<00:00:53.129> one

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
one more time the hang of it tie one

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
one more time the hang of it tie one
more<00:00:53.579> knot<00:00:53.760> over<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.239> previous<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:54.870> just

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
more knot over the previous not just

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.560 
more knot over the previous not just
like<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.710> okay<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
like that okay and then I'm going to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.470 
like that okay and then I'm going to
hold<00:00:57.870> my<00:00:58.500> fingers<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.699> loop<00:00:59.910> right<00:01:00.180> there

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
hold my fingers in the loop right there

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.229 
hold my fingers in the loop right there
well<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> tighten<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:02.820> just

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
well I tighten this up right here just

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.690 
well I tighten this up right here just
like<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.809> okay<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:05.010> pretty<00:01:05.610> much

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
like that okay so now I have pretty much

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.690 
like that okay so now I have pretty much
a<00:01:06.420> loop<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.380> lasso<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> guess<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.430> looks<00:01:08.460> like

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
a loop or lasso I guess it looks like

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.310 
a loop or lasso I guess it looks like
right<00:01:09.479> over<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:09.930> I'm<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
right over there I'm just going to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.840 
right over there I'm just going to
tighten<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.860> more<00:01:11.010> time<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.729> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
tighten it one more time and if you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.820 
tighten it one more time and if you
really<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.540> secure<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.619> choose

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
really want to be secure you can choose

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.760 
really want to be secure you can choose
to<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> third<00:01:14.460> knot<00:01:14.700> okay<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.930> second

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
to do a third knot okay this this second

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620 
to do a third knot okay this this second
knot<00:01:16.890> isn't<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.340> holding<00:01:17.670> well<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.509> I'm

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
knot isn't really holding well so I'm

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.530 
knot isn't really holding well so I'm
going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> tie<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.710> knot<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.909> like

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
going to tie one more knot just like

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.109 
going to tie one more knot just like
that<00:01:22.170> okay<00:01:22.799> alright<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:23.520> we're<00:01:23.820> good<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> go

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that okay alright now we're good to go

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.780 
that okay alright now we're good to go
so<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.140> my<00:01:25.380> little<00:01:25.830> loop<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.189> there<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so I have my little loop right there and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
so I have my little loop right there and
then<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.689> I'm<00:01:27.810> gonna

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.370 
then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
wing<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.619> piece<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.700> rope<00:01:30.119> along<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.079> floor

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
wing this piece of rope along the floor

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.280 
wing this piece of rope along the floor
right<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.040> okay<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.420> literally

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
right here okay just like that literally

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.719 
right here okay just like that literally
just<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.220> I'm<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.579> go

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
just like that and then I'm going to go

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.569 
just like that and then I'm going to go
gather<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.299> my<00:01:36.450> branches<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.770> am<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
gather all my branches and I am going to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.810 
gather all my branches and I am going to
lay<00:01:39.180> them<00:01:39.450> sort<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:41.100> opposite<00:01:41.610> way<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
lay them sort of the opposite way that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.340 
lay them sort of the opposite way that
the<00:01:42.150> loop<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.479> laying<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> floor<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.259> I'm

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
the loop is laying on the floor so I'm

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
the loop is laying on the floor so I'm
going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> gather<00:01:43.649> my<00:01:43.890> branches<00:01:44.369> I'll<00:01:44.790> lay

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
going to gather my branches I'll lay

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
going to gather my branches I'll lay
them<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> small<00:01:45.659> pile<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.560> going

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
them in a small pile right here going

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.789 
them in a small pile right here going
this<00:01:47.939> way<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> direction<00:01:48.960> okay<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.710> I'm

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
this way in this direction okay so I'm

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
this way in this direction okay so I'm
going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:49.979> head<00:01:50.130> outside<00:01:50.280> gather<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.149> branches

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
going to head outside gather my branches

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.179 
going to head outside gather my branches
I<00:01:51.689> mean<00:01:51.840> we'll<00:01:51.990> leave<00:01:52.229> them<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.950> rope

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
I mean we'll leave them on the rope

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:03.510 
I mean we'll leave them on the rope
right<00:01:53.579> here

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.980 

you

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.630 

all<00:02:11.990> right<00:02:12.320> so<00:02:12.560> as<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.980> can<00:02:13.130> see<00:02:13.190> I've<00:02:13.610> taken

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
all right so as you can see I've taken

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.810 
all right so as you can see I've taken
these<00:02:14.330> tree<00:02:14.990> branches<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.830> I've<00:02:16.250> laid<00:02:16.580> them

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
these tree branches and I've laid them

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.210 
these tree branches and I've laid them
overtop<00:02:17.570> of<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.870> rope<00:02:17.960> sort<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.130> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
overtop of the rope sort of in the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.550 
overtop of the rope sort of in the
opposite<00:02:19.730> direction<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.780> Rope<00:02:20.990> okay<00:02:21.320> and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
opposite direction of the Rope okay and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.440 
opposite direction of the Rope okay and
I'm<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.220> take<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.730> side<00:02:23.060> right<00:02:23.270> here

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
I'm going to take this side right here

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.660 
I'm going to take this side right here
which<00:02:23.600> has<00:02:23.630> that<00:02:24.140> little<00:02:24.350> lasso<00:02:25.040> on<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.490> that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
which has that little lasso on it that

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.060 
which has that little lasso on it that
little<00:02:25.850> loop<00:02:26.660> right<00:02:26.959> there<00:02:26.990> okay<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.709> I'm

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
little loop right there okay and I'm

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.650 
little loop right there okay and I'm
going<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.220> take<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> opposite<00:02:29.120> side<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
going to take the opposite side of the

roll all the way down here reach out so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.870 
roll all the way down here reach out so
here's<00:02:32.870> one<00:02:33.110> side<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.400> rope<00:02:34.610> with<00:02:34.850> the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
here's one side of the rope with the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.000 
here's one side of the rope with the
hoop<00:02:35.330> here's<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.170> opposite<00:02:36.560> side<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.800> the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
Rope with sort of the bare end okay I'm

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.860 
Rope with sort of the bare end okay I'm
going<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> place<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.490> bare<00:02:40.730> end<00:02:41.000> through<00:02:41.660> that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
going to place the bare end through that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.180 
going to place the bare end through that
loop<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.320> I'm<00:02:42.680> going<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.860> pull<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.070> through

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
loop and I'm going to pull it through

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.240 
loop and I'm going to pull it through
all<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:44.300> way<00:02:44.330> okay<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:45.470> what<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:45.830> will<00:02:45.890> do

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
all the way okay now what this will do

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.740 
all the way okay now what this will do
is<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.850> will<00:02:46.910> sort<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.860> wrap<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:49.160> tight<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:50.570> will

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
is it will sort of wrap a tight it will

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.690 
is it will sort of wrap a tight it will
wrap<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.140> tight<00:02:51.380> hold<00:02:51.620> around<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.280> branches

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
wrap a tight hold around the branches

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.640 
wrap a tight hold around the branches
okay<00:02:52.970> as<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:53.180> see<00:02:53.330> it's<00:02:54.050> tightening<00:02:54.470> them

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
okay as you can see it's tightening them

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.460 
okay as you can see it's tightening them
down<00:02:54.680> now<00:02:55.520> okay<00:02:56.239> I'm<00:02:56.720> going<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.080> take<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
down now okay I'm going to take the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.380 
down now okay I'm going to take the
branches<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.250> bundle<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.820> branches<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.300> I'm

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
branches the bundle of branches and I'm

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.940 
branches the bundle of branches and I'm
going<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.570> sort<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.810> try<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.080> roll<00:03:00.440> them<00:03:00.680> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
going to sort of try and roll them and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.920 
going to sort of try and roll them and
as<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.790> roll<00:03:02.060> them<00:03:02.239> I'm<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.660> continue

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
as I roll them I'm going to continue

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.560 
as I roll them I'm going to continue
wrapping<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.739> rope<00:03:03.980> around<00:03:04.220> them<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:05.180> sort<00:03:05.480> of

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
wrapping the rope around them so sort of

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.680 
wrapping the rope around them so sort of
a<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:06.739> easy<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.340> do<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.910> do<00:03:08.090> once<00:03:08.360> you've<00:03:08.510> done

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
a it's easy to do to do once you've done

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.420 
a it's easy to do to do once you've done
it<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.900> few<00:03:08.930> times<00:03:09.260> but<00:03:09.920> you're<00:03:10.040> going<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.220> take

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
it a few times but you're going to take

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.280 
it a few times but you're going to take
the<00:03:10.580> branches<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.239> bundle<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.750> branches<00:03:12.140> and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
the branches the bundle of branches and

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.170 
the branches the bundle of branches and
you're<00:03:12.590> going<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:12.770> sort<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.070> roll<00:03:13.670> them<00:03:13.940> over

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
you're going to sort of roll them over

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.789 
you're going to sort of roll them over
okay<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.870> as<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.170> roll<00:03:15.380> them<00:03:15.560> at<00:03:15.709> the

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
okay and as you roll them at the

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.160 
okay and as you roll them at the
beginning<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.400> will<00:03:16.820> simply<00:03:17.450> tighten<00:03:17.870> up<00:03:17.959> the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
beginning it will simply tighten up the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.350 
beginning it will simply tighten up the
bundle<00:03:18.590> with<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.920> rope<00:03:19.130> but<00:03:19.730> then<00:03:19.790> once<00:03:20.150> it's

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
bundle with the rope but then once it's

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.020 
bundle with the rope but then once it's
tight<00:03:20.570> enough<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.080> can<00:03:21.530> actually<00:03:21.799> wrap<00:03:22.700> the

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
tight enough you can actually wrap the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.270 
tight enough you can actually wrap the
rope<00:03:23.239> around<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:23.780> now<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.110> can<00:03:24.320> see<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.769> am

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
rope around so now as you can see I am

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.449 
rope around so now as you can see I am
wrapping<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.150> rope<00:03:26.420> around<00:03:27.230> this<00:03:27.920> bundle<00:03:28.400> of

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
wrapping the rope around this bundle of

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.590 
wrapping the rope around this bundle of
branches<00:03:28.910> I'm<00:03:29.000> just<00:03:29.150> going<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.330> move<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.480> a

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
branches I'm just going to move it a

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.570 
branches I'm just going to move it a
little<00:03:29.630> bit<00:03:29.900> further<00:03:30.230> up<00:03:30.350> here<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.280> sort<00:03:31.459> of

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
little bit further up here to sort of

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.449 
little bit further up here to sort of
Center<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.150> little<00:03:32.420> bit<00:03:32.570> more<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.260> now<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.769> can

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
Center it a little bit more so now I can

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.000 
Center it a little bit more so now I can
take<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.850> rope<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.470> continually<00:03:36.470> wrap<00:03:36.830> it

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
take the rope and continually wrap it

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.690 
take the rope and continually wrap it
around<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.489> like<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.790> sort<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.350> make<00:03:39.350> my<00:03:39.500> way

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.180 
around and I like to sort of make my way
throw<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.880> middle<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:42.200> bundle<00:03:42.829> branches

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
throw the middle of the bundle branches

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.949 
throw the middle of the bundle branches
I<00:03:43.310> don't<00:03:43.459> like<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.700> only<00:03:43.910> overlap<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.690> rope<00:03:44.840> I

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
I don't like to only overlap the rope I

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.319 
I don't like to only overlap the rope I
sort<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.350> move<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.130> around<00:03:46.250> in<00:03:46.640> like<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:46.790> six<00:03:47.120> AG

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
sort of move it around in like a six AG

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.949 
sort of move it around in like a six AG
pattern<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.070> keep<00:03:49.480> wrapping<00:03:50.480> the

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
pattern so I you to keep wrapping the

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.650 
pattern so I you to keep wrapping the
ropes<00:03:51.470> around<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:52.130> bundle<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.549> branches<00:03:53.030> as<00:03:53.180> I

ropes around the bundle of branches as I
turn<00:03:53.930> them<00:03:54.140> just<00:03:54.440> like<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.970> you're

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
turn them just like that and you're

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.509 
turn them just like that and you're
going<00:03:56.329> to<00:03:56.420> keep<00:03:56.630> going<00:03:56.870> until<00:03:57.110> you<00:03:57.380> use<00:03:57.560> all<00:03:58.100> of

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
going to keep going until you use all of

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.670 
going to keep going until you use all of
the<00:03:58.670> rules<00:03:58.880> that<00:03:59.030> you<00:03:59.120> want<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.870> for<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:00.350> once

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
the rules that you want it for this once

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.280 
the rules that you want it for this once
again<00:04:00.920> I<00:04:01.010> have<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.190> boat<00:04:01.400> 12<00:04:01.579> feet<00:04:02.030> give<00:04:02.959> or<00:04:02.989> take

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
again I have a boat 12 feet give or take

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.870 
again I have a boat 12 feet give or take
it's<00:04:03.560> just<00:04:03.799> an<00:04:03.920> estimate<00:04:04.430> okay

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
it's just an estimate okay

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.120 
it's just an estimate okay
and<00:04:05.750> keep<00:04:06.440> going<00:04:07.540> around<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.810> around<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.410> as

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
and keep going around and around and as

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.500 
and keep going around and around and as
you<00:04:10.280> go<00:04:10.400> around<00:04:10.549> run<00:04:10.940> you're<00:04:11.150> sort<00:04:11.450> of

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
you go around run you're sort of

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.800 
you go around run you're sort of
securing<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:13.489> branch<00:04:13.850> bundle<00:04:14.570> that<00:04:14.690> you've

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
securing the branch bundle that you've

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.740 
securing the branch bundle that you've
created<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:16.010> just<00:04:16.370> keep<00:04:16.579> wrapping<00:04:16.850> it<00:04:17.120> around

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
created so just keep wrapping it around

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.710 
created so just keep wrapping it around
around<00:04:18.790> and<00:04:19.790> so<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.030> get<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.359> end<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.660> the

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
around and so you get the end of the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.220 
around and so you get the end of the
rope

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
rope

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.190 
rope
okay<00:04:22.130> now<00:04:23.120> I'm<00:04:23.360> at<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.600> end<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.020> rope

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
okay now I'm at the end of the rope

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.800 
okay now I'm at the end of the rope
right<00:04:24.380> here<00:04:24.580> now<00:04:25.580> I'm<00:04:25.790> going<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.090> simply<00:04:26.510> tie

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
right here now I'm going to simply tie

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.410 
right here now I'm going to simply tie
this<00:04:27.590> end<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.310> roll<00:04:28.520> onto<00:04:29.030> the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
this end of the roll onto the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.180 
this end of the roll onto the
pre-existing<00:04:30.260> rope<00:04:30.500> right<00:04:30.890> here<00:04:31.040> in<00:04:31.100> the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
pre-existing rope right here in the

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.310 
pre-existing rope right here in the
bundle<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:31.820> whatever<00:04:32.210> way<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.540> you<00:04:32.870> want<00:04:33.170> to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
bundle in whatever way that you want to

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.200 
bundle in whatever way that you want to
as<00:04:33.410> long<00:04:33.440> as<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:33.740> tie<00:04:34.040> it<00:04:34.100> on<00:04:34.370> there<00:04:34.640> it'll

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
as long as you tie it on there it'll

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.210 
as long as you tie it on there it'll
pretty<00:04:35.540> much<00:04:35.630> be<00:04:35.960> safe<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.620> if<00:04:36.920> you<00:04:37.010> haven't

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
pretty much be safe and if you haven't

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.550 
pretty much be safe and if you haven't
created<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.730> bundle<00:04:38.060> that<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.300> really<00:04:39.050> heavy<00:04:39.260> a

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
created a bundle that is really heavy a

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.560 
created a bundle that is really heavy a
really<00:04:40.160> big<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.910> want<00:04:41.090> have<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.270> worry<00:04:41.450> about

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
really big you want have to worry about

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.600 
really big you want have to worry about
that<00:04:41.810> piece<00:04:42.050> of<00:04:42.230> roll<00:04:42.440> coming<00:04:42.770> over<00:04:43.040> okay<00:04:43.250> so

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
that piece of roll coming over okay so

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.100 
that piece of roll coming over okay so
once<00:04:44.060> again<00:04:44.150> you<00:04:44.330> can<00:04:44.360> create<00:04:44.600> bundles<00:04:44.870> that

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
once again you can create bundles that

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.530 
once again you can create bundles that
are<00:04:45.260> absolutely<00:04:45.770> massive<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.580> really<00:04:47.330> heavy

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
are absolutely massive and really heavy

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.140 
are absolutely massive and really heavy
but<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:48.350> know<00:04:48.470> your<00:04:48.680> rope<00:04:48.890> might<00:04:49.160> break<00:04:49.460> it

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
but you know your rope might break it

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.420 
but you know your rope might break it
might<00:04:50.419> be<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:51.110> knots<00:04:51.350> might<00:04:51.650> come<00:04:51.860> undone<00:04:52.160> and

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
might be the knots might come undone and

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.260 
might be the knots might come undone and
so<00:04:52.730> forth

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
so forth

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.150 
so forth
so<00:04:53.780> I<00:04:53.810> like<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.080> sort<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.440> keep<00:04:54.590> my<00:04:54.770> bundles

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
so I like to sort of keep my bundles

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.540 
so I like to sort of keep my bundles
this<00:04:55.520> big<00:04:55.850> or<00:04:56.140> just<00:04:57.140> a<00:04:57.350> little<00:04:57.560> bit<00:04:57.740> bigger<00:04:58.280> and

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
this big or just a little bit bigger and

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.030 
this big or just a little bit bigger and
that's<00:04:59.300> basically<00:04:59.780> all<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.380> there<00:05:00.620> is<00:05:00.650> to<00:05:00.919> it

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
that's basically all that there is to it

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.030 
that's basically all that there is to it
this<00:05:01.250> is<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> easiest<00:05:02.030> way<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.600> bundle<00:05:03.500> up<00:05:03.710> any

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
this is the easiest way to bundle up any

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.240 
this is the easiest way to bundle up any
pieces<00:05:04.820> of<00:05:05.000> wood<00:05:05.390> or<00:05:05.660> tree<00:05:06.260> branches<00:05:06.830> using

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
pieces of wood or tree branches using

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.450 
pieces of wood or tree branches using
rope<00:05:07.669> or<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.390> can<00:05:08.540> even<00:05:08.690> actually<00:05:09.050> use<00:05:09.740> some

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
rope or you can even actually use some

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.580 
rope or you can even actually use some
twine<00:05:10.850> and<00:05:11.180> that's<00:05:11.930> all<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:12.140> have<00:05:12.320> for<00:05:12.350> you

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
twine and that's all I have for you

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.480 
twine and that's all I have for you
today<00:05:12.800> thanks<00:05:13.790> for<00:05:14.000> watching
