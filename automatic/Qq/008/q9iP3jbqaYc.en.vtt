00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
period of time of sauce I did a lot of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.230 
period of time of sauce I did a lot of
thieving<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:46.619> friend<00:01:46.920> Dan<00:01:47.130> my<00:01:48.030> friend

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
dad was actually doing a lot of mining

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.200 
dad was actually doing a lot of mining
until<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.040> convinced<00:01:50.460> him<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> finally<00:01:50.850> come<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
until I convinced him to finally come to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.420 
until I convinced him to finally come to
thieving<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.659> me<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> lot<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.250> fun

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
thieving with me and it was a lot of fun

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.050 
thieving with me and it was a lot of fun
we<00:01:53.939> did<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> much<00:01:55.320> thieving<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.979> went<00:01:56.790> all<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
we did so much thieving I went all the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.850 
we did so much thieving I went all the
way<00:01:57.090> from<00:01:57.210> level<00:01:57.659> 85<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:59.689> believe<00:02:00.689> I'm<00:02:00.869> 94<00:02:01.649> now

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
way from level 85 to believe I'm 94 now

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.580 
way from level 85 to believe I'm 94 now
so<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.329> would<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.630> done<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.020> more<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
so if if I would have done that more I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.459 
so if if I would have done that more I
probably<00:02:05.340> would<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:05.880> been<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.240> 96<00:02:06.869> 97

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
probably would have been like 96 97

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.490 
probably would have been like 96 97
maybe<00:02:08.220> even<00:02:08.489> 99<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.929> put<00:02:10.349> in

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
maybe even 99 if I really like put in

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.020 
maybe even 99 if I really like put in
the<00:02:10.649> grind<00:02:10.950> right<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> beginning<00:02:11.760> because

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the grind right in the beginning because

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.150 
the grind right in the beginning because
like<00:02:12.239> i<00:02:12.330> said<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
like i said in the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.440 
like i said in the
beginning<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.520> really<00:02:13.820> didn't<00:02:14.000> know<00:02:14.030> exactly

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
beginning I really didn't know exactly

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.510 
beginning I really didn't know exactly
what<00:02:14.600> i<00:02:14.630> wanted<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.990> do<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.800> if<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:15.980> focused<00:02:16.430> on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
bring back you know I believe there was

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.690 
bring back you know I believe there was
a<00:03:08.870> month<00:03:09.170> where<00:03:09.500> every<00:03:10.130> weekend<00:03:10.550> was

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
a month where every weekend was

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.000 
a month where every weekend was
something<00:03:11.120> where<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.690> was<00:03:11.840> like<00:03:12.020> double<00:03:12.350> XP<00:03:12.740> or

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
something where it was like double XP or

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.670 
something where it was like double XP or
double<00:03:13.340> drops<00:03:13.610> or<00:03:13.880> faster<00:03:14.300> respawn<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:15.110> think

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
double drops or faster respawn I think

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.740 
double drops or faster respawn I think
they<00:03:15.770> should<00:03:15.980> do<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.310> as<00:03:17.000> far<00:03:17.120> as<00:03:17.180> double<00:03:17.480> XP

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
they should do that as far as double XP

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.300 
they should do that as far as double XP
weekends<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.320> feel<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.800> feel<00:03:18.830> like<00:03:19.130> they<00:03:19.280> should

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310
