00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.590
 then the cake pops stick with me 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.989
 reinmachen 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.849

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.230
 best puts her on baking paper with it 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.030
 the dispatch gets and I have here 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.620
 such a small tablet for one 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.090
 few hours or overnight you have to 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.010
 the last three make the chocolate 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.080
 Melt animal for example, just one 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.480
 microwave and then you can yours 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.890
 lollis already with the chocolate 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.959
 cover will be a first for such 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.299
 spoon to help and an important tip 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.580
 Looks the bottom of something else 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.340
 That's just because of chocolate 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.049
 that raises up because I had it 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.269
 a few not covered down and then 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.190
 that's gone down so nice down too 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.170
 a little bit of chocolate a style 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.390
 then the whole thing is great and the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.160
 couverture also becomes super fast 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.630
 on the frozen bananas that is you 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.859
 then you can already snack directly or 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.959
 then just make them back in 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.299
 Gefrierfach brings out and nascht 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.650
 delicious and without a bad conscience and 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.769
 They are also made super fast 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.769
 or 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.560
 and now I have soko chips for you 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.960
 that's a great alternative to the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.730
 potato chips out of the bag and you 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.350
 can you just at the barbecue or evening 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.150
 to have a nice snack while watching tv 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.090
 and of course you need one 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.890
 zucchini and some olive oil so a to 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.750
 two tablespoons each in one whole 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.550
 zucchini just can do business 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.470
 still spices pepper salt and 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.120
 paprika powder I take there the zucchini 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.100
 cut her in as thin as possible 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.380
 slices and if you did that 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.570
 spreads her and dabbed her something 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.130
 dry that has the advantage that you 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.530
 then faster and better crispy 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.120
 being not extremely crispy 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.920
 but yes they are just chips 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.600
 similar depending on the stop again 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.280
 taste that I thought so too 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.750
 okay, the slices I give all in 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.540
 a bowl then come that 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.520
 olive oil and the spices over it me 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.740
 mix everything and then it can 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.870
 also on the baking sheet and comes in 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.810
 the preheated oven at 200 degrees 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.420
 circulates for 15 to 20 minutes but looks 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.650
 just go back and watch 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.420
 that will definitely be a lot 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.070
 much smaller so it has one now 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.810
 small portion with a helping zucchini 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.160
 given to me and if you are darker 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.900
 That's not what it does 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.940
 is one of them I have one more 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.590
 dipp made of quark and herbs and 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.239
 I hope it tastes just as good to you 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.250
 like me and now we get together 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.919
 a refreshing and fruity 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.300
 delicious watermelons chic and yes 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.680
 no big surprise to her either 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.480
 needs a watermelon 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.480
 I took a quarter here 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.820
 for two glasses then ice cubes a few 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.130
 strawberries lemon juice and if you 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.470
 would like something sweet or honey 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.610
 thick juice their millions of theirs 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.070
 comment 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.320
 in a mixer, the remaining containers 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.150
 ingredients come in here easily 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.430
 and as I said, pay attention to that 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.070
 mixa can also scratch ice and then it was 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.750
 simply puree purÃ©e and come 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.490
 still in a glass and you can do it all 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.350
 I say you enjoy it tastes like that 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.330
 nice sweet so that's really 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.040
 great if you have cravings for sweet 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.050
 and was so nice refreshing at the 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.760
 warm temperatures super delicious so yes 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.919
 try it and watermelon is 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.919
 anyway, I think that summer fruit 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.300
 and it's fruity and also 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.419
 refreshingly continue with this frozen 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.430
 strawberry yoghurt snack also a great 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.780
 alternative to the corn and also very 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.690
 done quickly you just need 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.150
 some yogurt I like to take the 15 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.520
 percent finished and then fend off 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.620
 fresher at best and a little honey if 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.880
 you want or even from dix to sweet 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.190
 if you still need some muffin 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.960
 and a muffin tin the strawberries 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.330
 will all take mashed 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.340
 there are only 23 pieces to the side 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.990
 decorating comes for the green and 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.880
 they are halved and the others 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.710
 just comes the green way then you can 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.440
 her directly into the mixer with the yogurt 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.810
 the honey and yes that was it 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.060
 already then the whole thing will be nice 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.190
 parried then I find the whole in the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.800
 muffin and not too high 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.539
 So relatively flat and then came the 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.490
 again in a muffin tin have that 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.930
 Unfortunately I did not feel it here I am 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.120
 Sorry but that makes in any case 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.740
 rather then they will not fall like that 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.030
 apart so they are totally different 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.099
 I have been there too 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.349
 So try once in the muffin 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.030
 fill the boxes too high and then 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.530
 The whole thing comes in a muffin tin and 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.900
 that makes him metal then comes into the 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.909
 freezer and if you did that 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.680
 then come up again as animals 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.810
 the strawberry on it because I found that 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.849
 just beautiful and as I said 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.130
 then for a few hours or just over 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:28.320
 freeze the night and then you have 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.759
 such tasty snacks you easy 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.740

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.150
 and can be fresh and beautiful 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.789
 snacking when you make the recipes 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.530
 then necessarily with hashtags instagram 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.969
 Incidentally, I'm posting on instagram

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.630
