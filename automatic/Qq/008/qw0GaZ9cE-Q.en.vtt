made a couple things before this uh but

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.080 
made a couple things before this uh but

I still didn't you know quite know a lot
of<00:04:18.120> technical<00:04:18.630> stuff<00:04:19.019> there<00:04:19.590> were<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.739> couple

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150

16 Batman transitive funny thing about

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.460 
16 Batman transitive funny thing about
this<00:04:28.940> scene<00:04:29.150> is<00:04:29.180> that<00:04:29.419> it<00:04:29.840> took<00:04:30.050> too<00:04:30.229> long<00:04:30.259> to

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
this scene is that it took too long to

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.260 
this scene is that it took too long to
shoot<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.949> other<00:04:30.979> stuff<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.669> so<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.210> was

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
shoot the other stuff and so it was

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.640 
shoot the other stuff and so it was
night<00:04:32.570> by<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.780> time<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.139> were<00:04:33.229> shooting<00:04:33.380> ed

night by the time we were shooting ed

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.409 
night by the time we were shooting ed
last<00:04:33.830> few<00:04:34.039> scenes<00:04:34.310> last<00:04:34.880> seen<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.120> was<00:04:35.210> fine

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
last few scenes last seen it was fine

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.610 
last few scenes last seen it was fine
because<00:04:35.600> it<00:04:35.750> took<00:04:35.840> instead<00:04:36.289> took<00:04:36.410> place

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
because it took instead took place

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.249 
because it took instead took place
inside<00:04:36.800> but<00:04:37.699> this<00:04:38.090> scene<00:04:38.479> was<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.199> know

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
inside but this scene was you know

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.140 
inside but this scene was you know
supposed<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.740> be<00:04:39.889> this<00:04:40.220> way<00:04:40.280> during<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:40.820> day

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
supposed to be this way during the day

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.920 
supposed to be this way during the day
and<00:04:41.680> outside<00:04:42.680> so<00:04:43.100> it's<00:04:43.250> super<00:04:43.639> dark<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:44.600> I

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
and outside so it's super dark and so I

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.620 
and outside so it's super dark and so I
decided<00:04:45.350> to<00:04:45.500> have<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.830> be<00:04:45.979> a<00:04:46.389> night<00:04:47.389> vision

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
decided to have it be a night vision

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.870 
decided to have it be a night vision
sort<00:04:48.259> of<00:04:48.350> scene<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:48.560> pretend<00:04:49.490> that<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.729> was<00:04:49.789> a

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
sort of scene and pretend that it was a

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.050 
sort of scene and pretend that it was a
frap<00:04:50.509> found<00:04:50.900> footage<00:04:51.340> but<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.430> had<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.729> have

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
frap found footage but I had to have

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.730 
frap found footage but I had to have
some<00:04:53.330> reason<00:04:53.600> to<00:04:53.720> have<00:04:53.840> all<00:04:54.080> Sun<00:04:54.320> be<00:04:54.500> found

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
some reason to have all Sun be found

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.320 
some reason to have all Sun be found
footage<00:04:54.979> and<00:04:55.220> so<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.400> did<00:04:55.639> this<00:04:55.729> transition

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
footage and so I did this transition

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.640 
footage and so I did this transition
with<00:04:56.509> the<00:04:56.630> two<00:04:56.750> guys<00:04:56.960> talking<00:04:57.199> about<00:04:57.440> the

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
with the two guys talking about the

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.520 
with the two guys talking about the
camera<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:59.180> then<00:04:59.330> put<00:04:59.570> camera<00:04:59.930> for<00:05:00.169> down<00:05:00.440> at

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
camera and then put camera for down at

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.439 
camera and then put camera for down at
the<00:05:00.650> bottom<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:01.190> think<00:05:01.759> it<00:05:01.849> worked<00:05:02.030> pretty<00:05:02.150> well

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
the bottom I think it worked pretty well

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.080 
the bottom I think it worked pretty well
it<00:05:02.780> didn't<00:05:02.960> work<00:05:03.080> great<00:05:03.440> but<00:05:03.680> as<00:05:04.160> least<00:05:04.699> fun

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
it didn't work great but as least fun

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.400 
it didn't work great but as least fun
and<00:05:05.410> understandable<00:05:07.810> when<00:05:08.810> I<00:05:08.840> got<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.289> this

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
and understandable when I got to this

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.070 
and understandable when I got to this
this<00:05:09.860> scene<00:05:10.130> I<00:05:10.160> had<00:05:10.460> no<00:05:10.669> idea<00:05:10.699> how<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.570> induced

was thinking about addressing the fact
that<00:06:52.180> the<00:06:52.360> first<00:06:52.570> episode<00:06:52.930> wasn't<00:06:53.110> going<00:06:53.410> to

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
that the first episode wasn't going to

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.650
