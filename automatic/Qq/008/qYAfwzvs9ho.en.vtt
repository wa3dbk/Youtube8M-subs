00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.990
 that you ask I come back in this 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:17.730
 video shift normally it should 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.680
 to be the second week video but hey 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.130
 the problem is that you know I had 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.110
 mounting problems and in the end the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 video I made the second week 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.160
 she went to the trash so I 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.020
 am a little disgusted happily 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.030
 that I took the photos because when 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.249
 I will reach with the four weeks in 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.269
 do I will put you the pictures for 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:38.070
 see the evolution 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.559
 so I come back to talk to you about the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.760
 Caudalie serum anti tasks with viny 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.859
 2002 ferry in and the olive squalane 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.620
 So here is a serum that goes 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.960
 correct but not remove your tasks which 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.569
 will brighten your complexion and make you 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.339
 achieved a lot more radiant then 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.909
 I said in my old brice 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.179
 video the one who went to the trash 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:05.129
 that this serum you have been several to 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.890
 tell me sandrine what are you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.610
 put as a foundation because you 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.979
 find my bright complexion and there I you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:21.149
 said ah ah ah that's the first 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:26.009
 week I saw that my skin texture 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:28.320
 it's a little refined but as 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.920
 it is a care to standardize 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.270
 thyme I noticed that the second 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.640
 week so the video where I should have 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.469
 you post I found that mountain 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.859
 was much brighter and there in 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.060
 same time as you told me 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.159
 so here is normally I should 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.869
 to be in the third week so I 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.869
 am for me in the third week 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.340
 I find that my tasks then I 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.840
 think of having others that will appear 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.549
 because it's not like I told you 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.409
 vieillesses task of de jure state 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.749
 sun me it's the threat mass is due 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.140
 to my pill but I saw that my tasks 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:06.179
 have faded anyway so when 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.700
 they say that it actually corrects 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.259
 and my complexion then there hello not 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.849
 makeup hair not coiffés 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.290
 I do not like it yet I'm washed 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.799
 but not at the level of the face because 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.150
 that i do that close you see i have 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.799
 left yesterday I got up that does not 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.510
 for a long time I have not had lunch yet 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.950
 I make you the video to larache and so 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.659
 yes I told you I see when 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.390
 even a little difference 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:35.280
 so I do not know there we still see 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.950
 my tasks what bothers me 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.840
 during the make-up does not even know to have 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.109
 my tasks because I'm used to it's at 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.640
 level of bluff because when you 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:49.019
 look at the color of my skin 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.310
 there you see a good claims the dish 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.700
 neck skin she is still more 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.909
 white 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.030
 look at the depigmentation I have there 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.400
 it's a vain 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.370
 you see the depigmentation up 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.889
 look there all the voices there and there the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.769
 front it goes away anyway that 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:10.829
 it's really good to correct so I 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.269
 you said I can not put any 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.900
 clear blush because actually I have a 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.599
 clear skin 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.389
 but with my tasks I move to a skin 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.910
 medium I am obliged to put myself the 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.120
 tints in beige beige foundation 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.299
 medium of yellow not rosé and blush 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.000
 I can not even put on a pink blush 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.370
 clear it's impossible or jean lemaître 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.459
 brown coral or a little pink 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.109
 more peculiar fades 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.020
 it puffs me up what it's like red to 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.180
 lips or game 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.040
 I can not put nude is 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.810
 impossible I can put that news wood 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.010
 it's all a disaster 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.940
 it's just when you know it 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.530
 you get used to it but this little serum the same 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.210
 if I know he will not remove the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.310
 spots I know he's going but corrected 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.140
 so I would really really 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.700
 curious because we have several 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.700
 task styles like I told you 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.500
 for sun spots to me I know 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.980
 that my sister had used it with 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.460
 the other product it was due to create the mail 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.580
 to this crime I believe and is 7 am these are 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.680
 really faded so it works well on 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.350
 sun spots on the tasks of 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.650
 old age know I could not you 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.030
 say 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.230
 Finally, I could tell you 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.130
 bullshit to please or say 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.230
 yeah that's a good product 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.230
 No, I do not know, I simply 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.150
 know that this product illuminates my skin 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.070
 and corrects me after three weeks 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.350
 I still see a difference 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.650
 after that it's a product that a certain 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.570
 blow it still costs 44 euros you 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.950
 you do not need any more 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.840
 put a lot I showed you in 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.960
 the first video that I will put back the 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.890
 link in info bar 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:57.610
 so after that is you little trick you 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.850
 have the opportunity to see it less 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.220
 dear how for those who command 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.740
 then there are two things the first thing 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.450
 you have going through the igraal website 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.000
 where you have my link in info bar 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.490
 for you sponsor it's not for you 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.020
 give my pussy all that just for 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.690
 good plans where you can have 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.960
 cash back on you have the thousand site 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.400
 and a pharmacy or drugstore I 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.919
 do not know so you will be able to arrive 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.350
 to find cheaper surely than 44 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.590
 euros i will look i will put you that 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.690
 in info bar with the direct link and 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.760
 for that you will register on the site 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.310
 igraal was taking my referral code and 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.830
 you will already have a euro when you 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.950
 go install the bar 3 euros then 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.990
 and more cash back after notice on your 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.220
 products you 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:50.580
 and order via this site already so the 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.160
 second solution for those who are 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.810
 that they have a leclerc and u do 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.910
 drugstore at leclerc 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.240
 you know that loyalty cards from 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.690
 leclerc one earns money on it but 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.020
 care products caudalie I was reading 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.610
 always buy with my cage mac of my 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.970
 map of chez leclerc 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.260
 now I know that I order too 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.350
 to have cashback via the site 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.450
 igraal but if we can also have a 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.550
 little better I advise you that you 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.770
 do your shopping at god to deduce to 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.810
 your case I do not 10 euros 5 euros 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.480
 keep them and when you go to the 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.160
 drugstore if you want to test at 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.440
 lower cost so half would not it 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.990
 that 20 euros 26 euros is like that 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.540
 I had my serum ssd altering which 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.060
 is possible early for the skins that are 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.450
 not hydrate who lack of 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.670
 so nourishing food and this serum 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.960
 help really perfect the sos of 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.510
 actors in caudalie it is really 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.860
 great for all skin types even for 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.000
 the skin through knowing that a skin 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.620
 not fat because you have oily skin 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.230
 that she does not need to be fed 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.420
 failed titles that's nothing to see it's 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.630
 completely different things but 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.720
 there this serum frankly me I tell you 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.700
 I see the difference in my level 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.340
 dyed at the level of my skin texture at 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:12.300
 level of light 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.650
 that yes a montain uniformity and that's it 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.350
 so after will I be 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:19.260
 continue I do not know because 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.240
 frankly at the level of my tasks that 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.580
 will stay for the moment and it bothers me 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.620
 now no longer simply 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.300
 it's caudalie I like 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.620
 the opportunity to test it 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:34.170
 so here on this I leave you if you 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.590
 have questions below the bar
