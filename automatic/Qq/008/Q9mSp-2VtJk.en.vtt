swing is a tendency to pick the club up
and<00:00:21.679> get<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:22.730> net<00:00:22.939> get<00:00:23.269> a<00:00:23.300> very<00:00:23.599> narrow<00:00:23.900> arc

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
and get the net get a very narrow arc

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.560 
and get the net get a very narrow arc
with<00:00:24.470> not<00:00:24.650> much<00:00:24.859> turn<00:00:25.250> notice<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.119> distance

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
with not much turn notice the distance

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.349 
with not much turn notice the distance
between<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:27.199> shaft<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:27.830> the<00:00:27.949> shoulder<00:00:28.400> what

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
between the shaft and the shoulder what

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.359 
between the shaft and the shoulder what
we<00:00:29.480> really<00:00:29.810> want<00:00:30.019> to<00:00:30.109> do<00:00:30.289> is<00:00:30.650> try<00:00:30.919> to<00:00:30.949> get<00:00:31.160> that

left side as far away from our target as
we<00:00:34.340> can<00:00:34.610> so<00:00:35.480> now<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:35.750> notice<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.440> distance

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
we can so now you notice the distance

power<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:20.840> way<00:01:21.049> so<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.799> dig<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:22.430> with<00:01:22.610> the

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
power that way so you dig in with the

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.940 
power that way so you dig in with the

inside of that leg keep your left neck
against<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.640> wall<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.320> there<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:27.500> go<00:01:27.619> nice

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
against the wall and there you go nice

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.700 
against the wall and there you go nice
and<00:01:28.130> wide<00:01:28.570> now<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.630> third<00:01:30.020> one<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:30.500> perhaps

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
and wide now the third one and perhaps

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.639 
and wide now the third one and perhaps
most<00:01:31.189> important<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.150> elbow<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:33.409> never

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
most important is this elbow you never

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.679 
most important is this elbow you never
want<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.040> let<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.430> elbow<00:01:34.850> feel<00:01:35.149> like<00:01:35.479> it

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.530 
disconnects from the left side of your
body<00:01:38.680> so<00:01:39.680> as<00:01:39.829> your<00:01:40.070> body<00:01:40.280> turns<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.149> elbow

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
body so as your body turns the elbow

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.859 
body so as your body turns the elbow
folds<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.610> stays<00:01:43.610> right<00:01:44.090> with<00:01:44.420> your<00:01:44.659> body

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
folds and stays right with your body

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.170 
folds and stays right with your body
don't<00:01:45.530> let<00:01:45.770> your<00:01:45.950> arms<00:01:46.310> stay<00:01:46.549> straight<00:01:46.579> and<00:01:47.090> go

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
don't let your arms stay straight and go

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.139 
don't let your arms stay straight and go
out<00:01:47.329> there<00:01:47.630> let<00:01:48.350> your<00:01:48.530> elbow<00:01:48.920> fold<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.670> stay

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
out there let your elbow fold and stay

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.969 
out there let your elbow fold and stay
connected<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.079> left<00:01:51.259> side<00:01:51.530> of<00:01:51.680> your<00:01:51.710> body

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
connected to the left side of your body

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.399 
connected to the left side of your body
so<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:52.490> would<00:01:52.640> look<00:01:52.790> like<00:01:52.850> this<00:01:53.360> as<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:54.170> left

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
so it would look like this as the left

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.190 
so it would look like this as the left
side<00:01:54.710> goes<00:01:55.009> wide<00:01:55.390> keeping<00:01:56.390> your<00:01:56.540> neck<00:01:56.719> against

side goes wide keeping your neck against
the<00:01:57.320> ball<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.829> your<00:01:57.950> right<00:01:58.130> thigh<00:01:58.460> in<00:01:58.790> that

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
the ball and your right thigh in that

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.499 
the ball and your right thigh in that
