00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.560
 I want myself 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.160
 hello, good friends, once I'm not going to 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.800
 explain how to install the 465 I'm going to 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.310
 bring an update for 465 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.809
 rebus a spot that the partner has taken 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.870
 my partner called esker your link 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.879
 from page 13 4 hacker that he 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.309
 the owner of the page had gone up 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 uploaded a spoof that had taken him 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.949
 a good rebujo this is not a tutorial 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.300
 I just want to show you how 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.970
 do it that in principle is better than 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.010
 even the one of the dragon that does not 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.010
 he did more than give for sack 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.140
 I'm not convinced by the custom firmware 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.670
 from the Dragon 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.470
 I think that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.220
 This custom firmware is much more 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.440
 complete fine let's see in principle 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.870
 we all know that this descent 355 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.920
 install again on bus 4 65.2 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.260
 important I'll leave it on the page 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.540
 merkel dotcom in the update and the 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:31.600
 spu I will leave it in application is well 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:33.430
 important to download rebus 4 65.2 the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.610
 point point point 1 you get the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.470
 player who is point 2 well once 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.260
 that we installed it we all know how to go 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.480
 to urge paxil and install the tul box and 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.350
 we have to take into account the following 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.350
 configuration 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.359
 once we get inside 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 information if this information, 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.049
 we put in we see that we have to be the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.929
 kernel has to be in dex and the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.960
 target type has to be in dex 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:03.130
 important 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.300
 the rest we go back out 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.130
 remember that if you put adex 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.810
 what I said to skype or do them 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.940
 comments to fix it but it has 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.630
 to be in dex index to be able 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.960
 install it worth it we give it to 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.960
 behind 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.459
 and we get 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.519
 the system of exist modes has to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.319
 be normal you do not have to put the 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.710
 Normal gleaning has to be normal 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.110
 as it puts here 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.910
 so that we are not asked for the good play 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.070
 once this is just going to 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.620
 back we give to Kuyt and we get the 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.890
 system to partner we are now with the 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.640
 lester touring companion 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.709
 of pc 4 hacker thanks to some files 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.330
 that has passed the by monster good the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.400
 second part of recording so we're going 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.480
 to do with him because he has been giving 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.849
 a bit of 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.040
 he wants to know why he advertised his 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.500
 channel I will put your channel in the description 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.430
 please past that you also do here 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.519
 it's pretty good 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.730
 there we are restarting the console of the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.829
 so that it looks with its captor for 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.829
 to see that we are in perfect reverse 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.260
 and we are going to go as we have already given the 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.030
 spot we're going to go to make it look like 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.620
 we are in 466 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.210
 we're going system adjustment like 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.700
 Always System Information 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.450
 we will do it is normal that 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.130
 see with 1 or 2 seconds of delay there 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.569
 that understand one we 're talking about 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.489
 by skype and 2 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.590
 there we see that it is in how many is the theme 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.920
 perfect now we're going backwards he 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.900
 the air will fade with control 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.819
 with just remembering please that as 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.879
 we have left a custom firmware and we 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.829
 we see you have to reinstall the 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.340
 control because at least enter and 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.650
 give it to ok on my website is the 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.629
 download of the latest 466 compatible 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.150
 it works perfectly because we have 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.020
 already tried bullet and it has all vanished 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.340
 perfect 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.140
 Y 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.800
 Well, it's going to show us a little more 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.800
 below we are logging in 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.800
 perfect 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.620
 At first 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.940
 we wait 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.490
 what they are and want to leave us there we are 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.009
 connected 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.710
 and we see how soon the 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.270
 list of friends begin to load already without 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.790

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.780
 to put in the multi man 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.650
 what if we have not tested if the multi 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:44.380
 man I do not know which one he uses directly without 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.300
 remember to close session is just what 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.699
 that just being a partner he uses the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.319
 iris more perfect no problem I 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.319
 I particularly like the multi 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.599

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.319
 give pause so that this is not done anymore 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.340
 we see that we are with the partner 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.930

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.120

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.150
 there we are not marching infinite action 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.140

 capturing screen but good 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.080
 you know that the gta always takes a 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.390
 so little touching the noses but without 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.390
