00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.100
 hooks tv 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.710
 together with mail.ru 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.270
 I present you a review on the new light 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.000
 tank level 4 m24 chaffee he was introduced 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.470
 the game in a recent update and 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.589
 consider this car obliges me 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.769
 the debt itself is where you start 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.040
 download this thread of course it is important 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.989
 so let's go over what 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.480
 we have so good in it 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.320
 first of course this armor 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.390
 armor is here for a solid top five out of 10 then 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.940
 there is 1 2 that is, in general, it is good 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.450
 but exactly half why exactly 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.630
 when we get into fights 4 levels before us 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 there armor can save armor as thick as 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.060
 70 millimeters of the hull club logo and 75 and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.640
 forehead tower can save us there but when 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.850
 we get into the fight with the fifth and sixth 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.830
 levels there alas sadness us 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.990
 punch all well except what if they 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.580
 will shoot gun mask but of course 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.490
 this is only a matter of chance therefore 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.440
 punch you are likely to be further 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.319
 tank durability in general it is very 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.929
 strongly associated with booking and 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.179
 vitality can be put in 2 out of 10 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.599
 points why exactly yes yes because u 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.670
 tank very little hepe at up to 400 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.979
 hp like when playing with fourth 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.869
 levels are normal but high-explosive 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.560
 T-40 monsters are very strong 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.869
 annoyed 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.520
 and when you get into battle sixth 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.209
 levels here begins the most 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.160
 fun without modules on survivability you 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.789
 will die from one sneeze into your 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.179
 the side 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.920
 from some to you with a top gun 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.010
 further mobility is all at the tank 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.750
 ambiguous but good 8 out of 10 can 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.209
 feel free to bet because he is picking up 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.520
 your speed cheerfully you unfold 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.459
 smart but we have one 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.530
 a little problem is not that 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.239
 it's even a problem just a tank as if 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.520
 can only drive it faster 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.260
 artificially 1 developers limited 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.450
 that is, when he gains 50 kilometers 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.500
 an hour he abruptly drops her to 47 and 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.319
 so constantly well what we have what we have 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.230
 further on we have something else a 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.269
 it is exactly to pierce and 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.830
 these talk about gun breaking through here 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.110
 ok for level four in 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.629
 ninety eight units but she is goldie 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.480
 about 130 is enough to fight 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.819
 with opponents 5 and even win 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.010
 opponents of the sixth level certainly not 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.830
 single-handedly 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.670
 further information and stabilization here already 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.160
 everything is much worse with the institution we have 3.7 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.470
 seconds this is not young and stabilization 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.819
 also not to say that was good but 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.790
 but at the same time we have a good 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.200
 3.2 seconds recharge is great 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.599
 the problem is that between shots 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.579
 we do not have time to come down and at the same time 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.609
 so we have to constantly 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.079
 constantly somehow look for an opportunity so 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.849
 so we can get to come down 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.140
 and after that shoot it is not very 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.459
 convenient in some situations 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.260
 further damage damage everything is great 183 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.489
 one-time damage that's great 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.470
 great we can apply 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.739
 significant damage to whom only 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.099
 We want and further review probably one of 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.890
 important light tank components 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.319
 here we all say so too 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.630
 ambiguously we have seemingly not the most 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.200
 worst review worst officer about 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.419
 100 one hundred ninety three meters we have 210 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.280
 meters yes it seems not much more 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.829
 and there are cars with much more 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.819
 pleasant review take the same t-40 and y 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:07.430
 Her review is 240 meters, but there are 2 such 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.250
 problem first t-40 has an open 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.019
 felling what kind of on plus we have 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.389
 pretty good armor compared to 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.620
 that an open car while still 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:22.130
 correctly shine on the fourth levels 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.770
 quite difficult not even the problem 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.310
 that the difference is very small in radius 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.960
 review 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.169
 but simply that especially shine 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.660
 no one and no reason, and in general the game started 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.970
 and it reminded me of some such arcade 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.370
 q &amp; a after you change to 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.020
 lower levels with a dozen eights 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.440
 here it is somehow easier 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.360
 interesting fun cheerful I now moved 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.370
 ride the feeling as if you were going 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.610
 here in one direction you hit some 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.440
 there are mobs and you want to get to the main 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.539
 the boss is actually some sort of 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.300
 feeling arises when you skate on 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.129
 Chaffee 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.080
 you are such a serious uncle with a big 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.090
 with a baton, of course, not without them 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.610
 disadvantages you like as they can too 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.789
 nail but at the same time we can you very 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.129
 even painful to bite so more often 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.639
 delivers only pleasant sensations from 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.979
 games 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.659
 by the way by modules it is recommended here 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.180
 to send and to 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:17.970
 quicker to bite 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.849
 pickup drives or stabilization 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.520
 module and in doing so should be addressed for 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.139
 yourself what is more important to you is hp or accuracy 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.509
 if you are willing to sacrifice accuracy in 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.490
 name hp then put the modules on hbk 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.560
 if not ready then put the modules on 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.289
 accuracy but then be prepared for that 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.169
 that 400 400 of your stock and n will 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.330
 quite seriously noticeably miss and 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.370
 at the same time in battles you will feel it pretty 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.310
 seriously if you get with sixes to 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.229
 the same and only gold modules 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.539
 or how to call them average modules 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.879
 large modules that cost more 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.009
 only they can provide you 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.680
 required number of hit points in 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.750
 at least 750 units if you 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.479
 put both if you put 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.460
 conventional modules on hp then a maximum of 600 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.819
 units of strength you get and how we 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.009
 remember one-time damage to kvass 650 is for you 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.710
 It will not be given in general, something particularly noticeable 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.990
 gain in strength survivability in battles with 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.630
 sixes but if you want to ponagibat 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.940
 sixes then take better sixes here 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.940
 for the fourth level, the tank is great 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.020
 this is a decent start to the line I think 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.360
 will leave you only pleasant 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.490
 impressions are the same he left 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.009
 I actually own this car 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.620
 I liked it and I recommend it to everyone 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.629
 start at least try and then how 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.250
 maybe this car will go to you 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.889
 like it and you want to download a branch 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.900
 further but if not then you actually 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.460
 don't lose much just 4 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.979
 level pretty sand tank and 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.860
 actually bought a lot not even 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.990
 spent did not like sold but I 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.789
 I recommend you all to try with you 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.930
 was a circle tv together with the company 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:54.210
 mail.ru 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.479
 all bye bye see you in the fields 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.479
 battles
