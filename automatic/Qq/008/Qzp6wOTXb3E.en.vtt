00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.030
 ni 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.019
 I often tell you 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.050
 To get into sheep processing 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.790
 Not from the gate 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.790
 What comes over from other places 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.630
 It is a thief 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.630
 At the beginning 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.740
 The gatekeeper who enters from the gate is a sheep shepherd 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.020
 Also open for him 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.780
 Sheep hears his voice 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.440
 And he calls his sheep's name 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.440
 Catch fish 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:46.129
 If it is my sheep girl he will be at the top of the sheep 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.129
 Sheep is to keep up to him because it is his voice 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.240
 Other people 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.040
 It is escaped if it does not follow 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.040
 Because I do not know the voice of the person 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.850
 I am a person of sheep to be well well I tell you 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.520
 Everyone who came before me 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.270
 Thief and is not 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.270
 Be a robber 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.810
 I am a sentence 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:21.130
 Those who enter through me are saved 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.340
 You will also find the daily paper 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.539
 It is stealing that the thief comes 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.130
 Kill 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.130
 There is nothing else to destroy 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.580
 I have come to Jai of the sheep 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.580
 It is to make it rich 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.020
 I am a good shepherd 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.850
 Good shepherd's place for sheep 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.909
 If the hirer who is not a shepherd but sheep is not his own sees a wolf coming 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.390
 Let the sheep go and run away 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.640
 The wolf is inevitably by also scatter 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:06.320
 He is a hired person and does not care about sheep 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.960
 I am a good shepherd and I know my sheep 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.220
 My sheep are 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.850
 Also know me 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.850
 It is just 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.590
 It is the same as Father doing me and I doing Father 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.590
 And I give up life for the sheep 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.240
 I have also sheep fit of bad you are not in this enclosure 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:35.050
 I have to guide them They also in my love 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.520
 One will and finally obey one of 60 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.520
 Will be a single shepherd 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:47.170
 Father loves me because I give up my life, so giving up life gets it again 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.170
 Because 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.190
 Someone from me 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.190
 It's not taking it 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.209
 I ne are you doing it from their own 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.280
 I have the power to do it and also the power to receive it 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.330
 This is the rule given from my father
