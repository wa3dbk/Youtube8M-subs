00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
and green and lush we get a couple of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.950 
and green and lush we get a couple of
weeks<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.750> fairly<00:00:16.560> intense<00:00:16.980> rain<00:00:17.449> non-stop<00:00:18.449> 24

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
weeks of fairly intense rain non-stop 24

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.990 
weeks of fairly intense rain non-stop 24
hour<00:00:19.170> day<00:00:19.380> rain<00:00:19.740> for<00:00:20.070> two<00:00:20.250> weeks<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> then

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
hour day rain for two weeks and then

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.929 
hour day rain for two weeks and then
since<00:00:21.720> then<00:00:21.900> we've<00:00:22.080> had<00:00:22.640> 37<00:00:23.640> degree

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
since then we've had 37 degree

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.990 
since then we've had 37 degree
temperatures<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:25.109> about<00:00:25.289> every<00:00:25.619> day<00:00:25.800> 37<00:00:26.519> 38

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
temperatures just about every day 37 38

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.839 
temperatures just about every day 37 38
degrees<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:28.019> nice<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.439> hot<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.460> result

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
degrees so be nice and hot as a result

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.160 
degrees so be nice and hot as a result
of<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> eggs<00:00:30.539> nice<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> green<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
of that in the eggs nice and green and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:44.560 
of that in the eggs nice and green and
lush

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.990 

so<00:00:45.110> obviously<00:00:45.380> 37<00:00:46.100> degree<00:00:46.310> temperatures<00:00:46.850> you

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
so obviously 37 degree temperatures you

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.790 
so obviously 37 degree temperatures you
can<00:00:47.150> imagine<00:00:47.300> how<00:00:47.600> nice<00:00:47.780> climbing<00:00:48.470> into<00:00:48.590> that

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
can imagine how nice climbing into that

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.890 
can imagine how nice climbing into that
River<00:00:49.100> would<00:00:49.340> be<00:00:52.630> very<00:00:53.630> refreshing<00:00:55.660> let's<00:00:56.660> do

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
River would be very refreshing let's do

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:13.840 
River would be very refreshing let's do
that<00:00:57.080> shall<00:00:57.350> we

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:26.069 

you

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.050 

we're<00:01:26.799> at<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.009> center<00:01:27.219> now<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:27.579> can<00:01:27.789> see<00:01:27.969> it

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
we're at the center now you can see it

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.599 
we're at the center now you can see it
moving<00:01:28.299> it's<00:01:29.020> pretty<00:01:29.380> fast<00:01:29.679> it's<00:01:30.130> pretty<00:01:30.340> fast

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
moving it's pretty fast it's pretty fast

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.450 
moving it's pretty fast it's pretty fast
and<00:01:30.820> pretty<00:01:30.969> heavy<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.979> why<00:01:33.189> you<00:01:33.250> weren't

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
and pretty heavy that's why you weren't

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.800 
and pretty heavy that's why you weren't
seeing<00:01:33.759> people<00:01:34.119> out<00:01:34.240> there<00:01:34.420> in<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.630> middle

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
seeing people out there in the middle

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.510 
seeing people out there in the middle
our<00:01:35.110> sort<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.439> paddling<00:01:35.890> around<00:01:35.979> at<00:01:36.189> the<00:01:36.280> sides

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
our sort of paddling around at the sides

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.890 
our sort of paddling around at the sides
but<00:01:36.789> out<00:01:36.939> in<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.119> center<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.600> fairly<00:01:37.990> intense

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.690 

so<00:01:43.900> this<00:01:44.050> is<00:01:44.170> what<00:01:44.320> we<00:01:44.440> came<00:01:44.650> for<00:01:44.710> this<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.460> sort

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
so this is what we came for this is sort

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.210 
so this is what we came for this is sort
of<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:45.820> bit<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.650> traditional<00:01:47.650> way<00:01:47.830> of<00:01:47.860> fishing

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
of a bit of a traditional way of fishing

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.100 
of a bit of a traditional way of fishing
up<00:01:48.550> in<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.760> mountains<00:01:49.180> they<00:01:49.720> used<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:49.960> make

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
up in the mountains they used to make

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.610 
up in the mountains they used to make
these<00:01:50.350> ramps<00:01:50.980> of<00:01:51.130> bamboo<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.120> then<00:01:53.110> channel

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
these ramps of bamboo and then channel

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.320 
these ramps of bamboo and then channel
the<00:01:53.830> water<00:01:53.980> from<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.430> river<00:01:54.550> onto<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.090> ramp

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
the water from the river onto the ramp

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.030 
the water from the river onto the ramp
and<00:01:55.660> as<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.900> can<00:01:55.990> see<00:01:56.140> this<00:01:56.260> gap<00:01:56.530> sit<00:01:56.860> between

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
and as you can see this gap sit between

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.430 
and as you can see this gap sit between
the<00:01:57.250> bamboo<00:01:57.940> there<00:01:58.210> which<00:01:58.720> allows<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:59.200> water

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
the bamboo there which allows the water

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.910 
the bamboo there which allows the water
and<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.830> small<00:02:00.130> fish<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.520> pass<00:02:00.670> through<00:02:01.120> but

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
and the small fish to pass through but

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.320 
and the small fish to pass through but
obviously<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.040> catches<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.610> big<00:02:03.790> fish<00:02:04.030> up<00:02:04.180> on

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
obviously it catches the big fish up on

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.740 
obviously it catches the big fish up on
the<00:02:04.420> ramp<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:06.760> is<00:02:06.910> still<00:02:07.120> a<00:02:07.150> very<00:02:07.300> popular

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
the ramp so this is still a very popular

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.230 
the ramp so this is still a very popular
way<00:02:07.870> whole<00:02:08.380> villages<00:02:08.920> get<00:02:09.160> together<00:02:09.340> up<00:02:09.940> in

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
way whole villages get together up in

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.820 
way whole villages get together up in
the<00:02:10.330> mountains<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:10.899> make<00:02:11.050> these<00:02:11.230> ramps<00:02:11.680> to

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
the mountains and make these ramps to

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.660 
the mountains and make these ramps to
collect<00:02:12.070> fish<00:02:13.709> but<00:02:14.709> obviously<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.190> one's<00:02:15.459> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
collect fish but obviously this one's a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.030 
collect fish but obviously this one's a
tourist<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:16.900> tourists<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.350> come<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.800> undo

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
tourist one for tourists to come to undo

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.970 
tourist one for tourists to come to undo
it<00:02:18.100> ourselves<00:02:19.170> it's<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.320> similar<00:02:20.680> sort<00:02:20.860> of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
it ourselves it's a similar sort of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:31.050 
it ourselves it's a similar sort of
principle

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.150 

pretty<00:02:31.720> civilized<00:02:32.110> way<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.410> catch<00:02:32.650> fish<00:02:32.680> isn't

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
pretty civilized way to catch fish isn't

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.610 
pretty civilized way to catch fish isn't
that<00:02:33.810> quite<00:02:34.810> often<00:02:34.960> what<00:02:35.080> they<00:02:35.200> do<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.500> I'll

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
that quite often what they do is I'll

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.640 
that quite often what they do is I'll
actually<00:02:35.740> have<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.040> box<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.990> ramp<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.380> this

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
actually have a box and a ramp like this

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.890 
actually have a box and a ramp like this
and<00:02:38.800> I'll<00:02:38.860> over<00:02:38.980> sort<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.400> box<00:02:39.670> type<00:02:40.450> set<00:02:40.780> up

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
and I'll over sort of a box type set up

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.630 
and I'll over sort of a box type set up
so<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.290> as<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.620> fish<00:02:41.800> get<00:02:42.010> pushed<00:02:42.310> up<00:02:42.460> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
so that as the fish get pushed up the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.180 
so that as the fish get pushed up the
ramp<00:02:42.850> they<00:02:43.300> drop<00:02:43.600> into<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> box<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.980> means

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
ramp they drop into a box and that means

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.320 
ramp they drop into a box and that means
that<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.430> don't<00:02:45.520> have<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> be<00:02:45.910> there<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.180> catch

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330
