Victoria's Secret Pink they're good

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.690 
Victoria's Secret Pink they're good
quality<00:04:28.350> in<00:04:28.710> my<00:04:28.860> opinion<00:04:28.890> but<00:04:29.430> they<00:04:29.550> are

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
quality in my opinion but they are

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.330 
quality in my opinion but they are
expensive<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.500> like<00:04:31.830> something<00:04:32.190> they'll

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
expensive so I like something they'll

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.130 
expensive so I like something they'll
stand<00:04:32.640> out<00:04:32.910> more<00:04:33.150> other<00:04:33.390> than<00:04:33.480> those<00:04:33.750> shorts

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
stand out more other than those shorts

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.020 
stand out more other than those shorts
the<00:04:34.320> shorts<00:04:34.590> for<00:04:34.710> 30<00:04:34.980> but<00:04:35.460> they're<00:04:35.610> just<00:04:35.760> plain

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
the shorts for 30 but they're just plain

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.630 
the shorts for 30 but they're just plain
black<00:04:36.270> these<00:04:36.570> were<00:04:36.870> 69.95<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.490> troy

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
black these were 69.95 so the troy

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.240 
black these were 69.95 so the troy
secret<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.120> expensive<00:04:39.870> but<00:04:40.830> that's<00:04:41.040> why<00:04:41.220> I

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
secret is expensive but that's why I

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.800 
secret is expensive but that's why I
don't<00:04:41.370> like<00:04:41.640> white<00:04:41.940> because<00:04:42.270> white<00:04:42.450> can<00:04:42.690> get

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
don't like white because white can get

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.050 
don't like white because white can get
