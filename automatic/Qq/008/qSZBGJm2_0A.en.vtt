shaft feels really good and you really
can't<00:01:32.880> beat<00:01:33.090> precision<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.020> basically

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
companies in my opinion brought Warner

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
companies in my opinion brought Warner
and<00:01:41.759> all<00:01:41.850> them<00:01:42.060> brought<00:01:42.899> Warner<00:01:43.290> they<00:01:43.470> pretty

and all them brought Warner they pretty

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.969 
and all them brought Warner they pretty
much<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:45.240> cut<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.960> cut<00:01:45.990> metal<00:01:46.380> down<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.890> the

much they cut they cut metal down on the
shafts<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.520> stuff<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.030> stuff<00:01:48.689> gets<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> little

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
shafts and stuff so stuff gets a little

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.480 
shafts and stuff so stuff gets a little
bit<00:01:49.290> weaker<00:01:49.590> from<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> research<00:01:50.340> I've<00:01:50.579> done

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
bit weaker from the research I've done

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.639 
bit weaker from the research I've done
turbo<00:01:53.490> nedick's<00:01:53.820> kind<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> same<00:01:54.540> thing<00:01:54.810> so

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
turbo nedick's kind of the same thing so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
turbo nedick's kind of the same thing so
I<00:01:55.680> stick<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.040> either<00:01:56.340> precision<00:01:57.030> or<00:01:57.390> Garrett

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
I stick with either precision or Garrett

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.620 
I stick with either precision or Garrett
in<00:01:58.049> my<00:01:58.799> personal<00:01:59.280> opinion<00:01:59.399> now<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.329> being<00:02:00.540> an

entry-level turbo charger you sure
getting<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.969> nice<00:02:03.149> bang<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.659> your<00:02:03.750> buck<00:02:03.960> you're

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
getting a nice bang for your buck you're

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.590 
getting a nice bang for your buck you're
getting<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.530> billet<00:02:04.890> aluminum<00:02:05.399> wheel<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.939> it

has those lines carved into it for a
better<00:02:08.550> airflow<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.750> most<00:02:10.050> turbochargers

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
better airflow so most turbochargers

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.229 
better airflow so most turbochargers
don't<00:02:10.979> come<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.459> billet<00:02:11.879> wheel<00:02:12.060> they

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
so nice bang for the buck right there

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.270 
so nice bang for the buck right there
now<00:02:17.030> with<00:02:17.270> these<00:02:17.510> entry-level<00:02:17.990> turbos<00:02:18.620> you're

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
now with these entry-level turbos you're

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.190 
now with these entry-level turbos you're
not<00:02:19.430> gonna<00:02:19.580> quite<00:02:19.880> get<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.450> anti<00:02:20.930> surge

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
not gonna quite get the anti surge

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.400 
not gonna quite get the anti surge
compressor<00:02:21.890> housing<00:02:22.120> where<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:24.020> have<00:02:24.170> that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
compressor housing where you have that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.860 
compressor housing where you have that
extra<00:02:24.560> hole<00:02:25.430> some<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.210> them<00:02:26.330> we<00:02:26.420> got<00:02:26.540> drilled

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
extra hole some of them we got drilled

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.690 
extra hole some of them we got drilled
out<00:02:27.050> holes<00:02:27.380> or<00:02:27.830> some<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.220> them<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.460> have<00:02:28.670> a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
out holes or some of them just have a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.390 
out holes or some of them just have a
straight<00:02:29.090> couple<00:02:29.510> lines<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.160> when

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
straight couple lines in there so when

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.520 
straight couple lines in there so when
you<00:02:31.490> build<00:02:31.640> up<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.970> surge<00:02:32.240> it'll<00:02:32.660> diffuse<00:02:33.320> out

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
you build up a surge it'll diffuse out

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.040 
you build up a surge it'll diffuse out
of<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.640> don't<00:02:34.880> get<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.240> but<00:02:35.720> other

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
of that so you don't get that but other

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.870 
of that so you don't get that but other
than<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.440> these<00:02:36.740> turbos<00:02:37.190> are<00:02:37.340> really<00:02:37.700> good

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
than that these turbos are really good

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.480 
than that these turbos are really good
this<00:02:38.090> one's<00:02:38.360> rated<00:02:38.750> for<00:02:39.280> 620<00:02:40.280> wheel

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
this one's rated for 620 wheel

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.150 
this one's rated for 620 wheel
horsepower<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.900> that's<00:02:42.500> pretty<00:02:42.710> good<00:02:42.950> right

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
horsepower so that's pretty good right

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.460 
horsepower so that's pretty good right
there<00:02:43.450> comes<00:02:44.450> with<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.690> little<00:02:45.020> nipple<00:02:45.230> right

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
there comes with a little nipple right

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.320 
there comes with a little nipple right
here<00:02:45.830> for<00:02:46.250> running<00:02:46.370> your<00:02:46.700> boost<00:02:46.910> controller

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
here for running your boost controller

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.990 
here for running your boost controller
as<00:02:47.660> far<00:02:47.960> as<00:02:48.110> bolt<00:02:48.380> pattern<00:02:48.740> goes<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.730> get<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
as far as bolt pattern goes you get the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.560 
as far as bolt pattern goes you get the
regular<00:02:50.240> two<00:02:50.900> four<00:02:51.650> six<00:02:52.430> bolts<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
regular two four six bolts on the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.340 
regular two four six bolts on the
compressor<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.380> then<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.340> have<00:02:55.580> 4<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:57.230> the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
compressor and then you have 4 for the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.010 
compressor and then you have 4 for the
cartridge<00:02:57.800> right<00:02:58.010> here<00:02:58.570> so<00:02:59.570> you<00:02:59.660> get<00:02:59.780> four

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
cartridge right here so you get four

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.590 
cartridge right here so you get four
there<00:03:00.290> then<00:03:01.190> when<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.400> come<00:03:01.580> over<00:03:01.610> here<00:03:02.240> you

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
there then when you come over here you

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.370 
there then when you come over here you
got<00:03:02.660> one<00:03:02.990> two<00:03:03.260> three<00:03:03.370> four<00:03:04.370> five<00:03:04.910> six<00:03:05.270> for<00:03:06.200> the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
got one two three four five six for the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.860 
got one two three four five six for the
exhaust<00:03:06.740> housing<00:03:06.970> now<00:03:07.970> one<00:03:08.660> thing<00:03:08.810> that's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
exhaust housing now one thing that's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.320 
exhaust housing now one thing that's
nice<00:03:09.110> about<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.560> is<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.310> see<00:03:10.580> that<00:03:10.910> it's

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
nice about this is I see that it's

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.020 
nice about this is I see that it's
actually<00:03:11.960> kind<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.950> out<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:13.610> way<00:03:13.790> right

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
actually kind of out of the way right

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.400 
actually kind of out of the way right
here<00:03:14.090> they<00:03:14.390> got<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.540> little<00:03:14.840> more<00:03:14.960> clearance

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
here they got a little more clearance

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.040 
here they got a little more clearance
than<00:03:15.890> some<00:03:16.430> other<00:03:16.610> turbochargers<00:03:17.480> where

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
than some other turbochargers where

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.180 
than some other turbochargers where
you're<00:03:18.170> trying<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.470> get<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> wrench<00:03:18.860> in<00:03:19.040> there

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
you're trying to get a wrench in there

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.300 
you're trying to get a wrench in there
and<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.400> really<00:03:19.640> can't<00:03:19.910> but<00:03:21.070> just<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.190> little

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
and you really can't but just a little

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.480 
and you really can't but just a little
bit<00:03:22.550> more<00:03:22.790> not<00:03:23.000> much<00:03:23.320> now<00:03:24.320> I<00:03:24.740> said<00:03:25.010> before<00:03:25.340> they

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
bit more not much now I said before they

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.910 
bit more not much now I said before they
grind<00:03:25.760> down<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.110> exhaust<00:03:27.110> housing<00:03:27.320> which<00:03:27.740> is

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
grind down the exhaust housing which is

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.840 
grind down the exhaust housing which is
nice

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
nice

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.970 
nice
probably<00:03:29.390> sticks<00:03:29.630> up<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:30.110> lot<00:03:30.290> on<00:03:30.500> some<00:03:30.800> other

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
probably sticks up a lot on some other

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.070 
probably sticks up a lot on some other
turbochargers<00:03:31.730> but<00:03:31.970> pretty<00:03:32.630> much<00:03:32.720> that's

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
turbochargers but pretty much that's

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.780 
turbochargers but pretty much that's
just<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.500> standard<00:03:33.710> procedure<00:03:33.920> now<00:03:34.550> on<00:03:34.700> the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
just a standard procedure now on the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.720 
just a standard procedure now on the
back<00:03:34.970> here<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.720> have<00:03:35.750> your<00:03:36.020> t3<00:03:36.560> t4<00:03:36.770> flange<00:03:37.370> or

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
back here you have your t3 t4 flange or

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.920 
back here you have your t3 t4 flange or
pretty<00:03:38.330> much<00:03:38.390> t3<00:03:38.960> but<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:39.860> 282<00:03:40.630> it's<00:03:41.630> nice

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
pretty much t3 but this is 282 it's nice

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.030 
pretty much t3 but this is 282 it's nice
and<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:43.430> could<00:03:43.670> be<00:03:43.790> ported<00:03:44.240> so<00:03:45.040> porting

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
and it could be ported so porting

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.400 
and it could be ported so porting
shouldn't<00:03:46.610> be<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.760> problem<00:03:47.080> now<00:03:48.080> as<00:03:48.200> far<00:03:48.350> as

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
shouldn't be a problem now as far as

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.830 
shouldn't be a problem now as far as
warranty<00:03:48.860> goes<00:03:49.130> from<00:03:49.940> real<00:03:50.180> street<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.720> was

if I decided to weld in a 3 3 inch v ban
right<00:03:58.910> here<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.840> wouldn't<00:04:00.110> be<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.230> problem<00:04:00.500> as

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
right here that wouldn't be a problem as

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.800 
right here that wouldn't be a problem as
long<00:04:00.860> as<00:04:00.980> it's<00:04:01.160> obviously<00:04:01.520> a<00:04:01.640> decent<00:04:02.270> weld<00:04:02.450> not

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
long as it's obviously a decent weld not

won't give me any problem as far as

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.120 
won't give me any problem as far as
porting<00:04:14.480> goes<00:04:14.660> I'm<00:04:14.960> sure<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.440> same<00:04:15.680> thing<00:04:15.950> as

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
porting goes I'm sure the same thing as

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.520 
porting goes I'm sure the same thing as
long<00:04:16.310> as<00:04:16.460> it's<00:04:16.640> not<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:16.850> botched<00:04:17.600> up<00:04:17.900> chop<00:04:18.260> job

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
long as it's not a botched up chop job

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.560 
long as it's not a botched up chop job
as<00:04:18.950> long<00:04:19.130> as<00:04:19.280> it's<00:04:19.460> smooth<00:04:19.790> than<00:04:19.970> that<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.330> can

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
as long as it's smooth than that you can

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.180 
as long as it's smooth than that you can
port<00:04:20.900> it<00:04:20.989> out<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:21.410> shouldn't<00:04:21.830> have<00:04:21.950> any

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
port it out and shouldn't have any

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.490 
port it out and shouldn't have any
problems<00:04:22.640> either<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.720> that's<00:04:23.990> really<00:04:24.260> nice

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
problems either so that's really nice

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.730 
problems either so that's really nice
from<00:04:24.979> pretty

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
from pretty

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.230 
from pretty
reputable<00:04:26.039> company<00:04:26.520> now<00:04:26.729> as<00:04:26.819> far<00:04:27.000> as<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
reputable company now as far as the

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.360 
reputable company now as far as the
compressor<00:04:27.660> housing<00:04:27.780> goes<00:04:28.139> it's<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:29.190> a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
compressor housing goes it's it's a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.089 
compressor housing goes it's it's a
rough<00:04:29.759> little<00:04:30.000> cast<00:04:30.360> right<00:04:30.630> here<00:04:30.979> but<00:04:31.979> that's

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
rough little cast right here but that's

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.950 
rough little cast right here but that's
usually<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.580> way<00:04:32.729> they<00:04:33.000> all<00:04:33.150> go<00:04:33.360> unless<00:04:33.930> you

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
usually the way they all go unless you

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.200 
usually the way they all go unless you
get<00:04:34.319> into<00:04:34.500> like<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.830> high-end<00:04:35.370> $3,000

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
get into like the high-end $3,000

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.480 
get into like the high-end $3,000
turbochargers<00:04:37.160> pretty<00:04:38.160> much<00:04:38.310> any

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
turbochargers pretty much any

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.249 
turbochargers pretty much any
entry-level<00:04:39.000> turbo<00:04:39.479> is<00:04:39.569> gonna<00:04:39.720> be<00:04:39.870> like<00:04:40.050> that

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
entry-level turbo is gonna be like that

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.100 
entry-level turbo is gonna be like that
so<00:04:41.099> you<00:04:41.669> can<00:04:41.699> always<00:04:41.970> take<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.539> shop<00:04:42.810> have

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
so you can always take it to shop have

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.589 
so you can always take it to shop have
it<00:04:43.289> poured<00:04:43.979> it<00:04:44.069> out<00:04:44.190> nicely<00:04:44.490> if<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.240> decide<00:04:45.569> to

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
it poured it out nicely if you decide to

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.200 
it poured it out nicely if you decide to
but<00:04:46.050> that's<00:04:46.289> really<00:04:47.009> not<00:04:47.190> necessary<00:04:47.430> unless

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
but that's really not necessary unless

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.890 
but that's really not necessary unless
you're<00:04:48.449> going<00:04:48.750> for<00:04:49.220> every<00:04:50.220> extra<00:04:50.900> horsepower

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
you're going for every extra horsepower

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.210 
you're going for every extra horsepower
you<00:04:52.050> can<00:04:52.199> possibly<00:04:52.500> get<00:04:52.680> so<00:04:52.860> basically<00:04:53.099> we

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
you can possibly get so basically we

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.040 
you can possibly get so basically we
want<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.430> pull<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.849> down<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.210> its<00:04:54.360> price<00:04:54.660> and

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
want to pull it down to its price and

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.240 
want to pull it down to its price and
this<00:04:55.169> turbo<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:56.300> roughly<00:04:57.300> if<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:58.289> order<00:04:58.620> not

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
this turbo is roughly if you order not

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.460 
this turbo is roughly if you order not
in<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.520> same<00:04:59.729> state<00:04:59.909> which<00:05:00.690> would<00:05:00.900> be<00:05:01.020> Florida

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
in the same state which would be Florida

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.140 
in the same state which would be Florida
if<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:02.099> order<00:05:02.340> from<00:05:02.430> Florida<00:05:02.849> you're

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
if you order from Florida you're

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.180 
if you order from Florida you're
obviously<00:05:03.270> gonna<00:05:03.630> get<00:05:03.840> hit<00:05:04.020> with<00:05:04.139> 7%<00:05:04.680> sales

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
obviously gonna get hit with 7% sales

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.089 
obviously gonna get hit with 7% sales
tax<00:05:05.610> that's<00:05:06.300> where<00:05:06.509> they're<00:05:06.630> located<00:05:06.830> but<00:05:07.830> if

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
tax that's where they're located but if

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.620 
tax that's where they're located but if
you<00:05:08.220> order<00:05:08.430> outside<00:05:08.759> of<00:05:08.849> Florida<00:05:09.150> no<00:05:09.389> sales

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
you order outside of Florida no sales

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.379 
you order outside of Florida no sales
tax<00:05:09.800> 700<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:10.979> I<00:05:11.159> believe<00:05:13.880> $74<00:05:14.880> just<00:05:15.060> call<00:05:15.240> them

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
tax 700 and I believe $74 just call them

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.089 
tax 700 and I believe $74 just call them
up<00:05:15.509> tell<00:05:15.870> them<00:05:15.930> in<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.259> Fastlane<00:05:16.620> sent<00:05:16.979> you

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
up tell them in the Fastlane sent you

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.010 
up tell them in the Fastlane sent you
and<00:05:17.340> you<00:05:17.550> might<00:05:17.729> be<00:05:17.880> able<00:05:18.000> to<00:05:18.090> get<00:05:18.270> yourself<00:05:18.449> a

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
and you might be able to get yourself a

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.130 
and you might be able to get yourself a
little<00:05:19.440> bit<00:05:19.560> of<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.770> discount
