00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.820
 break from the second since in the beginning of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.550
 understood lie to understand what is 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.200
 happening next with shows 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.899
 the consequences of the rain that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.820
 affected everyone including where the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.399
 leading protagonist who is the scientist 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.489

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.650
 Tell us, we'll give it to you. 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.840
 that move for a while to place x 6 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.150
 x stay there I spoke with the front begins 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.400
 working for the owner of that company 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.530
 which is the equity to the front idol not 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.090
 I know what the lady who had the dollar 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.110
 In front of us, do you need people? 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.119
 Are you going to tell me what 's going on? 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.299
 happening things kind of bizarre going out 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.400
 You can do it by the way. 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 fix the problem and fix it and that is 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.439
 practically the basic synopsis of the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.439
 son 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.890
 I do not believe my machine has 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.990
 earned all of this 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.720
 the big balcony of the second movie is 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.790
 mixing animals with food that 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.680
 dropped on the island were mixing together if 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.740
 You're not there. It 's a kind of stuff with 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.110
 that a bug of the hour each 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.480
 the inventiveness in this staff went far 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:07.030
 fishing animals as sushi coxilha 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:13.090
 green hamburger spiders with 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.460
 Kill paws made a lot one 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.590
 and it only gets legal because 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.030
 What are you going to stay in? 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.680
 will be the next level that just wants 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.840
 now that they're going to do it, it's over 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.910
 being very cool along with a cast of 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.710
 very fun as well 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.020
 they end up kind of takes the film on the back 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.560
 because that theme will take those people 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.750
 very cool in her that votes for retirement 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.820
 But they are very funny things. 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.120
 but it does not go much further than this 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.050
 since the story well basic type 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.630
 very child-oriented 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.250
 so be prepared to quench your appetite 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.950
 hours 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:57.590
 This is a nice journey here. 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:02.020
 raining hamburger 29 she will see now 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.020
 deco is fun but will not go beyond 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.020
