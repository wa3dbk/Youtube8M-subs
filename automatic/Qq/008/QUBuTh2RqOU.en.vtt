00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
happens is when you cap a flag I could

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.949 
happens is when you cap a flag I could
get<00:02:08.580> 2,000<00:02:09.060> points<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.599> doesn't<00:02:09.840> really

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
get 2,000 points that doesn't really

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.270 
get 2,000 points that doesn't really
matter<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> points<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.069> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
however many people are dead you have to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.199 
however many people are dead you have to
cap<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> flag<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.650> order<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:18.370> them<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.520> respawn

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
cap a flag in order for them to respawn

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.900 
cap a flag in order for them to respawn

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.600 
halfway through the game you'll see that
I<00:02:26.170> try<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.380> play<00:02:26.620> flags<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.190> trying<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.400> bait

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
flags and my team wasn't that great so I

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.690 
flags and my team wasn't that great so I
knew<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.959> if<00:02:32.080> they<00:02:32.200> stay<00:02:32.440> dead<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.250> game<00:02:33.459> is

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
knew that if they stay dead the game is

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.250 
knew that if they stay dead the game is
about<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.360> rounds<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.690> about<00:02:34.840> two<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.140> half

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
about the rounds of about two and a half

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.500

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.280 
I killed the kid top white first and
then<00:02:52.060> when<00:02:52.180> he<00:02:52.239> capped<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.630> flag<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:53.019> knew<00:02:53.140> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
then when he capped the flag I knew that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.809 
then when he capped the flag I knew that
kid<00:02:53.470> would<00:02:53.620> spawn<00:02:53.860> back<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.430> killed<00:02:54.700> that

the<00:02:58.030> baiting<00:02:58.360> comes<00:02:58.569> into<00:02:58.780> play<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:58.989> right

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
the baiting comes into play and right

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.930 
here I actually I clutch up right here I
think<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.660> was<00:03:01.780> on<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.870> 19<00:03:02.470> or<00:03:02.739> maybe<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.610> think<00:03:03.790> I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
think I was on a 19 or maybe I think I

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.729 
think I was on a 19 or maybe I think I
was<00:03:04.060> around<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.360> 19<00:03:04.780> or<00:03:04.810> 20<00:03:05.170> kill<00:03:05.319> streak<00:03:05.530> at<00:03:05.650> the

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
was around a 19 or 20 kill streak at the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.009 
was around a 19 or 20 kill streak at the
time<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.519> my<00:03:06.880> teammate<00:03:07.180> dies<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:07.660> actually<00:03:07.810> I

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
time and my teammate dies I actually I

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.630 
time and my teammate dies I actually I
feel<00:03:08.380> bad<00:03:08.590> because<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.890> let<00:03:09.040> my<00:03:09.160> teammate<00:03:09.459> die

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
feel bad because I let my teammate die

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.750 
feel bad because I let my teammate die
right<00:03:10.269> there<00:03:10.450> I<00:03:10.480> captured<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.380> captured<00:03:11.860> C<00:03:12.459> or

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
right there I captured I captured C or

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.570 
right there I captured I captured C or
the<00:03:13.390> enemy<00:03:14.170> captured<00:03:14.620> B<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:14.830> let<00:03:15.100> them<00:03:15.190> captured

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
the enemy captured B I let them captured

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.370 
the enemy captured B I let them captured
B<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.940> then<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.239> actually<00:03:16.660> called<00:03:16.989> in<00:03:17.110> all<00:03:17.230> my

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
B and then I actually called in all my

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.080 
B and then I actually called in all my
streaks<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.040> had<00:03:18.190> my<00:03:18.340> ballistic<00:03:18.760> vest<00:03:18.940> on

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
streaks and I had my ballistic vest on

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.460 
streaks and I had my ballistic vest on
so<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.329> was<00:03:19.420> really<00:03:19.570> hard<00:03:19.810> for<00:03:19.870> me<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.079> even<00:03:20.260> die

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
so it was really hard for me to even die

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.979 
so it was really hard for me to even die
in<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.739> round<00:03:21.510> though<00:03:22.510> that's<00:03:22.690> kind<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.900> how

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
in that round though that's kind of how

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.210 
in that round though that's kind of how
the<00:03:23.049> game<00:03:23.290> mode<00:03:23.440> works<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.829> if<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:23.980> have<00:03:24.100> to

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the game mode works and if you have to

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.039 
the game mode works and if you have to
if<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.430> cap<00:03:24.609> all<00:03:24.790> three<00:03:25.000> flags<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:25.750> win<00:03:25.930> the

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
if you cap all three flags you win the

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.660 
if you cap all three flags you win the
round<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.560> it's<00:03:26.890> like<00:03:27.040> searching<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.400> story

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
round and it's like searching the story

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.720 
round and it's like searching the story
it's<00:03:27.940> up<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.209> four<00:03:28.420> rounds<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:28.989> win<00:03:29.170> and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730
