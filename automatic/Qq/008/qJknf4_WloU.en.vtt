00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
crackdown one was one of my favorite

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.170 
crackdown one was one of my favorite
games<00:00:17.630> at<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.439> start<00:00:18.770> of<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:18.920> xbox<00:00:19.340> 360<00:00:19.880> I

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
games at the start of the xbox 360 I

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.939 
games at the start of the xbox 360 I
only<00:00:20.510> really<00:00:20.779> got<00:00:20.900> it<00:00:21.020> because<00:00:21.109> of<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:21.380> halo<00:00:21.560> 3

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
only really got it because of the halo 3

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.429 
only really got it because of the halo 3
beta<00:00:22.190> that<00:00:22.520> came<00:00:22.699> with<00:00:22.910> it<00:00:22.939> but<00:00:23.330> it<00:00:23.570> blew<00:00:24.260> me

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
beta that came with it but it blew me

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.500 
beta that came with it but it blew me
away<00:00:24.470> and<00:00:24.949> I<00:00:25.220> was<00:00:25.250> really<00:00:25.580> impressed<00:00:25.789> what

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
away and I was really impressed what

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.810 
away and I was really impressed what
crackdown<00:00:26.990> two<00:00:27.320> was<00:00:27.800> kind<00:00:28.189> of<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.519> real

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
crackdown two was kind of a real

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.450 
crackdown two was kind of a real
disappointment<00:00:29.619> considering<00:00:30.619> how<00:00:31.039> few

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
disappointment considering how few

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.240 
disappointment considering how few
changes<00:00:32.090> were<00:00:32.660> made<00:00:32.900> now<00:00:33.500> i<00:00:33.530> know<00:00:33.680> they<00:00:33.949> switch

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
changes were made now i know they switch

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.979 
changes were made now i know they switch
developers<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.940> ruffian<00:00:35.330> games<00:00:35.360> and

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
developers to ruffian games and

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.319 
developers to ruffian games and
obviously<00:00:36.469> they<00:00:37.309> only<00:00:37.460> had<00:00:37.700> about<00:00:37.820> eight

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
obviously they only had about eight

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.479 
obviously they only had about eight
months<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:38.989> develop<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.530> game<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.010> i'm<00:00:40.280> not

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
months to develop the game so i'm not

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.520 
months to develop the game so i'm not
blaming<00:00:40.730> them<00:00:41.090> they<00:00:41.809> obviously<00:00:41.930> have<00:00:42.320> time

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
blaming them they obviously have time

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.170 
blaming them they obviously have time
constraints<00:00:42.739> that<00:00:43.190> were<00:00:43.520> out<00:00:43.820> of<00:00:44.000> their

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
constraints that were out of their

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.510 
constraints that were out of their
control<00:00:44.329> but<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.649> main<00:00:45.860> thing<00:00:45.890> i<00:00:46.190> would<00:00:46.250> say

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
control but the main thing i would say

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.639 
control but the main thing i would say
for<00:00:46.550> crackdown<00:00:46.969> 3<00:00:47.149> is<00:00:47.660> just<00:00:47.989> give<00:00:48.469> the

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
for crackdown 3 is just give the

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.590 
for crackdown 3 is just give the
developers<00:00:49.160> time<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:49.640> really<00:00:49.850> put<00:00:50.420> their<00:00:50.570> own

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
developers time to really put their own

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.229 
developers time to really put their own
spin<00:00:51.020> on<00:00:51.079> things<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.800> not<00:00:52.309> just<00:00:52.640> create<00:00:53.210> a

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
spin on things and not just create a

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.750 
spin on things and not just create a
cookie<00:00:53.690> cutter<00:00:53.899> of<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.559> last<00:00:54.770> game<00:00:54.980> which<00:00:55.579> is

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
cookie cutter of the last game which is

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.330 
cookie cutter of the last game which is
what<00:00:55.910> they<00:00:56.000> did<00:00:56.120> with<00:00:56.239> crackdown<00:00:56.750> 2<00:00:56.989> and

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
what they did with crackdown 2 and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.189 
what they did with crackdown 2 and
basically<00:00:58.340> it<00:00:58.789> turned<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.360> lot<00:00:59.629> of<00:00:59.750> people<00:01:00.079> off

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
basically it turned a lot of people off

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.410 
basically it turned a lot of people off
the<00:01:00.320> franchise<00:01:00.800> myself<00:01:01.609> included<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.180> an

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
the franchise myself included to an

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.840 
the franchise myself included to an
extent<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.440> with<00:01:03.620> this<00:01:03.649> in<00:01:03.800> mind<00:01:03.949> i'd<00:01:04.339> say<00:01:04.610> a

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
extent so with this in mind i'd say a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.969 
extent so with this in mind i'd say a
totally<00:01:05.539> new<00:01:05.690> city<00:01:05.960> has<00:01:06.289> to<00:01:06.470> be<00:01:06.560> incorporated

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
totally new city has to be incorporated

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.260 
totally new city has to be incorporated
so<00:01:07.909> in<00:01:08.060> crackdown<00:01:08.380> 12<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.740> was<00:01:10.100> Pacific<00:01:10.729> City<00:01:10.909> I

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
so in crackdown 12 it was Pacific City I

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.870 
so in crackdown 12 it was Pacific City I
think<00:01:11.780> as<00:01:12.020> good<00:01:12.439> as<00:01:12.590> Pacific<00:01:13.040> City<00:01:13.220> years<00:01:13.520> and

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
think as good as Pacific City years and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.600 
think as good as Pacific City years and
the<00:01:14.450> whole<00:01:14.630> architecture<00:01:15.100> works<00:01:16.100> really<00:01:16.460> well

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
the whole architecture works really well

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.520 
the whole architecture works really well
with<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:16.970> game<00:01:17.180> in<00:01:17.360> mind<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.840> change<00:01:18.350> of

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
with the game in mind a change of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.560 
with the game in mind a change of
scenery<00:01:18.890> will<00:01:19.340> do<00:01:19.549> it<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.729> world<00:01:19.939> of<00:01:20.119> good<00:01:20.150> and

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
scenery will do it a world of good and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.920 
scenery will do it a world of good and
really<00:01:21.320> give<00:01:21.740> some<00:01:22.040> varying<00:01:22.970> distinctions

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
really give some varying distinctions

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.590 
really give some varying distinctions
between<00:01:24.170> each<00:01:24.680> islands<00:01:25.640> as<00:01:25.759> well<00:01:25.790> assuming

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
between each islands as well assuming

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.880 
between each islands as well assuming
that<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:26.990> game<00:01:27.170> does<00:01:27.380> take<00:01:27.619> place<00:01:27.770> on

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
that the game does take place on

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.609 
that the game does take place on
multiple<00:01:28.549> different<00:01:28.700> locations<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:29.930> terms<00:01:30.470> of

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
multiple different locations in terms of

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.289 
multiple different locations in terms of
vehicles<00:01:31.189> I<00:01:31.490> think<00:01:31.909> boats<00:01:33.189> motorbikes<00:01:34.299> ATVs

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
vehicles I think boats motorbikes ATVs

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.480 
vehicles I think boats motorbikes ATVs
all<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.900> those<00:01:36.020> would<00:01:36.259> be<00:01:36.380> cool<00:01:36.619> really<00:01:37.460> cool

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
all of those would be cool really cool

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.539 
all of those would be cool really cool
and<00:01:37.970> bring<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:38.930> back<00:01:38.960> where<00:01:39.350> agency<00:01:40.130> vehicles

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
and bring it back where agency vehicles

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.819 
and bring it back where agency vehicles
transform<00:01:41.119> as<00:01:41.329> we<00:01:41.479> enter<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.110> because<00:01:42.680> I'm

crackdown<00:01:43.189> two<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.490> didn't<00:01:43.729> happen<00:01:44.030> and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
crackdown two that didn't happen and

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.670 
crackdown two that didn't happen and
that<00:01:44.299> was<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.600> coolest<00:01:44.780> thing<00:01:45.170> on<00:01:45.409> the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
that was like the coolest thing on the

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.590 
that was like the coolest thing on the
original<00:01:46.100> crackdown<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.000> when<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.299> leveled

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
original crackdown so when you leveled

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.770 
original crackdown so when you leveled
up<00:01:47.720> your<00:01:48.170> driving<00:01:48.619> skills<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.280> they<00:01:49.369> kind<00:01:49.579> of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
up your driving skills and they kind of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.030 
up your driving skills and they kind of
transformed<00:01:50.780> as<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.079> got<00:01:51.259> in<00:01:51.409> them<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.740> saw

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
transformed as you got in them I saw

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.710 
transformed as you got in them I saw
that<00:01:52.189> was<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.369> neat<00:01:52.579> little<00:01:52.729> touch<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.509> don't

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
that was a neat little touch and I don't

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.480 
that was a neat little touch and I don't
know<00:01:53.840> why<00:01:53.960> they<00:01:54.079> got<00:01:54.200> rid<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:55.220> terms

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
know why they got rid of it and in terms

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.899 
know why they got rid of it and in terms
of<00:01:55.700> players<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.990> think<00:01:57.530> certain<00:01:58.399> armorer

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
of players that I think certain armorer

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.459 
of players that I think certain armorer
varieties<00:01:59.509> you<00:01:59.719> should<00:01:59.869> be<00:01:59.990> able<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.290> buy

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
varieties you should be able to buy

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.649 
varieties you should be able to buy
different<00:02:00.979> armors<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.399> basically<00:02:02.000> allow<00:02:02.420> a

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
different armors and basically allow a

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.359 
different armors and basically allow a
one-star<00:02:03.200> stoppage<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.950> that<00:02:04.130> particular

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
one-star stoppage to that particular

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.080 
one-star stoppage to that particular
skill<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.180> see<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.350> buy<00:02:06.590> strength<00:02:07.399> armor<00:02:07.850> and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
skill so see you buy strength armor and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.969 
skill so see you buy strength armor and
it'll<00:02:08.780> add<00:02:08.959> an<00:02:09.049> extra<00:02:09.290> star<00:02:09.530> run<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.860> your

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
it'll add an extra star run to your

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.040 
it'll add an extra star run to your
strength<00:02:10.280> but<00:02:10.519> no<00:02:10.729> other<00:02:10.880> skill<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.690> say<00:02:11.989> you

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
strength but no other skill and say you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.410 
strength but no other skill and say you
make<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.459> your<00:02:13.640> guy<00:02:13.849> is<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.060> bit<00:02:14.270> more

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
make it so that your guy is a bit more

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.880 
make it so that your guy is a bit more
beefed<00:02:14.720> up<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.290> mostly<00:02:15.920> alternative

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
beefed up and mostly alternative

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.920 
beefed up and mostly alternative
we<00:02:17.010> say<00:02:17.220> if<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.370> get<00:02:17.640> an<00:02:17.850> agility<00:02:18.270> on<00:02:18.690> there

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
we say if you get an agility on there

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.870 
we say if you get an agility on there
you<00:02:19.290> become<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> bit<00:02:19.830> more<00:02:19.860> streamlined<00:02:20.580> and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
you become a bit more streamlined and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.510 
you become a bit more streamlined and
obviously<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.020> can<00:02:22.350> jump<00:02:22.590> higher<00:02:22.830> run<00:02:23.130> faster

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
obviously you can jump higher run faster

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.850 
obviously you can jump higher run faster
etc<00:02:24.000> etc<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.750> should<00:02:24.959> be<00:02:25.080> when<00:02:25.260> you've<00:02:25.410> maxed

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
etc etc this should be when you've maxed

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.350 
etc etc this should be when you've maxed
out<00:02:25.950> your<00:02:26.100> starts<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.520> believe<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:27.090> that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
out your starts I believe in that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.110 
out your starts I believe in that
particular<00:02:27.600> skill<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:29.400> not<00:02:29.610> open<00:02:29.970> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
particular skill so it's not open to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.880 
particular skill so it's not open to
abuse<00:02:30.240> but<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:31.380> that's<00:02:31.530> something<00:02:31.709> that

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
abuse but I think that's something that

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.680 
abuse but I think that's something that
could<00:02:32.190> be<00:02:32.220> well<00:02:32.790> worked<00:02:33.060> into<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.450> game

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
could be well worked into the game

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.390 
could be well worked into the game
something<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.740> an<00:02:34.860> absolute<00:02:35.250> necessity

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
something that is an absolute necessity

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.750 
something that is an absolute necessity
is<00:02:36.150> more<00:02:36.750> mission<00:02:37.200> variety<00:02:37.800> because<00:02:38.040> both

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
is more mission variety because both

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.000 
is more mission variety because both
crack<00:02:39.030> down<00:02:39.180> one<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.540> two<00:02:39.720> with<00:02:40.230> absolute

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
crack down one and two with absolute

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.040 
crack down one and two with absolute
offenders<00:02:41.550> for<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:41.940> as<00:02:42.209> much<00:02:42.570> as<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.780> enjoyed

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
offenders for this as much as I enjoyed

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.170 
offenders for this as much as I enjoyed
the<00:02:43.200> games<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.860> missions<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.700> felt<00:02:44.910> so

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the games the missions just felt so

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.030

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
attempt at a bit more variation but the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.530 
attempt at a bit more variation but the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
kind of really push the variety aspect

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.190 
kind of really push the variety aspect
and<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.120> think<00:03:06.180> crackdown<00:03:06.750> needs<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.110> do

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
and I think crackdown needs to do

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.500 
and I think crackdown needs to do
something<00:03:07.440> similar<00:03:07.950> with<00:03:08.100> extra<00:03:09.030> missions<00:03:09.209> in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
something similar with extra missions in

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.020 
something similar with extra missions in
mind<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.900> think<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.650> some<00:03:11.220> kind<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.489> Prophet

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
mind I think that some kind of Prophet

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.699 
mind I think that some kind of Prophet
boss<00:03:12.390> fights<00:03:12.720> should<00:03:13.290> be<00:03:13.410> incorporated

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
boss fights should be incorporated

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.100 
boss fights should be incorporated
rather<00:03:14.370> than<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:15.180> they're<00:03:15.420> taking<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.870> gang

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110

rather than just they're taking on gang
leaders<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:16.860> some<00:03:17.010> really<00:03:17.250> big<00:03:17.489> ass

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
leaders I think some really big ass

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.699 
leaders I think some really big ass
enemies<00:03:18.120> like<00:03:18.330> we<00:03:18.780> kind<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.019> took<00:03:19.200> on<00:03:19.380> wave

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
enemies like we kind of took on wave

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.819 
enemies like we kind of took on wave
after<00:03:19.920> wave<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.250> freaks<00:03:20.820> in<00:03:21.180> crackdown<00:03:22.019> 2<00:03:22.500> and

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
after wave of freaks in crackdown 2 and

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.190 
after wave of freaks in crackdown 2 and
I<00:03:23.220> think<00:03:23.610> some<00:03:23.880> really<00:03:24.269> really<00:03:24.420> huge<00:03:24.750> enemies

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
I think some really really huge enemies

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.770 
I think some really really huge enemies
would<00:03:25.739> be<00:03:25.950> awesome<00:03:26.310> in<00:03:26.459> crackdown<00:03:26.730> 3<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.450> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
would be awesome in crackdown 3 and it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.870 
would be awesome in crackdown 3 and it
would<00:03:27.870> really<00:03:28.079> push<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.130> whole<00:03:29.310> four<00:03:29.610> player

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
would really push the whole four player

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.720 
would really push the whole four player
co-op<00:03:30.180> side<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.140> because<00:03:31.620> foreplay<00:03:32.430> court

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
co-op side of it because foreplay court

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.210 
co-op side of it because foreplay court
was<00:03:32.940> too<00:03:33.090> easy<00:03:33.269> in<00:03:33.750> crackdown<00:03:34.110> two<00:03:34.410> okay<00:03:34.980> also

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
was too easy in crackdown two okay also

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.699 
was too easy in crackdown two okay also
I<00:03:35.430> think<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.180> leveling<00:03:36.720> system<00:03:37.110> should<00:03:37.680> be

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
I think that a leveling system should be

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.280 
I think that a leveling system should be
used<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.340> tandem<00:03:38.579> with<00:03:39.000> skill<00:03:39.630> progressions

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
used in tandem with skill progressions

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.550 
used in tandem with skill progressions
so<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:40.920> this<00:03:41.070> consistent<00:03:41.760> across<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.870> single

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
so have this consistent across a single

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.160 
so have this consistent across a single
player<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.769> multiplayer<00:03:44.390> basically<00:03:45.390> have<00:03:46.019> us

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
player and multiplayer basically have us

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.470 
player and multiplayer basically have us
gain<00:03:46.380> XP<00:03:46.829> for<00:03:47.100> getting<00:03:47.459> kills<00:03:47.700> doing<00:03:48.120> missions

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
gain XP for getting kills doing missions

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.750 
gain XP for getting kills doing missions
collecting<00:03:49.380> orbs<00:03:49.739> at<00:03:49.890> basically<00:03:50.430> anything

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
collecting orbs at basically anything

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.720 
collecting orbs at basically anything
that<00:03:51.209> furthers<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.350> game<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.829> just<00:03:53.400> allow

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
that furthers the game and just allow

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.569 
that furthers the game and just allow
these<00:03:53.910> levels<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:55.019> say<00:03:55.560> unlock<00:03:55.980> new<00:03:56.190> skills

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
these levels to say unlock new skills

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.780 
these levels to say unlock new skills
unlock<00:03:57.150> aesthetic<00:03:58.019> items<00:03:58.579> basically<00:03:59.579> just

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
unlock aesthetic items basically just

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.370 
unlock aesthetic items basically just
something<00:04:00.180> extra<00:04:00.570> so<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.750> feel<00:04:01.140> what

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
something extra so you feel what

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.340 
something extra so you feel what
constant<00:04:01.950> progression<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.239> feel<00:04:03.780> that

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
constant progression that I feel that

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.350 
constant progression that I feel that
the<00:04:04.680> other<00:04:04.799> two<00:04:05.100> games<00:04:05.400> were<00:04:05.610> walking<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.209> an

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
the other two games were walking to an

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.840 
the other two games were walking to an
extent<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.019> mean<00:04:07.590> saints<00:04:07.920> row<00:04:08.070> 3<00:04:08.100> have<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.489> really

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
extent I mean saints row 3 have a really

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.550 
extent I mean saints row 3 have a really
great<00:04:08.970> system<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.630> leveling<00:04:10.019> up<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.350> think

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
great system of leveling up and I think

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.110 
great system of leveling up and I think
crackdown<00:04:10.950> could<00:04:11.160> do<00:04:11.280> something<00:04:11.489> similar<00:04:11.700> to

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
crackdown could do something similar to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.210 
crackdown could do something similar to
that<00:04:12.269> with<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.959> leveling<00:04:13.320> system<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.739> mind<00:04:13.980> i

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
that with the leveling system in mind i

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.819 
that with the leveling system in mind i
think<00:04:14.489> in<00:04:15.209> game<00:04:15.600> challenges<00:04:16.229> could<00:04:16.410> be<00:04:16.500> given

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
think in game challenges could be given

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.830 
think in game challenges could be given
so<00:04:17.250> something<00:04:17.669> similar<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.269> halo<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.810> gears

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
so something similar to halo and gears

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.469 
so something similar to halo and gears
of<00:04:19.169> war<00:04:19.380> where<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.280> get<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.880> certain<00:04:21.239> amount<00:04:21.269> of

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
of war where you get a certain amount of

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.750 
of war where you get a certain amount of
XP<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:22.049> say<00:04:22.200> killing<00:04:22.530> 100<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.520> type<00:04:23.729> of

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
XP for say killing 100 of this type of

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.520 
XP for say killing 100 of this type of
enemy<00:04:24.030> or<00:04:24.390> getting<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.720> hundred<00:04:25.050> melly<00:04:25.260> kills

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
enemy or getting a hundred melly kills

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.469 
enemy or getting a hundred melly kills
etc<00:04:26.130> just<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.700> little<00:04:26.940> something<00:04:27.210> extra

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
etc just a little something extra

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.810 
etc just a little something extra
outside<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.349> achievements<00:04:28.979> that<00:04:29.130> give

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
outside of the achievements that give

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.470 
outside of the achievements that give
the<00:04:29.970> player

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
the player

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.510 
the player
that<00:04:30.690> extra<00:04:30.930> incentive<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.620> keep<00:04:31.740> on<00:04:31.950> playing

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
that extra incentive to keep on playing

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.150 
that extra incentive to keep on playing
and<00:04:32.870> some<00:04:33.870> more<00:04:34.020> relatively<00:04:34.620> minor<00:04:34.830> things

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
and some more relatively minor things

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.460 
and some more relatively minor things
but<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.730> still<00:04:36.060> think<00:04:36.330> they<00:04:36.540> would<00:04:36.720> only<00:04:36.990> add<00:04:37.440> to

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
but I still think they would only add to

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.040 
but I still think they would only add to
the<00:04:37.920> game<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.370> fully<00:04:39.240> fledged<00:04:39.510> character

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
the game and fully fledged character

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.810 
the game and fully fledged character
creation<00:04:40.530> instead<00:04:40.920> of<00:04:41.010> just<00:04:41.220> the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
creation instead of just the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.580 
creation instead of just the
predetermined<00:04:42.240> agents<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.110> believe<00:04:43.470> those

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
predetermined agents I believe those

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.530 
predetermined agents I believe those
like<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.860> choice<00:04:44.160> of<00:04:44.340> four<00:04:44.670> and<00:04:44.700> crackdown<00:04:45.330> two

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
like a choice of four and crackdown two

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.810 
like a choice of four and crackdown two
which<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.810> pretty<00:04:46.500> abysmal<00:04:46.830> scene<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.700> your

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
which is pretty abysmal scene is your

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.940 
which is pretty abysmal scene is your
character<00:04:48.030> has<00:04:48.300> like<00:04:48.510> no<00:04:48.780> real<00:04:49.020> cutscenes<00:04:49.590> he

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
character has like no real cutscenes he

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.040 
character has like no real cutscenes he
doesn't<00:04:50.280> talk<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.880> I've<00:04:51.450> got<00:04:51.630> no<00:04:51.750> gripes

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
doesn't talk that I've got no gripes

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.840 
doesn't talk that I've got no gripes
with<00:04:52.230> but<00:04:52.830> if<00:04:53.010> you're<00:04:53.280> going<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.490> have<00:04:53.640> that

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
with but if you're going to have that

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.000 
with but if you're going to have that
you<00:04:54.330> need<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.660> make<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:55.110> so<00:04:55.350> that<00:04:55.560> we<00:04:55.770> can<00:04:55.920> at

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
you need to make it so that we can at

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.070 
you need to make it so that we can at
least<00:04:56.160> create<00:04:56.610> our<00:04:56.730> own<00:04:56.760> agent<00:04:57.330> character<00:04:57.840> and

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
least create our own agent character and

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.530 
least create our own agent character and
it<00:04:58.440> just<00:04:58.620> seems<00:04:58.830> kind<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.190> lazy<00:04:59.550> even<00:05:00.300> if<00:05:00.390> it's

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
it just seems kind of lazy even if it's

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.660 
it just seems kind of lazy even if it's
just<00:05:00.600> more<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.200> basic<00:05:01.590> one<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:02.250> doesn't<00:05:02.580> have

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
just more of a basic one it doesn't have

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.520 
just more of a basic one it doesn't have
to<00:05:02.790> be<00:05:02.820> as<00:05:03.150> in-depth<00:05:03.780> as<00:05:03.780> something<00:05:04.440> like

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
to be as in-depth as something like

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.500 
to be as in-depth as something like
saints<00:05:04.920> row<00:05:05.070> or<00:05:05.340> Skyrim<00:05:05.940> or<00:05:06.120> anything<00:05:06.480> like

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
saints row or Skyrim or anything like

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.780 
saints row or Skyrim or anything like
that<00:05:06.660> just<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:07.260> bit<00:05:07.650> more<00:05:08.040> advanced<00:05:08.370> than<00:05:08.520> what

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
that just a bit more advanced than what

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.730 
that just a bit more advanced than what
we<00:05:08.880> have<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.330> also<00:05:09.570> give<00:05:09.840> us<00:05:09.960> more<00:05:10.140> choice

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
we have and also give us more choice

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.920 
we have and also give us more choice
with<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.040> colors<00:05:11.520> on<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:11.880> armors<00:05:12.270> because

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
with the colors on the armors because

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.090 
with the colors on the armors because
four<00:05:13.260> is<00:05:13.290> terrible<00:05:13.980> also<00:05:14.760> allow<00:05:16.100> customizable

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
four is terrible also allow customizable

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.440 
four is terrible also allow customizable
weapons<00:05:17.490> so<00:05:18.060> say<00:05:18.660> rapid<00:05:19.530> fire<00:05:19.740> or<00:05:20.150> scopes<00:05:21.150> or

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
weapons so say rapid fire or scopes or

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.890 
weapons so say rapid fire or scopes or
stuff<00:05:22.230> that<00:05:22.380> makes<00:05:22.530> us<00:05:22.770> reload<00:05:23.400> quicker

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
stuff that makes us reload quicker

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.450 
stuff that makes us reload quicker
basically<00:05:24.900> just<00:05:25.560> try<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.040> crush<00:05:26.250> the

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
basically just try and crush the

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.580 
basically just try and crush the
customization<00:05:27.210> aspect<00:05:27.570> a<00:05:27.660> bit<00:05:27.810> more<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.470> I

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
customization aspect a bit more and I

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.830 
customization aspect a bit more and I
think<00:05:28.620> hunt<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:29.820> combat<00:05:30.270> can<00:05:30.450> be<00:05:30.570> improved

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
think hunt and combat can be improved

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.320 
think hunt and combat can be improved
quite<00:05:31.200> a<00:05:31.260> lot<00:05:31.530> give<00:05:32.040> us<00:05:32.160> some<00:05:32.400> proper<00:05:33.060> real

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
quite a lot give us some proper real

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.440 
quite a lot give us some proper real
grappling<00:05:33.720> moves<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:34.580> some<00:05:35.580> actual<00:05:35.850> finishes

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
grappling moves and some actual finishes

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.450 
grappling moves and some actual finishes
and<00:05:36.660> make<00:05:37.110> it<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.290> bit<00:05:37.440> more<00:05:37.470> advanced<00:05:38.310> than

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
and make it a bit more advanced than

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.150 
and make it a bit more advanced than
just<00:05:38.850> mashing<00:05:39.090> be<00:05:39.420> repeatedly<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.350> this<00:05:40.860> next

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
just mashing be repeatedly and this next

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.250 
just mashing be repeatedly and this next
one<00:05:41.310> actually<00:05:41.670> isn't<00:05:41.880> that<00:05:42.060> minor<00:05:42.390> and<00:05:42.720> I

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
one actually isn't that minor and I

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.870 
one actually isn't that minor and I
should<00:05:43.650> have<00:05:43.740> done<00:05:43.980> it<00:05:44.130> earlier<00:05:44.220> you'll

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
should have done it earlier you'll

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.550 
should have done it earlier you'll
probably<00:05:45.120> noticed<00:05:45.660> in<00:05:45.810> this<00:05:45.930> video<00:05:46.260> that

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
probably noticed in this video that

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.550 
probably noticed in this video that
