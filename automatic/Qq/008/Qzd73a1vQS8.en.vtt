my drugs they say you can't be addicted
to<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.440> but<00:00:12.349> I've<00:00:13.349> had<00:00:13.559> some<00:00:13.769> days<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:15.059> was

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
to it but I've had some days and it was

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.970 
to it but I've had some days and it was
just<00:00:15.360> like<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.660> needed<00:00:15.900> marijuana<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.770> me<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
just like I needed marijuana for me to

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.970 
just like I needed marijuana for me to
function<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.640> well<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.660> didn't<00:00:18.960> even<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.800> of

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
function it well I didn't even think of

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.950 
function it well I didn't even think of
drugs<00:00:20.460> as<00:00:20.640> addictive<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.390> just<00:00:21.600> thought<00:00:21.750> they

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
drugs as addictive I just thought they

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960 
drugs as addictive I just thought they
were<00:00:21.990> just<00:00:22.199> something<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> did<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.039> didn't

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
were just something you did I didn't

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
were just something you did I didn't
know<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:25.109> life<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.470> gonna<00:00:25.619> depend

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
know it was you my life was gonna depend

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.599 
know it was you my life was gonna depend
on<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:27.949> feel<00:00:28.949> very<00:00:29.070> strongly<00:00:29.460> that

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
on it I feel very strongly that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.009 
on it I feel very strongly that
addiction<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> brain<00:00:30.269> disease

addiction is a brain disease
I<00:00:31.050> think<00:00:31.740> there's<00:00:31.980> ample<00:00:32.279> evidence

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
I think there's ample evidence
