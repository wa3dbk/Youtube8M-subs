00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to all hello then I am today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.440
 here to start a new week in 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.930
 outfits 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.580
 yes after weeks I decided why 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.639
 It seems a bit out of the sun beautiful 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.130
 hot weather and I wanted to do it 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 very so summer with new little things 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 so yes I sent back rim they trembled 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.859
 but now here I am as a new viking 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.789
 of delay therefore for me today to Sunday 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.680
 you see the video on Monday then that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.279
 on Monday Tuesday saying so for one 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.859
 week 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 so it will accompany you this time from 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.369
 Monday to Sunday and I will try to 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.360
 publish all videos and between 2 and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.370
 3 in the afternoon 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.500
 so you know that after lunch there is the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.390
 pause peels the sbu video all 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 days I promise you for a week 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 so let's start then for mine today 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.969
 this morning I was voting 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.190
 and then there was the classic lunch 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.829
 Sunday I ate a point 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.480
 pistachios made by the delicious mother e 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.000
 so nothing now after lunch between a 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.770
 I go out a little, though, but that mother 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.300
 in short, maybe the trick is a post made 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.980
 the hair is a bit worn out because it is already 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.410
 past time since I have been 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.049
 prepared then regarding the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.270
 makeup made this eyeliner line 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.610
 very so clean above and inside 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.229
 the eye and then in another 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 the accessories are these earrings 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.490
 beautiful in metal a little from zynga but 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.380
 also rather elegant than me 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
 really like them because they give 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.970
 so much light to the face and buttery 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.770
 I like them so much I don't remember apple 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.659
 give yourself someone and then this france 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.500
 of tonic people last year hm 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.060
 even this moment especially 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.829
 summer because I find maximum one 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.290
 very summery accessory 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.420
 and oh well it is beautiful because it is giant and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.280
 take your whole arm or yours 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.070
 this cotton dress is very much 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.979
 light with this beautiful 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.110
 in particular unconscious that takes everything 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.000
 the neckline is a neckline but there is also 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.920
 in short, the high neck and ends 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.720
 rather long I'm used to wearing 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.160
 clothes there slightly stronger because 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.159
 I believe that I no longer return to my legs 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.930
 however okay this for Sunday perhaps 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.400
 also the tradate sale or provato 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.369
 a belt at the waist but in the end me 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.050
 he liked softer than most shirts 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.700
 beautiful well this as shoes or 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.650
 these boots some for 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.440
 mostly years ago from topshop now 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.180
 they are matt leather and have this 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.050
 calculate with you the boots that you 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.300
 other accessories 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.209
 I wanted to call a little style first 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.280
 a bit of a concert, etc. even if then 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.070
 it remains rather rather 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.600
 elegant let's say as a bag or this 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.790
 sack which is also a little beautiful 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.410
 biased because it really makes a lot of noise 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.540
 anyway I ca n't do all these coins 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.790
 from these things also greedy 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.470
 video you do not see concerts I wanted that 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.150
 he still turned out to be anyway 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.220
 tomorrow in the lunch cooperating and so on 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.950
 but with a twist and a little more 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.220
 so I decided to combine these 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.220
 accessories 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.840
 ok 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.840
 we are there bye tomorrow
