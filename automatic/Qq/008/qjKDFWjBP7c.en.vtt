and I just I don't know I just freaking

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140 
and I just I don't know I just freaking
love<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.619> only<00:01:16.740> 69.95<00:01:17.549> which<00:01:18.060> I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
which is really annoying I know this may

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.440 
which is really annoying I know this may

my<00:02:22.480> hair<00:02:22.600> off<00:02:22.930> when<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.590> hairstyle<00:02:23.920> I

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
my hair off when I do this hairstyle I

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.390 
my hair off when I do this hairstyle I
just<00:02:24.820> feel<00:02:25.030> like<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.360> doesn't<00:02:25.810> really<00:02:26.400> do

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
just feel like it doesn't really do

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.460 
just feel like it doesn't really do
anything<00:02:28.000> because<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.510> curls<00:02:28.780> aren't<00:02:29.080> so

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
anything because the curls aren't so

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.170 
anything because the curls aren't so
like<00:02:29.740> pinned<00:02:30.280> tight<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.580> curly<00:02:30.880> starting

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
like pinned tight and curly starting

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.700 
like pinned tight and curly starting
them<00:02:31.300> lower<00:02:31.510> on<00:02:31.810> your<00:02:31.840> hair<00:02:32.290> shop<00:02:32.500> actually

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
them lower on your hair shop actually

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.070 
them lower on your hair shop actually
works<00:02:33.040> better<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.790> kind<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.180> like<00:02:34.360> doing

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
works better so I kind of like doing

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.690 
works better so I kind of like doing
like<00:02:35.230> my<00:02:35.530> whole<00:02:35.740> like<00:02:35.980> one<00:02:36.190> half<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.460> my<00:02:36.520> hair

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
like my whole like one half of my hair

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.340 
like my whole like one half of my hair
other<00:02:37.120> half<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.510> my<00:02:37.600> hair<00:02:37.750> because<00:02:37.990> then<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.170> can

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
other half of my hair because then I can

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.890 
other half of my hair because then I can
kind<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.560> gauge<00:02:38.770> what<00:02:39.610> I'm<00:02:39.820> really<00:02:40.000> doing<00:02:40.120> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
kind of gauge what I'm really doing and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.420 
kind of gauge what I'm really doing and
splitting<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:41.620> just<00:02:41.830> kind<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.040> mix<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.280> more

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
splitting it up just kind of mix it more

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.980 
splitting it up just kind of mix it more
curly<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.090> not<00:02:43.240> as<00:02:43.330> much<00:02:43.420> what<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:43.630> want<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.870> do

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
curly and not as much what I want to do

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.780 
curly and not as much what I want to do
because<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.320> like<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.710> it<00:02:44.800> be<00:02:44.950> very<00:02:45.550> like

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
because I like to have it be very like

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.610 
because I like to have it be very like
everything<00:02:46.240> flows<00:02:46.450> together<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.260> doing<00:02:47.530> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
everything flows together so doing the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.250 
everything flows together so doing the
curls<00:02:47.830> separately<00:02:48.340> makes<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.300> like<00:02:49.660> not<00:02:49.930> blend

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
curls separately makes it like not blend

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.660 
curls separately makes it like not blend
this<00:02:50.410> nicely<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.070> first<00:02:51.280> we're<00:02:51.400> going<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.580> take

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
this nicely so first we're going to take

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.610 
this nicely so first we're going to take
a<00:02:51.700> section<00:02:51.970> that's<00:02:52.300> about<00:02:53.020> an<00:02:53.170> inch<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
a section that's about an inch and a

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.860 
a section that's about an inch and a
half<00:02:53.650> wide<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.850> first<00:02:55.030> open<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.390> clamp<00:02:55.630> and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
half wide so first open the clamp and

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.840 
half wide so first open the clamp and
the<00:02:56.530> side<00:02:56.770> actually<00:02:56.950> has<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.370> roller<00:02:57.580> you're

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
the side actually has the roller you're

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.090 
the side actually has the roller you're
going<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.090> start<00:02:58.360> by<00:02:58.390> using<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.710> placing

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
going to start by using that so placing

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.500 
going to start by using that so placing
your<00:03:00.220> hair<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.520> between<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.120> clamps<00:03:01.420> on

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
your hair in between so the clamps on

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.600 
your hair in between so the clamps on
the<00:03:01.600> bottom<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.960> rollers<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.410> top<00:03:02.680> you're

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
the bottom the rollers on the top you're

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.260 
the bottom the rollers on the top you're
going<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:04.030> wrap<00:03:04.420> your<00:03:04.690> hair<00:03:07.500> away<00:03:08.500> from<00:03:09.270> your

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
going to wrap your hair away from your

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.170 
going to wrap your hair away from your
face<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:11.430> curl<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.580> up<00:03:12.670> towards<00:03:12.940> your<00:03:13.060> head

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
face and curl it up towards your head

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.490 
face and curl it up towards your head
might<00:03:13.510> have<00:03:13.630> toppled<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.960> tip<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.320> if<00:03:14.440> you

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
might have toppled the tip of it if you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.990 
might have toppled the tip of it if you
have<00:03:14.590> really<00:03:14.710> thick<00:03:15.010> or<00:03:15.190> really<00:03:15.400> long<00:03:15.610> hair<00:03:15.880> I

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
have really thick or really long hair I

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.730 
have really thick or really long hair I
know<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.180> have<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.720> depending<00:03:17.350> on<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.500> size<00:03:17.680> of

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
know I have to depending on the size of

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.020 
know I have to depending on the size of
the<00:03:17.830> section<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.250> for<00:03:18.400> bigger<00:03:18.580> sections<00:03:18.940> I

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
the section so for bigger sections I

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.390 
the section so for bigger sections I
just<00:03:19.210> hold<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.510> tip<00:03:19.800> other<00:03:20.800> sections<00:03:21.220> for

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
just hold the tip other sections for

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.590 
just hold the tip other sections for
like<00:03:21.520> really<00:03:21.730> small<00:03:21.910> ones<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.150> don't<00:03:22.330> need<00:03:22.450> to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
like really small ones I don't need to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.320 
like really small ones I don't need to
thin<00:03:23.020> that<00:03:23.140> for<00:03:23.320> about<00:03:23.410> 30<00:03:23.710> seconds<00:03:24.340> obviously

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
thin that for about 30 seconds obviously

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.020 
thin that for about 30 seconds obviously
holding<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.720> longer<00:03:26.080> for<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.740> bigger

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
holding it longer for the bigger

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.730 
holding it longer for the bigger
sections<00:03:28.030> I'm<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:28.960> going<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.230> let<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.530> down

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
sections I'm just going to let that down

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.100 
sections I'm just going to let that down
and<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.520> what<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.790> curl<00:03:31.030> looks<00:03:31.270> like<00:03:31.540> so

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
and that is what the curl looks like so

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.320 
and that is what the curl looks like so
once<00:03:32.320> you<00:03:32.440> find<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.100> next<00:03:33.490> section<00:03:33.880> closest

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
once you find the next section closest

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.970 
once you find the next section closest
to<00:03:34.390> that<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.810> hasn't<00:03:34.990> been<00:03:35.140> curled<00:03:35.530> yet<00:03:35.710> and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
to that that hasn't been curled yet and

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.010 
to that that hasn't been curled yet and
opening<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.490> clamp<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.480> part<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.870> from

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
opening the clamp so this part is from

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.270 
opening the clamp so this part is from
here<00:03:38.370> wrapping<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.670> around<00:03:42.210> clamping<00:03:43.210> that<00:03:43.390> in

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
here wrapping it around clamping that in

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.800 
here wrapping it around clamping that in
and<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.430> one<00:03:45.700> stayed<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.300> so<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.540> just<00:03:46.690> hold

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
and that one stayed and so you just hold

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.360 
and that one stayed and so you just hold
it<00:03:46.960> like<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.230> throughout<00:03:47.440> 30<00:03:47.680> seconds<00:03:48.100> so

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
it like this throughout 30 seconds so

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.590 
it like this throughout 30 seconds so
with<00:03:48.490> all<00:03:48.610> these<00:03:48.730> curls<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.390> like

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
with all these curls I really like

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.510 
with all these curls I really like
making<00:03:49.840> sure<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.470> they're<00:03:50.650> curled<00:03:50.890> away

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
making sure that they're curled away

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.400 
making sure that they're curled away
from<00:03:51.850> my<00:03:51.970> head<00:03:52.180> because<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:53.080> think<00:03:53.140> that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
from my head because I think that

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.530 
from my head because I think that
creates<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:54.460> most<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:55.240> a<00:03:55.660> very<00:03:56.530> kind<00:03:56.950> of

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
creates the most of a very kind of

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.610 
creates the most of a very kind of
windblown<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:59.140> gives<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.380> little<00:03:59.500> more

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
windblown it gives a little more

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.290 
windblown it gives a little more
flattering<00:04:00.190> especially<00:04:00.310> on<00:04:00.820> like

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
flattering especially on like

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.690 
flattering especially on like
universally<00:04:02.050> on<00:04:02.230> all<00:04:02.410> different<00:04:02.700> faces

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
universally on all different faces

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.520 
universally on all different faces

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.470 
shapes and sizes and things like that I
feel<00:04:05.830> like<00:04:05.920> going<00:04:06.040> away<00:04:06.370> just<00:04:06.670> have<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.240> look

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
feel like going away just have that look

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.760 
feel like going away just have that look
that<00:04:07.660> everyone<00:04:07.870> tries<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.260> achieve<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.680> when

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
that everyone tries to achieve and when

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.500 
that everyone tries to achieve and when
curls<00:04:09.010> are<00:04:09.100> going<00:04:09.280> every<00:04:09.820> which<00:04:09.940> way<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.330> looks

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
curls are going every which way it looks

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.760 
curls are going every which way it looks
very<00:04:10.600> natural<00:04:11.170> but<00:04:11.260> this<00:04:11.440> we're<00:04:11.620> kind<00:04:11.740> of

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
very natural but this we're kind of

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.620 
very natural but this we're kind of
going<00:04:11.920> for<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.160> very<00:04:12.250> holiday<00:04:12.670> glam<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.450> now<00:04:13.540> I'm

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
going for a very holiday glam so now I'm

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.490 
going for a very holiday glam so now I'm
gonna<00:04:13.720> take<00:04:13.930> some<00:04:14.110> top<00:04:14.320> sections<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.239> again

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
gonna take some top sections and again

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.960 
gonna take some top sections and again
curl<00:04:17.500> them<00:04:17.650> away<00:04:17.859> from<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.250> head<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.580> one<00:04:18.820> we

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
curl them away from the head this one we

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.210 
curl them away from the head this one we
don't<00:04:19.090> really<00:04:19.239> want<00:04:19.540> them<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:19.870> start<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:20.770> close

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
don't really want them to start so close

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.410 
don't really want them to start so close
so<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:21.640> won't<00:04:21.880> always

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
so I won't always

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.850 
so I won't always
rolled<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.810> barrel<00:04:22.960> up<00:04:23.290> I'll<00:04:23.500> just<00:04:23.650> kind<00:04:23.830> of

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860
