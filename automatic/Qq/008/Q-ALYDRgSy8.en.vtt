setups<00:02:19.350> i'm<00:02:19.470> going<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> show<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.070> one

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
setups i'm going to show you this one

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.790 
setups i'm going to show you this one
right<00:02:20.550> here<00:02:20.610> are<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.930> ones<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.290> don't<00:02:22.590> match

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
right here are the ones that don't match

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.250 
right here are the ones that don't match
as<00:02:23.010> much<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.610> can<00:02:23.760> make<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> match<00:02:24.260> but

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
as much but you can make a match but

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.200 
as much but you can make a match but
basically<00:02:25.470> right<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.730> have<00:02:26.880> ghosts

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
basically right here you have ghosts

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.700 
basically right here you have ghosts
hardened<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.870> hacker<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.460> with<00:02:29.460> ghosts<00:02:30.710> as

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
hardened and hacker and with ghosts as

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.130 
hardened and hacker and with ghosts as
you<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:32.790> see<00:02:33.000> i<00:02:33.030> matched<00:02:33.390> up<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> ones<00:02:33.960> that

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
you can see i matched up the ones that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.570 
you can see i matched up the ones that
matched<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.650> red<00:02:34.920> blue<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.550> green<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:37.580> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
matched in red blue and green and the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.340 
matched in red blue and green and the
balloon<00:02:38.820> red<00:02:39.570> ones<00:02:39.780> are<00:02:39.960> self-explanatory

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
balloon red ones are self-explanatory

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.460 
balloon red ones are self-explanatory
but<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.730> can<00:02:41.850> see<00:02:42.060> with<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.330> green<00:02:42.600> if<00:02:42.960> you

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
but as you can see with the green if you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.680 
but as you can see with the green if you
use<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.740> motion<00:02:44.190> sensor<00:02:44.340> you'll<00:02:45.240> be<00:02:45.420> able<00:02:45.540> to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
use a motion sensor you'll be able to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.540 
use a motion sensor you'll be able to
get<00:02:45.990> kills<00:02:46.320> through<00:02:46.560> walls<00:02:46.770> since<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.490> will

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
get kills through walls since it will

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.640 
get kills through walls since it will
show<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:47.970> where<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.240> enemy<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.510> at<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.020> it

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
show like where the enemy is at and it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.380 
show like where the enemy is at and it
should<00:02:49.830> be<00:02:49.860> easy<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.190> acquire<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:51.000> kills

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
should be easy to acquire like kills

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.850 
should be easy to acquire like kills
through<00:02:51.600> walls<00:02:51.810> pretty<00:02:52.140> simple<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.710> is

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
through walls pretty simple like that is

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.290 
through walls pretty simple like that is
put<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.130> one<00:02:53.340> room<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.730> camp<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.090> another

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
can hide on the spine and then you can

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.780 
can hide on the spine and then you can
shoot<00:03:01.230> aircraft<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> spine<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.490> then

shoot aircraft in the spine and then

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.460 
shoot aircraft in the spine and then
there's<00:03:03.120> lots<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.420> there's<00:03:03.900> lots<00:03:04.350> of

and<00:03:19.520> so<00:03:20.520> I<00:03:20.550> try<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.940> group<00:03:21.210> them<00:03:21.390> together<00:03:21.510> this

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
and so I try to group them together this

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.210 
and so I try to group them together this
would<00:03:22.140> probably<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.530> hardest<00:03:22.830> one<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.010> get

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
would probably the hardest one to get

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.790 
would probably the hardest one to get
and<00:03:24.030> then<00:03:24.480> i<00:03:24.570> put<00:03:24.780> i<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.140> put<00:03:25.260> hard<00:03:25.470> line<00:03:25.650> up

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
and then i put i just put hard line up

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.230 
and then i put i just put hard line up
there<00:03:26.010> just<00:03:26.160> because<00:03:26.490> i<00:03:26.640> haven't<00:03:26.880> used<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.210> yet

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
there just because i haven't used it yet

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.630 
there just because i haven't used it yet
it's<00:03:27.660> only<00:03:27.750> perk<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:28.200> i<00:03:28.320> couldn't<00:03:29.100> fit<00:03:29.340> and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
it's only perk that i couldn't fit and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.310 
it's only perk that i couldn't fit and
with<00:03:29.760> any<00:03:29.910> category<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.540> can<00:03:30.690> go<00:03:30.840> if<00:03:30.930> anything

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
with any category it can go if anything

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.410 
with any category it can go if anything
really<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:32.490> with<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.670> scout<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.060> second

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
really but with a scout and second

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.590 
really but with a scout and second
chance<00:03:34.160> if<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.250> fall<00:03:35.640> into<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:36.000> second<00:03:36.390> chance

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
chance if you fall into a second chance

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.450 
chance if you fall into a second chance
you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:36.900> get<00:03:37.020> kills<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.500> your<00:03:37.620> secondary<00:03:38.100> so

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
you can get kills if your secondary so

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.160 
you can get kills if your secondary so
that<00:03:38.640> would<00:03:38.730> help<00:03:38.850> towards<00:03:39.180> scout<00:03:39.450> but<00:03:40.140> i

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
that would help towards scout but i

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.020 
that would help towards scout but i
don't<00:03:40.380> really<00:03:40.500> see<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.830> reason<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.610> get<00:03:41.730> scout

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
don't really see a reason to get scout

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.330 
don't really see a reason to get scout
or<00:03:42.150> second<00:03:42.540> chance<00:03:42.720> pro<00:03:43.050> or<00:03:43.530> just<00:03:43.950> even<00:03:44.100> use

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
or second chance pro or just even use

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.410 
or second chance pro or just even use
them<00:03:44.430> at<00:03:44.550> all<00:03:44.670> because<00:03:44.850> i<00:03:45.000> just<00:03:45.090> seemed<00:03:45.390> like
