which are now going to be in the game

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.230 
which are now going to be in the game
which<00:03:29.620> means<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:30.070> basically<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:31.120> can

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
there as well that looks cool it's that

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.760 
there as well that looks cool it's that
initial<00:03:48.490> seeing<00:03:49.240> it<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.990> initial<00:03:50.290> assault

from within the siege towers rolling up
to<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.080> walls<00:03:53.290> is<00:03:53.620> pretty<00:03:54.400> epic<00:03:54.520> stuff<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:55.180> also

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
to the walls is pretty epic stuff I also

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.210 
to the walls is pretty epic stuff I also
say<00:03:56.170> all<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.440> arrows<00:03:56.680> are<00:03:56.800> sticking<00:03:57.070> in<00:03:57.160> the

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
say all the arrows are sticking in the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.250 
say all the arrows are sticking in the
shields<00:03:57.640> so<00:03:58.060> obviously<00:03:58.600> having<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.930> shields

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
shields so obviously having the shields

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.930 
shields so obviously having the shields
informations<00:03:59.650> gonna<00:04:00.070> be<00:04:00.190> important<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.760> stop

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
informations gonna be important to stop

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.190 
informations gonna be important to stop
you<00:04:01.060> from<00:04:01.150> getting<00:04:01.360> ours<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.810> place<00:04:02.020> because

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
you from getting ours in place because

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.320 
you from getting ours in place because
that's<00:04:02.410> all<00:04:02.500> dependent<00:04:02.860> on<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.330> projectile

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
that's all dependent on the projectile

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.030 
that's all dependent on the projectile
physics<00:04:04.810> system<00:04:05.110> as<00:04:05.230> well<00:04:05.380> so<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.770> know<00:04:05.920> if

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
physics system as well so you know if

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.140 
physics system as well so you know if
you<00:04:06.130> bought<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.340> with<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:06.610> shield

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
boom boom the hostage that is Carthage

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.110 
boom boom the hostage that is Carthage
the<00:04:25.780> whole<00:04:26.110> most<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.949> whole<00:04:27.040> cottage<00:04:27.310> yeah

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
the whole most of whole cottage yeah

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.120 
the whole most of whole cottage yeah
so<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.389> can<00:04:28.630> just<00:04:28.780> get<00:04:28.960> an<00:04:29.050> impression<00:04:29.320> right

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
so you can just get an impression right

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.070 
so you can just get an impression right
from<00:04:30.340> there<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.699> the<00:04:30.850> scale<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:31.690> this<00:04:31.810> is<00:04:31.960> the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
from there of the scale so this is the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.320 
from there of the scale so this is the
