00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.720
 I'll tell you so the player lives around 8 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.610
 hours in the mode of works 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.280
 play music that is from 8 to 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.180
 12 hours it is normal his work happened 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:55.760
 of course and longer much longer but the average is 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.890
