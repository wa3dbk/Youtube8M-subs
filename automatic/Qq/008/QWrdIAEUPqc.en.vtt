00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.920 
then the jetta and I believe because the
jetta<00:02:49.950> at<00:02:50.220> 75<00:02:50.879> mile<00:02:51.150> an<00:02:51.330> hour<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:53.120> around<00:02:54.120> 2500

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
jetta at 75 mile an hour is around 2500

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.069 
jetta at 75 mile an hour is around 2500
rpm<00:02:55.730> whereas<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.209> Chevrolet<00:02:57.599> Cruze<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
rpm whereas with the Chevrolet Cruze the

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.140 
rpm whereas with the Chevrolet Cruze the
six-speed<00:02:58.650> versus<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.220> jettas<00:02:59.549> five-speed

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
six-speed versus the jettas five-speed

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.960 
six-speed versus the jettas five-speed
puts<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.440> right<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.129> around<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.700> under

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
puts this it right in around just under

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.830 
puts this it right in around just under
2100<00:03:03.810> RPM<00:03:03.900> at<00:03:04.379> 75<00:03:04.890> mile<00:03:05.129> an<00:03:05.220> hour<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.299> expect

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
2100 RPM at 75 mile an hour so I expect

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.470 
2100 RPM at 75 mile an hour so I expect
to<00:03:06.930> see<00:03:07.110> better<00:03:07.319> fuel<00:03:07.590> mileage<00:03:07.620> with<00:03:08.099> this

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
to see better fuel mileage with this

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.930 
to see better fuel mileage with this
means<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.599> it's<00:03:09.870> got<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.739> little<00:03:11.129> lower<00:03:11.340> rpms

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
means that it's got a little lower rpms

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.720 
means that it's got a little lower rpms
and<00:03:12.239> such<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.829> I<00:03:13.859> think<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.640> be

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
and such so I think this is going to be

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.449 
and such so I think this is going to be
a<00:03:14.760> good<00:03:14.940> trade<00:03:15.269> for<00:03:15.299> us<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.980> honestly<00:03:16.980> will

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
a good trade for us I honestly will

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.339 
a good trade for us I honestly will
never<00:03:17.640> buy<00:03:17.790> another<00:03:17.819> Volkswagen<00:03:18.299> car<00:03:18.959> because

never buy another Volkswagen car because
