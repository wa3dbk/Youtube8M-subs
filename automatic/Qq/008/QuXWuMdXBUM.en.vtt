really<00:00:24.300> hoping<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.900> enough<00:00:25.140> money<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439

have the Retina display and everything
but<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> problem<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.760> if<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.090> was

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
but the problem is is that if I was

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.089 
but the problem is is that if I was
going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.750> make<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.199> computer<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.920> way<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
going to make my computer the way I

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.840 
going to make my computer the way I
really<00:00:32.610> wanted<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.149> run<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.260> perform<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.070> would

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
really wanted to run and perform I would

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.160 
really wanted to run and perform I would
have<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> probably<00:00:36.450> spend<00:00:37.489> $3,300<00:00:39.020> that<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
have to probably spend $3,300 that is

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
have to probably spend $3,300 that is
just<00:00:40.379> too<00:00:40.710> much<00:00:40.950> money<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.550> know<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.480> lot<00:00:42.690> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
just too much money I know a lot of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.779 
just too much money I know a lot of
people<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.079> probably<00:00:43.230> saying<00:00:43.710> well<00:00:44.160> didn't

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
people are probably saying well didn't

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.520 
people are probably saying well didn't
spend<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> lot<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> money<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
spend a lot of money to get this one and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.310 
spend a lot of money to get this one and
yes<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.489> truth<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.059> did<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:49.050> computer

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
yes the truth is I did but this computer

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.540 
yes the truth is I did but this computer
costs<00:00:50.010> around<00:00:50.219> $1,000<00:00:51.120> less<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> let's<00:00:53.340> get

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
costs around $1,000 less so let's get

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
costs around $1,000 less so let's get
into<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.910> more<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.930> said<00:00:54.960> is

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
into it more so this is like I said is

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.069 
into it more so this is like I said is
the<00:00:55.530> new<00:00:56.160> model<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> only<00:00:57.780> thing

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the new model but the only thing

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.369 
the new model but the only thing
different<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.579> fact<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.120> has<00:01:00.379> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
different is the fact that it has the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.969 
different is the fact that it has the
USB<00:01:02.280> 3.0<00:01:03.059> ports<00:01:03.480> now<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:06.799> internals<00:01:07.799> are

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
USB 3.0 ports now and the internals are

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.130 
USB 3.0 ports now and the internals are
different<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.939> has<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.450> Ivy<00:01:09.869> Bridge

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
different now it has the Ivy Bridge

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.950 
different now it has the Ivy Bridge
processor<00:01:11.570> has<00:01:12.570> great<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:14.040> gigabyte<00:01:14.549> video

the truth is the one thing that really

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.740 
the truth is the one thing that really
swayed<00:02:21.900> me<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:23.100> fact<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.750> you

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
swayed me is is this the fact that you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.220 
swayed me is is this the fact that you
can't<00:02:25.160> upgrade<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.520> RAM<00:02:26.670> yourself<00:02:27.210> it's<00:02:27.840> like

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
can't upgrade the RAM yourself it's like

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.880 
can't upgrade the RAM yourself it's like
than<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.830> heirs<00:02:29.220> where<00:02:29.700> basically<00:02:30.560> if<00:02:31.560> you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
than the heirs where basically if you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.470 
than the heirs where basically if you
want<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:32.460> computer<00:02:32.880> certain<00:02:33.150> way<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.330> have

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
want your computer certain way you have

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.410 
want your computer certain way you have
to<00:02:33.930> work<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.410> way<00:02:34.590> right<00:02:34.620> away<00:02:34.980> from<00:02:35.940> Apple

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
to work that way right away from Apple

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.680 
to work that way right away from Apple
see<00:02:37.260> there's<00:02:38.100> kind<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.550> no<00:02:38.760> user<00:02:39.090> upgrades

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
see there's kind of no user upgrades

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.190 
see there's kind of no user upgrades
that<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.860> as<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:42.090> right<00:02:42.360> now<00:02:42.630> maybe

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that you can do as of right now maybe

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.930 
that you can do as of right now maybe
someday<00:02:43.560> down<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.220> line<00:02:44.400> somebody<00:02:44.700> could

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
someday down the line somebody could

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.479 
someday down the line somebody could
figure<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.360> out<00:02:45.440> but<00:02:46.440> um<00:02:46.680> basically<00:02:47.220> I

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
figure that out but um basically I

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.640 
figure that out but um basically I
really<00:02:48.090> wanted<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.420> computer<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.320> could

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
really wanted the computer that I could

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.070 
really wanted the computer that I could
kind<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.489> change<00:02:50.550> around<00:02:51.060> if<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.690> need<00:02:51.870> to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
kind of change around if I need to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.460 
kind of change around if I need to
someday<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.390> overall<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.440> really

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
someday so overall this is a really

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.680 
someday so overall this is a really
beautiful<00:02:56.340> computer<00:02:57.530> very<00:02:58.530> excited<00:02:59.690> I've
