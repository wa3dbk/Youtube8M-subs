00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.399
 hello how about friends like being neither names nor being very happy to be 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:07.819
 with you on this occasion shared this reflection 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.830
 of a message sent to us by a friend who is in Guadalajara 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:12.479
 here I send you 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.789
 a huge kiss I support omitting their names by 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.349
 because that's how I was asked for it 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.349
 percent to appear admired percent play and the husband of 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.140
 they suddenly 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.099
 asks me to reflect on this part that is acceptable 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.679
 in death there 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.200
 i just 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.140
 the course of miracles that I know what I rely on many times to be able to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.130
 explain this 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.540
 tells us that death does not exist that death is not real that we are spirit 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.330
 that our presidency is eternal 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.570
 that we men only use the body as a means of 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.530
 communication 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.680
 that the judge also that that is the end 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.060
 another part tells us that the body is made to limit or limited then 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.680
 the spirit sometimes knows when to leave this body 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 many times we feel angry and frustrated sad upset about the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.310
 situation is normal 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.469
 eye no 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:07.650
 does not stop 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.060
 that you do not feel sad is that he was not going to be his owner 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.340
 live it 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.830
 we experience feels that we are here in this world to feel 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.290
 say something in this kind of events chin situations 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.050
 It is very delicate because many times 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.800
 we say things that can hurt a little more what is best for us is 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.970
 remain silent at those times 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.670
 what I can tell you what it is 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.960
 Long live the experience that you feel that if you got angry upset 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.579
 Castro says that I would like 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:40.860
 take this out 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.540
 How sad 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 but if I want to invite you to 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.859
 do not get mad at that 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.359
 because that will take you 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.140
 when carrying 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.700
 frustration antipathy this apathy forgiveness 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.460
 iii feelings 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.890
 find them 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.100
 and discomfort 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.630
 then I will not deny what I feel 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.959
 but do not get hooked to that feeling 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.589
 and at all times I want to invite you 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:17.099
 akin dykes a jesus to the holy spirit ccoo the name that chili kiosk of the 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.329
 divinity 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.329
 to accompany you that has to exist to live this experience 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.699
 everything you feel 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:29.499
 I recognize what you are feeling but ask him to help you return act peace 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.659
 mental 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.499
 ask him to love you directly to inner peace 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.230
 ask him to help you that you like the way to be able to accept this situation 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:45.649
 Now I will be of mathis tell you that we are not a body that we are free 1 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.499
 that death does not exist 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.249
 the one that simply and simply is a change 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.459
 but the pain 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.949
 we feel you and we already experience there are 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.139
 the course of miracles does not want us 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.449
 avoid experiences 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.509
 what the mining crossroads ask us is 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:06.920
 that we move away from pain the course of miracles helps us to get away from pain 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.920
 to remain the possible means of pain 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.330
 live the experience 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.760
 but the leader as soon as possible of those feelings of pain 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:23.880
 is part of life is part of this habitat this world is not of today 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.739
 the one who will exhibit the treasures because this world 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.789
 have 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:31.669
 as the delay this world stands out over 4 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:32.959
 beliefs 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.970
 basic we all feel that is the belief the loss in the scarcity in the 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.259
 separation and in death 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:44.329
 the belief the death will accompany very clear of the crese the loss 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:48.749
 Live the experience if you feel you lost something live 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.679
 feel 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:56.179
 but he quickly asks for help, asks for seven to return to that place of peace 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:59.649
 10 if I help you accept things as they are 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:04.989
 and lose the holy spirit that gives you many portals we are with you and in 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.749
 this moment in this instant 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.059

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.059

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:16.680
 lost 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.699
 sad 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.889
 we unite in this moment and remember 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.889
 that we are one in God 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.729
