00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
before Thanksgiving so I wanted to do

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.530 
before Thanksgiving so I wanted to do
like<00:00:39.380> a<00:00:39.590> review<00:00:40.010> for<00:00:40.280> Thanksgiving<00:00:40.940> that

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
like a review for Thanksgiving that

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.130 
like a review for Thanksgiving that
would<00:00:41.720> seem<00:00:41.960> sort<00:00:42.410> of<00:00:42.610> kind<00:00:43.610> of<00:00:43.760> like<00:00:43.880> it<00:00:44.140> when

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
would seem sort of kind of like it when

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.720 
would seem sort of kind of like it when
I<00:00:45.199> think<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.559> this<00:00:45.679> I<00:00:45.859> think<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:46.129> old<00:00:46.340> western

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
I think of this I think of old western

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.400 
I think of this I think of old western
because<00:00:47.269> it<00:00:47.390> has<00:00:47.539> to<00:00:47.690> solve<00:00:47.870> this<00:00:48.019> in<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.230> old

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
because it has to solve this in the old

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.259 
because it has to solve this in the old
western<00:00:48.710> movie<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.670> when<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:49.879> think<00:00:50.120> of<00:00:50.179> all

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
western movie and when I think of all

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.639 
western movie and when I think of all
the<00:00:50.329> western<00:00:50.660> for<00:00:50.839> some<00:00:50.989> reason<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.320> think<00:00:51.469> of

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
the western for some reason I think of

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.720

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
online I'm guessing it's the Jim Bowie

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.630 
online I'm guessing it's the Jim Bowie
knife<00:02:29.209> because<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.660> says<00:02:29.870> Jim<00:02:30.170> Bowie<00:02:30.640> right

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640
