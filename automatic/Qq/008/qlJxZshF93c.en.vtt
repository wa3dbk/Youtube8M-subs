00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.759
 hello how about very good guys 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.549
 Welcome to this new gameplay of 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.509
 game lego batman 3 beyond Gotham and 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.670
 to this video, I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:16.330
 all the characters of the dlc arrow 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.910
 it guys because now we will 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.369
 start 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.400
 well let's go into our menu 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.170
 characters and the first one we see here 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.970
 it is arrow 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.789
 and we had played with this character 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.020
 in the mission in history mode of this 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.120
 dlc there is your little arrow we can or 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.660
 we could see in the level that we played that 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.300
 the arrows when you throw them to an object 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.680
 of the metallic ego because they are explosive 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.280
 it also has the sensor that it detects in 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.960
 the hidden objects 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.489
 so they are delicious I like it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.890
 Ok guys, there we have an arrow 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.500
 we modeled a little bit and changed to 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.090
 next character that is canary 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.019
 arrow 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.019
 there we have it 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.290
 what is it that has those baths of 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.290
 Martial Arts 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.159
 let's go testing buttons to see what 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.680
 skills or powers more has it worth for 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.120
 the seen also has the sonic power 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.740
 so it's great 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:34.100
 but it's high pretty high 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.630
 there we have a canary arrow 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.610
 there is we go for the next 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.410
 character that is felicity smoke there is 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.330
 and now there we are going to prove what 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.630
 powers or abilities has that 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.070
 character apparently because he has the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.950
 sensor that detects objects 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.720
 hidden 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.810
 there is 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.290
 that more then weapons does not have 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.170
 and you can also become invisible by 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.270
 the seen 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.700
 and we have felicity smoak 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.370
 more guys, now let's go for 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.410
 the next character that is the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.310
 huntress 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.310
 there we have it 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.920
 for what I see, he has a crossbow 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.920
 with which he throws arrows 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.030
 let's try buttons to see if it has 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.100
 some other power 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.830
 but for what I do, he only has the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.140
 crossbow is to defend itself 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.390
 so we modeled a little bit more and 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.910
 we change to the next character that is 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.530
 thug of the island 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.280
 and this the thug on the island has a 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.930
 pistol 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.900
 to this type of thugs because we have 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:55.090
 faced in the mission 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.090
 of this arrow tlc 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.240
 guys, he just has the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.890
 pistolita let's go for the next 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.890
 character that is john's click 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.500
 there it is that he also has his pistolita 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.720
 and I'm testing the buttons to see if 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.300
 have something more 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.680
 but apparently not so let's go 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.680
 to the next character 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.860
 there is this is malcolm tarling 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.069
 arrows are thrown also has a bow 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.069
 black 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.209
 You can do a double jump too 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.210
 where the buttons see if it has 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.490
 something special but apparently not 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.270
 we modeled a little more and 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.819
 we change to the next character what is 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.219
 king harper 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.879
 there we have looks similar to 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:03.879
 of arrow only that his suit is red 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.920
 hawking 2 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.430
 you can also throw the arrows what 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.060
 I do not know if the characters these have 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.100
 arrow are the same as the first character 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.380
 that we had his arrows were 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.500
 explosive but good let's put the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.710
 last character that is slide wilson 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.350
 has a sword also has 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.600
 a gun is very good and can pass 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.220
 Unnoticed can also be camouflaged 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.930
 becoming little plant 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.950
 there we have slide wilson 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.110
 I like it 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.420
 for guys because this was the last 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.940
 character 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.500
 so now we're going to make a 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.700
 review of all the characters that 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.670
 we just saw 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.350
 the first character was arrow then 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.180
 we had a canary arrow then it's 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.780
 happy and 10 mod 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.220
 there's the island thug hunter 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.600

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.910
