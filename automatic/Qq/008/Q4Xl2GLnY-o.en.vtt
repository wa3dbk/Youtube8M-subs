00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
ghost ghost train theme going so the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.360 
ghost ghost train theme going so the
front<00:00:38.460> part<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.660> big<00:00:39.840> difference<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.649> if

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
front part the big difference here is if

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.350 
front part the big difference here is if
you<00:00:41.460> look<00:00:41.640> underneath

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you look underneath

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.180 
you look underneath
I<00:00:42.530> used<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.040> idea<00:00:44.340> from<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.700> Constitution

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
I used the idea from the Constitution

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.760 
I used the idea from the Constitution
Train<00:00:47.190> Set<00:00:47.719> where<00:00:48.719> if<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:51.770> added

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
Train Set where if you look here I added

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.000 
Train Set where if you look here I added
the<00:00:53.039> swivel<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> front<00:00:55.260> part<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.860> now

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the swivel to the front part here so now

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
the swivel to the front part here so now
the<00:00:56.070> front<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.820> swivel<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.050> ghost

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the front can swivel and now the ghost

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.139 
the front can swivel and now the ghost
train<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.710> make<00:00:58.859> those<00:00:59.039> those<00:00:59.940> turns<00:01:02.149> that

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
train can make those those turns that

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.000 
train can make those those turns that
forced<00:01:03.570> me<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> move<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> carriage<00:01:04.710> back<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
forced me to move the carriage back a

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
forced me to move the carriage back a
little<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.869> were

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
little bit so if you can if you were

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.440 
little bit so if you can if you were
know<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.530> original<00:01:08.040> design<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.970> wheel<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
know on the original design the wheel is

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.560 
know on the original design the wheel is
a<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:10.260> bit<00:01:10.380> further<00:01:10.619> back<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:12.090> now<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
a little bit further back but now the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.940 
a little bit further back but now the
carriage<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.290> further<00:01:13.439> back<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:13.920> I

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
carriage is a little further back but I

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.460 
carriage is a little further back but I
still<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> looks<00:01:14.610> good<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.259> added

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
still think it looks good and I added

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.660 
still think it looks good and I added
the<00:01:16.650> coupling<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> cars

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the coupling so the cars

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
the coupling so the cars
I<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> flapping<00:01:21.600> wings<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.470> flying

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
I like the flapping wings but the flying

working on a on a track ghost train so
so<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> figured<00:01:27.689> all<00:01:27.930> makes<00:01:28.200> new<00:01:28.439> cars<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> the

the top very similar I added a middle
piece<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:04.130> just<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> keep<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.579> consistent

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
piece just just to keep it consistent

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.699 
piece just just to keep it consistent
and<00:02:07.840> then<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.739> added<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.250> caboose<00:02:10.590> here's<00:02:11.590> the

and then I added a caboose here's the
caboose<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.430> kind<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.700> tried<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:12.970> keep<00:02:13.150> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
caboose and I kind of tried to keep the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.030 
caboose and I kind of tried to keep the
same<00:02:13.950> general<00:02:14.950> theme<00:02:15.190> going

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040

now<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.830> have<00:02:36.129> added<00:02:36.459> power<00:02:36.760> yet<00:02:37.030> that's<00:02:37.360> the

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
now I have added power yet that's the

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.020 
now I have added power yet that's the
next<00:02:37.750> page<00:02:38.739> face<00:02:39.099> I<00:02:39.310> don't<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> power

next page face I don't have a power

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.830 
next page face I don't have a power
system<00:02:40.329> yet<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.890> until<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.730> get<00:02:42.879> power<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.720> is

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
system yet so until I get power this is

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.059 
system yet so until I get power this is
what<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.079> looks<00:02:44.230> like<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.200> can<00:02:47.349> run<00:02:47.560> on

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
what it looks like and you can run on

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:55.710 
what it looks like and you can run on
the<00:02:48.250> tracks<00:02:48.549> pretty<00:02:48.849> well<00:02:53.849> so<00:02:54.849> that's<00:02:55.480> my

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
the tracks pretty well so that's my

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.890 
the tracks pretty well so that's my
modification<00:02:56.379> of<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.620> ghost<00:02:56.829> train<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.390> it

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
modification of the ghost train and it

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.559 
modification of the ghost train and it
was<00:02:59.109> a<00:02:59.140> really<00:03:00.010> great<00:03:00.220> set<00:03:00.579> but<00:03:01.150> like<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.390> said<00:03:01.540> I

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
was a really great set but like I said I

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.000 
was a really great set but like I said I
was<00:03:01.720> just<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.959> little<00:03:02.319> disappointed<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.890> I

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
was just a little disappointed that I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.009 
was just a little disappointed that I
couldn't<00:03:03.069> run<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.549> tracks<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.780> just

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
couldn't run on the tracks and I just

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.550 
couldn't run on the tracks and I just
wanted<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.349> try<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.099> see<00:03:06.730> what<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.150> could<00:03:07.359> do<00:03:07.510> to

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
wanted to try and see what I could do to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.190 
wanted to try and see what I could do to
to<00:03:08.560> improve<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:09.510> anyways<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.690> hope<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.989> like
