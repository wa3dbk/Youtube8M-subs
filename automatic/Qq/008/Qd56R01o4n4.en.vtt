 a thin layer of clay 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.620
 immediately after cover the bottom of the vase 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.990
 with specific soil from the garden that 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.640
 it is softer and contains the pebbles of 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.640
 pumice that favor drainage 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.009

 slightly opening the underlying part 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.470
 to allow the best rooting

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.630
 aromatic too close to each other 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.630
 otherwise they will not grow well 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.590
 finally proceed by ticking off either 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.560
 slightly the plant in this way 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.780
