00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.670
 ah 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.210
 Gaia is one of the missions Stone 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.760
 angular of the European space agency 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.280
 in this decade 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.800
 the objective observe more than a thousand 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.780
 millions of stars in our galaxy 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.490
 the tool a satellite capable of 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.220
 get a precision 100 times higher 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.930
 that the preceding missions 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.820
 what galla is going to do is that 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.489
 properties will allow us to get 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.160
 the 3d glasses and we will be able to see a 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.870
 lots of stars really in 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.879
 three dimensions 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.530
 For this, it has two telescopes 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.780
 six mirrors and a focal plane of almost 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.399
 one billion pixels that convert to 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.300
 street in the biggest camera in space 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.300
 never built 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.510
 what is measuring from there is the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.579
 size of something like 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.079
 the pupil of the eye of a man who 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.630
 I was on the moon seen from the 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.120
 land 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.250
 barrier of heaven for five years and 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.200
 will send 50 gb daily to the ground 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.290
 data that will allow to elaborate the biggest 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.370
 star census of our galaxy 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.290
 that there will be a catalog 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.420
 astrometric is to say a catalog of 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.790
 positions distances and movements of 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.770
 the stars the Spanish contribution 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 It represents about 10 percent of 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.610
 the mission involving more than one 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.620
 hundred of scientists and in particular 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.080
 outstanding projects of the uned the 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.890
 University of La CoruÃ±a and especially the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.890
 University of Barcelona 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.780
 It is also very important the role of 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.310
 various companies among others are from 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.200
 Spanish manufacture the parasol that 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.119
 protects the satellite the antenna that 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.530
 will send the information to the land and the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.390
 software that will process the data 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.440
 received that is estimated to reach 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.630
 a petabyte a million gigabytes 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.410
 the database that galla is going to give us 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.060
 really represents a huge treasure 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.640
 astronomers are going to be like those 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.650
 children in kings' day eager to see 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.010
 what toys brought them the kings 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.010
 wizards 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.010
 that there will be for many years 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.720
 reference for the entire economy 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.130
 the following videos explain with greater 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.380
 detail the operation of the satellite 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.750
 scientific and industrial participation 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.220
 Spanish and the revolution that will mean 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.520
 the gaia observations for the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.520
 astronomy 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.140
 ah
