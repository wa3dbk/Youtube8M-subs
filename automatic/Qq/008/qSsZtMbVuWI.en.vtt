00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.880 
use the adjustable strap because I feel
like<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.670> cap<00:01:42.880> size<00:01:43.150> comes<00:01:43.630> in<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.960> small<00:01:44.260> so<00:01:44.860> I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
like the cap size comes in a small so I

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.620 
like the cap size comes in a small so I
didn't<00:01:45.310> use<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.580> adjustable<00:01:46.060> strap<00:01:46.299> at<00:01:46.479> all

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
didn't use the adjustable strap at all

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.480 
didn't use the adjustable strap at all
and<00:01:46.870> it<00:01:46.930> fit<00:01:47.110> perfectly<00:01:47.530> overall<00:01:48.040> I<00:01:48.070> would<00:01:48.220> say

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
and it fit perfectly overall I would say

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.550 
and it fit perfectly overall I would say
that<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.700> really<00:01:49.180> do<00:01:49.299> like<00:01:49.479> this<00:01:49.690> wig<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.229> think

you want a part now it's shedding and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.380 
you want a part now it's shedding and
tangling<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.070> does<00:02:35.370> shed<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.150> little

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.540 
tangling it does shed just a little
amount<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.900> mean<00:02:37.380> if<00:02:37.530> you've<00:02:37.650> had<00:02:37.920> synthetic

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
amount I mean if you've had synthetic

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.340 
amount I mean if you've had synthetic
wigs<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:38.970> you'll<00:02:39.150> know<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.390> you're<00:02:40.230> gonna

experience<00:02:40.860> shedding<00:02:41.520> more<00:02:41.760> than<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.360> was

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
experience shedding more than if it was

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.890 
experience shedding more than if it was
a<00:02:42.540> human<00:02:42.810> wig<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.710> it<00:02:43.860> does<00:02:44.100> shed<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.900> tingling

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
experience it just a tiny bit when I

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.620 
experience it just a tiny bit when I
first<00:02:50.400> started<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.880> comb<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:51.270> some<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.570> the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.810 
first started to comb out some of the
curls<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.620> other<00:02:52.740> than<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.280> wasn't<00:02:53.670> like

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
curls but other than that it wasn't like

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.760 
curls but other than that it wasn't like
a<00:02:54.060> point<00:02:54.600> where<00:02:54.750> my<00:02:54.870> comb<00:02:55.050> was<00:02:55.260> getting<00:02:55.500> stuck

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
a point where my comb was getting stuck

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.260 
a point where my comb was getting stuck
or<00:02:55.920> anything<00:02:56.070> like<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.700> wasn't<00:02:56.880> crazy

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
or anything like that it wasn't crazy

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.330 
or anything like that it wasn't crazy
tangling<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.230> yeah<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.380> really<00:02:58.470> do<00:02:58.830> like<00:02:59.040> this

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
I think the next time I get it I am

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.470 
I think the next time I get it I am
gonna<00:03:01.560> get<00:03:01.800> one<00:03:01.980> B<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.790> because<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.300> think

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
gonna get one B just because I think

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.200 
gonna get one B just because I think
it'll<00:03:03.750> look<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.260> natural<00:03:04.920> especially<00:03:05.700> because

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
it'll look so natural especially because

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.360 
it'll look so natural especially because
it's<00:03:06.630> just<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.290> don't<00:03:07.770> know<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.190> such<00:03:08.340> a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
it's just like I don't know it's such a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.370 
it's just like I don't know it's such a
nice<00:03:08.670> wig<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.240> think<00:03:09.570> it'll<00:03:09.690> look<00:03:09.780> really<00:03:10.140> more

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
I think it's definitely something

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.370 
I think it's definitely something
different<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.150> something<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.870> know<00:03:30.989> you

different and something you know you

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.740 
different and something you know you

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
don't see a lot often so the color is

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.360 
don't see a lot often so the color is
great<00:03:34.080> if<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.320> want<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.620> stand<00:03:34.830> out<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.100> lot
