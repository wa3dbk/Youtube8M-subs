00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.840 

this<00:00:08.660> is<00:00:08.750> that<00:00:08.870> right<00:00:09.050> and<00:00:09.370> of<00:00:10.370> course<00:00:10.639> this

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
this is that right and of course this

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.140 
this is that right and of course this
was<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:11.299> phase<00:00:11.540> which<00:00:12.110> was<00:00:12.290> called<00:00:12.730> not<00:00:13.730> rapid

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
was the phase which was called not rapid

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.400 
was the phase which was called not rapid
but<00:00:14.360> slow<00:00:14.660> rapid<00:00:15.379> passive<00:00:15.799> now<00:00:16.369> it<00:00:16.520> was<00:00:16.699> slow

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
but slow rapid passive now it was slow

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.609 
but slow rapid passive now it was slow
the<00:00:18.410> slow<00:00:19.029> passive<00:00:20.029> ventricular<00:00:20.690> filling

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
the slow passive ventricular filling

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.160 
the slow passive ventricular filling
which<00:00:22.310> is<00:00:22.490> duty<00:00:22.820> it<00:00:23.029> is<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.210> duty<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.750> longest

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
which is duty it is the duty the longest

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.660 
which is duty it is the duty the longest
phase<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:25.190> what<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.090> here<00:00:26.330> now<00:00:27.340> again<00:00:28.340> the

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
phase and what is here now again the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.470 
phase and what is here now again the
next<00:00:28.910> cycle<00:00:29.210> start<00:00:29.690> that<00:00:30.320> is<00:00:30.500> usual

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
next cycle start that is usual

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.200 
next cycle start that is usual
contraction<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:33.410> if<00:00:33.649> HS<00:00:34.550> contracting

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
contraction and if HS contracting

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.170 
contraction and if HS contracting
against<00:00:36.050> us<00:00:36.199> different<00:00:36.710> ventricle<00:00:37.190> only<00:00:37.910> then

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
against us different ventricle only then

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.660 
against us different ventricle only then
a<00:00:38.420> sound<00:00:38.870> will<00:00:39.170> be<00:00:39.199> produced<00:00:39.289> which<00:00:40.249> is<00:00:40.280> called

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
a sound will be produced which is called

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.489 
a sound will be produced which is called
s4<00:00:41.620> now<00:00:42.909> another<00:00:43.909> way<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.449> correlate<00:00:45.229> these

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
s4 now another way to correlate these

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:50.139 
s4 now another way to correlate these
concepts<00:00:46.280> is<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:47.199> you<00:00:48.199> can<00:00:48.409> say<00:00:48.879> that<00:00:49.879> this

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
concepts is that you can say that this

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:57.750 
concepts is that you can say that this
was<00:00:51.100> what<00:00:52.100> was<00:00:52.280> this<00:00:52.460> atrial

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.000 

what<00:00:58.760> was<00:00:58.970> this<00:00:59.120> atrial

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
what was this atrial

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.390 
what was this atrial
systole<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.680> what<00:01:03.680> was<00:01:03.860> this<00:01:04.129> continuing<00:01:06.400> up

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
systole and what was this continuing up

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.030 
systole and what was this continuing up
to<00:01:07.460> here<00:01:08.470> atrial<00:01:09.970> diastole<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.320> if<00:01:12.320> we<00:01:12.860> go

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
to here atrial diastole and if we go

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.410 
to here atrial diastole and if we go
like<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:13.280> from<00:01:13.790> here<00:01:14.270> what<00:01:14.840> was<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:15.320> up<00:01:15.950> to

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
like this from here what was this up to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.400 
like this from here what was this up to
this<00:01:17.420> phase<00:01:17.979> this<00:01:18.979> was<00:01:19.220> ventricular<00:01:21.640> systole

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
this phase this was ventricular systole

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.230 
this phase this was ventricular systole
this<00:01:24.410> is<00:01:24.910> ventricular<00:01:26.860> systole<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.240> of

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
this is ventricular systole and of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.120 
this is ventricular systole and of
course<00:01:29.540> what<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.840> here<00:01:30.940> what<00:01:31.940> was<00:01:32.119> this

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
course what is here what was this

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.680 
course what is here what was this
ventricular<00:01:35.289> -<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.970> point<00:01:38.300> which<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.600> have

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
ventricular - the point which you have

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.420 
ventricular - the point which you have
to<00:01:38.750> remember<00:01:38.930> as<00:01:39.259> one<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:40.009> at<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.280> beginning

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
to remember as one is at the beginning

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.889 
to remember as one is at the beginning
of<00:01:40.729> ventricular<00:01:42.160> systole<00:01:43.160> and<00:01:43.430> s2<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.240> at<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
of ventricular systole and s2 is at the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.480 
of ventricular systole and s2 is at the
as<00:01:47.899> you<00:01:48.080> can<00:01:48.259> see<00:01:48.470> at<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.830> end<00:01:48.979> of<00:01:49.160> ventricular

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
as you can see at the end of ventricular

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.600 
as you can see at the end of ventricular
systole<00:01:50.300> or<00:01:50.539> beginning<00:01:50.899> of<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.200> ventricular

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
systole or beginning of the ventricular

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.440 
systole or beginning of the ventricular
diastole<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:52.910> s3<00:01:53.899> is<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:56.030> somewhere

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
diastole and s3 is in the somewhere

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.870 
diastole and s3 is in the somewhere
before<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.140> middle<00:01:57.440> of<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.880> ventricular

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
before the middle of the ventricular

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.499 
before the middle of the ventricular
diastole<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.140> as<00:02:00.979> for<00:02:01.369> if<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:01.880> there<00:02:02.240> in

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
diastole and as for if it is there in

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.540 
diastole and as for if it is there in
some<00:02:02.690> pathological<00:02:02.990> condition<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:04.160> is<00:02:04.220> just

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
some pathological condition it is just

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.350 
some pathological condition it is just
before<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> next<00:02:05.179> when<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:05.959> will<00:02:06.050> assist<00:02:06.380> lay

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
before the next when it will assist lay

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.089 
before the next when it will assist lay
now<00:02:08.360> if<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.750> really<00:02:08.990> want<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.349> correlate<00:02:09.590> all

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
now if you really want to correlate all

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.820 
now if you really want to correlate all
these<00:02:10.369> things<00:02:10.840> with<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.959> pressure<00:02:12.200> changes

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
these things with the pressure changes

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.750 
these things with the pressure changes
the<00:02:13.550> volume<00:02:14.150> changes<00:02:15.340> volume<00:02:16.340> within<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
the volume changes volume within the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.390 
the volume changes volume within the
ventricle<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.870> can<00:02:18.050> see<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.830> volume<00:02:19.069> in<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
ventricle you can see the volume in the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.750 
ventricle you can see the volume in the
ventricle<00:02:20.030> here<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:21.050> slightly<00:02:21.440> increased<00:02:21.760> in

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
ventricle here is slightly increased in

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.479 
ventricle here is slightly increased in
this<00:02:23.390> case<00:02:23.630> volume<00:02:24.050> remains<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.500> same<00:02:24.709> you

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
this case volume remains the same you

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.760 
this case volume remains the same you
know<00:02:25.610> during<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.060> phase<00:02:26.470> volume<00:02:27.470> will

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
know during this phase volume will

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.830 
know during this phase volume will
remain<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.099> same<00:02:28.130> here<00:02:29.030> volume<00:02:29.360> will<00:02:29.599> rapidly

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
remain the same here volume will rapidly

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.070 
remain the same here volume will rapidly
go<00:02:30.110> down<00:02:30.410> then<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.430> will<00:02:31.550> further<00:02:31.730> go<00:02:32.030> down

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
go down then it will further go down

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.740 
go down then it will further go down
then<00:02:33.080> volume<00:02:33.290> will<00:02:33.530> remain<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.950> same<00:02:34.599> does<00:02:35.599> it

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
then volume will remain the same does it

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.900 
then volume will remain the same does it
right<00:02:35.900> then<00:02:36.709> ventricular<00:02:37.069> volume<00:02:37.280> will<00:02:37.580> start

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
right then ventricular volume will start

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.729 
right then ventricular volume will start
going<00:02:38.060> up<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:39.400> again<00:02:40.400> going<00:02:40.670> up<00:02:40.940> and

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
going up and again going up and

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.830 
going up and again going up and
eventually<00:02:42.739> in<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.160> next<00:02:43.489> stage<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.480> what<00:02:44.660> we

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
eventually in the next stage so what we

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.110 
eventually in the next stage so what we
have<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.140> really<00:02:45.410> learn<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:46.220> volume<00:02:46.520> with

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
have to really learn that volume with

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.100 
have to really learn that volume with
atrial<00:02:47.450> contraction

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
atrial contraction

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.250 
atrial contraction
well<00:02:48.590> volume<00:02:49.069> in<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.220> ventricle<00:02:49.610> increases

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
well volume in the ventricle increases

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.110 
well volume in the ventricle increases
during<00:02:51.260> isovolumetric<00:02:51.980> contraction<00:02:52.370> volume

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
during isovolumetric contraction volume

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.330 
during isovolumetric contraction volume
in<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.300> ventricle<00:02:53.690> remains<00:02:53.959> same<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.440> rapid

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
in the ventricle remains same and rapid

then slow passive filling again volume

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.080 
then slow passive filling again volume
become<00:03:09.349> more<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.769> in<00:03:10.189> the<00:03:10.310> end<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.579> course<00:03:10.609> if

next<00:03:11.620> atrial<00:03:12.620> contraction<00:03:13.069> come

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830

top look if I draw the ECG you can

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.040 
top look if I draw the ECG you can
understand<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.880> atrial<00:03:47.880> contraction<00:03:48.540> if

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
understand that atrial contraction if

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.020 
understand that atrial contraction if
there<00:03:49.740> is<00:03:49.800> an<00:03:49.860> initial<00:03:50.460> contraction

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
there is an initial contraction

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.940 
there is an initial contraction
mechanical<00:03:51.690> wave<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:52.200> course<00:03:52.650> there<00:03:52.920> should

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
mechanical wave of course there should

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.730 
mechanical wave of course there should
be<00:03:53.250> electrical<00:03:53.970> stimulation<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:55.290> just

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
be electrical stimulation of it just

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.760 
be electrical stimulation of it just
before<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.940> P<00:03:57.450> wave<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.959> ECG<00:03:58.350> should<00:03:58.650> be

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
before that so P wave of ECG should be

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.510 
before that so P wave of ECG should be
before<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.900> then<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.130> onset<00:04:02.490> of

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
before that and then this is onset of

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.790 
before that and then this is onset of
ventricular<00:04:02.700> contraction<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.959> means<00:04:04.200> there

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
ventricular contraction it means there

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.730 
ventricular contraction it means there
is<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> strong<00:04:05.790> what<00:04:09.170> what<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.440> activity

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
is a strong what what is this activity

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.740 
is a strong what what is this activity
when<00:04:11.400> ticular<00:04:11.730> depolarization<00:04:12.330> going<00:04:12.570> on

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
when ticular depolarization going on

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.190 
when ticular depolarization going on
which<00:04:12.930> has<00:04:13.050> taken<00:04:13.470> all<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:14.270> activity<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.450> of

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
which has taken all the activity and of

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.470 
which has taken all the activity and of
course<00:04:16.530> during<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:18.200> what<00:04:19.200> is<00:04:19.320> this<00:04:19.530> st<00:04:20.190> phase

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
course during the what is this st phase

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.690 
course during the what is this st phase
ST<00:04:21.860> segment<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:24.210> know<00:04:24.390> Plateau<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:25.020> there<00:04:25.260> and

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
ST segment you know Plateau is there and

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.640 
ST segment you know Plateau is there and
you<00:04:26.700> see<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.150> still<00:04:27.390> contracting<00:04:27.990> but<00:04:28.440> when

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
you see it is still contracting but when

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.130 
you see it is still contracting but when
relaxation<00:04:29.310> start<00:04:29.640> it<00:04:30.240> means<00:04:30.450> repolarization

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
relaxation start it means repolarization

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.590 
relaxation start it means repolarization
has<00:04:31.410> started<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.970> will<00:04:33.150> lead<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.330> which

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
has started and that will lead to which

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.600 
has started and that will lead to which
wave<00:04:34.310> T<00:04:35.310> wave<00:04:35.580> right<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:37.020> this<00:04:37.169> is<00:04:37.230> how<00:04:37.430> ECG<00:04:38.430> can

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
wave T wave right so this is how ECG can

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.750 
wave T wave right so this is how ECG can
be<00:04:38.820> superimposed<00:04:39.600> on<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:41.100> of<00:04:41.460> course

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
be superimposed on that and of course

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.780 
be superimposed on that and of course

mechanically<00:05:27.230> content<00:05:27.650> first<00:05:28.310> ventricle<00:05:29.060> is

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
mechanically content first ventricle is

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.360 
mechanically content first ventricle is
electrically<00:05:29.900> stimulated<00:05:30.470> then<00:05:30.980> went<00:05:31.250> it

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
electrically stimulated then went it

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.090 
electrically stimulated then went it
will<00:05:31.490> undergo<00:05:32.020> mechanical<00:05:33.020> contraction<00:05:33.560> so

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
will undergo mechanical contraction so

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.070 
will undergo mechanical contraction so
in<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.490> heart<00:05:34.790> first<00:05:35.450> you<00:05:35.630> have<00:05:35.720> to<00:05:35.780> remember

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
in the heart first you have to remember

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.290 
in the heart first you have to remember
the<00:05:36.740> first<00:05:37.070> is<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.370> electrical<00:05:37.760> event<00:05:38.120> and

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
the first is the electrical event and

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.530 
the first is the electrical event and
after<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:39.200> there<00:05:39.440> is<00:05:39.610> mechanical<00:05:40.610> event<00:05:41.090> now

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
after that there is mechanical event now

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.050 
after that there is mechanical event now
if<00:05:41.990> I<00:05:42.260> say<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:42.890> atrial<00:05:43.310> contraction<00:05:43.820> is<00:05:43.970> the

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
if I say that atrial contraction is the

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.300 
if I say that atrial contraction is the
atrial<00:05:44.540> mechanical<00:05:45.350> event<00:05:45.590> so<00:05:45.950> electrical

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
atrial mechanical event so electrical

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.460 
atrial mechanical event so electrical
event<00:05:46.610> should<00:05:46.700> be<00:05:46.760> just<00:05:47.030> before<00:05:47.180> that<00:05:47.510> so

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
event should be just before that so

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.310 
event should be just before that so
electrical<00:05:49.250> event<00:05:49.520> 4h<00:05:50.000> is<00:05:50.300> represented<00:05:51.260> by

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
electrical event 4h is represented by

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.140 
electrical event 4h is represented by
the<00:05:51.440> P<00:05:51.680> wave<00:05:51.890> so<00:05:52.790> P<00:05:53.030> wave<00:05:53.330> represents<00:05:53.990> what

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
the P wave so P wave represents what

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.990 
the P wave so P wave represents what
atrial<00:05:56.800> depolarization<00:05:57.800> is<00:05:58.310> just<00:05:58.520> before<00:05:58.880> the

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
atrial depolarization is just before the

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.180 
atrial depolarization is just before the
a<00:05:59.150> wave<00:05:59.360> P<00:06:00.350> wave<00:06:00.680> on<00:06:01.040> ECG<00:06:01.610> is<00:06:02.170> actual

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
a wave P wave on ECG is actual

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.460 
a wave P wave on ECG is actual
depolarization<00:06:04.190> and<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:05.180> wave<00:06:05.720> on<00:06:06.050> the

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
depolarization and a wave on the

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.430 
depolarization and a wave on the
pressure<00:06:06.710> is<00:06:07.010> pressure<00:06:07.580> in<00:06:07.970> the<00:06:08.330> atria<00:06:09.170> due<00:06:09.320> to

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
pressure is pressure in the atria due to

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.370 
pressure is pressure in the atria due to
mechanical<00:06:09.560> activity<00:06:10.300> so<00:06:11.300> a<00:06:11.600> wave<00:06:12.260> is

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
mechanical activity so a wave is

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.380 
mechanical activity so a wave is
representing<00:06:12.980> chemical<00:06:13.520> activity<00:06:13.640> and<00:06:14.240> of

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.510 
activity there must be a Chell
electrical<00:06:20.540> activity<00:06:20.960> is<00:06:21.440> that<00:06:21.650> right<00:06:21.860> now

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
electrical activity is that right now

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.860 
electrical activity is that right now
the<00:06:23.000> next<00:06:23.270> point<00:06:23.480> which<00:06:23.630> you<00:06:23.660> have<00:06:23.810> to

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
the next point which you have to

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.650 
the next point which you have to
understand<00:06:24.350> is<00:06:24.530> that<00:06:25.010> look<00:06:25.190> here<00:06:25.450> here<00:06:26.450> the

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
understand is that look here here the

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.390 
understand is that look here here the
pressure<00:06:27.010> ventricle<00:06:28.010> has<00:06:28.070> started

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
pressure ventricle has started

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.180 
pressure ventricle has started
contraction<00:06:29.080> pressure<00:06:30.080> has<00:06:30.290> gone<00:06:30.530> very

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
contraction pressure has gone very

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.610 
contraction pressure has gone very
rapidly<00:06:31.580> up<00:06:32.110> do<00:06:33.110> you<00:06:33.200> think<00:06:33.410> it<00:06:33.500> is<00:06:33.590> possible

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
rapidly up do you think it is possible

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.360 
rapidly up do you think it is possible
without<00:06:34.220> depolarization<00:06:34.970> of<00:06:35.060> ventricles<00:06:35.120> so

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
without depolarization of ventricles so

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.110 
without depolarization of ventricles so
depolarizing<00:06:37.370> current<00:06:37.400> is<00:06:37.910> QRS<00:06:39.370> so<00:06:40.370> this<00:06:40.520> QRS

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
depolarizing current is QRS so this QRS

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.930 
depolarizing current is QRS so this QRS
is<00:06:41.300> showing<00:06:41.630> that<00:06:42.229> there<00:06:42.650> is<00:06:42.940> depolarization

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
is showing that there is depolarization

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.690 
is showing that there is depolarization
of<00:06:44.060> ventricles<00:06:44.350> and<00:06:45.350> if<00:06:46.040> you<00:06:46.160> print<00:06:46.370> ago<00:06:46.550> that

start and pressure in the ventricle goes

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.730
