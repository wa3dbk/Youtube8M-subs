hand and just sand down the whole wheel

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.619 
hand and just sand down the whole wheel
so<00:00:44.769> you<00:00:44.800> can<00:00:44.949> if<00:00:45.430> there's<00:00:45.760> any<00:00:45.970> rust<00:00:46.329> or

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
so you can if there's any rust or

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.119 
so you can if there's any rust or

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
anything like that you want to get that

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.859 
anything like that you want to get that
off<00:00:48.309> and<00:00:48.610> plus<00:00:49.150> you<00:00:49.269> want<00:00:49.330> to<00:00:49.449> have<00:00:49.540> a<00:00:49.570> rough

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:49.869 
off and plus you want to have a rough

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:51.930 
off and plus you want to have a rough
surface<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.530> paint<00:00:50.710> on<00:00:50.920> so<00:00:51.460> it'll<00:00:51.640> stick

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
surface to paint on so it'll stick

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:02.800 
surface to paint on so it'll stick
better<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:53.140> I'm<00:00:53.229> going<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.409> do<00:00:53.500> that<00:00:53.650> right<00:00:53.920> now

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.119 

once<00:01:03.810> you've<00:01:03.960> got<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.199> wheels<00:01:04.590> nice<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
once you've got your wheels nice and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.430 
once you've got your wheels nice and
sanded<00:01:05.489> down<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.750> want<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> clean<00:01:07.140> them<00:01:07.230> off

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
sanded down you want to clean them off

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.770 
sanded down you want to clean them off
and<00:01:07.800> I<00:01:08.160> reckon<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.880> easiest<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and I reckon the easiest way to do that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
and I reckon the easiest way to do that
just<00:01:09.930> take<00:01:10.140> an<00:01:10.290> air<00:01:10.380> compressor<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:13.640> blow<00:01:14.640> off

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
just take an air compressor and blow off

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.350 
just take an air compressor and blow off
any<00:01:15.090> dirt<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.450> might<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:17.360> then

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
any dirt that might be on them and then

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740 
any dirt that might be on them and then
you<00:01:18.690> want<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> take<00:01:19.170> some<00:01:20.180> paint<00:01:21.180> thinner<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you want to take some paint thinner and

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.120 
you want to take some paint thinner and
what<00:01:22.440> paint<00:01:22.680> thinner<00:01:22.920> does<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.690> it<00:01:24.860> cleans<00:01:25.860> off

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
what paint thinner does is it cleans off

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.480 
what paint thinner does is it cleans off
all<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.760> brake<00:01:27.180> dust<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.770> stuff<00:01:29.280> from

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
all the brake dust and the stuff from

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.180 
all the brake dust and the stuff from
sanding<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.500> makes<00:01:31.950> them<00:01:32.040> really

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
sanding and it just makes them really

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.830 
sanding and it just makes them really
clean<00:01:32.400> ready<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> paint<00:01:33.330> on<00:01:33.510> them<00:01:33.660> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
clean ready for it to paint on them and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.050 
clean ready for it to paint on them and
just<00:01:34.320> what<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.830> do<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.280> off<00:01:35.400> clean<00:01:35.790> rag

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
just what you do is get off clean rag

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.030 
just what you do is get off clean rag
and<00:01:36.360> put<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.050> paint<00:01:37.259> thinner<00:01:37.410> on<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:37.920> then

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and put the paint thinner on it and then

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.190 
and put the paint thinner on it and then
rub<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> wheels<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.080> an

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
rub that on the wheels and then have an

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.859 
rub that on the wheels and then have an
extra<00:01:40.530> clean<00:01:40.740> rag<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.940> wipe<00:01:42.330> off<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
extra clean rag so you can wipe off the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
that could be on there that would make

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.960 
that could be on there that would make
the<00:02:15.690> paint<00:02:15.900> not<00:02:16.110> stick<00:02:16.440> now<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.760> want<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
do is tape off your tires so that no

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
paint will get onto the tires the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.030 
paint will get onto the tires the
easiest<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.350> many<00:02:25.530> ways<00:02:25.710> but<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
easiest in this many ways but the

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
you want to let get it a quite a while

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.800 
you want to let get it a quite a while
to<00:06:00.520> dry<00:06:00.700> before<00:06:01.030> you<00:06:01.120> put<00:06:01.150> it<00:06:01.390> back<00:06:01.420> on<00:06:01.540> your
