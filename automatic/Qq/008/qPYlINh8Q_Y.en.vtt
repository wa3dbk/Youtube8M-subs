doing out here today we use instead a
system<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.070> we<00:02:45.160> call<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.489> diode<00:02:45.910> gun<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:47.220> we

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
system that we call the diode gun and we

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.130 
system that we call the diode gun and we
set<00:02:48.459> up<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.700> lights<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.269> sequence<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.110> that

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
set up the lights and sequence so that

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.280 
set up the lights and sequence so that
they<00:02:50.590> travel<00:02:50.860> down<00:02:51.310> at<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.239> exact<00:02:52.660> same<00:02:52.900> speed

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
they travel down at the exact same speed

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.840 
they travel down at the exact same speed
that<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.709> countermeasure<00:02:54.220> would<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.550> going

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
that the countermeasure would be going

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.300 
that the countermeasure would be going
so<00:02:55.330> we<00:02:55.450> can<00:02:55.480> see<00:02:55.900> then<00:02:56.200> with<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.070> high-speed

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
frames per second we can see precisely

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.840 
frames per second we can see precisely
where<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.739> countermeasure<00:03:03.250> would<00:03:03.579> have<00:03:03.700> hit

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
where the countermeasure would have hit

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.930 
where the countermeasure would have hit
