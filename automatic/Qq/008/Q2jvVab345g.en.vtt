00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.690
 oli 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.700
 and in this video I'm going to share 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.510
 some ideas that occurred to me 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.389
 because like you it happens to me too 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.449
 that sometimes I do not know what to wear and I think 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.150
 that this is very common among all 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.740
 women and there is not one that never 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.740
 I asked what I wear 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:44.350
 and many times the same to me always 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.870
 it happens and there are times 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.789
 that I forget the clothes I have 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.600
 and it's very strange and I do not know why it happens 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:55.570
 but it happens to me then there are times that I 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.030
 She says why do not you put it all because 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.149
 you do not use the other nothing but 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 characters and more that I do not want to wear it 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.549
 but I forget that I have it and 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 I never flew it with is then also 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.670
 it occurred to me that it would be a good idea to defeat 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.690
 all the clothes so you do not always see 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.759
 just like a portrait and the truth is that 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.550
 I had nothing to do then I put myself 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:27.340
 as to think and do things and try to 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.340
 look for a way that you can rotate all 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.080
 my clothes so as not to see me always 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.910
 the first idea 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.670
 it's like the one I like the least and the least 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.020
 practice because it occurred to me to put in 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.550
 a hook 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.910
 a blouse and above put a 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.620
 a sweater or a shirt or something with that 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:59.960
 combine here 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.570
 then put all the others and day 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.680
 by day to grab one and use it and 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.050
 grabbing another and another and so on but this 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.870
 idea is not very practical for me because 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.050
 my closet is very small and then not 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.220
 I fit all the big ones with two 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.990
 matches nothing else then if it serves you 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.320
 you think it's a way then you can 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.930
 use I have the idea I also have 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.050
 it happened that you can do as a style 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.200
 inventory of all pants 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.790
 blouses sweaters jackets blankets all 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.330
 what you have in your closet and then 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.100
 Well, you go like choosing this with this and 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.650
 this one with this one and that's how you create the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.260
 looks 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.750
 to my mind as nothing practical because 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.540
 you have your looks made then every 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.120
 you will choose the same time and you will not 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.410
 choose or rotate with the other clothes that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.490
 do you have 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.720
 The third idea I liked the most and it's like 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.030
 more didactic and it's about doing as 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.740
 the inventory but on cards 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.110
 So here on the cards 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.590
 putting tennis 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.590
 pink dress 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.470
 pants blouses and so you're writing 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.010
 all the clothes you have on cards and 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.950
 then they can separate it by pants 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:32.269
 blouses and shirts and coats and jackets 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.390
 and sweaters and whatever then you go 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.420
 choosing a card to create a 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.030
 look and so it goes as being more random 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.659
 for me to say that gave me a little 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.680
 lazy to do all the cards is a 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:52.180
 good idea but if it requires a lot of time 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.040
 first something else 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.200
 idea number 4 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.240
 idea number 4 is the one I liked the most 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.210
 and the one that I think works best for 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.340
 this to combine the garments 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.760
 randomly and it gives you as a range 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 greater but as it is more difficult to 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.850
 explain 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.100
 I tell you this video so that you 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.290
 invite good what I did was create 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.200
 a list of the theory in excel what 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.670
 first thing you have to do is create a 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:27.310
 inventory or list of all your garments 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.900
 and you are going to put a key and then pants 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.960
 well I put it as pants 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.009
 calls is usually the plus or shoes 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.039
 then everything will continue to be 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:39.680
 since you have each category established 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:43.490
 and everything is already listed let's put 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.129
 the formula the formula is diagonal search 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.830
 Random between you and they will go out 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:52.399
 then you will select in the first 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.909
 parentheses are the numbers 

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:54.909
 in the key 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.160
 then you will select the range of 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.250
 clothes that you want me to contemplate this 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.470
 random selection at the end you have 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.490
 to close the formula with parentheses and 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:25.540
 give before this way when you press the 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.630
 press button will give you a look 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.270
 completely random but I hope that 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.950
 they have been useful of these four 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.350
 recommendations for making 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:39.340
 different and so I invite you to what 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.610
 try and try it and if it comes out 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.960
 there some look like weird that flat 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.920
 you say no not to grow 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:51.130
 follow him to try and combine with 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.470
 other things and then for that is super 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.170
 useful for these days that flat out not 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.500
 You know what to put on, because there he can give you 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:02.410
 a good idea and if they have any 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.030
 the comment or something can leave it to me 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.550
 down here in the comments or 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.070
