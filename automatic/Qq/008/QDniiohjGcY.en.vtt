00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
or maybe a bit of information if

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.359 
or maybe a bit of information if
afterward<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.070> of

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
afterward you just get a little bit of

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.280 
afterward you just get a little bit of
caffeine<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:51.360> sort<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.689> highlighting

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
caffeine it's sort of like highlighting

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
caffeine it's sort of like highlighting
a<00:01:52.380> piece<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:52.920> memory<00:01:53.040> maybe<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.820> do

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
a piece of your memory maybe if you do

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
a piece of your memory maybe if you do
that<00:01:54.119> your<00:01:54.390> brain<00:01:54.540> will<00:01:54.810> include<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> in

tonight's consolidation the half-life of
caffeine<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:58.560> six<00:01:58.920> hours<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.700> if<00:01:59.850> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
caffeine is about six hours so if you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.490 
caffeine is about six hours so if you
were<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.240> drink<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> 200<00:02:00.990> milligrams<00:02:01.350> of

caffeine that they're recommending for

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.030

there<00:02:05.430> would<00:02:05.520> still<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.850> hundred

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
there would still be a hundred

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.029 
there would still be a hundred
milligrams<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.990> your<00:02:07.140> body<00:02:07.350> at<00:02:07.619> 4:00<00:02:07.890> a.m.

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
that can affect sleep quality so maybe

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.420 
that can affect sleep quality so maybe
it's<00:02:10.410> better<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.619> try<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:10.920> during<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> day

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
