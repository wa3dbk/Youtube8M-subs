00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.189
 Rodrigo Pinto 14 years discovered the ballet 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.189
 10 o'clock at will in the dance 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.610
 you clap with the gift of the conversation saying that 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.480
 is and see and hear of truth and music 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.269
 classic 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.850
 some houses are signed and then 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.850
 I gave up here and it's there. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:55.870
 today's goals are to stay and look good 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:58.659
 worked and stay with pedestrians to pass 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.860
 for example companies or schools 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:05.409
 so some exercises other times 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.649
 some variations that we 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.750
 make your movements more difficult to 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.020
 see and where to spend the body can 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.810
 when you see several complications 15 with 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:22.500
 the technique and we have skipped a lot and this 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.500
 power one of the obstacles 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.340
 the school and here the ballet are two things 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.000
 who told me that they demand a lot from me 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.070
 and I have to organize it's a lot to 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.410
 to be able to reconcile the two things I 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.030
 I can here a long time and a lot of time with 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.350
 people and with colleagues and therefore 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.930
 school ended but when the family 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.170
 but with a home a family and the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.810
 and even in the literal sense went with 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:03.420
 uncles the ballet teachers who 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:05.290
 discovered the dance is my desire is 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.560
 invite a fish in the water 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.430
 one hour I am and then the phrases remain 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.610
 long 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.950
 the diogo olive leaves for the music and 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.600

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.730

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.440
 It was with this presentation that 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.140
 the first place in paris in the category 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.140
 classic junior at that same time 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.790
 to reach this level were 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.190
 many hours of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.510
 work a week is part of the school 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.200

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.970
 a professional ethanol company 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.870
 Diogo does not like to fail a lot 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.770
 happy 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.350
 I like to make Jose Oliveira have 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.670
 14 years has already gained several stages and 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.270
 bags for everyone 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.060
 among them a scholarship in bolshoi mexico 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.340
 not being able to keep because in the kitchen 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.340
 on the essential lines 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.040
 now just like rodrigo pinto goes in village 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.340
 new york at the end of the paris contest 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.170
 katherine fortuna and mariana caldeira do 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.170
 You do not like thirteen either. 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:55.599
 I return the same effort country 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.519
 fatigue three watches pt of 9 years dance 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.540
 since the 4 was also in the contest 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.220
 interest together with 40 Portuguese 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.650
 went well 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.019
 we are growing our own jurors there 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.180
 American nut henry has been davos 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.959
 down because portugal is right 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.079
 is evolving quite physically 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.790
 thanks to the championships that open 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.799
 eyes to our students and our 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.479
 teachers and both the fact that it is a 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.520
 competition, wanting to do more and more 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:29.020
 It's best when I see myself like this in the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.139
 foreigner is strange because first it is 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.910
 way out of my May and then more than 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.100
 It's also good because we're always new 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.650
 new people teachers in sÃ£o 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.180
 right here, but here we are 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.960
 played very well and started the 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.449
 we remain without a survey 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:53.380
 like there have a way that we 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:58.479
 Let's get this catarina. 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:01.050
 mariana diogo oliveira and rodrigo pinto 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.840
 are the new generation of classical dance 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.460
 Portuguese and want to conquer the world 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.240
 worth is not 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.240
 I hope so
