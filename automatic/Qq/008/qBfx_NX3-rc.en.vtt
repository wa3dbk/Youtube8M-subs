00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
don't know what I just thought to ask to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.580 
don't know what I just thought to ask to
see<00:00:24.330> if<00:00:24.390> they<00:00:24.539> had<00:00:24.750> them<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.080> they<00:00:25.289> had<00:00:25.410> one

see if they had them and they had one

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.970
