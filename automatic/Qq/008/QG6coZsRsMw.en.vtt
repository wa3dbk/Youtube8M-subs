 They say that they are going to rest in Sochi 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.769
 situation dictates security measures not 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.959
 precluded clashes undermining

 see how it happens by 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.890
 Apparently on the other side there is no 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.350
 one Ukrainian border guard who 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.750
 I would now be guarded checkpoint but 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.240

 inspect the car the bus and their flow 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.090
 over time only increases 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.400
 will drive up the main forces that is, people 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.680
 who served in the border troops here 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.840

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.200
 proper equipment then everything will be 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.840

 stated that the main purpose of all this 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.099
 resubordination is the organization 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.060
 unimpeded border crossing for 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.010
