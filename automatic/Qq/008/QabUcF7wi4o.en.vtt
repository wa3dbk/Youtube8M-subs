you should have more than enough memory

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.390 
you should have more than enough memory
now<00:04:00.530> one<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.890> things<00:04:01.040> you're<00:04:01.190> probably

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
now one of the things you're probably

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.760 
now one of the things you're probably
all<00:04:01.790> wondering<00:04:01.820> is<00:04:02.570> what<00:04:03.020> exactly<00:04:03.470> is<00:04:03.620> the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
all wondering is what exactly is the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.100 
all wondering is what exactly is the
processor<00:04:04.340> inside<00:04:04.730> right<00:04:05.450> now<00:04:05.480> we<00:04:05.690> can't

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
processor inside right now we can't

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.720 
processor inside right now we can't
specify<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.739> whole<00:04:06.950> story<00:04:07.250> because<00:04:07.400> Samsung

specify the whole story because Samsung

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.430 
specify the whole story because Samsung

just what we're using as you can see
navigation<00:04:22.349> is<00:04:22.530> pretty<00:04:22.979> smooth<00:04:23.340> although<00:04:23.879> it

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
navigation is pretty smooth although it

navigation is pretty smooth although it
doesn't<00:04:24.150> seem<00:04:24.389> as<00:04:24.539> mind-blowing<00:04:24.900> as<00:04:25.229> maximum

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
Sybok dr. should all right so a couple

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.899 
Sybok dr. should all right so a couple
of<00:04:31.409> other<00:04:31.560> new<00:04:31.860> innovations<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.520> Samsung's

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
of other new innovations that Samsung's

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:33.980 
of other new innovations that Samsung's
put<00:04:33.120> in<00:04:33.210> here<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.479> we're<00:04:33.569> going<00:04:33.689> to<00:04:33.719> see<00:04:33.870> if<00:04:33.930> we

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
put in here and we're going to see if we

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.800 
put in here and we're going to see if we
can<00:04:34.199> show<00:04:34.409> you<00:04:34.439> is<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.520> bunch<00:04:36.180> of<00:04:36.270> gestures

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
can show you is a bunch of gestures

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.230 
can show you is a bunch of gestures
they're<00:04:37.620> building<00:04:37.919> upon<00:04:38.219> what<00:04:38.639> they<00:04:38.759> did<00:04:38.969> in<00:04:39.180> a

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
they're building upon what they did in a

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.390 
they're building upon what they did in a
gs3<00:04:39.719> before<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.409> so<00:04:40.740> you're<00:04:40.860> getting<00:04:41.009> things

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
gs3 before and so you're getting things

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.219 
gs3 before and so you're getting things
you<00:04:41.699> maybe<00:04:41.909> we<00:04:42.120> can<00:04:42.270> pull<00:04:42.449> up<00:04:42.479> Flipboard<00:04:43.110> we

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
you maybe we can pull up Flipboard we

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.969 
you maybe we can pull up Flipboard we
could<00:04:43.379> show<00:04:43.560> this<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.919> you<00:04:45.469> he's<00:04:46.469> building<00:04:46.889> it

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
could show this to you he's building it

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.740 
could show this to you he's building it
right<00:04:47.009> now<00:04:47.310> but<00:04:47.999> you<00:04:48.120> can<00:04:48.150> actually<00:04:48.389> go<00:04:48.629> ahead

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
right now but you can actually go ahead

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.379 
right now but you can actually go ahead
and<00:04:48.930> if<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:49.259> tap<00:04:49.699> or<00:04:50.699> actually<00:04:51.000> if<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.180> hover

Arab you now works with your finger as
you<00:04:53.879> can<00:04:54.090> see<00:04:54.270> here<00:04:54.509> we<00:04:54.599> had<00:04:54.719> to<00:04:54.810> get<00:04:54.900> pretty

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
you can see here we had to get pretty

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.939 
you can see here we had to get pretty
close<00:04:55.259> but<00:04:55.560> it'll<00:04:56.069> show<00:04:56.250> up<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.460> preview<00:05:00.949> hover

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
close but it'll show up a preview hover

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.469 
close but it'll show up a preview hover
over<00:05:02.279> Flipboard<00:05:02.699> you<00:05:02.789> can<00:05:02.939> see<00:05:03.060> pulls<00:05:03.360> a

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
over Flipboard you can see pulls a
