00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.269
 Since 1960, consumption patterns have been constantly evolving since the first 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.650
 tower 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.570
 and yet 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.570
 reduce waste is not easy 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.960
 it was a few simple gestures 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.310
 in fact there is frankly obvious 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.310
 it's going to be for example we avoid having 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.970
 overpack years 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.920
 sometimes we will avoid 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.090
 as much as possible to have ideas two individual we will rather take 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.020
 from detours to packaging 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.400
 we're going to go back to focus products and we see 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.960
 in the mode 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.110
 or even at home for example we're going 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.110
 we will keep drafts will do double-sided printing 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.850
 in 2007 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.780
 370 kilos of waste per capita were eliminated by the different 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 door-to-door collections but for some 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.190
 reduce waste 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.570
 this is the case of this history-geo teacher installed in reims since soon 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.750
 years 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.240
 I let ourselves stay at the same moment 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.510
 m the oldest of only 0 15 euro 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.410
 the tribunal 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.520
 and that's what I can do more than recently 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.560
 there is the amount of household garbage 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.360
 every year the paradoxes until 2007 the stream of waste deposited in 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.930
 dump the debt in greece 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.270
 next to that I think he still has a lot of work for the future 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.360
 you were going in in the buildings of the agglomeration you were going to see in 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.450
 garbage cans in garbage rooms 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.780
 houdan in the basements you still have a lot of bulky that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.100
 are dropped in the wrong place so if the programmer is why 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.860
 really accentuate this communication for the dump 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.010
 it's also certainly our way of life that has tinkered a lot with the 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.910
 house does a lot of work oneself so all these works generates 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.360
 a lot of waste 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.880
 from where in reinforcement with interest today of the waste disposal 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.670
 it's been a year now since the Grenelle environment set up the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.219
 first voices framework on waste reduction 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.310
 in a few months paid application decrees complete the 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:14.230
 legislation
