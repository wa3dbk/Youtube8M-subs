about these not just what these but how

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.689 
about these not just what these but how
many<00:00:18.480> bees<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.350> out<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.189> great<00:00:20.490> big

this is the best trick there is for

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.140 
this is the best trick there is for
studying<00:00:26.450> bees<00:00:26.720> you<00:00:27.650> put<00:00:27.920> out<00:00:28.070> an<00:00:28.400> attractant

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
studying bees you put out an attractant

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.440 
studying bees you put out an attractant
that<00:00:29.689> gets<00:00:29.960> a<00:00:30.230> male<00:00:30.529> bee<00:00:30.860> to<00:00:31.849> come<00:00:32.059> out<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:32.360> the

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
that gets a male bee to come out of the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.560 
that gets a male bee to come out of the
forest<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.190> I<00:00:34.190> can<00:00:34.430> count<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.180> measure<00:00:35.420> it

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
forest and I can count it and measure it

forest and I can count it and measure it
and<00:00:35.900> identify<00:00:36.830> it<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.250> do<00:00:37.489> all<00:00:37.520> my<00:00:38.000> science

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
and identify it and do all my science

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.240 
and identify it and do all my science
and<00:00:39.670> their<00:00:40.670> bees<00:00:40.850> coming<00:00:41.180> in<00:00:41.390> already<00:00:42.220> when<00:00:43.220> I

and their bees coming in already when I
put<00:00:43.610> out<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.790> little<00:00:44.090> bit<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.330> the<00:00:44.510> chemical<00:00:44.930> the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
put out a little bit of the chemical the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.100 
put out a little bit of the chemical the
bees<00:00:45.890> come<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.370> it<00:00:46.489> thinking<00:00:46.850> I'm<00:00:47.570> in<00:00:47.840> luck

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
what its ecological ties are what food

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.040 
what its ecological ties are what food
it<00:03:52.200> eats<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.680> what<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:52.920> pollinates<00:03:53.250> basically
