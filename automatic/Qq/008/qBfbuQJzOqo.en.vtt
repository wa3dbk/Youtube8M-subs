those<00:03:58.690> electric<00:03:59.170> current<00:03:59.530> filaments<00:04:00.010> will

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
those electric current filaments will

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.910

attract matter from the nearby corona

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.570 
attract matter from the nearby corona
and<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:04.420> corona<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.840> course<00:04:05.170> itself<00:04:05.590> appears

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
and the corona of course itself appears

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.910 
and the corona of course itself appears
dark<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.090> these<00:04:07.240> images<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.380> material

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
dark in these images so the material

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.460 
dark in these images so the material
suddenly<00:04:09.430> appears<00:04:09.850> as<00:04:10.210> knots<00:04:10.960> of<00:04:11.230> matter

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
suddenly appears as knots of matter

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.560 
suddenly appears as knots of matter
along<00:04:11.860> these<00:04:12.100> filaments<00:04:12.460> and<00:04:12.730> then<00:04:13.330> they<00:04:13.510> are
