00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Tell me guys, what's the Daniel King this is? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 betting video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.490
 the first thing we have to define 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.559
 before starting to play poker is with the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.730
 type of bet will be an essential part 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.120
 about the game 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.960
 bets they can be three 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.750
 after issuing bets with limits and after 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.570
 limit the first pot shape that we 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.760
 Let's analyze, it will be put to the limit but 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.609
 after the limit must always be of the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.880
 da pide blight such as a game 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.969
 hardest blind is a plug and 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.520
 skills are two tokens bet 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.800
 limited will always have two tokens 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.899
 then for example if the player only 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.149
 want to make it really simple during a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.370
 hand it will always have to increase two 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.120
 and can not increase even less 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.129
 more 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.649
 if you have an increase before you already 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.350
 the two chips actually it always will 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.129
 have to be 4 chips or never 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.129
 any less 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.550
 bets they will change later on 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.010
 and preflop on the river and on the flop 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.900
 there is always going to be the big blind limit 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.090
 and when it comes to the suit it's going to be 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.610
 always double that limit then as 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 for example the game with big bets 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.350
 blind two tokens 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.570
 the turn and the river will be 104 chips 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.030
 there is also a limit of increases that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.630
 we can make a hand that is limited 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 to four raises per round only 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.299
 for example if the player increases to 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.970
 two other chips increases to 46 and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.860
 another for eight bets brake 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.290
 this is the maximum that can be posted 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.170
 during that betting round 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.549
 The second form of betting is poker with 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.799
 pot limit 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.250
 This seems easier but may vary 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.500
 of lesser value will be the big blind with 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.619
 example in the previous case would be two 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.259
 to the limit of the pot that should be 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.719
 be counted and seen what one runs the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.899
 pot to bet 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.119
 can vary from any value between this 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.430
 for example if the player can 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.360
 have ten chips in the player and can bet 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.450
 between two tokens or ten to ten tokens 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.710
 If you decide to bet the ten chips come 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.530
 the turn of another player 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.110
 is he could post it can only 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.980
 paying the 10 chips could discard the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.410
 his hand 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.440
 I do not want to pay or he can 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.110
 increase its momentum varies from the minimum 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.960
 ten chips that would be the car that 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.580
 the person has already made more of it than 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.560
 has to be at least twice the increase 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.560
 40 or more chips because 40 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.750
 because there are ten tokens that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.110
 belongs the first player to bet 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.270
 but the ten chips are in the pot but the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.760
 ten tracks that the player would have to pay 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.820
 to complete this can then believe 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.880
 with 30 fishes then increase of it will have 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.460
 that being will be able to be of those 30 chips 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.380
 more than the initial 10min you used to 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.310
 pay an increase of 40 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.100
 tokens the last form of mouth that exists 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.380
 is the poker without limit of bets 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.930
 in it you can post any value 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.810
 since then the big blind 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.180
 to the value of your STEC or chips 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.890
 you have at that moment on the table may 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.310
 vary from any value 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.200
 so this was the video about betting 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.610
 next video will be a general overview of 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.010
 everything we 've done so far as 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.000
 betting strength of the cards the distribution 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.980
 of the cards 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.680
 will be a review of everything we 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.800
 We saw you then, I'll wait for you next time. 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800
