00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
work we drink pressure because it sounds

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.920 
work we drink pressure because it sounds
like<00:00:59.710> it's<00:00:59.920> making<00:01:00.220> you<00:01:00.370> better<00:01:01.089> yet<00:01:01.750> today

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
like it's making you better yet today

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.320 
like it's making you better yet today
where<00:01:02.920> pressure<00:01:03.159> can't<00:01:03.280> be<00:01:03.610> defined<00:01:03.940> because

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
where pressure can't be defined because

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.600 
where pressure can't be defined because
it's<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.629> personal<00:01:05.050> feeling

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
it's a personal feeling

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.460 
it's a personal feeling
it's<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.240> question<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:07.660> can<00:01:08.050> be<00:01:08.080> nothing

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
it's a question that can be nothing

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.140 
it's a question that can be nothing
because<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.220> means<00:01:09.490> one<00:01:10.000> thing<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.360> one<00:01:10.510> person

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
because it means one thing to one person

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.280 
because it means one thing to one person
so<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.270> real<00:01:13.450> moral<00:01:13.780> that<00:01:13.930> is<00:01:14.020> if<00:01:14.140> you're

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
so the real moral that is if you're

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.160 
so the real moral that is if you're
getting<00:01:14.470> better<00:01:14.800> in<00:01:14.980> my<00:01:15.130> opinion<00:01:15.160> why<00:01:16.170> anila

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
getting better in my opinion why anila

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.630 
getting better in my opinion why anila
less<00:01:17.320> if<00:01:17.530> someone<00:01:17.830> said<00:01:17.980> if<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.160> grab<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.490> at

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
less if someone said if I grab it at

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.970 
less if someone said if I grab it at
this<00:01:18.820> pressure<00:01:19.240> I<00:01:19.600> hit<00:01:20.080> these<00:01:20.290> shots<00:01:20.620> and<00:01:20.920> I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
this pressure I hit these shots and I

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.270 
this pressure I hit these shots and I
get<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.580> spike<00:01:21.910> on<00:01:22.090> your<00:01:22.210> no<00:01:22.360> shot<00:01:22.920> yep<00:01:23.920> shots

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
get this spike on your no shot yep shots

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.580 
get this spike on your no shot yep shots
better<00:01:24.610> than<00:01:24.790> why<00:01:24.940> I<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.180> use<00:01:25.510> expiration<00:01:26.290> it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
better than why I to use expiration it

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.650 
better than why I to use expiration it
but<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.580> probably<00:01:27.820> it's<00:01:28.210> linked<00:01:28.479> because

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
but it is probably it's linked because

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.530 
but it is probably it's linked because
if<00:01:29.110> he's<00:01:29.290> hitting<00:01:29.560> pushes<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:30.460> sauce<00:01:30.940> yes

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
if he's hitting pushes and sauce yes

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.120 
if he's hitting pushes and sauce yes
we're<00:01:31.780> feeling<00:01:32.140> like<00:01:32.290> it's<00:01:32.350> softer<00:01:33.010> he's

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
we're feeling like it's softer he's

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.190 
we're feeling like it's softer he's
probably<00:01:33.430> reduced<00:01:33.970> intention<00:01:34.750> he<00:01:35.020> can

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
probably reduced intention he can

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200 
probably reduced intention he can
release<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.890> club<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.130> bit<00:01:36.340> better<00:01:36.580> yeah<00:01:36.970> it's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
release the club a bit better yeah it's

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.780 
release the club a bit better yeah it's
related<00:01:37.600> galleries<00:01:38.080> I<00:01:38.229> guess<00:01:38.470> reason<00:01:38.890> is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
related galleries I guess reason is

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.609 
related galleries I guess reason is
helping<00:01:40.270> him<00:01:40.390> with<00:01:40.509> his<00:01:40.540> release<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:41.200> lighter

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
helping him with his release a lighter

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.590 
helping him with his release a lighter

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
gross stereotype but it is a pattern I

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.859 
gross stereotype but it is a pattern I
see<00:01:49.660> when<00:01:50.440> I<00:01:50.470> d2<00:01:50.920> tradesmen<00:01:51.640> people<00:01:52.570> using

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
see when I d2 tradesmen people using

see when I d2 tradesmen people using
hammers<00:01:53.340> tools<00:01:54.340> allotted<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.300> very<00:01:55.690> strong

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
hammers tools allotted a very strong

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.550 
hammers tools allotted a very strong
physically<00:01:57.119> but

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
physically but

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.950 
physically but
no<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.939> obvious<00:02:00.329> generations<00:02:00.810> there

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
no and it's obvious generations there

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.899 
no and it's obvious generations there
are<00:02:01.110> some<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.470> for<00:02:01.649> lots<00:02:01.860> but<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.340> no<00:02:02.610> control

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
are some do for lots but have no control

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.779 
are some do for lots but have no control
so<00:02:05.539> officially<00:02:06.140> becomes<00:02:06.560> almost<00:02:06.829> ceased<00:02:07.549> but

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
so officially becomes almost ceased but

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.300 
so officially becomes almost ceased but
immobilien<00:02:08.269> is<00:02:08.720> much<00:02:08.929> less<00:02:09.140> than<00:02:09.319> mine<00:02:09.500> and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
immobilien is much less than mine and
