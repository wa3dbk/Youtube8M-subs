I can use to do this well it really
comes<00:00:25.590> down<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.010> question<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.670> what

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
comes down the question is is what

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.570 
comes down the question is is what
software<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.019> planning<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.859> install<00:00:29.010> on

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
software are you planning to install on

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
software are you planning to install on
all<00:00:29.849> these<00:00:30.000> remote<00:00:30.359> computers<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.109> then<00:00:31.529> go

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
all these remote computers and then go

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.370 
all these remote computers and then go
from<00:00:31.830> there<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.390> easiest<00:00:34.050> way<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
from there so the the easiest way to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.920 
from there so the the easiest way to
install<00:00:35.149> software<00:00:36.149> remotely<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.809> these

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
install software remotely on these

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.139 
install software remotely on these
computers<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> using<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.129> kind<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.520> script

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
computers is using some kind of script

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.869 
computers is using some kind of script
so<00:00:39.809> using<00:00:40.469> group<00:00:40.710> policies<00:00:41.280> or<00:00:41.430> such<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.670> can

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so using group policies or such you can

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.700 
so using group policies or such you can
call<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> script<00:00:42.629> whenever<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.079> computer

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
call a script whenever the the computer

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.889 
call a script whenever the the computer
boots<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.190> person<00:00:44.520> logs<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
boots or the person logs in and with a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.660 
boots or the person logs in and with a
lot<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> software<00:00:46.770> basically<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> can

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
lot of software basically what you can

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.830 
lot of software basically what you can
do<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.559> trigger<00:00:49.950> an<00:00:50.850> installation

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
do is you can trigger an installation

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.439 
do is you can trigger an installation
routine<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:53.010> switches<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
routine with switches so one of the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.959 
routine with switches so one of the
first<00:00:55.079> switches<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.039> slash<00:00:56.370> Q

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
first switches you do is you do slash Q

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.869 
first switches you do is you do slash Q
and<00:00:57.300> /<00:00:57.780> Q<00:00:58.170> makes<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> quiet<00:00:58.980> install<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.730> when

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and / Q makes it a quiet install so when

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.029 
and / Q makes it a quiet install so when
you<00:01:00.000> whenever<00:01:00.300> you're<00:01:00.510> having<00:01:00.660> installs<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you whenever you're having installs and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.920 
you whenever you're having installs and
they're<00:01:02.190> quiet<00:01:02.520> what<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> means<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
they're quiet what that means is the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500 
they're quiet what that means is the
user<00:01:04.290> isn't<00:01:05.220> shown<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.970> installation

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
user isn't shown the installation

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.969 
user isn't shown the installation
process<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.170> they<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> little

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
process so they don't see the little

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
process so they don't see the little
next<00:01:08.340> screens<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> cancel<00:01:09.210> screens<00:01:09.510> or

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
next screens or the cancel screens or

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
next screens or the cancel screens or
any<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.520> do

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
any of that so what you can do is you do

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.859 
any of that so what you can do is you do
the<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.570> blah<00:01:13.020> blah<00:01:13.229> blah<00:01:13.530> exe<00:01:14.460> slash<00:01:15.299> Q

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the you know blah blah blah exe slash Q

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.450 
the you know blah blah blah exe slash Q
and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.740> put<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> lot<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.340> other

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and then you can put a lot of other

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.280 
and then you can put a lot of other
slashes<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> blog<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.080> called

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
slashes in the blog what are called

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
slashes in the blog what are called
switches<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.979> there<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:21.030> state<00:01:21.299> certain

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
switches in there to state certain

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.929 
switches in there to state certain
things<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.200> put<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> switch<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.340> whether

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
things you can put a switch for whether

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.370 
things you can put a switch for whether
it<00:01:24.060> should<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.299> custom<00:01:24.659> install<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it should be a custom install or a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.410 
it should be a custom install or a
switch<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> switch<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.240> or

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
switch for this or a switch for that or

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.030 
switch for this or a switch for that or
switch<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.750> other<00:01:27.869> things<00:01:27.930> now<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.890> those

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
switch for other things now all of those

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.819 
switch for other things now all of those
switches<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> look<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:30.570> is

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
switches what you have to look at is

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.260 
switches what you have to look at is
basically<00:01:31.829> that's<00:01:32.340> built<00:01:32.640> into<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> software

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
basically that's built into the software

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.700 
basically that's built into the software
itself<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.110> when<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.320> goes<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
itself so when it goes to the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
itself so when it goes to the
installation<00:01:34.950> routine<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.790> looks<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.450> see

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
installation routine it looks to see

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.840 
installation routine it looks to see
within<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.439> command<00:01:37.979> where<00:01:38.250> those<00:01:38.490> switches

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
within the command where those switches

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
within the command where those switches
configured<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.020> they<00:01:40.170> are<00:01:40.320> it'll<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
configured and if they are it'll do the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.990 
configured and if they are it'll do the
routine<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.640> you're<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> be

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
routine so if you're going to be

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.760 
routine so if you're going to be
installing<00:01:42.150> Adobe<00:01:42.780> Flash<00:01:43.110> you're<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
installing Adobe Flash you're going to
