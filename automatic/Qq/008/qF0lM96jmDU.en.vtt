00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
cut spending on the middle class again

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.699 
cut spending on the middle class again
and<00:04:11.299> then<00:04:12.299> we<00:04:12.659> have<00:04:12.690> even<00:04:12.930> less<00:04:13.229> of<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.470> middle

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
and then we have even less of a middle

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.710 
and then we have even less of a middle
class<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:14.190> what<00:04:14.579> does<00:04:14.699> that<00:04:14.729> do<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.269> creates<00:04:15.449> a

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
class and what does that do it creates a

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.569 
class and what does that do it creates a
death<00:04:16.049> spiral<00:04:16.229> for<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.739> economy<00:04:17.159> because

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
death spiral for the economy because

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.089 
death spiral for the economy because
nobody<00:04:18.030> can<00:04:18.209> buy<00:04:18.389> anything<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.680> in<00:04:19.889> the

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
nobody can buy anything and so in the

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.700 
nobody can buy anything and so in the
end<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.699> rich<00:04:20.880> don't<00:04:21.150> wind<00:04:22.019> up<00:04:22.139> benefitting

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
end the rich don't wind up benefitting

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.440 
end the rich don't wind up benefitting
either<00:04:23.010> they<00:04:23.550> do<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.880> short<00:04:24.150> run<00:04:24.240> no

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
either they do in the short run no

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.250 
either they do in the short run no
question<00:04:24.840> about<00:04:24.900> that

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
question about that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.640 
question about that
so<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.830> tune<00:04:26.039> of

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
so the tune of

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.980 
so the tune of
and<00:04:27.160> sometimes<00:04:27.550> billions<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:28.120> dollars<00:04:28.419> but<00:04:28.900> in

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
and sometimes billions of dollars but in

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.629 
and sometimes billions of dollars but in
the<00:04:29.110> long<00:04:29.380> run<00:04:29.620> we<00:04:29.949> become<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.220> third<00:04:30.460> world

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
the long run we become a third world

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.390 
the long run we become a third world
country<00:04:30.729> and<00:04:31.180> right<00:04:31.360> now<00:04:31.540> we<00:04:32.350> are<00:04:32.380> in<00:04:32.830> terms<00:04:33.220> of

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
country and right now we are in terms of

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.879 
country and right now we are in terms of
income<00:04:33.610> inequality<00:04:34.030> right<00:04:34.840> between<00:04:35.020> Cameroon

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
income inequality right between Cameroon

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.790 
income inequality right between Cameroon
and<00:04:36.130> Jamaica<00:04:36.669> that<00:04:37.600> is<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.780> disastrous<00:04:38.470> place

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
and Jamaica that is a disastrous place

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.070 
and Jamaica that is a disastrous place
we<00:04:39.010> find<00:04:39.220> ourselves<00:04:39.479> that<00:04:40.479> is<00:04:40.600> not<00:04:40.810> how<00:04:41.020> you

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
we find ourselves that is not how you

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.190 
we find ourselves that is not how you
build<00:04:41.169> a<00:04:41.440> healthy<00:04:41.710> economy
