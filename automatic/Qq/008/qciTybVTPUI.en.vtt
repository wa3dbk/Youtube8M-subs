00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
up in this playoff series and I think

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.689 
up in this playoff series and I think
that<00:06:33.960> he<00:06:34.110> did<00:06:34.259> those<00:06:34.409> last<00:06:34.620> three<00:06:34.710> games<00:06:34.860> was

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
that he did those last three games was

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.149 
that he did those last three games was
