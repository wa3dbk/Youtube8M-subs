00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
yeah the trailer was hilarious but that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230 
yeah the trailer was hilarious but that

didn't even touch the tip of the iceberg

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.870 
didn't even touch the tip of the iceberg
because<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.840> whole<00:02:04.020> movies<00:02:04.560> hilarious<00:02:04.880> so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
because this whole movies hilarious so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.960

it<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.210> very<00:02:06.299> fine<00:02:06.810> line<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.469> think<00:02:08.039> though

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it is a very fine line I do think though

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.960 
it is a very fine line I do think though
just<00:02:09.420> summing<00:02:09.750> up<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.459> more<00:02:11.459> often<00:02:11.700> than

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
just summing up that it more often than

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.260 
just summing up that it more often than
not<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.330> feels

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
not it feels

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.030 
not it feels
like<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> movie<00:02:13.720> gives<00:02:13.870> away<00:02:14.050> everything<00:02:14.650> when

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
like a movie gives away everything when

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.740 
like a movie gives away everything when
in<00:02:15.160> actuality<00:02:15.490> doesn't<00:02:16.180> really<00:02:16.480> give

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
in actuality doesn't really give

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.570 
in actuality doesn't really give
everything<00:02:17.020> away<00:02:17.140> does<00:02:17.500> happen<00:02:17.770> from<00:02:18.220> time<00:02:18.310> to

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
everything away does happen from time to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.220 
everything away does happen from time to
time<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.390> unfortunate<00:02:19.690> when<00:02:20.050> that's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
time and it's unfortunate when that's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.040 
time and it's unfortunate when that's
the<00:02:20.320> case<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.760> sometimes<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:22.090> comedies

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
the case and sometimes a comedies

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.990 
the case and sometimes a comedies
trailer<00:02:23.500> does<00:02:23.740> show<00:02:24.010> all<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.310> funniest<00:02:24.730> parts

trailer does show all the funniest parts

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.240 
trailer does show all the funniest parts
but<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.180> find<00:02:25.420> most<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.930> time<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.320> doesn't<00:02:26.590> for

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
but I find most the time it doesn't for

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.340 
but I find most the time it doesn't for
the<00:02:27.310> most<00:02:27.460> part<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.060> but<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.750> once<00:02:28.990> again<00:02:29.080> it's

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
the most part and but it once again it's

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.630 
the most part and but it once again it's
that<00:02:29.440> precarious<00:02:29.740> line<00:02:30.070> like<00:02:30.340> if<00:02:30.460> you're<00:02:30.610> a
