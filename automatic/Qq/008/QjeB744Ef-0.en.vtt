00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.509 
retention equals longer hair if your
hair<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:37.180> very<00:02:37.300> thick<00:02:37.630> or<00:02:38.230> coarser<00:02:39.040> or<00:02:39.280> more

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
hair is very thick or coarser or more

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.460 
hair is very thick or coarser or more
tightly<00:02:39.850> coiled<00:02:40.330> than<00:02:40.600> mine<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.260> you're

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
tightly coiled than mine and you're

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.470 
tightly coiled than mine and you're
interested<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.100> finger<00:02:42.430> detangling<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.209> would

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
interested in finger detangling I would

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.720 
interested in finger detangling I would
suggest<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.290> use<00:02:44.470> smaller<00:02:45.070> sections

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
suggest just to use smaller sections

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.840 
suggest just to use smaller sections
than<00:02:46.000> I'd<00:02:46.209> use<00:02:46.570> I<00:02:46.840> use<00:02:47.590> smaller<00:02:47.980> sections<00:02:48.640> when

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
than I'd use I use smaller sections when

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.820 
than I'd use I use smaller sections when
I<00:02:48.880> finger<00:02:49.330> detangle<00:02:49.840> then<00:02:50.019> when<00:02:50.170> I<00:02:50.200> use<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> comb

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
I finger detangle then when I use a comb

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.190 
I finger detangle then when I use a comb
to<00:02:51.010> detangle<00:02:51.040> because<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.209> just<00:02:52.720> can't<00:02:52.989> get

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
to detangle because I just can't get

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.810 
to detangle because I just can't get
through<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.560> thick<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.040> sections<00:02:54.489> with<00:02:54.640> my

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
through a thick of sections with my

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.140 
through a thick of sections with my
fingers<00:02:55.239> as<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.570> can<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.870> comb<00:02:56.670> does<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.790> take<00:02:57.970> me

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
fingers as I can a comb does it take me

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.970 
fingers as I can a comb does it take me
longer<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.600> finger<00:02:58.989> detangle<00:02:59.410> my<00:02:59.530> hair<00:02:59.560> than

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
longer to finger detangle my hair than

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.210 
longer to finger detangle my hair than
it<00:03:00.100> did<00:03:00.220> when<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.489> used<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.880> comb<00:03:01.120> yes<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.860> takes

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
it did when I used a comb yes it takes

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.520 
it did when I used a comb yes it takes
me<00:03:03.430> twice<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.239> amount<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.720> time<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.200> finger

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
me twice the amount of time to finger

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.890 
me twice the amount of time to finger
detangle<00:03:06.010> my<00:03:06.130> hair<00:03:06.160> as<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.880> did<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.120> comb<00:03:07.570> but<00:03:07.750> I

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
detangle my hair as it did a comb but I

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.080 
detangle my hair as it did a comb but I
think<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.310> worth<00:03:09.579> it

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
think that it is worth it

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.539 
think that it is worth it
because<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.230> amount<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.590> hair<00:03:11.829> loss<00:03:12.100> when<00:03:12.489> I

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
because the amount of hair loss when I

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.340 
because the amount of hair loss when I
finger<00:03:12.910> detangle<00:03:13.360> compared<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.959> when<00:03:14.079> I<00:03:14.110> use

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
finger detangle compared to when I use

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.300 
finger detangle compared to when I use
the<00:03:14.530> comb<00:03:14.769> is<00:03:15.040> like<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.510> little<00:03:17.230> it's<00:03:17.500> amazing

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
the comb is like so little it's amazing

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.100 
the comb is like so little it's amazing
how<00:03:18.489> little<00:03:18.519> hair<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.030> lose<00:03:19.420> when<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.780> finger

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
how little hair I lose when I finger

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.500 
how little hair I lose when I finger
detangle<00:03:20.590> my<00:03:20.709> hair<00:03:20.739> now<00:03:21.640> don't<00:03:22.060> be<00:03:22.150> mistaken

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
detangle my hair now don't be mistaken

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.050 
detangle my hair now don't be mistaken
I've<00:03:22.870> used<00:03:23.110> my<00:03:23.290> wide<00:03:23.560> tooth<00:03:23.590> comb<00:03:23.860> for<00:03:24.519> who

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
I've used my wide tooth comb for who

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.670 
I've used my wide tooth comb for who
knows<00:03:25.239> how<00:03:25.540> many<00:03:25.600> years<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.380> I've<00:03:26.470> had

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
knows how many years and I've had

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.590 
knows how many years and I've had
absolutely<00:03:27.190> no<00:03:27.430> problems<00:03:27.940> with<00:03:28.090> length<00:03:28.390> or

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
absolutely no problems with length or

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.720 
absolutely no problems with length or
tension<00:03:28.810> or<00:03:28.989> anything<00:03:29.290> else<00:03:29.620> when<00:03:30.220> it<00:03:30.340> came<00:03:30.519> to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
tension or anything else when it came to

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.880 
tension or anything else when it came to
detangling<00:03:31.239> my<00:03:31.299> hair<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.900> just<00:03:32.470> find<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.739> this

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
detangling my hair I just find that this

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.640 
detangling my hair I just find that this
process<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.640> lot<00:03:33.820> more<00:03:34.030> gentler<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:35.170> if<00:03:35.470> I

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
process is a lot more gentler so if I

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.979 
process is a lot more gentler so if I
can<00:03:35.860> be<00:03:35.980> gentler<00:03:36.459> with<00:03:36.610> my<00:03:36.850> hair<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.390> retain<00:03:37.959> a

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
can be gentler with my hair and retain a

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.660 
can be gentler with my hair and retain a
little<00:03:38.170> bit<00:03:38.350> more<00:03:38.590> length<00:03:38.829> in<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.130> process

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
little bit more length in the process

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.210 
little bit more length in the process
then<00:03:40.000> hey<00:03:40.269> why<00:03:40.900> not<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.709> have<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:42.040> mention

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
then hey why not and I have to mention

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.729 
then hey why not and I have to mention
too<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.880> finger<00:03:43.329> detangling<00:03:43.810> does<00:03:44.140> not<00:03:44.440> do<00:03:44.709> a

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
too that finger detangling does not do a

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.670 
too that finger detangling does not do a
thorough<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.430> job<00:03:45.730> as<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.060> comb<00:03:46.450> detangle<00:03:47.140> but

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
thorough of a job as a comb detangle but

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.380 
thorough of a job as a comb detangle but
for<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.100> things<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.549> do<00:03:48.610> with<00:03:48.910> my<00:03:49.090> hair

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
for the things that I do with my hair

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.630 
for the things that I do with my hair
which<00:03:49.780> right<00:03:50.110> now<00:03:50.320> is<00:03:50.560> mostly<00:03:50.769> wash<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.489> gos

anything where my hair is in a textured
style<00:03:56.410> my<00:03:57.160> fingers<00:03:57.640> get<00:03:57.880> my<00:03:58.120> hair<00:03:58.359> detangled

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
style my fingers get my hair detangled

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.960 
style my fingers get my hair detangled
more<00:03:59.470> than<00:03:59.680> enough<00:03:59.950> for<00:04:00.130> something<00:04:00.519> like<00:04:00.700> that

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
more than enough for something like that

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.880 
more than enough for something like that
now<00:04:01.540> if<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:01.750> was<00:04:01.900> going<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.260> flat<00:04:02.470> iron<00:04:02.680> my<00:04:02.769> hair

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
now if I was going to flat iron my hair

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.210 
now if I was going to flat iron my hair
or<00:04:03.430> use<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.910> paddle<00:04:04.150> brush<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.690> blow-dry<00:04:04.870> I

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
or use a paddle brush to blow-dry I

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.740 
or use a paddle brush to blow-dry I
definitely<00:04:06.220> use<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.700> comb<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:07.209> detangle<00:04:07.239> my

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
definitely use the comb to detangle my

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.100 
definitely use the comb to detangle my
hair<00:04:07.780> so<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.379> my<00:04:08.590> hair<00:04:08.860> is<00:04:08.890> 100%<00:04:10.110> detangled

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
hair so that my hair is 100% detangled

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.900 
hair so that my hair is 100% detangled
as<00:04:11.290> opposed<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.220> about

as opposed to the about

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.620 
as opposed to the about
75<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:14.440> 95<00:04:15.010> percent<00:04:15.160> detangling<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.240> get<00:04:16.480> with

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
75 to 95 percent detangling I get with

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.020 
75 to 95 percent detangling I get with
my<00:04:16.780> fingers<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:19.470> that's<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.680> y'all<00:04:20.950> I<00:04:21.220> was<00:04:21.760> a
