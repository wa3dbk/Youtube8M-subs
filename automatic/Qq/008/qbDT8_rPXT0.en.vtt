00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
house is perfect to use and then just

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.480 
house is perfect to use and then just
cut<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.030> out<00:00:15.289> cut<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.350> piece<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.650> string<00:00:17.190> ready

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
cut it out cut a piece of string ready

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.450 
cut it out cut a piece of string ready
to<00:00:17.730> go<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.810> then<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.470> know<00:00:19.619> sometimes<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
to go and then you know sometimes at the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.040 
to go and then you know sometimes at the
bottom<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> string<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> yar<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.960> it

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
bottom of the string or the yar and it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.439 
bottom of the string or the yar and it
starts<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.590> fray<00:00:22.980> like<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.910> then<00:00:24.300> it's

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
starts to fray like this and then it's

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.300 
starts to fray like this and then it's
really<00:00:24.689> difficult<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.619> them<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.800> put<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
really difficult for them to put the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.849 
really difficult for them to put the
bead<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
bead on so what you can do is just get a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.479 
bead on so what you can do is just get a
little<00:00:29.160> piece<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.580> tape<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:32.059> just<00:00:33.059> put<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.660> on

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
little piece of tape and just put it on

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.340 
little piece of tape and just put it on
that<00:00:35.489> part<00:00:35.969> leaving<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.450> little<00:00:36.660> bit<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> space

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that part leaving a little bit of space

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.180 
that part leaving a little bit of space
up<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> top<00:00:42.079> you<00:00:43.079> want<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.739> per<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
up at the top you want to do this per is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
up at the top you want to do this per is
kind<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:45.500> tricky<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.510> roll<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.410> little

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
kind of tricky so just roll it a little

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.700 
kind of tricky so just roll it a little
bit<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.879> then<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.600> bit<00:00:51.899> easier<00:00:52.350> for

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
bit so then it's a little bit easier for

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.279 
bit so then it's a little bit easier for
them<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> put<00:00:53.430> those<00:00:53.640> speeds<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.050> I'm<00:00:55.140> gonna

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
them to put those speeds on so I'm gonna

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.479 
them to put those speeds on so I'm gonna
cut<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.920> don't<00:00:56.010> need<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
cut it because we don't need all that

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.910 
cut it because we don't need all that
tape<00:00:58.730> okay<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.510> that's<00:01:00.780> ready<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> go<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
tape okay so then that's ready to go so

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.590 
tape okay so then that's ready to go so
now<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.280> now<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.670> ready<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.090> them<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> be

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
now it's now it's ready for them to be

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
now it's now it's ready for them to be
able<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> string<00:01:04.170> those<00:01:04.350> beads<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.830> now<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
get by that bead and then what they're

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.060 
get by that bead and then what they're
working<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.530> they're<00:01:46.740> really

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
working on great small motor skills

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.530 
working on great small motor skills
using<00:01:49.920> those<00:01:50.100> muscles<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.790> their<00:01:51.030> hands<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
those little tiny beads and then using

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.359 
those little tiny beads and then using
great<00:01:57.180> eye<00:01:57.450> hand<00:01:58.079> coordination<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.979> their<00:01:59.130> eye
