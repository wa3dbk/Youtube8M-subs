00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:05.620
 Hello 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.840
 very good from criticisms of 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.450
 minecraft we were located in all 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.490
 our part of them online and good 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.070
 as already some of you have noticed 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.349
 these thousands and we are ready to 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.910
 throw us another game in which he goes to 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.829
 be now in game mode called duel 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.570
 by teams and well let's try 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.850
 put in a game that is quite 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.560
 full as this one to see 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.600
 to see if we can enter because 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.310
 Normally if we try to connect 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.210
 some game in which there is not much 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.150
 people take a long time to connect and it's a 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.680
 incredible rollazo so the best thing is 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.510
 enter a game like this one that already 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.739
 there are enough people and good as 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.440
 you can appreciate I made some 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.330
 build ready for the video and good 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.120
 let's see which team we could choose 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.760
 us the red or in the units with the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.870
 blue 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.870
 come I'm 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.890
 nine players of ten come one more and 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.890
 come in come let's go cheer tests 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.200
 all ready for the good battle 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.750
 I guess this game is about killing 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.900
 for something called ting des max duel by 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.090
 equipment and well I have taken the kit from 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.950
 diamond like most people the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.480
 which I think will be quite successful 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.850
 for the mere fact that we're going with 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.950
 diamonds and well finally we have entered 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.840
 ok the countdown starts we're still here 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.640
 with our texture for what good and 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.470
 when he told me it would be better because today 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.340
 I'll put the roof because it's better 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.890
 OK 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.070
 I guess we have more than one life and 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.670
 well I'm going to go to copaco gives me 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.439
 same everything I do not care 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.060
 all you have to do is kill like this 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.650
 that does not have any complications in 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.130
 If I do not know where you are going to see 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.130
 the enemies 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.200
 to see the rear 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.840
 of a red to see if we can give you a 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.140
 I already have the extra 314 doses 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.140

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.490
 the beautiful appearance 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.870
 to kill enemies 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.940
 novenas forms here the truth but 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.340
 come on, the teams are in balance 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.630
 there are other enemies, of course, it 's a 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.630
 unnecessary rodeo where are you going 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.690

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.959

 if we go behind another part day and 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.670

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.650
 if we stay here, another game is played 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.600
 starting that the truth is that it would be 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.970
 pretty funny I had it super 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.860

 more accurate beating like the last one and it's going to 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.250
 go watering alive stealing if we have won
