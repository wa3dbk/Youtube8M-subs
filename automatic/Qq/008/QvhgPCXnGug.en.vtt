trying<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.849> go<00:00:14.940> for<00:00:15.089> photorealistic<00:00:15.540> we

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
trying to go for photorealistic we

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.019 
trying to go for photorealistic we
really<00:00:16.109> are<00:00:16.260> we<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.460> consider<00:00:17.699> be

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
really are we have what we consider be

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.140 
really are we have what we consider be
one<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> best<00:00:18.949> concept<00:00:19.949> art<00:00:20.220> teams<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
one of the best concept art teams in the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.929 
one of the best concept art teams in the
industry<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:22.740> felt<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.279> much<00:00:23.519> as

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
industry and we felt that it was much as

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.790 
industry and we felt that it was much as
a<00:00:24.180> great<00:00:24.720> compelling<00:00:25.140> way<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.289> use<00:00:25.529> some<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
a great compelling way to use some of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.320 
a great compelling way to use some of
this<00:00:25.859> concept<00:00:26.279> art<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.910> way<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.090> communicate

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
this concept art in a way to communicate

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.109 
this concept art in a way to communicate
storytelling<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.910> know<00:00:29.939> our

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
storytelling and so you know our

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.049 
storytelling and so you know our
cinematic<00:00:30.630> style<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.199> much<00:00:31.410> more<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
cinematic style is much more of a

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.280 
cinematic style is much more of a
handcrafted<00:00:33.059> painterly<00:00:33.510> style<00:00:33.540> as<00:00:33.960> opposed

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
handcrafted painterly style as opposed

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
handcrafted painterly style as opposed
to<00:00:34.469> photorealistic<00:00:35.100> which<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:35.940> feel

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
to photorealistic which we feel

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
to photorealistic which we feel
photorealistic<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.350> quickly<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
photorealistic can quickly get out of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.650 
photorealistic can quickly get out of
date<00:00:38.219> depending<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.850> technologies<00:00:39.360> is

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
