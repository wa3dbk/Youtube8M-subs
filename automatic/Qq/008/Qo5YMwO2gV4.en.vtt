00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
is heat treated ahead of time so that

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.110

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
has the hardness necessary and then it's

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.660 
has the hardness necessary and then it's

the<00:03:01.480> problem<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:02.140> don't<00:03:02.170> want<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.500> put<00:03:02.709> a

the problem is we don't want to put a

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
time you know the threads would be

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.020 
time you know the threads would be
galling<00:03:09.910> on<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.810> aluminum<00:03:11.320> engine<00:03:12.030> castings

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
and the in the frame so that's why we

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.190 
and the in the frame so that's why we
end<00:03:15.190> up<00:03:15.250> having<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.630> brick<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:16.810> turned<00:03:17.080> down

half-inch rod to 20 to 12 millimeter so

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.810 
half-inch rod to 20 to 12 millimeter so

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
we go from 25 to 12 because you can't

if you had done this before you could

if you had done this before you could
probably<00:03:28.129> do<00:03:28.370> all<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.970> parts<00:03:29.300> in<00:03:29.420> an<00:03:29.540> hour

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959

but if it's your first time I would say

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.660 
but if it's your first time I would say
more<00:03:32.690> likely<00:03:33.140> anywhere<00:03:33.620> from<00:03:33.739> two<00:03:33.980> hours<00:03:34.370> to
