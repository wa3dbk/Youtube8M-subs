00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello I am zero easy in a new 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.849
 minecraft video in which I'm 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.450
 falling here and apparently for some 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.140
 reason I do not know what's happening was in 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.420
 another game and they transported me to this 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.950
 so let's start 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.740
 in 10 seconds and good as I told them 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.220
 to raise sky ones because you voted 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.160
 to play sky one os and I know they are 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.040
 very difficult these games I have already 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.840
 three games where I lose 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.840
 and tonight if I win 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.879
 so let's start 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.920
 first of all I want to tell you that 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:56.680
 only without the problem of the keyboard already 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.680
 solve and also what solution 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.930
 the solution is changing from where 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.100
 I put the microphone that my microphone 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.100
 It is the galaxy note 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.560
 and good 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.280
 let's start 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.810
 looking for things does not make you do here 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.810
 alone and not the truth 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.289
 and there are many songs here so 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.289
 good 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.990
 go and they gave him full iron 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.670
 orale 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.659
 the diamond 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.280
 let's look at that same 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.260
 and I hope they do not throw me 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.579
 and I no longer have blocks 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.180
 with stein to put this 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.650
 for more blocks 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.650
 let's go for more blocks 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.690
 I'm really bad to see I put this 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.690
 and I put 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.300
 I put these 2 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.379
 and there was already a small bridge 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.599
 also understand that not too serious 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.780
 because I have not uploaded videos in almost a 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.780
 month 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.450
 but in the other video I already told you why 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.190
 subscribers and of course not 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.190
 there is another because of course 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.670
 you do not give me more things today cakes 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.600
 so in this December I have eaten 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.660
 pretty cake 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.520
 because practically every day 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.520
 I had someone's birthday 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.770
 almost every birthday someone and 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.460
 in those days 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.480
 there was a lot of mast 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.650
 and that date 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.650
 they'll say 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.670
 what if they did the same 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.090
 today I think I did not give 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.580
 with knowing if pulsation is not going to be you 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.760
 he's going to want to attack me so I do not know what 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.760
 do 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.290
 because we are dancing and he goes 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.290
 there 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.260
 today I seem to have a new friend 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:56.220
 and we are team wants to kill me 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.090
 because he wants to kill me 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.090
 bendaÃ±a 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.070
 apparently he is not good friend and he loves me 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.620
 kill but friend does not do not want to be team and 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.090
 he wants to kill the good friend 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.280
 so I killed him with a sword of 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:22.229
 diamond in the game I will not think and 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.229
 it turns out that someone killed someone 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.310
 and I have love 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.580
 with this lava 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.580
 Oh 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.400
 but he was Chinese so I'm going to go up 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.550
 this video 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.940
 I have not decided on this video just 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.940
 because 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:54.249
 that's all very epic for me I do not know if 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:57.460
 surely for you, not because 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:59.060
 surely they have played a thousand games but 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.419
 this is one 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.210
 of the few games I've played in 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.450
 this server and in all there 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.450
 good ones 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.150
 who are left look at this there is a way 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.150
 out there 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:29.380
 there is a way for me 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.380
 and I hope they are not doing team 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.500
 let's see what they are doing 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:46.449
 I'll go there 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:49.229
 for there and if they throw me then anyway 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.229
 and jump 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.430
 and jump and jump and jump and this is balcony 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:07:00.210
 and doing very well while doing it 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:04.020
 They are killing and one killed another so 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.770
 I suddenly arrived and jumped on him and 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.770
 I eat an apple 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:16.190
 and the bad and I kill it truth truth that what 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:18.760
 I send 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.760
 I kill him 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.669
 oh my god my god 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.110
 well I'm going to supplies and they're going to be 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:30.419
 all parties and those that change 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:35.990
 I do not think that it raises games in which 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:35.990
 win and I hope you see it until next time 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.110
 plus
