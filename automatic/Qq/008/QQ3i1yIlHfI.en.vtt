00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.350
 so hello this is my first video review 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.989
 and it will be on the motherboard 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.289
 motherboard dark and deadline 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.920
 refer contribution 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.189
 another class 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.419
 that's how you see 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.470
 second term 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.980
 read 8 c 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.609
 Jess 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.689
 the rules are like her 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:26.699
 pay 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.550
 not only Odessa but childhood means 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.550
 that this wild beadle 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.740
 but here it costs 1 5 hryvnia 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.470
 LAN card 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.060
 and there that is not insulting 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.239
 but in principle there is no more equality 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.469
 but because it is 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.219
 motherboard from her st your brother 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.490
 worth only 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.329
 for 20 children for their own sake 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.900
 he has great 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.680
 now more in detail 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.820
 motherboard I really liked 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.790
 first of all my speech 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.470
 how to say sights 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.620
 Litex 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.030
 this 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.940
 Here is a function that can through 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.119
 bios open additional a g but 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.410
 It was 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.600
 they are country processors 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 so now let's see what is there 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.369
 absence to manifest 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.460
 the day before and the Chinese are not very 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.350
 ivy that can let you charge 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.100
 voyage 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.060
 they filed 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.850
 percentage or 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.940
 on the forum 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.140
 40 percent faster than you do it 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.740
 do 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.939
 from networks from taxies ti we also support 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.080
 six core processors 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.700
 process 10 percent 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.790
 and there is 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.340
 that's what I still liked more 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.500
 two different operational regions 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.420
 ddr2 and ddr3 memory 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 project video deforge Ossetia 25 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.530
 256 bit percentage 256 megabytes is also very 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.590
 not bad 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.900
 support the kids then the processor 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.770
 they are two candidates for the post of minister of india 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.530
 but now more in detail 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.190
 let's see because inside such 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.139
 equipment 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.450
 This is the most common grade of this. 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.019
 Donetsk payment 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.759
 it includes 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.349
 two brochures 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.099
 the first name of the country’s strategy will be 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.759
 this is warrior bodily things function 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.269
 and which allows you to load windows 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.519
 percentage up to ten times faster to find 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.529
 SEC trains 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.549
 and the second was in the province 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.669
 at the end of the river 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.589
 Well, I understand the players on this 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.289
 all turned 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.859
 I think it's not interesting 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.859
 So we see that it will take place 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.499
 China's draft strategy is as far as I am 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:44.759
 got it 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:48.299
 yes it is this environment maternal description 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.339
 fees 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.709
 connection installation and so on 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.669
 so many languages ​​what to see m 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.089
 are there any Russians 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.089
 so further drive all drivers 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.319
 ii term 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.079
 Sattar rescuers 2 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.959
 in set 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.759
 unfortunately points 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:12.739
 on the system unit 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.279
 and naturally the motherboard 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.279
 now trying to undermine 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.689
 almost 300 thousand 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.689
 so here I pulled out the motherboard knife 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.509
 the first thing that catches your eye is 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.829
 Naturally very beautiful color 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.929
 motherboard 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.619
 Further 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.299
 the biggest cons of this maternal 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.249
 boards it is natural 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.709
 when cooling the north bridge 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.259
 she is very weak now I'll show you 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:46.679
 ponomarenko 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:48.839
 ohh I looked at many forums and 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.759
 say that when you buy 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.149
 understory charge immediately or order another 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.009
 improved bridge location or 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:58.219
 are being made 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.879
 I decided to order 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.429
 refinery much more 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.579
 output other cooled 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.790
 because I will use 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.969
 presently 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.179
 and 256 megabytes 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:12.399
 integrated graphics card 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.399
 again so then we'll see 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.579
 but look there are right connectors 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.459
 well suspicious memory ddr2 ddr2 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.759
 see the editors 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.949
 and further 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.139
 CPU 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.360
 processor socket 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.590
 en 2 an 24 a mts not supported 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:34.860
 percent 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.529
 so there is 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.020
 wrote 1 two boxes of the site to video cards 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.169
 etc 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.310
 nutrition 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.340
 m 24 5 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.460
 connection is possible 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.330
 hospitable food 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.949
 However, as I understand it for the old 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.830
 Russian drive connection 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.099
 inheritance 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.099
 and here are 4 Saratov 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.120
 but pretty good here 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.889
 rub then any connector for 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:05.990
 connect 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.529
 and beating her up as beaten 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:10.879
 so on there is still here 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.509
 we'll see 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.090
 this is for purchase 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.940
 I absolutely do not understand the mother 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.629
 new board why do you need slutsky 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.259
 I do not understand 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.759
 and it is time for her by the way 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.839
 he spent 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:26.249
 in this segment in operation this maternal 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:27.770
 integrated circuit board 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.309
 but do 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.520
 and one channel 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.999
 so on that show 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:36.130
 the crowd is 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.909
 crowd connection this 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.959
 also completely not quite possible forever 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.999
 modern computers 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:43.550
 and then a year 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.810
 message checking 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.120
 on the front panel 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.930
 power button recipe 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.029
 such does 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.159
 so let's see what is there yet 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.520
 let's see how she looks 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.069
 that's how you see 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.730
 and for the mouse 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.219
 for me from the flood of me there 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.379
 I will connect 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:08.419
 obsolete com ports are completely perfect too 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.319
 unnecessary on modern 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.300
 computers 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.559
 per gram 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.119
 4 days 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:16.619
 more times two three four 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:18.969
 n network card 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:20.699
 eventually connected 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.879
 and 3 exit 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.499
 so I can still mark his children 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:28.130
 video cards 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.460
 the graphics card is very good 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.669
 and even more so for its price 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.669
 I bought it for 365 hryvnia 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.609
 but it is very good despite 

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:40.569
 her 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:41.319
 in g 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.419
 but you understand for its parameters it is very 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.499
 good value for money 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:50.419
 so i think on this video review we 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:53.439
 finish if he is quito 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:54.879
 leave questions in the comments
