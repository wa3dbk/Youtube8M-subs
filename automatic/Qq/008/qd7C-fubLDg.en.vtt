00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
 that's why August 8 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.370
 these are 5 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.710
 from where it comes from such a kelakh belgium 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.159
 she makes him a golden business 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:13.419
 arms complaints 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:14.939
 not bad 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.939
 compare with the weak 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.079
 I started watching the matches 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.029
 this call to stone lopes 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.130
 banking values 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.130
 and it marks the end of the month 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.879
 he took everybody to follow in real time looking for them 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.390
 Didier Deschamps kept his promises 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.590
 always up 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.010
 for Switzerland 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.460
 so this year largely weakened 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.630
 8 days ago 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.190
 the seniors club of switzerland 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.490
 reading 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.350
 you know it 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.080
 when to buy 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.140
 valbuena believes him 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.239
 8:20 p.m. 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.239
 and then here is to save 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.250
 the plant wall and the lunar rallies 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.830
 so it takes hours 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.290
 the idea is the same 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 if the thugs march 6th at 8 pm 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 we'll talk 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.940
 - Luc Besson 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.940
 we do not have anything like it 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.520
 mario bros 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.520
 by two in one year 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.149
 the German runner 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.909
 it's like sex 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.269
 four days 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.169
 the ubs bank 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.759
 Catherine Ashton 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.759
 be sure to break a net in force 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.979
 Whose fault is it 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.979
 the American delegation 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.489
 few elected 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.769
 14 points 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.259
 the image of the king dagobert 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.319
 for lunch a great balance 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.519
 the saga twilight gently the property 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.469
