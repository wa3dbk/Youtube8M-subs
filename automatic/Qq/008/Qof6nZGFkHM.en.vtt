 governor of são paulo the bill 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.050
 which guarantees teachers of the category 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 who are not hired 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.439
 the right to medical care and other 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.090
 benefits 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.430
 the workers performed a 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.380
 manifestation this afternoon in front of the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.519
 State Secretary of Education at 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.519
 center of the capital of São Paulo 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.829
 this act is actually a form of 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 pressure for the first calling the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.800
 attention to the way in which 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.109
 temporary teachers are not 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.359
 especially those who are so precarious 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.939
 in this hiring that are called 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.720
 category 3, we do not work with 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.189
 same responsibilities but is not 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 We have benefits entitled to the 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.630
 without health medical leave 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.130
 It's complicated, you work with it. 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.500
 responsibility 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.600
 Thank heavens, I got assigned class. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.780
 but the benefits did not work out that this 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.820
 off mode is not to be 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.860
 to say a bigger jargon we had a 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.400
 process of precariousness that our 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.570
 option then an act like that represents 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.610
 a form of knots somehow 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.200
 we have also been able to mobilize the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.399
 category as teachers that we 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.740
 we met today 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.070
 punching bags is actually that either 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.259
 you the effective category f category of 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.850
 that alphabet soup that the government 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.290
 rode for people is not just an issue 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.619
 salaries teachers are without 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:05.340
 opportunity to take classes then 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.429
 quarantine is 200 school days and what 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.800
 happens in public school does not have 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.980
 teacher 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.020
 No one else wants to be our teacher. 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.870
 project is to try to 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.760
 correcting a problem in the law ensures that 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.220
 all servers and the same right 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.910
 especially in relation to the right to 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.780
 iamspe 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.140
 we only conquered sinnott faced isola 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.060
 categorical 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.850
 this is wrong this government has taken 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.630
 state of são paulo that has been the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.910
