00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 sarma lives in cleaning and keeps their pumpkin 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.629
 under the rocking chair in the room 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.210
 this year's harvest was small 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.460
 several pieces one of them varieties 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.969
 marble seeds brought familiar from 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.160
 Russia 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.949
 whether it was not hot pumpkin not even 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.810
 had to water the crop the gardener took off in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.630
 November day in March, and not here in the spring 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 decided to cut the marble beauty and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.990
 I could not believe my eyes the seeds were 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.720
 111 everything is described then I think this 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.300
 some kind of news from space or 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.969
 Someone wants to tell us something 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.430
 characters resemble hieroglyphic characters 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.920
 gardener carried an unusual find in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.309
 nature museum but there hesitated 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.660
 the pier is not analyzing the volume scratched marks 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.700
 however, a couple of seeds were left on 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.640
 research experts but for now 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.469
 no answer we turned to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.410
 experienced agronomist journal editor 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.440
 family garden or not nikolayeva she 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.039
 noted versions to spare one of 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.809
 them during pollination occurred 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.700
 unplanned incident usually gardeners 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.400
 pollinates the pumpkin by artificial means 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.590
 putting on flowers and canvas bags 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.159
 but the bees could penetrate 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.250
 gaps could form on 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.590
 flower some kind of plant virus 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.070
 which evolving influenced 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.350
 the formation of such a pattern on the seeds 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.619
 but virus and vegetable 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:34.259
 it is very difficult to study and therefore 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.159
 now prove discover them will 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.350
 difficult and perhaps impossible to Elena 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.479
 says that we do not know that 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.149
 what conditions were kept brought from 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.850
 Russia seeds what impact they are 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.380
 were exposed in any way about the unusual 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.259
 fact need to have 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.570
 breeders of grade a this year to plant 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.600
 in the ground at least a few times sand 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.790
 seed for the mystery we turned and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.549
 at the Latvian Faculty of Biology 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.890
 University in the laboratory a lot of all 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.200
 the greens over which they experiment 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.840
 faculty members and students know 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.740
 many unusual occurrences 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.780
 patterns on the plant 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.090
 Volga and folded in the plant 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.860
 often weird things appear one 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.230
 times on the leaves of the tree appeared as 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.840
 as if wax crystals are so 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.160
 plant protect itself from overheating 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.740
 case with a pumpkin got some 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.840
 a misunderstanding but I do not rule out that 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.550
 some creatures have invested in these signs 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.220
 a kind of message to people 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.100
 but so far biologists understand seeds 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.100
 Sarma reminded us of the beneficial properties 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.890
 vitamin product and treated us 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.270
 pumpkin cutlets irina tender she 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.270
 scrapped plus the first Baltic channel
