00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.290
 or white with you today I continue with 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.420
 the series of videos dedicated to reviews 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.390
 of makeup bases and I'll talk to you 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.130
 from this greater yorman and teacher many 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.600
 you asked about the bases of 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.090
 armani because they are bases that have a 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.070
 pretty high price and you want to know my 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.829
 opinion well this base seems to me 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.179
 wonderful many people even I have 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.579
 talked very well of the base 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.519
 maxam body because this base is for me 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.919
 as level 3 the mastery of get out 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:36.289
 so to speak not doing honor to his 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:38.620
 name is a base that leaves an aspect 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:41.469
 let's say mate but it's not a mate 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.269
 off not but it's a luminous matte 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.609
 with very little amount you see that it is 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.980
 very fluid it is very important to look very 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:52.309
 very very fluid is very very important 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.559
 shake the well with a couple of droplets already 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.289
 it's enough because it gives a lot of itself 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.390
 the product and it's the typical product that 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.679
 It adapts very well to the skin 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.989
 used in lighter skins and more 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.300
 dark to see how he reacts and he 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.730
 It adapts very well to the skin because it is like 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.940
 that melts 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.720
 with the person's own skin creates 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.460
 a perfect layer one layer but at the same time 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.950
 that you do not see you do not notice at all 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.200
 mask effect does not mark at all the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.860
 forums completely disguises the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.720
 coverage is I'd say it's half average 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.820
 pulling to low is not much coverage 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.000
 obviously you can build by applying 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.000
 plus 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.200
 and I tell you I think it's a product 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.390
 absolutely recommendable has the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.729
 factor protection 15 also very long 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.430
 duration if you go to the stand or will be attended 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.600
 great and you will try the base up 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.259
 that you find the color that really 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.270
 you need and really an authentic 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.860
