00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.220
 much more complex models 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.880
 consider a classic example 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.900

 let's turn the space in the window

 projections in this way 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.180
 so that we can see the lower bound

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.490
 for this you can use either

 of the object project select polygons which 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.720

 will have a rather rough look 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:30.819
 but now we will tell you how 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.829

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.900
 if smoothing is applied to all 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.629
 immediately the shape of the legs will be ready 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.349

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.989
 for this we need to highlight 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.069
