acoustic piano will do now let's take a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830 
acoustic piano will do now let's take a
listen<00:01:16.950> over<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.180> go<00:01:18.330> ahead<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.570> press

listen over here if I go ahead and press

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.690 
listen over here if I go ahead and press
a<00:01:18.870> note<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.290> let<00:01:19.440> it<00:01:19.560> ring<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.860> normally<00:01:20.580> when

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
a note and let it ring out normally when

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.390 
a note and let it ring out normally when
we're<00:01:20.820> dealing<00:01:20.940> with<00:01:21.090> PCM<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.830> sample<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
we're dealing with PCM the sample that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.400 
we're dealing with PCM the sample that
makes<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:23.910> sound<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.270> only<00:01:24.540> x-amount

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
makes up that sound is only x-amount

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.359 
makes up that sound is only x-amount
long<00:01:25.680> okay<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.940> hold<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.360> hold<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.050> a

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
long okay so when we hold out hold out a

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
long okay so when we hold out hold out a
tone<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:30.420> point<00:01:30.660> it's<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> run<00:01:31.110> out

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
tone at some point it's going to run out

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.359 
tone at some point it's going to run out
and<00:01:31.410> we're<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.010> physically

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and we're going to have to physically

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
and we're going to have to physically
loop<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:32.970> sometimes<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.810> hold<00:01:34.020> out

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
loop it so sometimes when we hold out

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.490 
loop it so sometimes when we hold out
those<00:01:34.380> notes<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.770> might<00:01:35.190> hear<00:01:35.460> an<00:01:35.640> audible

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
those notes you might hear an audible

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.219 
those notes you might hear an audible
and<00:01:37.760> it's<00:01:38.760> not<00:01:38.910> cool<00:01:39.150> I'll<00:01:39.690> check<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.050> when

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and it's not cool I'll check it out when

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.780 
and it's not cool I'll check it out when
we<00:01:40.260> do<00:01:40.440> it<00:01:40.590> here

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.270 

it's<00:01:44.570> going<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.780> naturally<00:01:44.960> decay<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:46.100> like

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
it's going to naturally decay just like

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.320 
it's going to naturally decay just like
an<00:01:46.400> acoustic<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:49.130> when<00:01:49.340> we<00:01:49.460> play<00:01:49.700> slow

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
an acoustic so when we play slow

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.180 
an acoustic so when we play slow
passages<00:01:50.900> maybe<00:01:51.080> for<00:01:51.350> church<00:01:51.590> or<00:01:51.830> ballads

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
passages maybe for church or ballads

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.880 
passages maybe for church or ballads
it's<00:01:52.880> going<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.090> sound<00:01:53.300> really<00:01:54.170> great<00:01:54.440> so<00:01:56.890> it's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
it's going to sound really great so it's

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:19.559 
it's going to sound really great so it's
going<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.190> sound<00:01:58.310> really<00:01:58.550> great

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.240 

now<00:02:20.569> let's<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:20.870> ahead<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.260> edit<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.950> piano

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
now let's go ahead and edit this piano

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.170 
now let's go ahead and edit this piano
now<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:23.150> once<00:02:23.480> again<00:02:23.599> shift<00:02:24.579> tone<00:02:25.579> edit<00:02:25.970> and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
now so once again shift tone edit and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.390 
now so once again shift tone edit and
now<00:02:26.209> look<00:02:27.079> at<00:02:27.200> all<00:02:27.290> these<00:02:27.409> parameters<00:02:27.920> these

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
now look at all these parameters these

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.250 
now look at all these parameters these
parameters<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.360> supernatural<00:02:29.720> engines

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
parameters in the supernatural engines

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.289 
parameters in the supernatural engines
change<00:02:30.829> according<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.640> instrument<00:02:32.150> that

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
change according to the instrument that

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.839 
change according to the instrument that
we're<00:02:32.480> editing<00:02:32.659> so<00:02:33.590> for<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.980> piano<00:02:34.280> here's

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.130 
we're editing so for the piano here's
some<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.209> common<00:02:35.569> things<00:02:35.720> we<00:02:35.780> would<00:02:35.989> edit

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
some of the common things we would edit

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.890 
some of the common things we would edit
maybe<00:02:37.010> like<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> stereo<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:37.879> so<00:02:38.390> if<00:02:38.659> I'm

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
maybe like a stereo with so if I'm

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.610 
maybe like a stereo with so if I'm
playing<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.440> solo<00:02:39.890> piano<00:02:40.159> I<00:02:40.780> want<00:02:41.780> more<00:02:41.959> more

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
playing a solo piano I want more more

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.880 
playing a solo piano I want more more
within<00:02:43.340> my<00:02:43.760> sound<00:02:44.090> okay<00:02:44.480> more<00:02:44.689> frequencies<00:02:45.290> so

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
within my sound okay more frequencies so

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.490 
within my sound okay more frequencies so
if<00:02:46.189> I'm<00:02:46.400> doing<00:02:46.700> stuff<00:02:46.879> like<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:50.810> nice<00:02:51.230> big

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
if I'm doing stuff like a as a nice big

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.100 
if I'm doing stuff like a as a nice big
sample

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.350 

but<00:02:55.100> if<00:02:55.280> I'm<00:02:55.460> playing<00:02:55.610> in<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.880> band<00:02:56.060> there's<00:02:56.300> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
but if I'm playing in the band there's a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.210 
but if I'm playing in the band there's a
lot<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.570> frequencies<00:02:56.990> going<00:02:57.290> on<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:57.950> can

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
lot of frequencies going on so I can

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.610 
lot of frequencies going on so I can
take<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.520> stereo<00:02:58.880> with<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.360> I<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:00.440> focus

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
take this stereo with and I can focus

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.830 
take this stereo with and I can focus
all<00:03:01.070> those<00:03:01.520> frequencies<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.630> way<00:03:02.720> it

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
all those frequencies so that way it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.930 
all those frequencies so that way it
fits<00:03:03.140> more<00:03:03.320> in<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.500> pocket<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.160> band<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.880> I

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
fits more in the pocket of the band so I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.800 
fits more in the pocket of the band so I
can<00:03:05.120> take<00:03:05.240> these<00:03:05.480> off<00:03:05.690> very<00:03:06.320> quickly<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:11.300> it

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
can take these off very quickly and it

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.750 
can take these off very quickly and it
fits<00:03:12.020> in<00:03:12.170> here<00:03:12.320> another<00:03:12.920> key<00:03:13.130> thing<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.520> can<00:03:13.670> do

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
fits in here another key thing I can do

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.520 
fits in here another key thing I can do
is<00:03:13.970> maybe<00:03:14.210> take<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:14.630> hammer<00:03:14.870> noise<00:03:15.200> and

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
is maybe take that hammer noise and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.800 
is maybe take that hammer noise and
adjust<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.430> when<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:16.610> play<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.210> play<00:03:17.360> with<00:03:17.780> a

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
adjust it so when I play I play with a

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.410 
adjust it so when I play I play with a
softer<00:03:18.290> or<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.530> harder<00:03:19.010> hammer<00:03:19.340> if<00:03:19.640> I'm<00:03:20.180> playing

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
softer or a harder hammer if I'm playing

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.850 
softer or a harder hammer if I'm playing
with<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.570> harder<00:03:20.930> hammer<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.440> could<00:03:21.590> be<00:03:21.680> good

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
with a harder hammer that could be good

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.180 
with a harder hammer that could be good
if<00:03:22.070> I'm<00:03:22.490> doing<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.940> more<00:03:23.510> rhythmic<00:03:24.260> piano<00:03:24.740> like

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
if I'm doing a more rhythmic piano like

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:37.860 
if I'm doing a more rhythmic piano like
where<00:03:25.430> maybe<00:03:25.670> we're<00:03:25.790> doing<00:03:25.850> some<00:03:26.120> salsa<00:03:26.540> music

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.700 

now<00:03:38.870> let's<00:03:39.110> take<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.290> listen

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
now let's take a listen

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.860 
now let's take a listen
using<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.580> softer<00:03:40.970> hammers<00:03:41.270> on<00:03:41.450> more<00:03:41.720> of<00:03:41.810> a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
using the softer hammers on more of a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:04:05.900 
using the softer hammers on more of a
ballad<00:03:42.260> esque<00:03:42.440> kind<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.280> sound

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.340 

same<00:04:06.910> thing<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.210> can<00:04:07.390> go<00:04:07.480> in<00:04:07.630> adjust<00:04:07.900> my<00:04:08.020> string

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
same thing I can go in adjust my string

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.640 
same thing I can go in adjust my string
resonance<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:08.950> my<00:04:09.130> key<00:04:09.400> off<00:04:09.580> resonance<00:04:10.150> so

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
resonance and my key off resonance so

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.410 
resonance and my key off resonance so
actually<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.830> can<00:04:12.250> see<00:04:12.550> you<00:04:12.730> can<00:04:12.880> go<00:04:13.030> inside

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
actually you can see you can go inside

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.360 
actually you can see you can go inside
your<00:04:13.600> piano<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.080> customize<00:04:14.740> and<00:04:14.890> then<00:04:15.190> once

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
your piano and customize and then once

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.190 
your piano and customize and then once
again<00:04:15.520> once<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.180> make<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.480> piano<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.959> like

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
again once you make the piano you like

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.599 
again once you make the piano you like
you<00:04:17.920> can<00:04:18.070> press<00:04:18.250> right<00:04:18.780> save<00:04:19.780> it<00:04:19.930> as<00:04:20.019> a<00:04:20.049> tone

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
you can press right save it as a tone

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.100 
you can press right save it as a tone
rename<00:04:21.609> it<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.850> whatever<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.210> want<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.540> there

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
you go you have your own custom piano so

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.120 
you go you have your own custom piano so
that's<00:04:25.600> something<00:04:25.780> real<00:04:26.050> easy<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.320> do<00:04:26.500> let's

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
that's something real easy to do let's

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.380 
that's something real easy to do let's
go<00:04:27.280> ahead<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.580> take<00:04:27.670> a<00:04:27.700> look<00:04:27.910> at<00:04:28.000> one<00:04:28.210> other

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
go ahead and take a look at one other

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.200 
go ahead and take a look at one other
supernatural<00:04:29.260> acoustic<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.670> let's<00:04:30.970> go<00:04:31.090> ahead

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
supernatural acoustic so let's go ahead

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.450 
supernatural acoustic so let's go ahead
and<00:04:31.420> choose<00:04:31.630> organ<00:04:32.350> pretty<00:04:32.920> good<00:04:33.070> sound<00:04:33.310> right

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
and choose organ pretty good sound right

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:43.710 
and choose organ pretty good sound right
out<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.760> box<00:04:41.880> okay<00:04:42.880> let's<00:04:43.270> go<00:04:43.420> ahead<00:04:43.600> and

out of the box okay let's go ahead and

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.880 
out of the box okay let's go ahead and
do<00:04:43.780> some<00:04:43.960> editing<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.710> sound<00:04:45.690> shift<00:04:46.890> tone

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:03.320 
to all the drawbars right here okay all
the<00:04:55.210> bars<00:04:55.420> so<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:55.690> can<00:04:55.900> change<00:04:56.080> it<00:04:56.260> very<00:04:57.250> quickly

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.180 
and clean but as it ages the engine
you're<00:05:13.419> going<00:05:13.540> to<00:05:13.600> start<00:05:13.780> hearing<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.169> okay<00:05:14.710> so

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
you're going to start hearing it okay so

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.220 
you're going to start hearing it okay so
we<00:05:15.400> can<00:05:15.550> adjust<00:05:15.669> our<00:05:16.150> particular<00:05:16.720> organ<00:05:17.140> in

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
we can adjust our particular organ in

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.500 
we can adjust our particular organ in
our<00:05:17.470> supernatural<00:05:18.100> organs<00:05:18.640> inside<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.120> effe

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
our supernatural organs inside the effe

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.230 
our supernatural organs inside the effe
to<00:05:19.960> do<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.290> same<00:05:20.530> and<00:05:20.790> one<00:05:21.790> of<00:05:21.910> those<00:05:22.000> things

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
to do the same and one of those things

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.400 
to do the same and one of those things
is<00:05:22.360> called<00:05:22.540> leakage<00:05:22.990> so<00:05:23.110> I'm<00:05:23.169> going<00:05:23.290> to<00:05:23.350> go

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
is called leakage so I'm going to go

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.290 
is called leakage so I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:23.530> and<00:05:23.770> turn<00:05:23.919> off<00:05:23.970> turn<00:05:24.970> it<00:05:25.000> all<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.210> way

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
ahead and turn off turn it all the way

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.120 
ahead and turn off turn it all the way
to<00:05:25.390> zero<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:25.870> turn<00:05:26.470> off<00:05:26.560> my<00:05:26.620> percussion

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
to zero and turn off my percussion

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.909 
to zero and turn off my percussion
switch<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.669> my<00:05:28.480> other<00:05:28.600> settings<00:05:29.020> here<00:05:29.080> so<00:05:29.830> you

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
switch and my other settings here so you

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.480 
switch and my other settings here so you
can<00:05:30.100> get<00:05:30.190> an<00:05:30.280> accurate<00:05:30.669> representation<00:05:32.490> so

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
can get an accurate representation so

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.080 
can get an accurate representation so
check<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:33.880> out<00:05:33.970> so<00:05:34.780> here<00:05:35.050> is<00:05:35.370> leakage<00:05:36.370> no

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
check it out so here is leakage no

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.460 
check it out so here is leakage no
leakage<00:05:37.450> in<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.600> organs<00:05:37.960> like<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:38.320> was

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
leakage in the organs like it was

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.380 
leakage in the organs like it was
brand-new<00:05:38.860> right<00:05:39.100> out<00:05:39.220> of<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.400> box<00:05:39.610> or<00:05:39.880> from

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.540 
brand-new right out of the box or from
the<00:05:40.480> factory<00:05:41.700> nice<00:05:42.700> clean<00:05:43.120> sound<00:05:43.800> but<00:05:44.800> as<00:05:44.950> the

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
the factory nice clean sound but as the

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.280 
the factory nice clean sound but as the
instrument<00:05:46.180> ages<00:05:46.570> you're<00:05:46.990> going<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.169> hear

okay<00:07:21.050> and<00:07:21.200> back<00:07:21.320> in<00:07:21.470> the<00:07:21.560> old<00:07:21.710> days<00:07:21.890> guys<00:07:22.400> would

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610 
okay and back in the old days guys would

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.820 
okay and back in the old days guys would
stretch<00:07:22.850> what<00:07:23.300> soak<00:07:23.690> the<00:07:23.870> belts<00:07:24.170> stretch<00:07:24.590> them

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
stretch what soak the belts stretch them

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.010 
stretch what soak the belts stretch them
to<00:07:24.950> get<00:07:25.100> them<00:07:25.190> just<00:07:25.400> right<00:07:25.670> and<00:07:25.970> that<00:07:26.840> would

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
to get them just right and that would

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.080 
to get them just right and that would
adjust<00:07:27.290> how<00:07:27.680> fast<00:07:27.950> they<00:07:28.100> would<00:07:28.220> ramp<00:07:28.430> up<00:07:28.670> ramp

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
adjust how fast they would ramp up ramp

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.690 
adjust how fast they would ramp up ramp
down<00:07:29.300> well<00:07:30.050> check<00:07:30.530> it<00:07:30.650> out<00:07:30.770> inside<00:07:31.160> the<00:07:31.310> F<00:07:31.430> ace

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:31.700 
down well check it out inside the F ace

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.030 
down well check it out inside the F ace
if<00:07:32.000> you<00:07:32.330> wanted<00:07:32.720> to<00:07:32.900> you<00:07:33.350> can<00:07:33.470> go<00:07:33.620> ahead<00:07:33.650> and<00:07:33.890> do

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.040 
if you wanted to you can go ahead and do

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.070 
if you wanted to you can go ahead and do
the<00:07:34.160> same<00:07:34.340> thing<00:07:34.580> and<00:07:34.760> control<00:07:35.240> those<00:07:35.780> two

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 
the same thing and control those two

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.260 
the same thing and control those two
things<00:07:36.230> individually<00:07:36.820> volumes<00:07:37.820> how<00:07:38.000> fast

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.270 
things individually volumes how fast

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.330 
things individually volumes how fast
they<00:07:38.450> ramp<00:07:38.720> up<00:07:38.900> wrap<00:07:39.290> down<00:07:39.530> and<00:07:39.800> their<00:07:39.980> speeds

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
they ramp up wrap down and their speeds

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.760 
they ramp up wrap down and their speeds
so<00:07:40.850> that's<00:07:41.030> something<00:07:41.330> totally<00:07:41.510> cool<00:07:41.900> so<00:07:42.620> as

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:42.770 
so that's something totally cool so as

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.370 
so that's something totally cool so as
you<00:07:42.950> can<00:07:43.100> see<00:07:43.160> inside<00:07:43.880> the<00:07:44.030> fao<00:07:44.360> eight<00:07:44.630> fao<00:07:45.080> 6

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:45.380 
you can see inside the fao eight fao 6
