00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone guys here is what to do 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.080
 our review this time 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.240
 regards the book the throne of swords that 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.920
 is the first book in the saga of le 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.309
 chronicles of ice and fire of 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.260
 george martin who i am very happy with 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.539
 do this review because it was from da 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.789
 so much and finally the other day online or 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.560
 finished reading the book then I got myself 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.000
 said to be the next review 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.580
 if with this wonderful book 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.740
 I didn't like it much from here and now 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.410
 I will tell you why I am slowly 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.420
 pinned of things to say but such from 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.120
 don't forget about anything then welcome 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.890
 I'll read so much here to list them all 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.230
 points that I liked 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.020
 first the prologue takes place in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.239
 northernmost part of the seven kingdoms 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.039
 precisely in the barrier e 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.219
 this barrier has been raised 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.800
 precisely to separate these lands 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.390
 seven kingdoms from wild animals ed 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 to strangers these strange ones are 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.890
 let's say entities in the form 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.170
 of shadow that precisely incite time and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.850
 fear and so that's why it was 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.970
 raised there are three main houses 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.369
 that we tell them vicissitudes yes 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.760
 the house of the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.610
 stark lord eddard stark his wife 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.820
 kathleen and their six children 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 the house of the lannisters and therefore of the three 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.020
 brothers cersei hints and tyrone that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.220
 that lineage of targaryens then 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.170
 because this is so called throne of 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.380
 shoulders because the throne of swords precisely 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.380
 sits 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.259
 the king robert baratheon who has precisely 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.180
 killed the king who previously sat 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:45.520
 on this throne that was of the house of gods 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:49.299
 targaryen and took a wife precisely 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.030
 of lannister cersei and from here 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:57.670
 robert and reigns reigns over the seven kingdoms 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.479
 after a while robert goes to do 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.460
 visit to and hard stark his great friend 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.849
 it's almost like he's a brother too 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.110
 and that to him to be his first 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:14.410
 knight and lord eddard also called 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.090
 in and at first it is a little hesitant 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.459
 in accepting this position until 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.590
 end decides to follow king robert ee 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.150
 kathleen wife leaves great winter 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.420
 with the two youngest children 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.060
 obviously vico 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.640
 there are so many intrigues blows of 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.799
 scene that really make you own 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.540
 think that nothing is as it seems because 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.870
 often it is just so them on this 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.880
 project do you think of a thing after some 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.840
 few pages and totally the opposite 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.639
 the plot takes place along the various points of 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.500
 view of the characters because it is not one 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.020
 simple plot of a book but you when 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.030
 go 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.460
 the book just read the points of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.830
 view of the main characters so it is 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.390
 a great thing in my opinion why as if 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.790
 you yourself instead of the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.400
 protagonist and reasons like him therefore 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.150
 experience firsthand what you feel at 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.690
 that protagonist is very fond of me 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.270
 to the character of air one of the daughters 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.320
 by which is the most rebellious we say 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.450
 that there is a but its masculine side 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.360
 compared to the sister who is more 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.160
 perfect she was one of mine 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.130
 favorite characters even in the like 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.080
 much as a person the king does not 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.480
 I see so much that's why we say it is done 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.610
 a bit that dragging his wife to beauty 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.870
 classic bitch of the situation if that 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.000
 there's the book we are not happy and 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.940
 third house I was telling you and the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.520
 lineage of targaryen by blacks if the 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.440
 brother viserys precisely that obviously 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.350
 they will always be involved in 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.820
 various vicissitudes of King Robert of 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.470
 great winter they are all 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.650
 closely connected to each other 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:59.060
 these characters obviously tell you it is 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.270
 a book classified as fantasy 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.090
 it's really very intriguing it's beautiful from 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.380
 read because it never bores you 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.560
 I personally I have never 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.020
 bored them bed in a week 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.840
 and even just I say that I did not see 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.820
 wait to do this review in 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.980
 this you see my shoulders and the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.380
 but the cover of the first book is there 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.750
 are other versions and I for example or the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.690
 volume 1 which contains the first four 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.430
 saga books because in the 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.070
 American version martin wrote 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.020
 seven volumes of which 5 have already been 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.220
 published and the other two 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.470
 obviously they will be next 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.919
 publication the mondadori that the house 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.710
 Italian publisher instead has divided 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.860
 these volumes in many books and so far ne 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.139
 they came out 11 is the twelfth volume 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.240
 the dance of grave will be released on October 30th 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.280
 it is called here therefore the fact of 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.250
 divide the saga into a thousand books 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.250
 make them cost enough the first 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.350
 edition usually costs around 19 euros per 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.979
 then do the oscar best seller a 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.770
 10 however it is that day I was is enough 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:09.650
 so this is the cover of the first one 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.450
 book is really was a discovery 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.360
 pleasant because I hear so much talk 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.520
 after asked opinions on a page of 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.970
 facebook books on the youtubers group 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.070
 so I thought a little bit 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.590
 so I also saw it on the novi library 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.380
 all here with me of super positives 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.470
 then I said to myself I buy too 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.240
 and I'm really happy because I am 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.510
 made sale indeed I am now reading 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.310
 the second which is the great winter is 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.800
 really wonderful so i am very 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.840
 very happy to have started this saga 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.940
 which will be as long as I say I love 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.280
 rice fields very very prisecco in this 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.680
 book find the map of at the beginning 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.120
 seven raimi very useful thing because 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.130
 at least you can give 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.630
 will have an idea on how they move 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.610
 the various protagonists because they do not remain 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.740
 always there in winter, yes indeed 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.050
 they move throughout the territory 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.580
 and then also find an appendix on 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.190
 history of each house and all 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.860
 components that are part of each 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.770
 set by this book indeed from this one 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.510
 saga also a TV series was made 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.190
 which I personally haven't seen yet 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.780
 because I prefer to see and read first 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.760
 the book then if to see the show 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.580
