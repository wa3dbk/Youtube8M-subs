00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this ahead and I'm really really worried

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.289 
this ahead and I'm really really worried
about<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.790> stretch

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
about a little bit about that stretch

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.050 
about a little bit about that stretch
it's<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> tough<00:01:46.740> time<00:01:47.060> now

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it's going to be a tough time now

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.440 
it's going to be a tough time now
looking<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> last<00:01:49.380> half<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.950> season

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
looking at the last half of the season

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.469 
looking at the last half of the season
favors<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> Dolphins<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.590> being<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:52.950> home

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
favors the Dolphins for being at home

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.499 
favors the Dolphins for being at home
but<00:01:54.530> who<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:56.189> play<00:01:56.460> some<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:57.240> tough

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
but who they play some really tough

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.899 
but who they play some really tough
games<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.770> almost<00:01:58.979> every<00:01:59.399> single<00:01:59.700> one<00:01:59.880> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
games I think almost every single one of

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.780 
games I think almost every single one of
them<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.390> against<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.259> last<00:02:01.740> year's<00:02:02.280> playoff

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
them is against a last year's playoff

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.840 
them is against a last year's playoff
team<00:02:03.030> they<00:02:03.659> play<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> cowboys<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:05.549> play<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
team they play the cowboys to play the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.029 
team they play the cowboys to play the
ravens<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.509> Giants<00:02:07.140> Giants<00:02:07.530> weren't<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
ravens the Giants Giants weren't a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.790 
ravens the Giants Giants weren't a
playoff<00:02:08.399> team<00:02:08.720> but<00:02:09.720> they<00:02:09.959> play<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.410> chargers

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
playoff team but they play the chargers

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.440 
playoff team but they play the chargers
colts<00:02:11.520> patriots<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> jets

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
colts patriots and the jets

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.130 
colts patriots and the jets
I<00:02:13.739> mean<00:02:14.739> that's<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.459> killers<00:02:15.819> row<00:02:16.090> right<00:02:16.750> there

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
I mean that's a killers row right there

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.759 
I mean that's a killers row right there
the<00:02:17.620> jets<00:02:17.830> are<00:02:17.890> going<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.129> be<00:02:18.220> vastly<00:02:18.819> improved

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769

make no bones about that hate the jets

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.610 
make no bones about that hate the jets
but<00:02:23.950> they<00:02:24.250> are<00:02:24.400> going<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.790> improved<00:02:25.620> too

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
but they are going to be improved too

not going to be a walkover this is our

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.910 
not going to be a walkover this is our
division<00:02:32.410> has<00:02:32.920> really<00:02:33.670> really<00:02:33.910> tightened<00:02:34.540> up

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
division has really really tightened up

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.199

New<00:02:35.920> England's<00:02:36.280> not<00:02:36.519> going<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.790> have<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.060> is

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
New England's not going to have it is

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.710 
New England's not going to have it is
easy<00:02:37.599> within<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.170> division<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:40.209> year<00:02:40.269> I

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
easy within the division this year I

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.320 
easy within the division this year I
think<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.500> everybody<00:02:42.280> could<00:02:42.760> go<00:02:42.910> three<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
think that everybody could go three and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.350 
think that everybody could go three and
three<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:45.040> out<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:46.000> realm<00:02:46.150> of

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
three and is not out of the realm of

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.570 
three and is not out of the realm of
possibility<00:02:47.080> everybody<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.160> division<00:02:48.459> is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
possibility everybody in the division is

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.270 
possibility everybody in the division is
three<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.819> three<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:50.349> last<00:02:50.530> two<00:02:50.799> games<00:02:51.069> of
