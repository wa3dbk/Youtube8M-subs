doing<00:00:04.759> we're<00:00:05.299> actually<00:00:05.450> broadcasting<00:00:06.350> a

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
doing we're actually broadcasting a

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.949 
doing we're actually broadcasting a
hangout<00:00:06.830> on<00:00:06.890> air<00:00:07.040> live<00:00:07.490> using<00:00:08.299> a<00:00:08.509> cell<00:00:08.929> phone

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:08.959 
hangout on air live using a cell phone

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.759 
hangout on air live using a cell phone
mobile<00:00:09.619> so<00:00:10.610> this<00:00:10.940> is<00:00:11.119> my<00:00:11.360> first<00:00:12.049> test<00:00:12.289> actually

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
mobile so this is my first test actually

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.589 
mobile so this is my first test actually
my<00:00:13.009> second<00:00:13.339> test<00:00:13.549> the<00:00:13.669> first<00:00:13.849> one<00:00:13.999> didn't<00:00:14.239> tend

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
my second test the first one didn't tend

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.140 
my second test the first one didn't tend
to<00:00:14.659> work<00:00:14.809> out<00:00:14.989> at<00:00:15.589> to<00:00:15.889> unblock<00:00:16.339> some<00:00:16.880> things

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
to work out at to unblock some things

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.609 
to work out at to unblock some things
and<00:00:17.449> I<00:00:17.689> think<00:00:17.960> that's<00:00:18.140> what<00:00:18.289> made<00:00:18.470> the

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
and I think that's what made the

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.200 
and I think that's what made the
difference<00:00:18.769> so<00:00:19.130> now<00:00:19.310> oh<00:00:19.339> that's<00:00:20.000> getting

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
difference so now oh that's getting

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.380 
difference so now oh that's getting
scary<00:00:20.539> we're<00:00:21.289> taking<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:21.859> cell<00:00:22.789> phone<00:00:23.060> we'll

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
scary we're taking the cell phone we'll

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.169 
scary we're taking the cell phone we'll
move<00:00:23.630> it<00:00:23.779> get<00:00:24.679> the<00:00:24.890> camera<00:00:25.429> pointing<00:00:25.699> at<00:00:26.029> me

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
move it get the camera pointing at me

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.649
