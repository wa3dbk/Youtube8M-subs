it<00:00:22.470> out<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:22.740> you're<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:22.949> YouTube<00:00:24.289> but<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> got

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
it out if you're on YouTube but it got

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.960 
it out if you're on YouTube but it got
me<00:00:25.590> thinking<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.430> make<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> video<00:00:26.789> game

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
me thinking so you can make a video game

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.670 
me thinking so you can make a video game
fairly<00:00:27.660> basic<00:00:27.840> video<00:00:28.109> game<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.380> three<00:00:28.529> minutes

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
fairly basic video game in three minutes

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.240 
fairly basic video game in three minutes
I<00:00:28.980> wonder<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.210> can<00:00:30.420> make<00:00:30.630> pong<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.439> four

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
I wonder if you can make pong in four

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
I wonder if you can make pong in four
and<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> that's<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.530> video<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.800> going

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and so that's what this video is going

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.530 
and so that's what this video is going
to<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.399> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.640> me<00:00:35.910> attempting<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
to be it's going to be me attempting to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.819 
to be it's going to be me attempting to
make<00:00:36.660> pong<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.170> four<00:00:37.350> minutes

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
make pong in four minutes

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.100 
make pong in four minutes
now<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:38.879> actually<00:00:39.059> done<00:00:39.390> any<00:00:39.809> time

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
now I have not actually done any time

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.729 
now I have not actually done any time
trial<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> don't<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:42.300> fast<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.320> can

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
trial so I don't know how fast I can

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.810 
trial so I don't know how fast I can
make<00:00:44.219> pong<00:00:45.050> but<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.550> something

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
make pong but it's a it's something

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.990 
make pong but it's a it's something
we're<00:00:48.059> trying<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.610> we'll<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.879> we

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
we're trying out here so we'll see if we

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
we're trying out here so we'll see if we
can't<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.350> pretty<00:00:52.559> quick<00:00:52.680> now

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
can't get this to to be pretty quick now

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.350 
can't get this to to be pretty quick now
I<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.399> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> point<00:00:53.789> out<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.210> will

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
I do want to point out that this will

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240 
I do want to point out that this will
just<00:00:54.390> kind<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> spirit<00:00:55.739> animal<00:00:56.129> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
just kind of be the spirit animal of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.880 
just kind of be the spirit animal of
pong<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.329> basic<00:00:57.660> gameplay<00:00:58.109> mechanics<00:00:58.770> not

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
pong the basic gameplay mechanics not

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
pong the basic gameplay mechanics not
necessarily<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.539> way<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.750> looks

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
necessarily all of the the way it looks

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
necessarily all of the the way it looks
and<00:01:01.199> everything<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.640> want

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and everything like that we we do want

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.160 
and everything like that we we do want
to<00:01:02.820> keep<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.059> fairly<00:01:03.270> straightforward<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
to keep this fairly straightforward and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.100 
to keep this fairly straightforward and
simple<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.460> four<00:01:05.670> minutes<00:01:05.810> not<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> lot<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
simple so it's four minutes not a lot of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.410 
simple so it's four minutes not a lot of
time<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> anyway

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
time so anyway

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.960 
time so anyway

we<00:03:46.870> are<00:03:46.930> going<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.139> say<00:03:47.410> 0<00:03:48.510> inputs<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:50.530> get

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
we are going to say 0 inputs that get

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.599 
we are going to say 0 inputs that get
access<00:03:53.160> horizontal<00:03:54.160> even<00:03:54.340> though<00:03:54.430> it's<00:03:54.549> the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
access horizontal even though it's the

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.309 
access horizontal even though it's the
horizontal<00:03:55.120> axis<00:03:55.480> we<00:03:55.660> are<00:03:55.870> using<00:03:56.109> it<00:03:56.290> to

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
horizontal axis we are using it to

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.970 
horizontal axis we are using it to
control<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:57.040> vertical<00:03:57.430> direction<00:03:58.419> a<00:03:59.380> little

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
control the vertical direction a little

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.949 
control the vertical direction a little
hacky<00:04:00.430> like<00:04:00.609> that<00:04:00.819> all<00:04:01.150> right<00:04:03.870> could<00:04:04.870> have

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
hacky like that all right could have

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.409 
hacky like that all right could have
done<00:04:05.079> it<00:04:05.200> great<00:04:05.470> if<00:04:05.590> I<00:04:05.680> had<00:04:05.799> five<00:04:06.010> minutes<00:04:06.419> now

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
done it great if I had five minutes now

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.289 
done it great if I had five minutes now
this<00:04:07.599> will<00:04:07.750> work<00:04:07.810> just<00:04:07.870> fine<00:04:08.730> all<00:04:09.730> right<00:04:10.000> so

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
this will work just fine all right so

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.180 
this will work just fine all right so
that<00:04:10.630> is<00:04:10.660> our<00:04:10.959> paddle<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.530> now<00:04:11.739> let's<00:04:11.889> move<00:04:12.010> on

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
that is our paddle and now let's move on

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.069 
that is our paddle and now let's move on
to<00:04:12.310> our<00:04:12.370> ball<00:04:12.639> our<00:04:12.880> ball<00:04:13.389> we're<00:04:13.660> basically<00:04:14.049> I

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
to our ball our ball we're basically I

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.569 
to our ball our ball we're basically I
want<00:04:14.319> to<00:04:14.380> be<00:04:14.739> able<00:04:14.829> to<00:04:14.950> keep<00:04:15.099> track<00:04:15.430> of

want to be able to keep track of

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.190 
want to be able to keep track of

directions so float speed X float speed
Y<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.859> then<00:04:21.310> we're<00:04:21.459> going<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.669> say

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
Y and then we're going to say

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.050

and make one else one grab that line

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.850 
and make one else one grab that line
paste<00:04:38.560> it<00:04:38.830> that's<00:04:39.099> why<00:04:39.960> there<00:04:40.960> we<00:04:41.080> go<00:04:41.289> and<00:04:41.530> then

sure I didn't have any errors here and
we<00:05:24.969> have<00:05:25.360> palm<00:05:26.009> alright<00:05:27.030> so<00:05:28.030> that<00:05:28.210> is<00:05:28.240> pong<00:05:28.840> and

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
we have palm alright so that is pong and

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.879 
we have palm alright so that is pong and
I<00:05:29.979> have<00:05:30.310> not<00:05:30.460> checked<00:05:30.639> my<00:05:30.789> time<00:05:30.969> so<00:05:31.330> um<00:05:31.889> I'll

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
I have not checked my time so um I'll

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.350 
I have not checked my time so um I'll
have<00:05:32.949> a<00:05:33.190> little<00:05:33.400> call<00:05:33.580> out<00:05:33.729> here<00:05:33.940> in<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.120> video

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
have a little call out here in the video

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.719 
have a little call out here in the video
to<00:05:34.479> see<00:05:34.630> if<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.780> made<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.139> but<00:05:35.550> there<00:05:36.550> you<00:05:36.639> go

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
to see if I made it but there you go

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.550 
to see if I made it but there you go
that's<00:05:37.030> Pauling<00:05:37.449> in<00:05:37.539> a<00:05:37.630> short<00:05:37.990> amount<00:05:38.349> of<00:05:38.500> time

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
that's Pauling in a short amount of time

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.629 
that's Pauling in a short amount of time
I<00:05:39.099> don't<00:05:39.430> know<00:05:39.580> how<00:05:40.330> much<00:05:40.509> time<00:05:40.840> I'm<00:05:41.639> guessing

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
I don't know how much time I'm guessing

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.879 
I don't know how much time I'm guessing
it<00:05:42.729> was<00:05:42.819> about<00:05:42.969> 4<00:05:43.240> minutes<00:05:43.419> just<00:05:44.380> by<00:05:44.620> looking

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
it was about 4 minutes just by looking

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.510 
it was about 4 minutes just by looking
at<00:05:45.009> the<00:05:45.159> recording<00:05:46.029> timer<00:05:46.960> here<00:05:47.409> but<00:05:48.009> we'll

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
at the recording timer here but we'll

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.080 
at the recording timer here but we'll
see<00:05:48.729> so<00:05:48.909> anyway<00:05:49.690> um<00:05:50.400> that<00:05:51.400> is<00:05:51.520> pong<00:05:51.729> in<00:05:51.880> 4

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
see so anyway um that is pong in 4

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.110 
see so anyway um that is pong in 4
minutes<00:05:52.300> approximately<00:05:53.169> maybe<00:05:53.969> unedited<00:05:54.969> and

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
minutes approximately maybe unedited and

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.629 
minutes approximately maybe unedited and
I<00:05:55.750> apologize<00:05:56.349> I<00:05:56.650> originally<00:05:57.250> was<00:05:57.370> thinking

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
I apologize I originally was thinking

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.490 
I apologize I originally was thinking
about<00:05:57.759> editing<00:05:58.150> it<00:05:58.300> so<00:05:58.419> you<00:05:58.509> didn't<00:05:58.779> hear<00:05:59.020> the

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
about editing it so you didn't hear the

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.469 
about editing it so you didn't hear the
loud<00:05:59.770> crazy<00:06:00.400> annoying<00:06:00.819> sounds<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.360> my

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
loud crazy annoying sounds of my

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.450 
loud crazy annoying sounds of my
mechanical<00:06:01.960> keyboard<00:06:02.050> but<00:06:02.949> then<00:06:03.099> I<00:06:03.190> thought

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
mechanical keyboard but then I thought

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.920 
mechanical keyboard but then I thought
now<00:06:03.819> everyone's<00:06:04.270> just<00:06:04.330> kind<00:06:04.509> of<00:06:04.630> think<00:06:04.810> I

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
now everyone's just kind of think I

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.800 
now everyone's just kind of think I
faked<00:06:05.229> it<00:06:05.409> if<00:06:05.680> I<00:06:06.009> if<00:06:06.729> I<00:06:06.819> edit<00:06:07.000> it<00:06:07.270> in<00:06:07.360> any<00:06:07.509> way<00:06:07.750> so

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
faked it if I if I edit it in any way so

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.740 
faked it if I if I edit it in any way so
I<00:06:08.080> made<00:06:08.380> it<00:06:08.529> completely<00:06:09.069> unedited<00:06:09.490> thank<00:06:10.419> you

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
I made it completely unedited thank you

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.170 
I made it completely unedited thank you
to<00:06:11.050> the<00:06:11.349> people<00:06:11.469> that<00:06:11.740> made<00:06:11.949> the<00:06:12.060> can't<00:06:13.060> think
