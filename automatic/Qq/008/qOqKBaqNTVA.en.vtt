00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:03.150
 it's the kind of stuff 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.150
 he is not here I am with this defeat 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.129
 marquette for tablets welcome 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.599
 you can see when it has always been 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.230
 and especially the drought 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.230
 to a little more volume 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.249
 but there the situation 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.699
 so there are two categories 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.050
 rather classic 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.050
 then leave it the applications 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 according to some 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.580
 no longer feeling sore 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.270
 according to marketwatch 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.270
 this fiction 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 as long as this mission 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800
 but here it is installed 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.700
 so tomorrow I will find on the desk 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.750
 because in June 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.750
 for the Netherlands 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.270
 cannes it's like the dock 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 in our application is a little 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 my thing is not walking in the cold winter 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.580
 I do not download 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.300
 it's different from these elements 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.730
 a click surely a passage under 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.310
 similar apps 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.310
 on the side 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.739
 salim lehri apps that are they 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.739
 the creator that 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.989
 I'm going on the desk 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.479
 porsche had to escape the possibility of installing 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.479
 but here you have seen this second marquette 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.769
 overall we look like 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 very strangely to rank preview 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.789
 our concern is that the applications that are installed 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:51.949
 alassane 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.149
 applications 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:09.569
 acidity and that's not the game 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.379
 normal slaughter
