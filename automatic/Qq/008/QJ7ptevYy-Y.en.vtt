 mark that I will mention in the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.369
 video is not paying me any 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.840
 weight to mention them in this video that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.910
 sizing you because they are the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.770
 products that are working for me 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.379

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.309
 products that I want to show you are 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.239
 these are from the l'orÃ©al brand 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.559
 that is the shampoo and it says is the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.010
 conditioner I think these products 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.589
 They are new if I'm not wrong and the truth 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.900
 is that I decided to try them because I saw 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.670
 very good reviews on youtube of these 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.840
 products the truth is that to me 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.970
 I love it very much and johann georg girls 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.040
 I want to tell you something very important that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.930
 is what I do in my hair is to wash my 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.659
 hair every day because I do not 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 he liked when he did not wash it he felt that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.299
 I was dirty, I felt dirty and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.600
 I had to wash it every day but 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.460
 watching videos and reporting I discovered 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.310
 that for a hair to be 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.500
 you do not have to wash it every day 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.690
 girls not for the simple fact that they do not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.909
 I see her every day my hair wants 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.710
 say I did not bathe no no no no because 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.050
 there I saw a video of a girl who 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.570
 he mentioned that he did not wash his hair all 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.850
 the days and received very ugly comments 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.850
 tica and filthy was that it is dirty that as 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 he did not bathe every day the simple 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.720
 made to mention that we did not wash the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.850
 hair every day does not mean 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.130
 that we do not see the body that we do not 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.590
 we bathe ok that has to be very 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.060
 clear so that later he does not say to lady 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.830
 It 's dirty like you're not going to eat it 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.960
 every day or as you do not bathe me 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.479
 bathroom every day but my hair does not 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.330
 it wet everything now yes the next 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.330
 product is this oil that you 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.370
 can use with wet or dry hair 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.920
 it does not matter for more products that 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.739
 use this your hair never goes 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.660
 to see fatty and I love to bring it in 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.510
 the good bag indeed 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.190
 I have one I have a little bottle 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.680
 where emptiness of this stops in the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.570
 course of the day's trip to put myself in 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.330
 the tips and that is that my hair has 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.630
 frizz or something like this I like 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.160
 use it more when I'm going to process my 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.540
 good hair when I'm going to put it 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.850
 heat now because I use the iron and 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.100
 legally since I got more than normal 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.410
 when I have my hair wet too 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.810
 I like to wear the girls but not 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.970
 I want to say that this product is not going to 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.820
 make my hair exposed because 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.220
 like my hair has a lot of frizz this 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.770
 all it does is protect it but 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.020
 after this I put my oami mousse 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.660
 cream so that my hair does not move 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.030
 your place I recommend it very much 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.370
 I repeat it can be used with the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.950
 Wet hair or dry hair does not 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.170
 It matters and the next product girls 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.620
 I am loving him with all my heart 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.140
 he used it once a week is it a 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.380
 little is that the truth is 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.050
 pulling out of the rush totally says it's 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.850
 an ampoule 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.490
 emergency treatment and I swear them 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.560
 that if it 's an emergency if you are 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.450
 being an event and his hair is very 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.390
 dried out and want to have this shine 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.220
 nice I know how dark this is going 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.090
 to be that your hair has the shine that 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.850
 you look in a two by three 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.190
 This is used in the shower girls 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.050
 you when you go to bathe 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.750
 wash your hair really well with 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.510
 shampoos that you use and then you 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.240
 place all the vial of media to 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.130
 tips have to act more or less than 1 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.840
 to 2 minutes the truth is that I leave it 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.150
 five minutes will serve you sincerely 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.550
 I leave it five minutes and then I 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.980
 rinse and ready girls do not need 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.690
 conditioner or anything like that 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.820
 and if girls these are the products that 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.250
 I wanted to show them because the truth 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.109
 is that I loved them and you guys 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.450
 they ask a lot what it is and what products 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.150
 I use in my hair I had them 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.530
 He said he used much the 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.900
 natural masks but I left them 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.880
 girls, I left the masks by 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.500
 complete when I say that completely 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.390
 but for the moment I already left them 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.780
 now I am using these products 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.120
 I have more or less a month and cachito if not 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.540
 I'm wrong using them and my hair 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.910
 it has been much healthier and I have seen it 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.440
 that my hair has grown a little more 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.800
 It is very long as you can tell 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.319
 but this helps me 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.300
 to have my hair healthy and I am 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.949
 helping me to grow up I hope so 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.080
 if previously it used much the 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.479
 pantene products the truth contains 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.069
 I loved it but like my 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.710
 hair got used to this 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.080
 shampoo and did not see the same results 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.539
 that at the beginning that's why I decided 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.060
 change to these products and I 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.889
 loved no regrets for anything I 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.900
 I hope you will try them and be the 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.930

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.699

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.919

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.879
 I get them in Walmart, I'm not
