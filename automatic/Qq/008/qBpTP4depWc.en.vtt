00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
that's called a Dueling tree this one

that's called a Dueling tree this one
happens<00:00:45.379> to<00:00:45.410> be<00:00:45.469> from<00:00:45.649> action<00:00:46.010> target<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.500> if

happens to be from action target and if
you've<00:00:48.680> got<00:00:48.769> seen<00:00:49.039> one<00:00:49.190> of<00:00:49.250> those<00:00:49.339> that's<00:00:49.789> how

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
you've got seen one of those that's how

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.660 
you've got seen one of those that's how
they<00:00:50.120> work<00:00:50.300> whenever<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:50.809> holster<00:00:51.170> here<00:00:51.670> it's

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
they work whenever you holster here it's

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.969 
they work whenever you holster here it's
called<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.030> tree<00:00:53.329> because<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:54.350> looks<00:00:54.829> like<00:00:54.949> a

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
called a tree because it looks like a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.530 
called a tree because it looks like a
tree<00:00:55.250> I<00:00:55.280> guess<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.640> stands<00:00:55.909> up<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.360> it<00:00:56.420> has

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
tree I guess it stands up and it has

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.950 
tree I guess it stands up and it has
limbs<00:00:56.899> that<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:57.769> knock<00:00:58.610> around<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.390> we

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
limbs that you knock around so we

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.420 
limbs that you knock around so we
thought<00:01:00.110> we'd<00:01:00.379> just<00:01:00.589> kind<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.070> give<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.309> an

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
closer up we've had this in a couple of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.289 
closer up we've had this in a couple of
videos<00:01:39.140> one<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.740> guess<00:01:39.979> we've<00:01:40.130> not<00:01:40.250> posted<00:01:40.700> but

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
videos one I guess we've not posted but

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.450 
videos one I guess we've not posted but
we<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:41.899> got<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.320> wanted<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.590> use<00:01:42.680> it<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:43.009> we

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
we just got it wanted to use it so we

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.370 
we just got it wanted to use it so we
were<00:01:43.790> so<00:01:43.939> anxious<00:01:44.149> that<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:44.930> didn't<00:01:45.170> have<00:01:45.259> it

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
were so anxious that we didn't have it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.440 
were so anxious that we didn't have it
tilted<00:01:45.590> enough<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:46.310> worked<00:01:46.909> pretty<00:01:47.060> cool

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
tilted enough and worked pretty cool

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.600 
tilted enough and worked pretty cool
pretty<00:01:47.930> well<00:01:48.170> but<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:49.219> wasn't<00:01:49.490> working

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
pretty well but it wasn't working

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.999 
pretty well but it wasn't working
exactly<00:01:50.030> right<00:01:50.360> with<00:01:50.540> lighter<00:01:50.750> ammo<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:51.860> if

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
exactly right with lighter ammo but if

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.410 
exactly right with lighter ammo but if
you<00:01:52.100> get<00:01:52.219> it<00:01:52.340> leaning<00:01:52.640> properly<00:01:53.060> get<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.240> level

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
you get it leaning properly get a level

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.410 
you get it leaning properly get a level
on<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.689> bottom<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:54.439> really<00:01:54.979> does<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.189> job

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
on the bottom it really does the job

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.179 
on the bottom it really does the job
once<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:56.509> see<00:01:56.659> how<00:01:56.810> these<00:01:56.960> these<00:01:57.530> pieces<00:01:57.860> work

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
once you see how these these pieces work

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.130 
once you see how these these pieces work
they<00:01:58.430> just<00:01:58.640> fit<00:01:58.909> in<00:01:59.060> there<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.600> can<00:01:59.780> take<00:01:59.990> them

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
they just fit in there you can take them

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.459 
they just fit in there you can take them
out<00:02:00.289> slop<00:02:01.009> them<00:02:01.159> in<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:02.840> set<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.259> hard

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
out slop them in and you set the it hard

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.870 
out slop them in and you set the it hard
enough<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.649> get<00:02:03.799> it<00:02:03.860> back<00:02:04.100> over<00:02:04.399> them<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:04.700> then

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
enough to get it back over them and then

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.749 
enough to get it back over them and then
it<00:02:05.000> swings<00:02:05.420> around<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:06.409> see<00:02:06.619> else<00:02:06.799> how

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
it swings around you see else how

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.509 
it swings around you see else how
solidly<00:02:08.539> it's<00:02:08.750> built<00:02:09.109> in<00:02:09.829> the<00:02:09.950> design<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.310> that

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
solidly it's built in the design of that

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.280 
solidly it's built in the design of that
thing<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.390> can<00:02:11.540> do<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:11.750> need<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.019> grease<00:02:12.260> it

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
thing now we can do we need to grease it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.680 
thing now we can do we need to grease it
what<00:02:13.190> I've<00:02:13.280> been<00:02:13.430> doing<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:13.880> since<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.510> got

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
what I've been doing just since we got

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.380 
what I've been doing just since we got
here<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.019> don't<00:02:15.320> have<00:02:15.410> any<00:02:15.590> grease<00:02:15.829> right<00:02:16.070> now

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
here I don't have any grease right now

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.759 
here I don't have any grease right now
I've<00:02:17.390> been<00:02:17.600> just<00:02:17.780> putting<00:02:18.079> some<00:02:18.230> bowel<00:02:18.410> stall

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
I've been just putting some bowel stall

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.789 
I've been just putting some bowel stall
here<00:02:18.980> where<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.280> swings<00:02:19.660> because<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:21.350> needs<00:02:21.590> to

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
here where it swings because it needs to

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.330 
here where it swings because it needs to
slide<00:02:22.220> around<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.500> rare<00:02:24.739> occasion<00:02:24.769> you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
slide around and on a rare occasion you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.039 
slide around and on a rare occasion you
might<00:02:25.519> get<00:02:25.730> one<00:02:25.910> if<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:26.570> don't<00:02:26.720> get<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.840> good

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
might get one if you don't get a good

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.830 
might get one if you don't get a good
hit<00:02:27.290> on<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:28.220> might<00:02:28.609> come<00:02:28.910> around<00:02:29.030> here<00:02:29.570> and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
hit on it it might come around here and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.990 
hit on it it might come around here and
just<00:02:30.190> balance<00:02:31.190> right<00:02:31.400> there<00:02:31.640> but<00:02:31.880> generally

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
just balance right there but generally

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.039 
just balance right there but generally
it's<00:02:32.269> going<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.450> go<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.660> way<00:02:32.780> or<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.019> other

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
it's going to go one way or the other

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.190 
it's going to go one way or the other
because<00:02:33.410> it's<00:02:33.739> leaning<00:02:34.870> especially<00:02:35.870> now<00:02:36.019> we

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
because it's leaning especially now we

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.620 
because it's leaning especially now we
have<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.440> leaning<00:02:36.680> properly<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.790> we<00:02:38.359> got<00:02:38.510> our

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
have it leaning properly so we got our

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.890 
have it leaning properly so we got our
set<00:02:38.840> right<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:39.519> it's<00:02:40.519> an<00:02:40.700> interesting<00:02:41.150> device

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
set right and it's an interesting device

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.030 
set right and it's an interesting device
there's<00:02:42.230> no<00:02:42.350> doubt<00:02:42.530> about<00:02:42.650> that

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
there's no doubt about that

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.640 
there's no doubt about that
and<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.510> hardened<00:02:44.870> steel<00:02:45.080> on<00:02:45.319> this<00:02:45.470> one

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
and this is hardened steel on this one

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.600 
and this is hardened steel on this one
they<00:02:46.010> make<00:02:46.220> them<00:02:46.430> for<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:47.420> 22<00:02:48.200> caliber

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
they make them for the 22 caliber

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.410 
they make them for the 22 caliber
but<00:02:50.000> we<00:02:50.420> went<00:02:50.569> ahead<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.290> voted<00:02:51.680> one<00:02:52.190> at<00:02:53.150> all

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
but we went ahead and voted one at all

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.199 
but we went ahead and voted one at all
they<00:02:53.600> are<00:02:53.780> 550<00:02:54.680> steel<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.610> we<00:02:55.730> can<00:02:55.880> shoot<00:02:56.030> with

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
they are 550 steel so we can shoot with

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.530 
they are 550 steel so we can shoot with
anything<00:02:57.190> even<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.250> rifle<00:02:58.700> if<00:02:58.760> we<00:02:58.850> wanted<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.180> I

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
anything even a rifle if we wanted to I

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.110 
anything even a rifle if we wanted to I
don't<00:02:59.690> know<00:02:59.840> we'll<00:03:00.110> do<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:01.370> pretty

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
don't know we'll do that but pretty

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.620 
don't know we'll do that but pretty
ingenious<00:03:02.450> design<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.700> we're<00:03:05.330> going<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.540> get

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
ingenious design so we're going to get

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.740 
ingenious design so we're going to get
some<00:03:05.840> grease<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.550> federal<00:03:07.550> work<00:03:07.700> well<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
some grease and federal work well the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.170 
some grease and federal work well the
bow<00:03:08.900> saw<00:03:09.140> actually<00:03:09.470> works<00:03:09.680> well<00:03:09.890> but<00:03:10.160> after<00:03:11.150> a

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
bow saw actually works well but after a

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.410 
bow saw actually works well but after a
rainstorm<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:12.290> won't<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:13.060> pretty<00:03:14.060> uh<00:03:14.150> pretty

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
rainstorm it won't so pretty uh pretty

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.110 
rainstorm it won't so pretty uh pretty
clever<00:03:14.840> pretty<00:03:15.290> clever

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120

that I was just in the mood sheets of

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.120 
that I was just in the mood sheets of
ten<00:03:23.330> millimeter<00:03:23.720> but<00:03:24.290> let<00:03:24.500> me<00:03:24.590> show<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:24.830> two

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
ten millimeter but let me show you two

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.390 
ten millimeter but let me show you two
that<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.459> will<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:26.720> will<00:03:26.840> operate<00:03:27.230> with<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> nine

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
that it will it will operate with a nine

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.920 
that it will it will operate with a nine
millimeter<00:03:30.190> now<00:03:31.190> if<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:32.540> don't<00:03:32.720> get<00:03:32.870> a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
millimeter now if you you don't get a

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.040 
millimeter now if you you don't get a
good<00:03:33.140> hit<00:03:33.380> on<00:03:33.410> one<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.920> arms<00:03:34.069> or<00:03:34.489> limbs

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
good hit on one of the arms or limbs

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.559 
good hit on one of the arms or limbs
it<00:03:36.410> might<00:03:36.680> not<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.670> you<00:03:38.120> know<00:03:38.180> it's<00:03:38.360> just<00:03:38.450> like

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
it might not so you know it's just like

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.150 
it might not so you know it's just like
knocking<00:03:38.900> over<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.319> plate<00:03:39.620> or<00:03:39.650> something

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
knocking over a plate or something

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.520 
knocking over a plate or something
you've<00:03:40.340> got<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.489> get<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.700> good<00:03:40.850> hit<00:03:41.060> on<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:43.360> okay

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
you've got to get a good hit on it okay

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.220 
you've got to get a good hit on it okay
let's<00:03:45.530> see<00:03:45.769> here<00:03:45.980> if<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.310> can<00:03:46.870> hit<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.019> thing

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
let's see here if I can hit the thing

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:59.390 
let's see here if I can hit the thing
with<00:03:48.470> this<00:03:48.560> I'll<00:03:48.769> start<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.100> bottom

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.759 

there<00:03:59.819> we<00:03:59.909> go<00:04:00.090> let's<00:04:01.049> say<00:04:02.810> haha<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:04.290> big<00:04:04.530> enough

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
there we go let's say haha in big enough

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.649 
there we go let's say haha in big enough
to<00:04:04.890> hit<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.069> knocking<00:04:05.370> around<00:04:05.610> but<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.569> it

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
to hit the knocking around but so it

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.839 
to hit the knocking around but so it
works<00:04:06.840> with<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.019> nine-millimeter<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:08.340> don't

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
works with a nine-millimeter I don't

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.330 
works with a nine-millimeter I don't
know<00:04:08.940> if<00:04:09.030> anything<00:04:09.299> will<00:04:09.330> maybe<00:04:09.629> a<00:04:09.750> 32<00:04:10.709> maybe

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
know if anything will maybe a 32 maybe

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.910 
know if anything will maybe a 32 maybe
or<00:04:11.519> 380<00:04:11.909> we<00:04:12.209> haven't<00:04:12.420> tried<00:04:12.569> a<00:04:12.629> 380<00:04:13.170> on<00:04:13.379> those

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
or 380 we haven't tried a 380 on those

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.430 
or 380 we haven't tried a 380 on those
are<00:04:14.069> pretty<00:04:14.220> heavy<00:04:14.459> plates<00:04:15.049> however<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.139> good

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
are pretty heavy plates however a good

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.199 
are pretty heavy plates however a good
hit<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.919> it<00:04:17.040> will<00:04:17.220> go<00:04:17.669> around<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.970> other<00:04:18.120> side

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
hit and it will go around the other side

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.849 
hit and it will go around the other side
and<00:04:18.600> that's<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.780> main<00:04:18.989> objective<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.620> get<00:04:19.739> it

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
and that's the main objective to get it

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.800 
and that's the main objective to get it
to<00:04:19.949> spin<00:04:20.220> around<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.940> asylum<00:04:21.419> lay<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.630> gun

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
to spin around the asylum lay the gun

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.230 
to spin around the asylum lay the gun
back<00:04:22.019> down<00:04:22.229> here<00:04:22.410> since<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.770> UH<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:24.030> we

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
back down here since the UH so we

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.070 
back down here since the UH so we
thought<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.540> give<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.750> a<00:04:24.780> look<00:04:24.930> at<00:04:25.020> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
thought to give you a look at the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.740 
thought to give you a look at the
dueling<00:04:25.470> tree<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.729> that<00:04:26.760> one<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.120> from<00:04:27.360> action

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
dueling tree so that one is from action

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.719 
dueling tree so that one is from action
target<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:28.470> there<00:04:28.889> are<00:04:29.040> I<00:04:29.070> guess<00:04:29.490> there<00:04:29.639> are

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
target and there are I guess there are

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.150 
target and there are I guess there are
lots<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.270> companies<00:04:30.449> to<00:04:30.720> make<00:04:30.900> them<00:04:31.080> but<00:04:31.680> as<00:04:31.889> I

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
lots of companies to make them but as I

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.070 
lots of companies to make them but as I

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
mentioned in another video we got that

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.189 
mentioned in another video we got that
one<00:04:34.199> for<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.410> half<00:04:34.650> price<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:36.060> sought<00:04:36.930> them
