just<00:00:39.420> stroking<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.010> structure

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
just stroking with the structure

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.619 
just stroking with the structure
following<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.770> thoracic<00:00:44.340> vertebra<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
following the thoracic vertebra on the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.840 
following the thoracic vertebra on the
spine<00:00:47.480> towards<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> one-bar<00:00:48.899> vertebra<00:00:49.850> so

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
spine towards the one-bar vertebra so

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.760 
spine towards the one-bar vertebra so
about<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> region<00:00:51.899> where<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.260> saddle<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
about the region where your saddle is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.700 
about the region where your saddle is
located<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.940> back<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> withers<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
located to back up the withers to the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.310 
located to back up the withers to the
front<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> ship<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.899> here<00:00:57.899> we're<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
front of the ship so here we're going to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.160 
front of the ship so here we're going to
go<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> structure<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.390> using<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
go with the structure and I'm using a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.000 
go with the structure and I'm using a
moderate<00:01:01.680> pressure<00:01:02.270> similar<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
moderate pressure similar to that of

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.359 
moderate pressure similar to that of
currying<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.619> sort<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> cross

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
currying so I'm just sort of cross

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.620 
currying so I'm just sort of cross
double<00:01:08.790> crossing<00:01:09.360> mine<00:01:10.310> working<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.549> down

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.510 

this<00:01:15.630> will<00:01:15.869> help<00:01:16.080> release<00:01:16.619> tension<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
this will help release tension in the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.330 
this will help release tension in the
myofascial<00:01:18.090> system<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> board<00:01:19.200> which<00:01:20.100> is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
myofascial system of the board which is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.929 
myofascial system of the board which is
the<00:01:20.869> fire<00:01:21.869> web<00:01:22.170> basically<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:23.070> contains<00:01:23.580> all

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the fire web basically that contains all

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.520 
the fire web basically that contains all
the<00:01:24.210> muscles<00:01:24.630> by<00:01:25.530> stretching<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:27.530> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the muscles by stretching this and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.920 
the muscles by stretching this and
softening<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.060> get<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> release<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
softening you get a release in the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.830 
softening you get a release in the
deeper<00:01:31.380> layer<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.329> gradually

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
deeper layer so you can gradually

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.719 
deeper layer so you can gradually
increase<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.710> pressure<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.430> using

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
increase the pressure that you're using

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.399 
increase the pressure that you're using
on<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> horses<00:01:36.540> back<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.670> cover<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.790> larger

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
on the horses back and cover a larger

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.620 
on the horses back and cover a larger
face<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.079> here<00:01:43.079> I'm<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:44.189> following<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.509> I'm

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
face so here I'm just following and I'm

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
face so here I'm just following and I'm
gradually<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.290> slowly<00:01:46.979> starting<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> change

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
gradually just slowly starting to change

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.190 
gradually just slowly starting to change
direction<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
direction on the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.359 
direction on the
diagonal<00:01:49.649> coming<00:01:50.340> down<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.860> I'm<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.219> going

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
diagonal coming down and I'm just going

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
diagonal coming down and I'm just going
to<00:01:53.430> follow<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.939> line<00:01:54.299> upper<00:01:54.750> spine<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.530> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
to follow the line upper spine and you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.190 
to follow the line upper spine and you
can<00:01:55.829> see<00:01:56.070> grace<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.520> starting<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.240> chew<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
can see grace is starting to chew and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.850 
can see grace is starting to chew and
stop<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.219> here<00:01:59.899> sometimes<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.320> may<00:02:01.439> take<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.740> few

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
stop in here sometimes it may take a few

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.219 
stop in here sometimes it may take a few
minutes<00:02:02.189> initially<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.329> horses<00:02:03.750> sometimes

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
minutes initially the horses sometimes

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.999 
minutes initially the horses sometimes
show<00:02:04.649> white<00:02:05.399> resistance<00:02:06.619> particularly<00:02:07.619> on

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
show white resistance particularly on

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
show white resistance particularly on
the<00:02:08.160> sensitive<00:02:08.640> horses<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the sensitive horses like the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
the sensitive horses like the
thoroughbred<00:02:10.019> if<00:02:10.349> your<00:02:11.069> horse<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.489> overly

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
thoroughbred if your horse is overly

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.630 
thoroughbred if your horse is overly
sensitive<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:13.200> can<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:13.530> begin<00:02:13.709> by<00:02:13.920> resting

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
sensitive you can just begin by resting

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.690 
sensitive you can just begin by resting
two<00:02:14.970> hands<00:02:15.480> one<00:02:15.870> behind<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.470> winner<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.040> one

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
two hands one behind the winner and one

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.920 
two hands one behind the winner and one
in<00:02:17.819> front<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.209> hips<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.780> staying<00:02:19.349> here

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.220 

and<00:02:24.530> as<00:02:24.709> your<00:02:24.890> horse<00:02:25.099> warms<00:02:25.640> up<00:02:25.849> you<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:26.870> start

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
and as your horse warms up you can start

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.080 
and as your horse warms up you can start
the<00:02:27.409> motion<00:02:27.829> that<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.069> just<00:02:28.250> showed<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:28.730> you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
the motion that I just showed you you
