00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:11.030
 so santa fe classic 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:16.920
 we test with a halo lens in foglights 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:19.859
 still for starters nothing is visible so for 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.070
 balance black white garage in the dark 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.560
 night 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.740
 I start the engine now I turn on 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.000
 for the running lights and the furthest light will burn 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.690
 40 percent light 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 really 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.430
 and white so now I include the dimensions 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.590
 now becomes darker respectively 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.530
 Included dimensions of the role of running lights 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.309
 turned off turn on the neighbor we see two 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.879
 ticks 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.730
 all is well now I turn off my neighbors including 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.430
 fog lights 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.770
 as you can see two ticks below in my opinion they 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.790
 clearer to check again 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:10.500
 turn off conclude fog turn on 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.960
 near but never on top of exposure 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.680
 my less 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.080
 Now 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:24.210
 together with a neighbor turn on the fog 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.920
 In general, there is probably no difference. 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.130
 the test will be on the move 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:36.390
 on the road there was born a walker and so on 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.640
 now we stand in nature lit neighbor 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.630
 Now I quickly turn off my neighbors including 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.119
 fog lights 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:48.740
 so that the difference is immediately visible well 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.119
 accordingly, take it back behind clearer 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.340
 gave further shine did not become again 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.409
 a little bit like that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.799
 means turning off fog including 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.799
 burden 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.340
 now twist tumanki and gave
