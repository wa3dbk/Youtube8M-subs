00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
too long obviously the more you work

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.440 
too long obviously the more you work
with<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.489> camera<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.700> better<00:04:14.880> images<00:04:15.360> you

quite<00:04:20.910> nice<00:04:21.060> we'll<00:04:21.299> see<00:04:21.419> how<00:04:21.600> nice<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.959> looks

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
quite nice we'll see how nice that looks

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.900 
quite nice we'll see how nice that looks
in<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.470> but<00:04:22.740> it's<00:04:23.220> got<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.430> functional

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910

I<00:04:26.100> think<00:04:26.310> for<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.550> price<00:04:26.760> would<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:27.720> say<00:04:27.930> it

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
I think for the price would you say it

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
I think for the price would you say it
was<00:04:28.050> easy<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.500> use<00:04:30.139> yeah<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.169> think<00:04:31.530> anyone<00:04:31.860> who

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
was easy to use yeah I think anyone who

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.200 
was easy to use yeah I think anyone who
hadn't<00:04:32.250> really<00:04:32.430> used<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.700> camera<00:04:32.880> could<00:04:33.090> pick

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
hadn't really used a camera could pick

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.640 
hadn't really used a camera could pick

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
and do an auto and I wouldn't have any

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.290 
and do an auto and I wouldn't have any
problems<00:04:36.630> at<00:04:36.720> all<00:04:37.760> coming<00:04:38.760> from<00:04:38.940> more

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
problems at all coming from more

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.330 
problems at all coming from more
experienced<00:04:39.750> backgrounds<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.950> get<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.130> bit

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
experienced backgrounds you get a bit

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.409 
experienced backgrounds you get a bit
more<00:04:41.370> frustrating<00:04:41.910> cuz<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.120> want<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> do

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
more frustrating cuz you want to do

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.640 
more frustrating cuz you want to do
things<00:04:42.630> with<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.840> may<00:04:42.930> be<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.169> it<00:04:43.260> can't<00:04:43.470> do

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
things with it may be that it can't do

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.320 
things with it may be that it can't do
but<00:04:44.190> again<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.490> have<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.729> consider<00:04:45.000> how<00:04:45.210> much

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
but again you have to consider how much

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.760 
but again you have to consider how much
this<00:04:45.450> camera<00:04:45.750> costs<00:04:46.169> and<00:04:46.320> what<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.560> can<00:04:46.680> offer

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
this camera costs and what it can offer

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.340 
this camera costs and what it can offer
so<00:04:47.669> you<00:04:47.760> think<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.390> might<00:04:48.419> be<00:04:48.690> able<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:48.930> use<00:04:49.169> it

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
so you think you might be able to use it

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.969 
so you think you might be able to use it
