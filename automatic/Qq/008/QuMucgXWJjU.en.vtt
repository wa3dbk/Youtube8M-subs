version<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.539> Optimus<00:00:21.539> Primal<00:00:22.400> probably

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
version of Optimus Primal probably

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.320 
version of Optimus Primal probably
accurate<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.630> all<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> other<00:00:25.199> toys<00:00:26.119> size<00:00:27.119> wise

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
accurate to all the other toys size wise

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.810 
accurate to all the other toys size wise
up<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.810> course<00:00:28.099> because<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.220> know<00:00:29.340> primal

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
up of course because we know primal

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.490 
up of course because we know primal
wasn't<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.300> tall<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.900> beast<00:00:31.080> wars<00:00:31.320> he's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
wasn't all that tall and beast wars he's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.549 
wasn't all that tall and beast wars he's
actually<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> shorter<00:00:32.460> maximals<00:00:34.940> so

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
actually one of the shorter maximals so

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.119 
actually one of the shorter maximals so
scale-wise<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:38.070> works<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.730> good<00:00:40.129> when

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
scale-wise this works really good when

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.200 
scale-wise this works really good when
you<00:00:41.190> compare<00:00:41.550> them<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.879> other

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
you compare them to all the other

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.920 
you compare them to all the other
characters<00:00:44.480> so<00:00:46.070> as<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.550> his<00:00:47.930> face

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
characters so as you can see his face

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.250 
characters so as you can see his face
and<00:00:49.320> bug-eyed<00:00:49.950> face<00:00:50.660> eyes<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.050> going

face and then rotate it down as you
rotate<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.220> face<00:02:36.459> will<00:02:36.670> kind<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:36.910> flip<00:02:37.180> in

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
rotate it the face will kind of flip in

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.970 
rotate it the face will kind of flip in
it's<00:02:39.610> like<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.900> just<00:02:41.050> push<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.800> down

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
it's like that and you just push it down

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.310 
it's like that and you just push it down
like<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.400> there's<00:02:43.350> Optimus<00:02:44.350> Primal<00:02:44.739> in

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
like that and there's Optimus Primal in

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.590 
like that and there's Optimus Primal in
robot<00:02:47.320> mode<00:02:47.519> maximized<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:51.130> let's<00:02:51.400> do<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.880> 360

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
robot mode maximized so let's do a 360

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.860 
robot mode maximized so let's do a 360
here<00:02:52.780> now<00:02:53.530> unlike<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.750> Voyager<00:02:55.750> Class

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
here now unlike the Voyager Class

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.690 
here now unlike the Voyager Class
version<00:02:56.350> this<00:02:56.440> one<00:02:56.620> doesn't<00:02:56.920> come<00:02:57.070> as<00:02:57.220> loaded

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
version this one doesn't come as loaded

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.310 
version this one doesn't come as loaded
but<00:02:58.000> he<00:02:58.120> still<00:02:58.330> comes<00:02:58.510> with<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.780> lot<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.050> weapons

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
but he still comes with a lot of weapons

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
but he still comes with a lot of weapons
he<00:03:00.280> has<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:01.810> double<00:03:02.650> barrel<00:03:04.050> forearm<00:03:05.050> guns<00:03:05.340> on

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
he has to double barrel forearm guns on

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.550 
he has to double barrel forearm guns on
both<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.269> his<00:03:07.420> arms<00:03:08.459> just<00:03:09.459> open<00:03:09.700> them<00:03:09.760> up<00:03:09.910> and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
both of his arms just open them up and

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.290 
both of his arms just open them up and
that<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.680> show<00:03:11.860> accurate<00:03:12.070> because<00:03:12.459> he<00:03:12.730> did<00:03:13.000> use

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
that is show accurate because he did use

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.990 
that is show accurate because he did use
to<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:14.019> few<00:03:14.890> times<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.430> episodes<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.640> trigger

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
to a few times in episodes the trigger

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.210 
to a few times in episodes the trigger
being<00:03:19.420> one<00:03:19.690> episode<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.380> remember<00:03:20.769> him<00:03:20.890> using

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
being one episode I remember him using

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.380 
being one episode I remember him using
two<00:03:21.459> guns<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.810> besides<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.950> know<00:03:24.040> his<00:03:24.190> a

there sometimes kind of kind of work it
in<00:04:11.340> sometimes<00:04:12.340> justice<00:04:12.700> want<00:04:12.879> to<00:04:12.969> go<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.269> there

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
in sometimes justice want to go in there

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.060 
in sometimes justice want to go in there
we<00:04:13.989> go<00:04:15.359> there<00:04:16.359> we<00:04:16.389> go<00:04:16.630> all<00:04:16.989> right<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:18.459> finally

we go there we go all right and finally

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.900 
we go there we go all right and finally
his<00:04:21.070> rocket<00:04:21.489> launchers<00:04:22.949> bring<00:04:23.949> them<00:04:24.130> around

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.570 

just<00:04:27.910> like<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:29.169> there<00:04:29.889> you<00:04:30.009> go<00:04:30.039> there's

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
just like that and there you go there's

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.189 
just like that and there you go there's
all<00:04:30.699> his<00:04:30.820> weapons<00:04:31.139> his<00:04:33.509> guns<00:04:34.509> out<00:04:34.780> here<00:04:35.050> so

get him out of the way and go let's talk
about<00:05:12.370> his<00:05:12.520> articulation<00:05:12.820> his<00:05:13.300> head<00:05:13.479> can<00:05:14.080> go

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
about his articulation his head can go

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:21.540 
about his articulation his head can go
all<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.470> way<00:05:14.620> around<00:05:16.979> that<00:05:19.770> his<00:05:20.770> arms<00:05:21.159> can<00:05:21.250> go

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
all the way around that his arms can go

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.080 
all the way around that his arms can go
all<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:21.909> way<00:05:22.000> around<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.389> shoulder<00:05:22.810> go<00:05:23.169> out

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
all the way around the shoulder go out

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.750 
all the way around the shoulder go out
but<00:05:25.090> at<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.330> elbow<00:05:25.720> turn<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.320> elbow<00:05:26.680> he<00:05:27.580> has

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
but at the elbow turn the elbow he has

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.520 
but at the elbow turn the elbow he has
waist<00:05:28.060> articulation<00:05:28.810> as<00:05:29.080> you<00:05:29.199> sound<00:05:29.440> the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
waist articulation as you sound the

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.710 
waist articulation as you sound the
transformation<00:05:30.190> is<00:05:31.289> nice<00:05:32.289> can<00:05:32.560> go<00:05:32.710> back<00:05:33.720> go

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
transformation is nice can go back go

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.719 
transformation is nice can go back go
really<00:05:35.680> can't<00:05:35.860> go<00:05:35.949> forward<00:05:36.250> probably<00:05:36.490> just<00:05:36.610> up

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
really can't go forward probably just up

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.999 
really can't go forward probably just up
there<00:05:37.409> and<00:05:38.409> his<00:05:38.560> legs<00:05:38.740> go<00:05:38.979> forward<00:05:39.460> back<00:05:40.270> and

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
there and his legs go forward back and

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:50.060 
there and his legs go forward back and
out<00:05:42.009> so<00:05:42.880> I<00:05:45.900> guess<00:05:46.900> that's<00:05:47.050> pretty<00:05:47.259> much<00:05:47.440> it

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070
