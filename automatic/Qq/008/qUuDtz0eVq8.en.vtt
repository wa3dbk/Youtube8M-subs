 download a replica of your orders and 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.720
 its processor is a little elongated since 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.710
 you can see vÃ©lez for some 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 most advanced android 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.060
 Everything's good 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 A) Yes 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.560

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.850
 last I leave it as download it 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.430
 we give to look 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.070
 and we wrote magic rock 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.730
 ah 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.730
 A) Yes 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.460
 and we are going to look for it 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.910
 if it does not appear to us that we arrived to look 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 inside a repository 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.159
 we give it below 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.049
 It is done 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.049
 is this being 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.580
 s 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.719
 As you are seeing, we are going to 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.719
 install 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.210
 or 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.299
 and let's do it 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.610
 there we give in accepting 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.610
 initiating download 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.399
 what sites you want to add to the store 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.399
 because I like it 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.980
 if they still do not have enough of going to the 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.980
 start of the test 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.190
 and since where it says instant 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.580
 ah 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:26.030
 in this they will download it in case you do not 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.880
 they have but if they have it as it happens 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:35.680
 it's good is in the process of unloading 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.680
 took the opportunity to ask them to subscribe 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.710
 it is better to press 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.010
 but the simplest ones for 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.250
 so that you can have other 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.250
 areas 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.890
 in past videos I had put them 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.990
 I do not have good that I already have rock 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:07.530
 now I tell them I do not have it anymore 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.100
 for those personals we would win in April 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.380
 hope you like 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.380
 this game is a very good replica 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.010
 good for 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.950
 for a cell phone like this I liked it 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.209
 we wait for it to load 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.209
 we can see what it is 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.269
 something shabby but you are a replica 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.340
 m 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.680
 it's a not very exact replica but I feel 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.680
 as if he can live has a while 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.740
 it's not very when the game good and if I 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.740
 liked it 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.519
 I hope you like it 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.060
 very good 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.220
 a replica 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.720
 good 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.720
 so he loses 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.150
 and we can see this which is subject is very 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.150
 tico well but as it is a replica because 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.500
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.020
 its deprive of the lehman and it's up 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.300
 yes no 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.430
 more watching
