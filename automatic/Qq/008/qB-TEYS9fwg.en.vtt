00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.919 
homemade filter from 125 gallon tank
probably<00:00:12.090> would<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.330> been<00:00:12.450> better<00:00:12.509> if<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
probably would have been better if I

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
made a video when I first built it

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.140

about<00:00:44.129> three<00:00:44.940> inch<00:00:45.120> space<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> water<00:00:46.399> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
about three inch space for the water to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.420 
about three inch space for the water to
come<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:48.469> go<00:00:49.469> through<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> first<00:00:50.129> chamber

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
come in go through the first chamber

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.630 
come in go through the first chamber
where<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.210> bio-balls<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.949> also<00:00:53.250> has<00:00:53.610> a

big drilled with the regular metal bit
and<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.609> allows<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.090> water<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.449> flow<00:01:04.280> from

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and that allows the water to flow from

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.060 
and that allows the water to flow from
the<00:01:05.339> tank<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.540> chamber<00:01:07.110> once<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the tank into that chamber once the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.760 
the tank into that chamber once the
water<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.820> chamber<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.170> bio<00:01:10.409> balls

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
water is in that chamber the bio balls

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.670 
water is in that chamber the bio balls
here<00:01:11.100> create<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> bacteria<00:01:12.570> which<00:01:13.320> helps

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
here create the bacteria which helps

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.580 
here create the bacteria which helps
keep<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> water<00:01:14.189> clean<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.990> waters<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.409> the

keep the water clean the waters not the
greatest<00:01:17.009> right<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.970> got<00:01:18.119> done

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
greatest right now it just got done

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.429 
greatest right now it just got done
feeding<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:19.259> had<00:01:19.409> some<00:01:19.619> pellets<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
feeding them they had some pellets and

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.249 
feeding them they had some pellets and
some<00:01:22.439> live<00:01:22.650> crabs<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:24.930> saying<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
some live crabs but as I was saying the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.690 
some live crabs but as I was saying the
water<00:01:25.439> goes<00:01:25.680> through<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:26.130> part<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
water goes through this part of the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.319 
water goes through this part of the
chamber<00:01:27.090> goes<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:29.670> space<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
chamber goes down and that space on the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.600 
chamber goes down and that space on the
bottom<00:01:30.479> goes<00:01:30.960> into<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> third<00:01:31.890> chamber<00:01:32.430> that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
bottom goes into the third chamber that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.170 
bottom goes into the third chamber that
could<00:01:32.850> hold<00:01:33.590> even<00:01:34.590> more<00:01:34.619> media<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:36.060> have

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
could hold even more media I don't have

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.810 
could hold even more media I don't have
anything<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> right<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.680> once<00:01:38.610> it's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
anything at it right now and once it's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789 
anything at it right now and once it's
in<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.390> overflows<00:01:39.930> into<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.500> last

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
in there it overflows into the last

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.760 
in there it overflows into the last
chamber<00:01:41.390> which<00:01:42.390> has<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> piece<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.140> plexiglass

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
chamber which has a piece of plexiglass

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.600 
chamber which has a piece of plexiglass
step<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:45.630> about<00:01:45.899> four<00:01:46.710> or<00:01:46.799> five<00:01:47.040> inches<00:01:47.280> from

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
step it's about four or five inches from

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.210 
step it's about four or five inches from
the<00:01:47.729> top<00:01:47.880> allowing<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> water<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.840> overflow

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
the top allowing the water to overflow

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.520 
the top allowing the water to overflow
into<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.549> last<00:01:50.820> chamber<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.320> last

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
into the last chamber and the last

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.690 
into the last chamber and the last
chamber<00:01:52.860> contains<00:01:53.659> regular<00:01:54.659> filter<00:01:55.020> floss<00:01:55.700> so

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
chamber contains regular filter floss so

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.740 
chamber contains regular filter floss so
that<00:01:57.299> also<00:01:57.500> creates<00:01:58.500> bacteria<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.750> filters

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that also creates bacteria but filters

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.569 
that also creates bacteria but filters
out<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.930> impurities<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> waste<00:02:01.979> inside<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
out the impurities the waste inside the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.310 
out the impurities the waste inside the
water<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.060> at<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> bottom<00:02:04.229> here<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
water and at the bottom here we have a

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
water and at the bottom here we have a
300<00:02:07.320> gallons<00:02:07.879> per<00:02:08.879> hour<00:02:10.610> fountain<00:02:11.610> pump

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
300 gallons per hour fountain pump

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.690 
300 gallons per hour fountain pump
and<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.700> pushes<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.750> water<00:02:14.310> back<00:02:15.310> into<00:02:15.550> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
and that pushes the water back into the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.470 
and that pushes the water back into the
tank<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:17.489> works<00:02:18.489> great<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.940> mean<00:02:19.000> once<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
tank and works great I mean once the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.440 
tank and works great I mean once the
bacterias<00:02:20.110> built<00:02:20.349> up<00:02:20.610> works<00:02:21.610> great<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.120> mean<00:02:22.330> of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
bacterias built up works great I mean of

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.930 
bacterias built up works great I mean of
