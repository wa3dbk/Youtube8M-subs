00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.010
 hello of motorcycle 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.830
 now I present another doll that is not directly in yari of mine 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.580
 sister 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.059
 but it's still part of the barbie collector win - royalty collection 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.490
 teleacras - trento 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.409
 they have therefore only lacking but unfortunately 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.449
 there is no way to find it 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.080
 and anyway we don't really care 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.509
 then my sister gave her 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.019
 here it is 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.399
 eeeeeee the reproduction of Queen Elizabeth first of England 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.370
 that fans of Flemish art or in any case of the historical period of the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.930
 England of the swans 500x600 will recognize painted by this Capri 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.640
 to this barbie 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.770
 m I don't have it unfortunately here 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.830
 anyway 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.830
 now let's see in detail 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.600
 she also eataly seen faithfully taken from the picture 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.820
 not 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.020
 when 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.020
 perhaps most was 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.990
 and why he had all this face uncovered 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.910
 Elisabetta first call it maiolo 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.260
 and this morning I made them fall 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.740
 all hair 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.880
 so it is assumed that she who was poor was devastated by this morning 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.770
 on our own skin 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.140
 and it was assumed I was saying that the wigs were heading 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.060
 look at this crown 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.930
 unfortunately it cannot be seen very well 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.820
 hair 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 tv there are very rich 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.790
 this is a hairstyle of the time 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.950
 is 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.590
 here the mattel wanted to make me pay attention 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.860
 all the details of the dress these are not seen very well in super - 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.590
 are the five beads crossed like these white ones 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.050
 like a cross, these mines, red is small gems 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.109
 and the same tune is reproduced on the collar 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.449
 and on this pendant 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.449
 attack they were these jewels 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.449
 very showy very large 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:17.919
 great matri 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.110
 % 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.190
 er how to say very geometric not like 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:27.040
 those of 700 then we will see who says eyes circles diamantini et cetera 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.479
 there are also decorating this ruff 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.969
 beautiful very beautiful and then all iridescent you see 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.879
 here there are applications with pearls so the shooting commits them 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.209
 earrings 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.869
 the dilemma 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:52.349
 The reason is that these necklaces are very reason and very many or very long 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.639
 above all and here the fashion of the jewelery fashion of the was born 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.930
 pearl necklace however names intertwined as is still used today no 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.249
 the paper bodice was very long 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.049
 hope alessandro siani - 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.039
 always handmade 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:15.889
 and 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.589
 now 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.420
 calceranica here 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.809
 my word 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.209
 then at the time it was used 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.319
 thank you 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.549
 for 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.909
 and black fans 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.830
 on the woman because sometimes she does very hot night 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.739
 how to use it now to get some air and give yourself with a bow 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:37.979
 a star 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.970
 which then apache to collect presents go there 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.970
 also the fan she with the beads 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:50.229
 this is a typical dress of the time because we have sleeves 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.379
 very bros if I'm not snorting yet 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.939
 it was not yet fashion 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.939
 this sort of under many cam 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.569
 they are both sides 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:07.799
 then we have 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.739
 let's call a good first so no frankly I don't know how to call it otherwise 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.799
 always shorter tracks 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.419
 and then undergo yourself like a bell 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.930
 opens like a bell 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.159
 behind 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.800
 it's the dress was quite simple we have nothing at all 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.349
 and it was so 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.020
 it was very narrow in life via the mountains there are the worst 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.430
 the ruff 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.849
 this kind of cape that could be used here too 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.639
 acerbis y 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.960
 cancel this dress first 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.370
 I don't think that there was unfortunately the audio Maori look at them calmly it seems to 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.080
 remember in the trailer 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.499

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.870

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.449
 compared to the end of the site 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.569
 which was very decorative 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.789
 these in particular the fabric with its own golden thread 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.740

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.979
