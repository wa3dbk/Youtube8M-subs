00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.820 
experiences and chance how
if<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.840> was<00:01:59.960> going<00:02:00.140> on<00:02:00.320> when<00:02:00.470> i<00:02:00.530> was<00:02:00.800> in

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
if that was going on when i was in

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.260 
if that was going on when i was in
college<00:02:01.010> which<00:02:01.250> by<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.460> way<00:02:01.580> we<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:01.820> went<00:02:02.180> to

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
college which by the way we I went to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.750 
college which by the way we I went to
NYU<00:02:02.540> also<00:02:02.960> which<00:02:03.320> i<00:02:03.530> think<00:02:03.620> you<00:02:04.190> know<00:02:04.220> maybe<00:02:04.520> we

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
NYU also which i think you know maybe we

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
NYU also which i think you know maybe we
should<00:02:04.910> put<00:02:05.060> together<00:02:05.330> some<00:02:05.570> sort<00:02:05.750> of

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
should put together some sort of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.719 
should put together some sort of
something<00:02:06.140> start<00:02:06.440> start<00:02:07.010> this<00:02:07.190> all<00:02:07.400> over<00:02:07.430> the

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
something start start this all over the

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.130 
something start start this all over the
all<00:02:07.910> over<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.270> world<00:02:08.360> or<00:02:08.600> maybe<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:08.960> should

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
all over the world or maybe we should

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.690 
all over the world or maybe we should
make<00:02:09.320> people<00:02:09.440> better<00:02:09.679> at<00:02:09.950> poker<00:02:10.250> I'm<00:02:10.369> not<00:02:10.520> sure

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
are the events and why do you feel like

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.800 
are the events and why do you feel like
you<00:02:37.730> know<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:37.940> have<00:02:38.120> an<00:02:38.239> edge<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.570> some

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
you know you have an edge and some

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.979 
you know you have an edge and some
verses<00:02:39.050> others<00:02:39.500> well<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:40.820> can't<00:02:41.060> say<00:02:41.270> in<00:02:41.690> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
verses others well I can't say in the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.960 
verses others well I can't say in the
PCA<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.500> rule<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.770> some<00:02:43.010> Downey<00:02:43.310> events<00:02:43.820> and

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
PCA the rule of some Downey events and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.460 
PCA the rule of some Downey events and
satellites<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:44.720> feel<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:44.900> those<00:02:45.170> events

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
satellites and I feel like those events

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.500 
satellites and I feel like those events
I<00:02:45.739> just<00:02:46.190> kind<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.400> gravitate<00:02:46.970> towards<00:02:47.360> because

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
I just kind of gravitate towards because

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.120 
I just kind of gravitate towards because
there's<00:02:47.660> certain<00:02:47.959> considerations<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.040> are

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
there's certain considerations that are

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.040 
there's certain considerations that are
a<00:02:49.220> little<00:02:49.370> different<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:50.090> guess<00:02:50.120> I'm<00:02:50.390> kind<00:02:50.959> of

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
a little different I guess I'm kind of

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.800 
a little different I guess I'm kind of
more<00:02:51.230> math<00:02:51.380> or<00:02:51.590> anted<00:02:52.070> in<00:02:52.280> poker<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:53.630> this

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
more math or anted in poker in this

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.110 
more math or anted in poker in this
tournament<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.590> thought<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.280> turbo<00:02:55.640> was<00:02:55.940> like

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
tournament I thought the turbo was like

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.300 
tournament I thought the turbo was like
a<00:02:56.270> great<00:02:56.540> event<00:02:56.780> I<00:02:57.080> really<00:02:57.410> enjoy<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.709> and

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
a great event I really enjoy that and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.530 
a great event I really enjoy that and
I'm<00:02:58.700> really<00:02:58.880> looking<00:02:59.120> forward<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.450> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
I'm really looking forward to the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.880 
I'm really looking forward to the
open-faced<00:02:59.989> tournament<00:03:00.440> at<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.590> end<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.800> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
open-faced tournament at the end of the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.590 
open-faced tournament at the end of the
series<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.610> even<00:03:02.030> like<00:03:02.180> right<00:03:02.330> now<00:03:02.450> you're

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
series and even like right now you're
