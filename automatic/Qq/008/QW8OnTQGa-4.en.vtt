they're gonna pick Callista or vein and
both<00:00:49.410> those<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:50.340> well<00:00:50.460> against

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
both those don't do very well against

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.369 
both those don't do very well against
Draven<00:00:51.149> he's<00:00:51.300> auto<00:00:51.600> attack<00:00:51.899> trades<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379

and and and sneaky was allowed to build
up<00:00:58.530> some<00:00:58.649> adoration<00:00:59.160> stacks<00:00:59.520> early<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
we saw that one engagement media is

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590 
we saw that one engagement media is
coming<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> wall<00:01:05.460> onto<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> vibe<00:01:06.030> picks

Draven<00:01:25.770> was<00:01:25.799> awesome<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.729> game<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
Draven was awesome this game and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.899 
Draven was awesome this game and
honestly<00:01:27.630> cloud<00:01:28.080> nine<00:01:28.320> played<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.729> well

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
honestly cloud nine played really well

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.700 
honestly cloud nine played really well
yeah<00:01:30.450> whether<00:01:30.840> whether<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.259> was<00:01:31.350> cloud<00:01:31.560> nine

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
yeah whether whether it was cloud nine

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
yeah whether whether it was cloud nine
playing<00:01:31.979> well<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.310> co<00:01:32.579> ji<00:01:32.790> being<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> step<00:01:33.270> slow

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
playing well or co ji being a step slow

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.380 
playing well or co ji being a step slow
it's<00:01:34.020> probably<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.560> bit<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> both<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's probably a bit of both because the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
it's probably a bit of both because the
early<00:01:36.810> game<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.290> where<00:01:37.740> media's<00:01:38.460> picked<00:01:38.670> up

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
early game here where media's picked up

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.429 
early game here where media's picked up
burst<00:01:38.970> blood<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.270> between<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> turrets<00:01:39.900> where

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
burst blood in between the turrets where

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.069 
burst blood in between the turrets where
CLG<00:01:41.100> didn't<00:01:41.520> seem<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.570> faster<00:01:42.930> side

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
CLG didn't seem to be on the faster side

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.600 
CLG didn't seem to be on the faster side
of<00:01:43.229> any<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> rotations<00:01:44.009> despite<00:01:44.430> having

that pressure on the one on one with the

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.819 
that pressure on the one on one with the
ignite<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.909> actually<00:02:44.659> get<00:02:44.930> into<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.440> game<00:02:45.650> and

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
trinity force so Zion missed those

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.380 
trinity force so Zion missed those
spikes<00:02:55.370> because<00:02:55.670> they<00:02:55.790> camped<00:02:56.120> him<00:02:56.239> and

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
spikes because they camped him and
