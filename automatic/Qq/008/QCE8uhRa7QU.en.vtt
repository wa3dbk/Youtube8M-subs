and when I heard they do it like I was
feeling<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.049> was<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.319> biggest<00:02:56.530> feeling

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
feeling it it was the biggest feeling

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.710 
feeling it it was the biggest feeling
because<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.220> looked<00:02:57.730> up<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.000> those<00:02:58.150> dudes<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.569> I

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
because I looked up to those dudes and I

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.180 
because I looked up to those dudes and I
was<00:02:58.959> able<00:02:59.049> to<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.379> part<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.680> was<00:02:59.860> legit

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
was able to have a part that was legit

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.890 
was able to have a part that was legit
it<00:03:00.970> was<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.209> greatest<00:03:01.390> feeling<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:01.840> I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
it was the greatest feeling and I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.360 
it was the greatest feeling and I
realized<00:03:02.410> ten<00:03:02.620> years<00:03:02.769> later<00:03:02.920> what<00:03:03.220> we

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
realized ten years later what we

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.559 
realized ten years later what we
actually<00:03:03.579> achieve<00:03:03.879> because<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.420> don't

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569
