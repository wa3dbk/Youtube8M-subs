it and what it is is it's actually sort

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.310 
it and what it is is it's actually sort
of<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.170> spray<00:02:15.890> paint<00:02:16.120> foundation<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.720> this

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
of like a spray paint foundation so this

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.250 
of like a spray paint foundation so this
foundation<00:02:19.220> really<00:02:20.030> reminded<00:02:20.570> me<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.780> spray

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
foundation really reminded me of spray

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.680 
foundation really reminded me of spray
paint<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.220> was<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> little<00:02:22.790> afraid<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.510> use

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
paint and I was a little afraid to use

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.229 
paint and I was a little afraid to use
it<00:02:23.720> at<00:02:24.080> first<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.890> I'm<00:02:25.070> actually<00:02:25.430> wearing<00:02:25.940> it

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
it at first but I'm actually wearing it

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.710 
it at first but I'm actually wearing it
right<00:02:26.420> now<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.350> let<00:02:28.250> me<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:28.430> say<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.299> was

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
right now and let me just say this was

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.690 
right now and let me just say this was
the<00:02:30.230> best<00:02:30.380> foundation<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.190> think<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.580> I've

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the best foundation I think that I've

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.949 
the best foundation I think that I've
ever<00:02:31.940> put<00:02:32.570> on<00:02:32.600> my<00:02:32.900> face<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.620> all<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:34.610> did<00:02:35.030> was<00:02:35.299> I

lashes<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.909> make<00:03:41.060> up<00:03:41.209> look<00:03:41.390> thicker<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.459> even

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
product and last but not least i

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.440 
product and last but not least i
intentionally<00:06:24.920> save<00:06:25.640> this<00:06:25.850> one<00:06:26.090> for<00:06:26.120> last

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
intentionally save this one for last

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.840 
intentionally save this one for last
because<00:06:26.720> this<00:06:27.650> is<00:06:27.920> the<00:06:28.070> actual<00:06:28.460> makeup
