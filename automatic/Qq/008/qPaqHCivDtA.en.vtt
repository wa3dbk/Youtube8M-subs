00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 one of these days making a message a 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.040
 Brazil's place to mention an absurdity 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.040
 You 'll agree this is absurd. 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.410
 and you go sometimes in a park is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.670
 children's babies he has a scale 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.070
 has a sliding wheel wheel slide 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.340
 and suddenly you see the mother taking the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.920
 thermal bag a bottle and in there 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.460
 Refrigerant is put in and glue 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.890
 mouth of the child two years absurd 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.710
 This you do not agree with me that this is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 absurd you give soda for a 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 two year old 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.050
 An absurd now I ask is a 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.600
 absurd give to the child of two years 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.309
 but you give your child pro 16 years hence 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 it's not absurd 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.910
 It's not absurd to take it there, it's not 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.440
 absurd I keep thinking that it will be 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.539
 You did not understand that your body is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.689
 temple of the Holy Spirit and that within 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.250
 One time we do not have animals. 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.619
 what was the part of the verse that you 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
 Did not understand when you say you're not 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.290
 of yourself you do not belong to you 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.140
 your body is the temple 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.350
 this time has an owner who is the spirit 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.970
 Holy and I am what I eat 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 I drink until we go. 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.320
 play or we will relativize the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.290
 Christian life 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.900
 Do you know that physical exercise 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.820
 of the body this is also religion 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.100
 this is also part of our process 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.990
 to connect with God that if my 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.960
 My mind has been lying if my blood 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.299
 sedentary lifestyle, it is obvious that the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.939
 holy spirit, speaking will continue speaking 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.130
 me but I will not understand right 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.049
 individual who does not sleep right who does not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.329
 does exercise individual who has a life 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.270
 sedentary woman who feeds badly was to listen 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.939
 as the voice of God how are you going to walk like 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.710
 Christ walked was not going to walk 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.649
 that is why the individual needs 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.720
 take care of your health because this is the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.520
 God's message to you 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.890
 now this has to do with a church 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.170
 Adventist was with Baptist church 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.490
 the Catholic church with spiritualism does not 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.140
 This has to do with God's will. 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.030
 for your life 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.990
 I wonder if there should be people 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.610
 watching sermon taking soda 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.240
 dear this is the time you need 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.770
 say so, sir, it's all wrong, it breaks 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.130
 my life and do it again now care 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.560
 When you ask for it, why does God fulfill it? 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.550
 accurate he will break everything 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:49.230
 he leaves no stone unturned 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:53.580
 they use me in the dust and he rebuilds it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.670
 another vase is another life but the 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.380
 break process hurts but it's the only 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.340
 way to salvation for life 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.980
 eternal 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.110
 dear bible declares, and you do not 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.350
 belong to ourselves 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.690
 I'm not the one who decides not to go on a day out. 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.180
 It's me who decides what I eat that I 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.640
 I'm not eating, it's God's will. 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.370
 God is Jesus saying the Lord I do not 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.350
 I want to go through the ordeal, but 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.010
 Your will is what Jesus is doing 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.650
 Christ made the Father His will, He 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.320
 taught this in the Father-Our Prayer be 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.650
 Thy will be done on earth as 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.600
 It's made in heaven today. 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.850
 the way things happen in the sky 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.650
 Jesus was declaring that it was done 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.530
 here on this earth 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.640
 What matters is the will of the father. 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.640
 the will of the father
