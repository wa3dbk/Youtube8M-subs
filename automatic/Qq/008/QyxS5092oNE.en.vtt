00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
think of putting a layer of i think it

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.860 
think of putting a layer of i think it
was<00:02:28.139> silk<00:02:28.829> i<00:02:29.209> think<00:02:30.209> they're<00:02:30.329> called<00:02:30.359> silks

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870

was silk i think they're called silks
put<00:02:31.469> over<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.090> essentially<00:02:33.090> what<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.239> was

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
put over and essentially what that was

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.940 
put over and essentially what that was
is<00:02:33.510> they<00:02:33.780> cut<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.019> piece<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.709> this

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
is they cut a piece of like this

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.399 
is they cut a piece of like this
material<00:02:35.519> put<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.120> over<00:02:36.209> your<00:02:36.379> fingernail<00:02:37.379> and

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
material put it over your fingernail and

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.099 
material put it over your fingernail and
then<00:02:37.799> they<00:02:37.920> used<00:02:38.000> glue<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.389> kind<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:39.689> adhere<00:02:40.079> it

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
then they used glue to kind of adhere it

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.170 
then they used glue to kind of adhere it
to<00:02:40.200> your<00:02:40.379> nail<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.889> strengthened<00:02:41.459> you

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
know the nail so that the Polish stayed

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.709 
know the nail so that the Polish stayed
on<00:02:43.769> longer<00:02:43.889> and<00:02:44.400> things<00:02:44.669> like<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.849> which<00:02:45.540> was

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:45.719 
on longer and things like that which was

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.869 
on longer and things like that which was
fine<00:02:45.989> but<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.469> was<00:02:46.769> again<00:02:47.159> because<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> way

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
fine but I was again because of the way

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.300 
fine but I was again because of the way
my<00:02:48.060> nails<00:02:48.269> are<00:02:48.419> so<00:02:48.569> thin<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.069> bend<00:02:50.069> easily

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
kind of see how that goes so I did that

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.619 
kind of see how that goes so I did that
and<00:03:12.620> she<00:03:13.620> did<00:03:13.799> two<00:03:14.280> colors<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.969> acrylic<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.510> was

my<00:03:40.739> nails<00:03:41.040> with<00:03:41.489> acrylic<00:03:42.299> very<00:03:42.989> very<00:03:43.319> very

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
my nails with acrylic very very very

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:50.499 
my nails with acrylic very very very
thin<00:03:44.220> layer<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:45.269> can<00:03:45.299> see<00:03:46.729> that<00:03:47.729> it's<00:03:48.419> like

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:50.509 
thin layer you can see that it's like

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.110 
thin layer you can see that it's like
what<00:03:51.509> is<00:03:51.629> that<00:03:52.579> all<00:03:53.579> right<00:03:53.790> well<00:03:53.970> use<00:03:54.090> a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
what is that all right well use a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.969 
what is that all right well use a
different<00:03:54.479> finger<00:03:54.629> just<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.959> show<00:03:55.169> you<00:03:55.199> you

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
different finger just to show you you

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.800 
different finger just to show you you
can<00:03:56.159> see<00:03:56.340> how<00:03:56.489> thin<00:03:56.759> it<00:03:56.879> is<00:03:57.000> like<00:03:57.359> there<00:03:57.629> isn't

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
can see how thin it is like there isn't

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.020 
can see how thin it is like there isn't
like<00:03:58.259> you<00:03:58.500> most<00:03:59.129> acrylic<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.669> see<00:03:59.849> like<00:04:00.000> a

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
like you most acrylic you see like a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.819 
like you most acrylic you see like a
layer<00:04:00.359> of<00:04:00.389> it<00:04:00.780> there<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.199> you<00:04:01.259> don't<00:04:01.560> see<00:04:01.799> that

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
layer of it there and you don't see that

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.699 
layer of it there and you don't see that
with<00:04:02.099> this<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.719> thinnest<00:04:04.169> layer<00:04:04.409> of

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
with this so it is the thinnest layer of

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.909 
with this so it is the thinnest layer of
acrylic<00:04:05.340> on<00:04:05.729> top<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.509> my<00:04:06.750> nails<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.319> then<00:04:07.889> I

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
acrylic on top of my nails and then I

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.159 
acrylic on top of my nails and then I
put<00:04:08.219> the<00:04:08.340> hollow<00:04:08.519> Jean<00:04:08.609> it<00:04:08.909> the<00:04:09.780> reason<00:04:10.049> I'm

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
put the hollow Jean it the reason I'm

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.020 
put the hollow Jean it the reason I'm
doing<00:04:10.199> this<00:04:10.439> now<00:04:10.769> is<00:04:11.009> because<00:04:11.280> I'm<00:04:11.609> getting

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
doing this now is because I'm getting

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.789 
doing this now is because I'm getting
ready<00:04:12.180> I'm<00:04:12.329> going<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.689> try<00:04:13.109> and<00:04:13.139> do<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.560> gel

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
then starting back from scratch and

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.070

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
would guess but i know that there are so

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.600 
would guess but i know that there are so
many<00:04:55.080> bad<00:04:55.319> things<00:04:55.349> out<00:04:55.770> there<00:04:55.949> about<00:04:56.039> acrylic

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.300 
nails so essentially if I ever took this
off<00:05:04.349> my<00:05:04.530> nails<00:05:04.710> would<00:05:04.830> be<00:05:04.919> short<00:05:05.159> and<00:05:05.219> they'd

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
off my nails would be short and they'd

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.589 
off my nails would be short and they'd
be<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.460> little<00:05:05.610> bit<00:05:05.819> damaged<00:05:06.120> but<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:06.360> wouldn't

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
be a little bit damaged but it wouldn't

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:07.879 
be a little bit damaged but it wouldn't
take<00:05:06.719> that<00:05:06.750> long<00:05:06.900> for<00:05:07.050> me<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.319> grow<00:05:07.530> them<00:05:07.740> back

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
take that long for me to grow them back

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.469 
take that long for me to grow them back
out<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:09.240> be<00:05:09.330> completely<00:05:09.449> healthy<00:05:11.479> they're

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
out to be completely healthy they're

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.990 
out to be completely healthy they're
definitely<00:05:12.780> did<00:05:13.740> i<00:05:13.830> do<00:05:13.919> there<00:05:14.190> sorry<00:05:14.460> there

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
definitely did i do there sorry there

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.839 
definitely did i do there sorry there
are<00:05:15.090> definitely<00:05:15.800> easier<00:05:16.800> ways<00:05:16.979> to<00:05:17.009> do<00:05:17.610> these

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
are definitely easier ways to do these

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.850 
are definitely easier ways to do these
things<00:05:18.150> when<00:05:18.779> I<00:05:18.840> go<00:05:19.080> in<00:05:19.169> there<00:05:19.289> it's<00:05:19.469> so<00:05:19.620> funny

things when I go in there it's so funny

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.469

and things like that and that's why they

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.830 
and things like that and that's why they
do<00:05:25.800> occur<00:05:26.129> like<00:05:26.279> it's<00:05:27.240> not<00:05:27.419> me<00:05:27.599> I'm<00:05:27.689> always
