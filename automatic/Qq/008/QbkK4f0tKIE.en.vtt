00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.900
 and there it is everyone these paths 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.449
 ball and today we find ourselves so 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.300
 for a video a bit special because 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.610
 I will do for the first time on 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.230
 my chain so a boxing man and it's going 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.820
 not be any I thought I 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.270
 so I missed today the 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.250
 boxing of gta 5 so the special edition 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.219
 so wait i'll try to good 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.739
 aiming here I hope you see that well 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.230
 it is just the carton which is 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:48.980
 listened to I find it rather beautiful she 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.149
 is quite large and already open 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.649
 because here I still had 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.989
 start installing the game in 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.449
 waiting so we can see anyway 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.039
 a little something better 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.829
 easy of good we can see a little 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:09.080
 foam thing like to protect one has 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:13.790
 already a little bit of that so opening up the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.740
 box we can see we already have them 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.120
 bonus the special edition just not you 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.630
 will see well there then I am trained 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.660
 normally it should be okay so 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.480
 the bonuses that are normally with 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.700
 special editions then we have 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 a big one my share I do not know if you 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.480
 will be able to see everything 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:46.100
 and theirs not everything but that's it 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.539
 a large map with several small 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.539
 red dots are also expected 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.969
 it was full of little red dots 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:02:00.259
 here it's kind of small places 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.530
 places hideouts and is therefore 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.869
 that's quite practical I have to say and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.679
 then we have what it is 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.390
 completely cracked this is where the 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.049
 metal box that is simply 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.260
 magnificent 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.220
 it's the reflection of the lamp that's the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.349
 box that I simply find 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.519
 magnificent 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.349
 it's even just for that matter that 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:36.700
 I bought the edition the special edition 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:36.700
 of the simple game again the manual 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.700
 and and a small map in color that 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.160
 my opinion is going to be a little bit smaller 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.880
 that your father is a little bit more 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.090
 small so that's like in all gt1 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.340
 m light here we have a small map 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.910
 with some small inscriptions 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.260
 above 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.250
 so that's the location of the stores 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.250
 etc so here it is not extraordinary 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.000
 I 'm not going to piss off that all to 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.790
 the time so here there was no 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.239
 great thing I could have opted for 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.859
 the special edition because it was the 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.000
 minimum to do I think I saw myself 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.390
 absolutely not to take 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.909
 gta 5 in normal edition and since you 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.260
 find that the 150 euros for this 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.230
 that they had in the collector had 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.159
 not found that the content of this 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.829
 that they had in the collector was worth 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.719
 not too bad so here and then 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.209
 so I do not know if it's part of 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:39.280
 don I do not think I do not think that that 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.480
 be part of the special but me 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.980
 when I had when I went to 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.709
 micromania throw the mop so I got 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.669
 this little booklet from a doctor seguin 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.470
 big theft auto with bah that retraces a 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.739
 little bit of history so I 'm going to do 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.730
 to languish it's not going to do it it traces a 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.079
 little bit you see all the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.829
 gta stories starting from the beginning 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.750
 until the end 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:12.159
 komax andreas gta iv is really nice 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:13.989
 yes it's cool good well here we see the 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.909
 voice that's pretty good the box in 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.459
 cardboard that is very simple I wanted 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.750
 show just now but that's otherwise 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.050
 frankly honestly I really 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:27.210
 flashed for 7 for this metal box 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:31.360
 which is just simply beautiful 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.949
 would change all that just now so 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.539
 here I would have liked to show you 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.070
 the cd except that I did not think about the fact 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.210
 I win to put in my ps3 and I 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.770
 throws and 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.500
 gb that you can not introduce yourself 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.419
 good quick here's the friends it was my all 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.330
 first boxing I hope it will not be 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.259
 not been too messy 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.090
 so I hope you will have but this 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.789
 little video by the way I invite you to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.229
 leave me a little I like and then 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.240
 do not hesitate to tell me what you 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.500
 have thought in the comments and then 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.699
 of course that's me I'm not telling you the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.800
 next for a new video and 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.000
 especially good game and by the way so there 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.400
 normally I'm going to do a little 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.380
 video about gta 5 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.050
 it's Tuesday and already seven o'clock and 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.720
 half home so surely could 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.310
 others the aude and the boxing moon so 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.410
 today so it's air Tuesday after 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.849
 by cons the video I think the 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.610
 video of the gameplay I think I would have 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.020
 no time to clone him 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.160
 today stellar Tuesday everything 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.570
 simply because it takes the time that 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.310
 the phase the time I spend the 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.229
 editing made it more the coup I would have 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.490
 absolutely no time so here it is 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.650
 will be scheduled for Wednesday 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.120
 So here is this month I wish you 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.210
 a good play at the next all the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.210
 world 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.390
 we
