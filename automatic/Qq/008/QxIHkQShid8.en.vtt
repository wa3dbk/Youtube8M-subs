00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
contradiction this kept this type of

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.440 
contradiction this kept this type of
character<00:01:46.510> in<00:01:46.660> that<00:01:47.220> he<00:01:48.220> has<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.460> sort<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.180> soft

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
character in that he has a sort of soft

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.220 
character in that he has a sort of soft
look<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.960> him<00:01:50.170> but<00:01:50.530> he's<00:01:50.650> actually<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:52.230> fighting

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
look to him but he's actually a fighting

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.190 
look to him but he's actually a fighting
character<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:55.180> he's<00:01:55.600> got<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.960> thick

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
character and so he's got that thick

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.020 
character and so he's got that thick
neck<00:01:56.410> because<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.830> that<00:01:57.250> actually<00:01:57.700> kind<00:01:58.000> of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
neck because that that actually kind of

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.960 
neck because that that actually kind of
gives<00:01:58.270> away<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.690> he<00:01:58.840> has<00:01:59.250> personal<00:02:00.250> power

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970
