flying through snap peas real look at
that<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> product<00:00:12.809> called<00:00:12.990> Qi<00:00:13.740> that's<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
that a product called Qi that's I I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.060 
that a product called Qi that's I I
imaginary<00:00:15.509> interface<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.560> keyboard

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
imaginary interface it's a keyboard

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.269 
imaginary interface it's a keyboard
without<00:00:17.190> keys<00:00:17.699> know<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.660> sounds<00:00:18.960> crazy<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:20.100> I

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
without keys know it sounds crazy like I

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
without keys know it sounds crazy like I
didn't<00:00:20.520> believe<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.820> either<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:21.660> Ryan<00:00:22.020> go

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
didn't believe it either but Ryan go

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.570 
didn't believe it either but Ryan go
ahead<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.470> tell<00:00:22.920> us<00:00:23.070> what<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.369> all<00:00:23.460> about

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
ahead and tell us what it's all about

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.509 
ahead and tell us what it's all about
let's<00:00:24.060> see<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.449> demo<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.529> basically

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
let's see a little demo so basically

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.200 
let's see a little demo so basically
it's<00:00:27.260> we're<00:00:28.260> predictive<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:29.820> something

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
it's we're predictive so it's something

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.440 
it's we're predictive so it's something
that<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.689> user<00:00:30.869> already<00:00:31.109> knows<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
that the user already knows and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.660 
that the user already knows and
basically<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:34.040> you're<00:00:35.040> typing<00:00:35.399> what

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
basically you just you're typing what

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.889 
basically you just you're typing what
are<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.820> doing<00:00:36.590> today<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> how<00:00:39.239> how<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
are you doing today so how how is it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
are you doing today so how how is it
detecting<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.710> keys<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.640> letters

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
detecting what keys or what letters

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
detecting what keys or what letters
you're<00:00:42.120> looking<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.540> us<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you're looking for us so in the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.029 
you're looking for us so in the
beginning<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> user<00:00:45.719> sees<00:00:46.039> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
beginning this is what the user sees you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.569 
beginning this is what the user sees you
have<00:00:47.190> four<00:00:47.610> keys<00:00:47.989> for<00:00:48.989> keys<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.890> each<00:00:50.160> Key

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
have four keys for keys that each Key

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.930 
have four keys for keys that each Key
has<00:00:50.719> a<00:00:51.719> group<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> letters<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.699> for<00:00:53.879> instance

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
has a group of letters so for instance

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.720 
has a group of letters so for instance
this<00:00:54.570> group<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.020> letters<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.980> touch<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this group of letters all touch the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.450 
this group of letters all touch the
floor<00:00:57.000> at<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:57.600> point<00:00:57.840> mm-hmm<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
floor at one point mm-hmm so like a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.630 
floor at one point mm-hmm so like a
white<00:00:59.850> ashes<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> flow<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:00.750> point<00:01:00.989> V<00:01:01.440> F<00:01:01.859> T

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
white ashes the flow at one point V F T

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.549 
white ashes the flow at one point V F T
they<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:02.969> touch<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.300> fly<00:01:03.449> one<00:01:03.629> point<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
they all touch the fly one point this

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
they all touch the fly one point this
group<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.979> letters<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.549> touch<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.090> floor<00:01:06.240> are

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
group of letters all touch the floor are

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.320 
group of letters all touch the floor are
two<00:01:06.600> points<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.710> n<00:01:07.920> touch<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> 42<00:01:08.729> points<00:01:09.150> h

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
two points so n touch to the 42 points h

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.929 
two points so n touch to the 42 points h
wa<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.799> notice<00:01:11.549> how<00:01:11.670> they're<00:01:11.820> all

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
wa and notice how they're all

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
wa and notice how they're all
capitalized<00:01:12.510> letters<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:13.229> these<00:01:13.650> letters

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
capitalized letters right these letters

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.609 
capitalized letters right these letters
are<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.369> with<00:01:14.700> closed<00:01:15.000> circles<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.600> them<00:01:15.780> so

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
are all with closed circles in them so

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.789 
are all with closed circles in them so
even<00:01:16.890> though<00:01:16.920> r<00:01:17.250> &amp;<00:01:17.549> P<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:18.060> 22<00:01:19.049> points<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.590> one

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
even though r &amp; P have 22 points and one

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
even though r &amp; P have 22 points and one
point<00:01:20.070> they're<00:01:20.520> still<00:01:20.869> categorized<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
point they're still categorized in the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.649 
point they're still categorized in the
circles<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:23.070> circles<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.670> priority<00:01:24.450> over

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
circles because circles is priority over

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.380 
circles because circles is priority over
everything<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.979> these<00:01:26.220> keys<00:01:26.880> these

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
everything and then these keys these

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.600 
everything and then these keys these
letters<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:28.080> letters<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> wide

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
letters are all letters that have a wide

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.160 
letters are all letters that have a wide
base<00:01:29.880> they<00:01:30.240> touch<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> floor<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.869> Y<00:01:30.960> base

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
base they touch the floor out of Y base

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.319 
base they touch the floor out of Y base
like<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.950> g<00:01:32.850> e<00:01:33.119> l<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:34.049> wide<00:01:34.500> or<00:01:34.829> curved<00:01:35.329> so

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
lot faster than a keyboard interests and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.110 
lot faster than a keyboard interests and
it<00:02:34.880> really<00:02:35.209> allows<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.650> tablet<00:02:37.100> pc<00:02:37.430> to

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
revolutionize itself and allow it to be

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.410 
revolutionize itself and allow it to be
