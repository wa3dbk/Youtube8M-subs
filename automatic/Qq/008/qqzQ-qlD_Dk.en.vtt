00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.059
 when finished building a house 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.940
 there was a question what ceilings do 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.519
 after thinking it was decided to do 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.520
 we were advised to ask them from hope 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.060
 in the eye of the ceiling found a website on the Internet and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.119
 their home designer held 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.380
 wooden beam and and had to close 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.510
 and it lost to make the second mur 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.510
 the design project liked we agreed 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.890
 it all starts with perimeter markings 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.260
 premises expose the framing strips 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.930
 they are the ones who hold the canvas 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.930
 and takes over the whole ceiling 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.300
 load mounting should be very 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.969
 reliably save on a fur coat 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.370
 not worth not to damage the hidden 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.930
 wiring using a special device 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 housing detection 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.570
 to form a second level 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.900
 You need thick PVC plastic and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 heads mounting brackets still 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.439
 The main requirement is reliable throughout 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.479
 length of the resulting wave set 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.450
 connector on login and aluminum 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.820
 a guide that will form a bend 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.640
 2 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.400
 under the downturn and chandeliers and lamps 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.310
 we provide for mortgage sites and 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.040
 laying electrical wiring 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.560
 the preparatory part is finished 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.710
 go to the installation of canvas paintings 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.960
 cuts out under each room 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.020
 individually and equipped with a harpoon 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.600
 a clip around the perimeter 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.120
 when heated the canvas becomes 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.130
 elastic and pliable it allows 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.250
 quietly pull it on any 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.680
 curvilinear surfaces important in this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 operations skill and lack of haste 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.060
 to provide decorative lighting 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.369
 glue LED strip 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.300
 solder joints and 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.270
 connections 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.380
 all remaining are mounted in the same way. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.959
 cloths install light fixtures 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:23.810
 prearranged places first 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:23.810
 test everything is ready 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.280
 that's how u got this wonderful 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.280
 ceiling of eyes while varnish 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.220
 and
