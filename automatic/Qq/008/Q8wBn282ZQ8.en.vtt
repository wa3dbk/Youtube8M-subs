00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.210 
was a great time so let's get started
one<00:00:21.420> tip<00:00:21.720> that's<00:00:21.990> necessary<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.010> want<00:00:23.160> to

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
one tip that's necessary is you want to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.370 
one tip that's necessary is you want to
par<00:00:23.460> cook<00:00:23.789> your<00:00:23.970> bacon<00:00:24.150> prior<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.930> wrapping<00:00:25.289> it

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
with the scallops because the scallops
