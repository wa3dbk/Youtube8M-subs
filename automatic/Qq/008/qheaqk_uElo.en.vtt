going to do is you can take that out put
this<00:00:54.620> part<00:00:55.620> underneath<00:00:56.000> make<00:00:57.000> some<00:00:57.180> holes<00:00:57.420> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this part underneath make some holes so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.360 
this part underneath make some holes so
the<00:00:57.780> bolts<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.109> through<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.070> will<00:00:59.250> be

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the bolts go through it so this will be

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.720 
the bolts go through it so this will be
basically<00:00:59.850> be<00:01:00.059> held<00:01:00.449> down<00:01:00.629> by<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:01.859> airbox<00:01:02.219> all

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
basically be held down by the airbox all

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.800 
basically be held down by the airbox all
three<00:01:03.239> screws<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:05.189> two<00:01:05.400> three<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> then<00:01:06.600> this

three screws one two three and then this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.190 
three screws one two three and then this
will<00:01:07.200> basically<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.710> shield<00:01:08.240> in<00:01:09.240> between

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.700 

basically<00:01:52.390> there<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.450> go<00:01:53.600> that<00:01:54.080> is<00:01:54.110> what<00:01:54.500> I'm

hoping<00:01:54.920> for<00:01:55.750> right<00:01:56.750> now<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:57.020> too<00:01:57.140> tall<00:01:57.320> like

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
hoping for right now it's too tall like

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.700 
hoping for right now it's too tall like
I<00:01:57.649> said<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:59.030> see<00:01:59.299> how<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.229> comes<00:02:00.409> all<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.679> way

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
I said you see how it comes all the way

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.320 
I said you see how it comes all the way
back<00:02:00.979> you'll<00:02:01.250> be<00:02:01.280> underneath<00:02:01.820> that's<00:02:02.149> why

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
back you'll be underneath that's why

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.660 
back you'll be underneath that's why
it's<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:02.600> tall<00:02:02.840> when<00:02:03.049> it<00:02:03.170> drops<00:02:03.380> down<00:02:03.670> it's

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
it's so tall when it drops down it's

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.700 
it's so tall when it drops down it's
going<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.820> drop<00:02:05.119> down<00:02:05.299> a<00:02:05.360> good<00:02:05.630> inch<00:02:05.990> or<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:06.439> so

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
going to drop down a good inch or so so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.960 
going to drop down a good inch or so so
hopefully<00:02:07.070> I'll<00:02:07.159> be<00:02:07.189> a<00:02:07.310> perfect<00:02:07.520> kite<00:02:07.789> if

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
hopefully I'll be a perfect kite if

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.160 
hopefully I'll be a perfect kite if
anything<00:02:08.269> I'll<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:08.420> trim<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.720> little<00:02:08.869> bit<00:02:08.989> off

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
anything I'll just trim a little bit off

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.550 
anything I'll just trim a little bit off
of<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:10.250> as<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.519> see<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:12.140> blocking

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
of it but as you can see it's blocking

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.520 
of it but as you can see it's blocking
the<00:02:12.680> front<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:13.040> turbo<00:02:13.310> right<00:02:13.459> there<00:02:13.700> all<00:02:14.630> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
the front of turbo right there all that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.090 
the front of turbo right there all that
back<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:18.530> am<00:02:18.650> going<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:19.010> to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
back there and I am going to have to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.470 
back there and I am going to have to
probably<00:02:19.459> turn<00:02:19.670> them<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.940> little<00:02:20.209> bit<00:02:20.330> off

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
probably turn them a little bit off

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.070 
probably turn them a little bit off
right<00:02:20.810> here<00:02:21.049> so<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.980> doesn't<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:23.720> know<00:02:23.810> cut

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
right here so this doesn't you know cut

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.500 
right here so this doesn't you know cut
that<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.530> am<00:02:25.430> going<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> turn<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.000> off<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:26.769> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
that I am going to turn this off so the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.680 
that I am going to turn this off so the
you<00:02:29.510> can<00:02:29.630> still<00:02:29.870> get<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.140> trans<00:02:30.470> fluid

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
you can still get to the trans fluid

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.880 
you can still get to the trans fluid
just<00:02:32.690> trim<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.930> little<00:02:33.140> notch<00:02:33.290> there<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.799> you

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
just trim a little notch there so you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.910 
just trim a little notch there so you
can<00:02:34.010> start<00:02:34.280> be<00:02:34.489> able<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.790> pull<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.000> out<00:02:35.890> but<00:02:36.890> uh

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
can start be able to pull it out but uh

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.039 
can start be able to pull it out but uh
right<00:02:37.700> here<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.120> corner<00:02:38.480> I'm<00:02:38.810> probably

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
right here in this corner I'm probably

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.509 
right here in this corner I'm probably
going<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.349> get<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.560> little<00:02:39.709> corner<00:02:40.069> patch<00:02:40.280> and

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
going to get a little corner patch and

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.530 
going to get a little corner patch and
make<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.989> so<00:02:41.989> it's<00:02:42.170> kind<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.440> blocking<00:02:43.540> that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
make it so it's kind of blocking that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.030 
make it so it's kind of blocking that
because<00:02:45.260> that's<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.590> only<00:02:45.739> part<00:02:45.950> that's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
because that's the only part that's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.150 
because that's the only part that's
showing<00:02:46.519> still<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:47.930> see<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.859> blocks

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
showing still you can see it blocks

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.120 
showing still you can see it blocks
everything<00:02:49.459> but<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:49.910> little<00:02:50.180> corner<00:02:51.130> so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
everything but that little corner so

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.250 
everything but that little corner so
blocks<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.519> turbo<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.150> everything<00:02:53.720> simple

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
blocks the turbo and everything simple

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.319 
blocks the turbo and everything simple
little<00:02:54.500> heat<00:02:54.620> shield<00:02:54.970> we'll<00:02:55.970> see<00:02:56.150> how<00:02:56.209> it

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
little heat shield we'll see how it

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.060 
little heat shield we'll see how it
turns<00:02:56.480> out<00:02:56.750> let<00:02:57.410> me<00:02:57.440> know<00:02:57.530> what<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:57.890> think
