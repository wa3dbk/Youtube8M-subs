00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.299 

the<00:00:14.570> rapid<00:00:15.020> brush<00:00:15.290> which<00:00:15.710> really<00:00:16.130> hasn't

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
the rapid brush which really hasn't

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.060 
the rapid brush which really hasn't
changed<00:00:16.820> much<00:00:16.970> in<00:00:17.029> 3d<00:00:17.480> coat<00:00:17.660> 3.2<00:00:18.260> but<00:00:18.860> still

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
changed much in 3d coat 3.2 but still

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.450 
changed much in 3d coat 3.2 but still
worth<00:00:19.279> the<00:00:19.460> video<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:19.970> worth<00:00:20.330> mentioning<00:00:20.869> is

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
worth the video and worth mentioning is

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.570 
worth the video and worth mentioning is
a<00:00:22.460> tool<00:00:23.180> that<00:00:23.210> allows<00:00:23.750> you<00:00:24.020> to<00:00:24.050> place<00:00:24.950> strokes

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
a tool that allows you to place strokes

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.229 
a tool that allows you to place strokes
rather<00:00:25.880> quickly<00:00:26.210> like<00:00:27.020> the<00:00:27.290> gum<00:00:27.800> brush<00:00:28.239> and

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
rather quickly like the gum brush and

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.950 
rather quickly like the gum brush and
also<00:00:30.230> somewhat<00:00:30.710> like<00:00:30.950> the<00:00:31.480> surface<00:00:32.480> clay<00:00:32.720> told

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
also somewhat like the surface clay told

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.090 
also somewhat like the surface clay told
however<00:00:33.500> this<00:00:34.399> one<00:00:34.640> doesn't<00:00:35.000> build<00:00:35.390> upon<00:00:36.100> the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
however this one doesn't build upon the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.760 
however this one doesn't build upon the
existing<00:00:37.760> surface<00:00:38.030> in<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:38.570> same<00:00:38.809> way<00:00:39.110> as<00:00:39.380> the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
existing surface in the same way as the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.310 
existing surface in the same way as the
other<00:00:39.920> ones<00:00:40.160> do<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:40.640> let<00:00:41.570> me<00:00:41.690> show<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:42.019> by

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
other ones do and let me show you by

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.349 
other ones do and let me show you by
demonstrating<00:00:42.859> here<00:00:43.129> with<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.280> stroke<00:00:43.609> notice

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
demonstrating here with a stroke notice

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.410 
demonstrating here with a stroke notice
these<00:00:44.510> grooves<00:00:44.960> here<00:00:45.109> on<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:46.519> top<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.120> this

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
these grooves here on the top of this

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.000 
these grooves here on the top of this
vehicle<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:49.120> as<00:00:50.120> I<00:00:50.239> make<00:00:50.390> me<00:00:50.539> stroke<00:00:51.019> you'll

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
vehicle and as I make me stroke you'll

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.369 
vehicle and as I make me stroke you'll
see<00:00:52.250> that<00:00:52.429> it<00:00:52.760> kind<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.660> under<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.140> surface

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
see that it kind of is under the surface

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.549 
see that it kind of is under the surface
and<00:00:54.859> it<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.910> makes<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.660> stroke<00:00:57.019> and<00:00:57.199> kind<00:00:57.499> of

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
and it it makes a stroke and kind of

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.250 
and it it makes a stroke and kind of
fills<00:00:57.890> those<00:00:58.160> up<00:00:58.429> and<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:59.629> would<00:00:59.929> do<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.230> same

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
fills those up and it would do the same

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.390 
fills those up and it would do the same
over<00:01:00.890> here<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:02.239> tries<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.719> keep<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.620> extrusion

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
over here it tries to keep the extrusion

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.649 
over here it tries to keep the extrusion
of<00:01:04.610> your<00:01:04.909> stroke<00:01:05.239> at<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.740> same<00:01:07.010> distance<00:01:07.659> from

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
of your stroke at the same distance from

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.590 
of your stroke at the same distance from
the<00:01:09.320> beginning<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.890> your<00:01:10.100> stroke<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:10.670> that

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
the beginning of your stroke and that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.719 
the beginning of your stroke and that
doesn't<00:01:11.870> make<00:01:11.930> too<00:01:12.170> much<00:01:12.200> sense<00:01:12.460> unless<00:01:13.460> you

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
doesn't make too much sense unless you

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.880 
doesn't make too much sense unless you
see<00:01:13.939> it<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.299> again<00:01:14.689> let's<00:01:14.899> make<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.530> few<00:01:15.770> other

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
see it so again let's make a few other

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.679 
see it so again let's make a few other
strokes<00:01:16.189> let's<00:01:16.399> go<00:01:16.520> over<00:01:16.640> here<00:01:16.820> where<00:01:17.540> we<00:01:17.659> have

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
strokes let's go over here where we have

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.319 
strokes let's go over here where we have
this<00:01:18.200> little<00:01:18.970> ovoid<00:01:19.970> capsule<00:01:20.810> shape<00:01:22.329> alright

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
this little ovoid capsule shape alright

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:24.880 
this little ovoid capsule shape alright
and<00:01:23.360> we'll<00:01:23.600> make<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.780> stroke<00:01:24.229> starting<00:01:24.740> outside

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
and we'll make a stroke starting outside

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.310 
and we'll make a stroke starting outside
of<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.549> you'll<00:01:25.729> see<00:01:25.939> that<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.990> stroke

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
of it and you'll see that the stroke

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.060 
of it and you'll see that the stroke
actually<00:01:28.060> kept<00:01:29.079> some<00:01:30.079> of<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.350> surface<00:01:30.890> that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
actually kept some of the surface that

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.770 
actually kept some of the surface that
was<00:01:31.250> already<00:01:31.579> there<00:01:31.820> right<00:01:32.090> in<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.360> area<00:01:32.420> and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
was already there right in that area and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.300 
was already there right in that area and
let's<00:01:33.350> do<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:33.619> over<00:01:33.770> here<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:33.979> I'll<00:01:34.070> show<00:01:34.100> you

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
let's do it over here and I'll show you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.469 
let's do it over here and I'll show you
no<00:01:35.030> more<00:01:35.860> see<00:01:36.860> there<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.280> tries<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.329> maintain

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
no more see there it tries to maintain

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.359 
no more see there it tries to maintain
the<00:01:38.780> same<00:01:39.140> elevation<00:01:39.860> from<00:01:39.979> your<00:01:40.189> previous

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
the same elevation from your previous

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.810 
the same elevation from your previous
stroke<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.090> over<00:01:41.810> here<00:01:41.960> on<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:42.170> side<00:01:42.820> there's

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
stroke so over here on this side there's

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.179 
stroke so over here on this side there's
a<00:01:43.939> higher<00:01:44.240> indentation<00:01:44.750> then<00:01:45.500> there<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.829> over

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
a higher indentation then there is over

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.539 
a higher indentation then there is over
here<00:01:46.399> inside<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.270> groove<00:01:48.070> so<00:01:49.070> this<00:01:49.310> tool<00:01:49.520> is

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
here inside the groove so this tool is

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.279 
here inside the groove so this tool is
really<00:01:49.909> good<00:01:50.030> for<00:01:50.210> roughing<00:01:50.810> out<00:01:50.930> general

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
really good for roughing out general

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.529 
really good for roughing out general
shapes<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.829> also<00:01:52.310> for<00:01:52.579> helping<00:01:52.969> you<00:01:53.090> maintain

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
shapes and also for helping you maintain

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
shapes and also for helping you maintain
some<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.469> shape<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:54.859> currently<00:01:55.250> have
