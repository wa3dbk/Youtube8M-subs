00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
done here the larger the shapefile the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.610 
done here the larger the shapefile the
longer<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.599> clipping<00:02:33.900> will<00:02:34.049> take<00:02:39.260> I've<00:02:40.260> done

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
longer the clipping will take I've done

longer the clipping will take I've done
these<00:02:40.829> with<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.130> whole<00:02:41.610> road<00:02:42.000> systems<00:02:42.480> for

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
these with a whole road systems for

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.930 
these with a whole road systems for
states<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.560> they<00:02:44.069> can<00:02:44.250> take<00:02:44.430> quite<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.670> bit<00:02:44.819> of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
states and they can take quite a bit of

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.190 
states and they can take quite a bit of
time<00:02:46.220> now<00:02:47.220> I'm<00:02:47.370> gonna<00:02:47.489> turn<00:02:49.310> Manhattan<00:02:50.310> cities

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
time now I'm gonna turn Manhattan cities

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.130 
time now I'm gonna turn Manhattan cities
our<00:02:52.200> Manhattan<00:02:52.680> roads<00:02:53.069> off<00:02:53.390> then<00:02:54.390> back<00:02:54.630> on<00:02:54.840> as

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
our Manhattan roads off then back on as

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.860 
our Manhattan roads off then back on as
you<00:02:55.319> can<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:56.209> how<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.360> would<00:02:57.420> be<00:02:57.569> lines

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you can see how it would be lines

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.150 
you can see how it would be lines
disappear<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:03.180> how<00:03:03.359> you<00:03:03.420> clip<00:03:04.160> rope

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
disappear so that is how you clip rope
