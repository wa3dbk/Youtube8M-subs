Zane<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.430> slowly<00:00:17.850> maybe<00:00:18.359> getting<00:00:19.109> closer

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
Zane is slowly maybe getting closer

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.529 
Zane is slowly maybe getting closer
is<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.220> mean<00:00:20.340> he's<00:00:20.460> poised<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.970> upset<00:00:21.300> him<00:00:21.390> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
is that mean he's poised to upset him I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.150 
is that mean he's poised to upset him I
could<00:00:22.470> go<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.710> far<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.400> seeing<00:00:24.300> Rutherford

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
could go that far but seeing Rutherford

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.560 
could go that far but seeing Rutherford
he's<00:00:26.160> been<00:00:26.340> training<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:27.029> guy<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.390> mind

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
he's been training with one guy in mind

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
he's been training with one guy in mind
and<00:00:27.779> that's<00:00:27.840> Aaron<00:00:28.170> Pico<00:00:28.529> he<00:00:29.010> knows<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.400> is

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
and that's Aaron Pico he knows this is

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.759 
and that's Aaron Pico he knows this is
the<00:00:29.640> standard<00:00:30.090> well<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.410> going

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
to the face which I didn't know you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.619 
to the face which I didn't know you
could<00:00:43.950> really<00:00:44.100> challenge<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:45.120> eventually

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
could really challenge they eventually

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.810 
could really challenge they eventually
challenged<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> think<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.980> trying<00:00:47.489> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
challenged to think they just trying to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600 
challenged to think they just trying to
bring<00:00:48.329> attention<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.489> exactly

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
bring attention to it exactly

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.340 
bring attention to it exactly
well<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.879> mentioned<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.050> that

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
well they mentioned that they do that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.410 
well they mentioned that they do that
overseas<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.579> snuffed<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.180> pretty

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
overseas and it's it snuffed out pretty

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
overseas and it's it snuffed out pretty
fast<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.140> overseas<00:00:56.010> international<00:00:56.699> terms

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
fast and overseas international terms

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
fast and overseas international terms
but<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.360> much<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.570> yeah<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.710> that's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
but not so much here yeah I think that's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.229 
but not so much here yeah I think that's
a<00:00:59.370> that's<00:00:59.789> where<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.059> saw<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> discrepancy

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
a that's where you saw the discrepancy

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.549 
a that's where you saw the discrepancy
this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> hand<00:01:03.870> fight<00:01:04.110> battle

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this is going to be a hand fight battle

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.780 
this is going to be a hand fight battle
and<00:01:05.330> nice<00:01:06.330> shot<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.110> Pico<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.130> moved<00:01:08.700> right

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and nice shot but Pico just moved right

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.750 
and nice shot but Pico just moved right
out<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> way<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:10.619> shot<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.010> Rutherford<00:01:11.580> we

about it Richard and a step out point

00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:52.459 
about it Richard and a step out point
would<00:06:50.729> give<00:06:50.879> him<00:06:51.029> the<00:06:51.059> lead<00:06:51.329> as<00:06:51.509> well<00:06:51.689> yeah<00:06:52.110> so

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:52.469 
would give him the lead as well yeah so

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:54.859 
would give him the lead as well yeah so
he<00:06:52.559> could<00:06:52.709> win<00:06:52.829> three<00:06:53.099> three<00:06:53.369> but<00:06:54.119> just<00:06:54.629> like

00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:54.869 
he could win three three but just like

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.619 
he could win three three but just like
that<00:06:55.139> shuts<00:06:55.709> the<00:06:55.829> door<00:06:56.029> for<00:06:57.029> the<00:06:57.149> time<00:06:57.360> being

that shuts the door for the time being

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:59.779 
that shuts the door for the time being
at<00:06:57.809> least<00:06:57.839> extending<00:06:58.679> his<00:06:58.829> lead<00:06:58.860> 5-2<00:06:59.369> and

those heavy hands those big hips you can

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:04.429

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
only keep him at bay for so long is the

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.649 
only keep him at bay for so long is the
one<00:07:04.589> thing<00:07:04.739> we've<00:07:04.860> learned<00:07:04.889> about<00:07:05.189> Pico<00:07:05.659> so

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 
one thing we've learned about Pico so

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.749 
one thing we've learned about Pico so
the<00:07:06.779> three<00:07:07.079> point<00:07:07.379> lead<00:07:07.529> with<00:07:07.649> 48<00:07:08.159> seconds<00:07:08.639> on

the<00:07:08.849> clock<00:07:09.059> and<00:07:09.119> I<00:07:09.949> wonder<00:07:10.949> if<00:07:11.009> that's<00:07:11.099> just

00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:11.369 
the clock and I wonder if that's just

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:13.279 
the clock and I wonder if that's just
heartening<00:07:11.729> to<00:07:11.999> Weatherford<00:07:12.659> you<00:07:12.959> know<00:07:13.049> he's

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289 
heartening to Weatherford you know he's

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:14.809 
heartening to Weatherford you know he's
just<00:07:13.439> going<00:07:13.589> to<00:07:13.649> press<00:07:13.949> forward<00:07:14.249> and<00:07:14.399> do<00:07:14.759> the

just going to press forward and do the

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.639 
just going to press forward and do the
same<00:07:15.089> thing<00:07:15.329> he's<00:07:15.569> been<00:07:15.599> doing<00:07:16.049> Russell<00:07:16.469> but
