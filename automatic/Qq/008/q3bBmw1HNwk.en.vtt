 recall talents and is basically an iron 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.579
 which already have the shape of the snail and 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.530
 therefore it is simpler and easier to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.359
 use will see in the tutorial is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.390

 that the 3g is a bit more expensive but bucket 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
 definitely worth it definitely 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.680
 was one of the best centers of the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.970
 legislation of all time 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.110
 Oh I understand she had a hall and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.600

 straighten your hair and do this understand that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.540

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.549
 definitely a new product 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.020
 I'm going to leave here all the more 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.549
 institutions of all the criticisms that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.310
 decisions for not being behind and only 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.259
 do it on opel of course you do 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 becoming if then to use the parties 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.630
 you can always use loyalty and a 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.399
 modulator iron our favorite brand 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.040
 do not have to weigh on food 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.780
 result midwives and had the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.799
 that want to learn how I do it 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.110
 that my hair 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.990
 just finish setting then to 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.250
 tell but this I'm going to look at 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.310
 first my son will not even read 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.890
 I'm going to call this iron that's been 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.690
 allow to reheat 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.220
 let's make the diagnosis came in two 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.680
 parts I usually do 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.950
 I have so we will improve 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.290
 areas and with elastic looking here I am 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.360
 very serious putin so look won a 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.200
 uniform to enjoy a thing against the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.310
 heat 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.810
 I also help her brighter and keep 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:31.050
 the most fun hair and I put it 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.209
 my hands and stayed almost by these two 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.390
 have dreams when the children since my 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.400
 where you play a medium section 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.400
 do not define very thick have tried 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.000
 do and I hope is that this is a 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.760
 The line we're going to do is take the iron 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.310
 as well as my turn to our 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:00.150
 dude and let's lock our hair 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:02.340
 in this ball rotate the hair around the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.950
 spiral and irons allow you to create that 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.000
 It is very cute and without having to 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.310
 be very worried a lot 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.100
 worried about how I stay in the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.000
 because it automatically contains this 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.850
 Format 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.489
 ah, I will give exactly the world does 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.670
 pity that so well defined and leaves 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.190
 stay today 31 20 and then let go and 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.959
 Fixed component bandit coins 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.049
 one thing I hope is that I have 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.120
 trick here is not that heats the 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.500
 makes it immense when it comes time to 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.500
 to curl our hair 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.430
 and will create a brass to disclose that in the 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.530
 reflections so and we will do such and 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:04.970
 how do you teach us how to do anything 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:07.100
 to use, just turn 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.240
 can be stoned and the parents are 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.240
 very physical 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.790
 to fix on the hairstyles to use it is there that the 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.709
 China wants everything to be a cardboard 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.709
