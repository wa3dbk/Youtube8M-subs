00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.819
 welcome to raymonde point as 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.970
 I present you the pulpy is cross 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.160
 xl zefal is the good who is small 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.380
 but with a good pumping volume 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.960
 since it is telescopic and she 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.179
 allows continuous and regular pumping 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.099
 we will start by looking at the details 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.929
 so we're on a pump that has 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.669
 of a removed grip to that allows a good 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.859
 grip 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.859
 a hood that will protect 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.140
 the tip a blocking system also 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.109
 we have here a small joint that we can 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.000
 move and that will allow to block 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.340
 if need an account in the closed position 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.870
 for example if we hang them head in 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.750
 low with this locking system 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.739
 it will avoid any untimely opening 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.280
 from the stern 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.769
 when there are such jerks 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.120
 at the tip we have the 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.449
 possibility very simply to adapt it 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.570
 so on one side it's for a valve 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.519
 stander 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:07.400
 and then I go back and I have a number 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.619
 who adapted for a valve presta it is 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.780
 very simply I can 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.369
 do you a little demonstration 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.500
 thanks to the collaboration of julien who 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.100
 kindly we celebrate his inner tube 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.369
 almost new relief then the pump 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.250
 is positioned very easily and we have a 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.140
 locking lever that is inverted so 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.990
 once you've set it 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.880
 you can always go it holds 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.829
 my test perfectly waterproof 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.630
 we are on a small road but 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:40.570
 whoever inflates on a bibard so it's okay 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.409
 to be regularly 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.659
 and quickly 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.560
 so even if I do not have a 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.300
 Athlete's middle 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.610
 you should be able to get away with it 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.320
 easily with this little pump well 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.810
 convenient 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.900
 knowing that was going to last with his little 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.680
 fixing system to the 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.680
 fix on the bike
