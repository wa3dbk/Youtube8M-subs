00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.630
 because they will have told me that I look like 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.940
 mexican movie pancho villa 'this 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:16.150
 woman the heroine does not have a mustache 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:19.720
 learning and this one if he has a mustache 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.130
 I think the wave is not being a woman 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.859
 live tonal 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.730
 no she is not a mustachioed woman and she 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.730
 it was with the two men 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.830
 I think it's time depilatory 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.830
 I mustache 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:43.990
 today we are going to distill the face 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.210
 hairy mustaches are not fashionable 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.520
 chávez and also this ventilation serves 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.500
 for men and women and I found a 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.100
 product in the super that I think we 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.989
 can work in this box is of 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.940
 Sally Hansen who has many products 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.270
 very good then it gives me as a 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.360
 guarantee 7 serves to pluck the eyebrow the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.510
 wine tuzzio and hairs the bikini area 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.580
 and where we have the same are not fashionable 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.890
 the hairs that we have to remove and 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.080
 this is a very reliable way that the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.270
 we can do at home as always 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.940
 a sensitivity test before because 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.060
 not all skins are the same here 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.880
 There are strips that are with band-aids 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.830
 and good of different sizes 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.280
 depending on the area for example if it is 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.250
 the cheek because we have thicker and if 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.259
 that's how it looks like it looks like Band-Aids 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.090
 truth is they are more realistic we are going to 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.579
 break up like this 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.009
 which we are going to use and as in 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.509
 any hair removal make the sixth 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.100
 night before they are going to leave because 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.670
 they're probably going to stay a little bit 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.170
 roasted red toasted and they are 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.299
 Putting on the beard, it will 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.429
 remain as a little boy and we will appear 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.429
 drinking tea if we're not going to like the 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.439
 result then do it with moderation the 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.189
 last night and see how your 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.530
 skin every skin is different too 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.080
 says it's for bikini algae me 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.239
 I find them a little bit small for 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.799
 the bikini but good if we have nothing else 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.480
 more than ready out there that we want 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.790
 retire of course it will work 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.370
 until we take our bandage and we're going to 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.720
 to warm 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.769
 with your hands and while doing that 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.290
 they may not come up funny if you 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.900
 they have to warm up enough so that 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.930
 feel that you are already in a good 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.659
 temperature and this is instead of 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.299
 microwave that for me is wonderful 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.450
 because they are very desperate and already 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.909
 it's hot we open it by 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.590
 Of course the room is clean 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.940
 Of course I do not have anything right now 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.769
 makeup or anything and besides that no 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.849
 touch the lip because it will hurt 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:59.299
 let's put here like this and with the hair I'm going 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.299
 to press 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.180
 a while 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:11.159
 combo that covers the area 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.159
 and they have to give a single pull to the 19th 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:23.950
 the truth has to go without knowing anything 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.379
 more remains as well as everything replaces and 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.889
 you can repeat it again if they hit you 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.290
 about 23 the instructions are very 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:35.019
 you can see them clearly which ones 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.169
 can see my video and a two three 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.230
 returns to exit with the case that is the 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.730
 good eyebrow I consider this is my 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.159
 opinion that this is not going to give me much 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.560
 way because it's square but if not 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.540
 I want to take away is a little bit what 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.209
 I put nothing else here be careful not to leave 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.219
 to bring your eyebrow can cut the 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:59.140
 bandages to make them look better with a 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:04:02.380
 little finger and 123 then it came out 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.450
 if it goes well nothing else as they already have 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.200
 little by little, well, that's fine 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.410
 I do not know if it is possible to see here with my 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.810
 decent anastasia production recordings 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.320
 of the next movie 'avatar' it 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.940
 I can see, I do not know the stuffed animal 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.090
 this one that came out for him or if not then 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.700
 believe and remember the opposite 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.010
 where does the medium go? 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.980
 coming down you pull for 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.350
 above 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.530
 why 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.060
 in this beautiful little box that has 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.850
 happy he will continue using that 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.950
 has double or cute that was microwave and 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.550
 I think heating that sets in 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.330
 sugar 2 honey or nothing like me 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.840
 like the things cited last up to 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:57.090
 eight weeks that's good to eliminate 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.680
 Quickly and effectively unwanted hair 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.560
 all those crimes that give us cans 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.730
 It seems that we come to decorate 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.170
 exactly and in the part that does not 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.480
 we want and when we want it in the 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.520
 head there if it does not grow there if it does not come out 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.440
 can be cut with scissors to give the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.270
 Desired form was not so wrong 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.040
 I'm going to do it, I'm going to cut it 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.080
 example in this that you and I already 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.920
 I would like to do my eyebrows counted them 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.180
 more or less a little curves of this 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.880
 way 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.960
 and when you put me in the eyebrow it's going to be a lot 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.690
 easier to make a design and remove 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.060
 remember to always measure before because 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.430
 if we can not take the surprise 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.460
 then we are going to bring our eyebrows and 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.730
 I do not know what is worse with serra or without being 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.670
 for hairy if we have one here and in 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.410
 the area must be left to rest 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.780
 Do not start giving and giving and giving because 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.460
 we can inflame then with a 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.560
 clamp if we see that there is one out there by 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.360
 we are talking in a mirror of those 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.570
 that make you see everything great that they are 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.940
 horrible that you see open pores the 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.890
 hairs that will leave you next year 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.440
 the wrinkles that will leave you inside 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.270
 three years these mirrors just use them 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.040
 please for hair removal and I do not 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.770
 another product arrived in me that nothing else 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.950
 the batteries with that I can cope but 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:20.550
 for the area that he already asks you, I'm going to take 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.380
 almond oil can use oil 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.350
 olive also 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.350
 and with a cotton swab I'm going to put it and if 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.800
 this records I'm super reddish I do not know 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:36.390
 if you see here but and below the eyebrow 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.300
 to nourish to soften and so that my 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.220
 skin is as beautiful as ever and 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.340
 true that if it works is a very 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.470
 easy to remove the hairs from the 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.050
 little face that we do not like can also 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:53.010
 Serve for bikini arias that are not 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.800
 so big with the wax and the rest of the 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:07:00.120
 almond oil they put it in their 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.340
 little hands in their little caps the little box 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.340
 can buy in any super me the 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.780
 I understand the sea of ​​Canada 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.610
 obsessive compulsive buying everything 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.530
 I am glad of her because I already give them 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.020
 a very good tip for people who 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:16.290
 they want to shave their mustaches and all this 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.480
 I do not recommend rake for the eyebrows 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.300
 neither for little mustaches nor for little hairs 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.100
 Facials that are bothering them 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.380
 definitely the wax or this kind of 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.040
 help that is wonderful already comes from 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.630
 peak 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.140
 and there I will give them a personal weight 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.140
 metal
