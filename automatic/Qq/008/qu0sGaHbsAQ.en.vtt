00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.590
Hey everybody, I'm the Creative Lady and
today is Monday, January 21, 2013 And today

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.570
is a special day in our household. It's
Dr. Martin Luther King Junior's National

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.560
Holiday and it's the Inauguration day of
President Barack Obama.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.900
And I thought how appropriate to come and
share with you something that you may find

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.240
helpful and useful.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.240
Back in October, my grandmother celebrated
her 93rd birthday and I wanted to give her

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.450
something special.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.410
I know that she adores President Barack Obama.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.020
I decided to write to The White House on the
Democratic National Convention night and I

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.360
faxed a letter from my computer to the White
House and requested a letter for my grandmother's

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.960
birthday, actually a birthday card for my
grandmother's birthday from The President.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.390
Of course I had my family watch, watching
the mail so she wouldn't go to the mailbox

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.989
but she was 92 and still vibrant honey.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.570
I had everybody watching out for this mail
that was coming.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.960
I could have had it sent to my home but I
wanted it to go to her home with her name

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.110
and address and everything on it.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.820
How about the one day that she was home alone,
on a Saturday, the letter came from The White

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.729
House and she ripped it open!

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.790
So it was not a surprise and she was so excited
and I was OK with her opening it early.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.420
In the meantime, my friend from DC has sent
her the official White House Presidential

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.350
Portrait. So what I did was went to Amazon
and I found a picture frame with 3 compartments

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.009
in it so I put in there, for her birthday,
the letter I had written to the White House,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.600
the picture of President Obama from the official
white house portrait as well as the card and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.100
the envelop from The White House.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.240
And I'll tell you, that was like the talk
of the town child. You would have thought

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.740
that I had brought the president to the house
honey.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.159
If you are interested in getting a letter
for a certain event like a special birthday,

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:13.739
I think you have to be over 60 in order to
get a birthday greeting from the president;

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.739
a veteran of the military aged 70. I think
boy scout commemoration, girl scout commemoration,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.930
a wedding but it has to be after the wedding
event because you may not get married. I'll

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.250
put the link down below so you guys can read
all of the qualifications in order to get

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.020
a greeting from the white house. I think you
guys will find it helpful so I'm gonna link

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.020
everything down below. Happy King Day, Happy
Inauguration Day, Thanks for watching! Bye!

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.690
Here's a closer look at how to get a greeting
from the president's office.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.379
You have to be a US citizen and it is free
of charge to get the greeting.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.459
You can even have your US Senator or US Representative
from your state do it for you but you can

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.680
easily do it for yourself.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.590
There are certain commemorative events that
can be recognized as warranted getting a greeting

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.349
such as an anniversary and the couple have
to have been married for at least 50 years,

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.629
a birthday turning 80, 70 for military veteran.
There are other occasions such as a wedding

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.720
or a baby's birth or adoption, retirement
from the same job for more than 30 years,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.870
boy scout, girl scout or religious occasion.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.280
You have to be sure to include the name and
home address of the honoree, the exact date

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.180
of the occasion, and if it's for a marriage,
how long the couple has been married and of

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.000
course, you're gonna have to include your
name and a daytime contact phone number.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.599
Send that information to
The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.599
Washington, D.C. 20500. For faster services,
fax your letter to 202-456-2461.
