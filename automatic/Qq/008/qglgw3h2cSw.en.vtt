I'll show you the close up obviously but

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600 
I'll show you the close up obviously but
I<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.710> i<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.340> i<00:00:47.430> did

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I don't know i really like it i did

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.180 
I don't know i really like it i did
order<00:00:47.820> size<00:00:48.180> 7<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.230> fits<00:00:49.469> perfectly<00:00:50.070> i

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
order size 7 and it fits perfectly i

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.819 
order size 7 and it fits perfectly i
would<00:00:50.460> say<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.360> almost<00:00:51.629> fits<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.710> bit

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
would say it almost fits a little bit

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.979 
would say it almost fits a little bit
smaller<00:00:53.160> than<00:00:53.250> true<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> size<00:00:53.879> because<00:00:54.570> it's

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
smaller than true to size because it's

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.439 
smaller than true to size because it's
got<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.649> weird<00:00:55.980> kind<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.640> square<00:00:57.000> shape<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
got this weird kind of square shape to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.110 
got this weird kind of square shape to
it<00:00:57.480> instead<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.079> being<00:00:58.230> circular<00:00:58.800> so

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
it instead of just being circular so

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
it instead of just being circular so
keep<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.359> mind<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:00.899> ordering<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
keep that in mind when ordering if you

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.770 
keep that in mind when ordering if you
have<00:01:02.460> larger<00:01:02.879> knuckles<00:01:03.239> or<00:01:03.449> anything<00:01:03.750> like

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
have larger knuckles or anything like

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.149 
have larger knuckles or anything like
that<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.080> might<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> hard<00:01:04.680> time<00:01:04.799> getting

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that you might have a hard time getting

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.950 
that you might have a hard time getting
it<00:01:05.280> over<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.240> other<00:01:06.479> than<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.840> think

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it over it but other than that I think

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.570 
it over it but other than that I think
this<00:01:07.229> fits<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.070> well<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
this fits really really well it's a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210 
this fits really really well it's a
heavy<00:01:08.790> piece<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.510> solid<00:01:09.750> piece<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.890> don't

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
heavy piece it's a solid piece I don't

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.530 
heavy piece it's a solid piece I don't
really<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.520> much<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.060> say<00:01:12.270> about<00:01:12.390> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
really have that much to say about it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.789 
really have that much to say about it
it's<00:01:12.780> pretty<00:01:13.020> much<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.770> what

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it's pretty much what you see is what

tall<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:17.670> 56<00:02:18.180> or<00:02:18.390> almost<00:02:18.660> 56<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.379> not<00:02:19.890> too

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
tall and like 56 or almost 56 so not too

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.030 
tall and like 56 or almost 56 so not too
bad<00:02:20.280> um<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:21.660> goes<00:02:21.900> down<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.319> my<00:02:22.560> belly<00:02:22.770> button

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.949 
bad um it goes down to my belly button
though<00:02:23.129> so<00:02:23.340> it's<00:02:23.550> definitely<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.090> longer<00:02:24.660> piece

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
though so it's definitely a longer piece

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.630 
though so it's definitely a longer piece
which<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.650> cool<00:02:25.830> because<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.250> wear<00:02:26.400> it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
which is cool because you can wear it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.220 
which is cool because you can wear it
with<00:02:26.700> different<00:02:26.940> pieces<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.599> layer<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
do whatever you need to do with it but

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.640

not<00:02:40.920> everyone<00:02:41.310> likes<00:02:41.519> that<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.390> makes<00:02:42.660> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
not everyone likes that but it makes it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.680 
not everyone likes that but it makes it
a<00:02:42.840> lot<00:02:42.959> easier<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.530> wear<00:02:43.739> but<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.730> has<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> really

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
a lot easier to wear but it has a really

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.479 
a lot easier to wear but it has a really
different<00:02:45.959> clasp<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:46.830> if<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.129> look<00:02:47.280> at<00:02:47.430> it

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
different clasp so if you look at it

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.839 
different clasp so if you look at it
right<00:02:47.700> here<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:49.080> actually<00:02:49.319> has<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.849> lobster

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
right here it actually has the lobster

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.869 
right here it actually has the lobster
claw<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.420> center<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.080> two<00:02:52.879> feather

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
claw in the center of the two feather

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.330 
claw in the center of the two feather
clusters<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.870> guess<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.319> would<00:02:55.440> call<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.220> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
clusters I guess you would call it so it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.890 
clusters I guess you would call it so it
just<00:02:56.519> closes<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.180> which<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.690> don't

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
just closes like that which I don't

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.330 
just closes like that which I don't
really<00:02:58.050> see<00:02:58.170> what<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> benefit<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.159> that

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
really see what the benefit of that

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.580 
really see what the benefit of that
would<00:02:59.730> be<00:02:59.909> really<00:03:00.209> since<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:00.930> long<00:03:01.230> but

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
would be really since it's so long but

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.080 
would be really since it's so long but
it's<00:03:01.739> just<00:03:01.950> kind<00:03:02.129> of<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.280> cool<00:03:02.519> little<00:03:03.319> nifty

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
it's just kind of a cool little nifty

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.520 
it's just kind of a cool little nifty

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.080 
think this is cute it could be a nice
layering<00:03:31.440> piece<00:03:31.769> it's<00:03:32.010> nice<00:03:32.190> by<00:03:32.400> itself<00:03:32.700> it's

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
layering piece it's nice by itself it's

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.050 
layering piece it's nice by itself it's
nothing<00:03:33.569> too<00:03:34.099> unique<00:03:35.099> or<00:03:35.370> different<00:03:35.400> but

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
nothing too unique or different but

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.490 
nothing too unique or different but
basically<00:03:36.209> what<00:03:36.629> it<00:03:36.659> is<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.080> four-leaf

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
basically what it is is a four-leaf

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.680 
basically what it is is a four-leaf
clover<00:03:37.980> with<00:03:38.519> different<00:03:38.879> colors<00:03:39.180> for<00:03:39.540> each

clover with different colors for each
leaf<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.319> think<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.069> nice<00:03:41.310> layering

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.369 
leaf I think this is a nice layering
piece<00:03:42.000> or<00:03:42.239> if<00:03:42.480> you're<00:03:42.659> wearing<00:03:42.900> one<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.200> the

colors like I am today just to kind of

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.089 
colors like I am today just to kind of
tie<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.299> all<00:03:45.450> together<00:03:45.629> the<00:03:46.379> one<00:03:46.590> complaint<00:03:46.980> I

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
tie it all together the one complaint I

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.440 
tie it all together the one complaint I
would<00:03:47.250> have<00:03:47.370> about<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.090> if<00:03:48.330> you

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
would have about this is that if you

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.910 
would have about this is that if you
have<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.569> smaller<00:03:48.900> wrist<00:03:49.230> which<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.650> feel<00:03:49.830> like

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
have a smaller wrist which I feel like

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.670 
have a smaller wrist which I feel like
my<00:03:50.099> wrist<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.370> pretty<00:03:50.640> normal<00:03:51.049> I'm<00:03:52.049> normal<00:03:52.530> too

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
my wrist is pretty normal I'm normal too

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.910 
my wrist is pretty normal I'm normal too
small<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.950> guess<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.730> kind<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.379> spins<00:03:55.379> around<00:03:55.560> on

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
small I guess it kind of spins around on

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.320 
small I guess it kind of spins around on
you<00:03:56.069> which<00:03:56.280> is<00:03:56.310> not<00:03:56.549> really<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:56.819> big<00:03:57.000> deal<00:03:57.060> if

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
you which is not really a big deal if

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.309 
you which is not really a big deal if
you're<00:03:57.450> gonna<00:03:57.569> layer<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.840> but<00:03:58.110> if<00:03:58.200> you're

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
you're gonna layer it but if you're

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.570 
you're gonna layer it but if you're
wearing<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.620> by<00:03:58.709> yourself<00:03:59.099> it's<00:03:59.280> kind<00:03:59.519> of

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
wearing it by yourself it's kind of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.830 
wearing it by yourself it's kind of
annoying<00:03:59.819> if<00:04:00.090> it's<00:04:00.150> back<00:04:00.360> here<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.750> whole

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
annoying if it's back here the whole

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.539 
annoying if it's back here the whole
time<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.680> that's<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.040> only<00:04:02.069> thing<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.519> I

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
time so that's the only thing that I

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.100 
time so that's the only thing that I
would<00:04:02.670> say<00:04:02.819> about<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.330> but<00:04:03.450> overall<00:04:03.780> I'm<00:04:04.080> happy

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
would say about it but overall I'm happy

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.949 
would say about it but overall I'm happy
that<00:04:04.409> I<00:04:04.560> have<00:04:04.830> this<00:04:05.069> but<00:04:05.760> probably<00:04:06.629> wouldn't

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
that I have this but probably wouldn't

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.080 
that I have this but probably wouldn't
be<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.470> first<00:04:07.980> choice<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.549> I<00:04:08.610> picked<00:04:08.849> from

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
be the first choice that I picked from

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
saw these and saw that they were a

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.590 
saw these and saw that they were a
little<00:05:21.100> bit<00:05:21.310> fancier<00:05:21.760> not<00:05:22.150> so<00:05:24.330> hippyish<00:05:25.330> or

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
little bit fancier not so hippyish or

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.000 
little bit fancier not so hippyish or
bohemian<00:05:25.780> which<00:05:26.260> is<00:05:26.410> there's<00:05:26.620> nothing<00:05:26.890> wrong

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
bohemian which is there's nothing wrong

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.350 
bohemian which is there's nothing wrong
with<00:05:27.070> that<00:05:27.310> sometimes<00:05:27.730> I<00:05:27.820> like<00:05:27.940> that<00:05:28.120> style

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
with that sometimes I like that style

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.000 
with that sometimes I like that style
but<00:05:28.690> generally<00:05:29.440> i<00:05:29.470> don't<00:05:29.560> really<00:05:29.740> dressed

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
but generally i don't really dressed

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.620 
but generally i don't really dressed
that<00:05:30.160> way<00:05:30.220> so<00:05:30.430> these<00:05:30.940> were<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.150> little<00:05:31.420> bit

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
that way so these were a little bit

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.150 
that way so these were a little bit
fancier<00:05:32.110> but<00:05:32.350> you<00:05:32.440> could<00:05:32.590> definitely<00:05:32.710> dress

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
fancier but you could definitely dress

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
cluster feathers right by your face it

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.530 
cluster feathers right by your face it
makes<00:06:11.830> your<00:06:11.980> face<00:06:12.040> look<00:06:12.310> like<00:06:12.430> wider<00:06:12.880> this

a<00:06:15.970> little<00:06:16.180> bit<00:06:16.390> past<00:06:16.810> your<00:06:16.990> chin<00:06:17.290> so<00:06:17.620> I<00:06:17.830> thought

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
a little bit past your chin so I thought

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.760

do<00:06:29.800> anything<00:06:30.100> like<00:06:30.190> this<00:06:30.400> before<00:06:30.580> so<00:06:31.030> it<00:06:31.090> was

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
do anything like this before so it was

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.880 
do anything like this before so it was
kind<00:06:31.390> of<00:06:31.420> cool<00:06:31.630> that<00:06:31.690> they<00:06:31.960> went<00:06:32.200> with<00:06:32.740> that

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
kind of cool that they went with that

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.670 
kind of cool that they went with that
trend<00:06:33.280> but<00:06:33.610> overall<00:06:34.030> I<00:06:34.540> don't<00:06:35.230> know<00:06:35.350> if<00:06:35.560> I

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
trend but overall I don't know if I

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.230 
trend but overall I don't know if I
really<00:06:35.830> think<00:06:36.430> that<00:06:36.550> these<00:06:36.760> would<00:06:36.940> be<00:06:37.030> worth

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
really think that these would be worth

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.870 
really think that these would be worth
the<00:06:37.390> money

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
the money

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.360 
the money

bat<00:06:45.200> on<00:06:45.380> the<00:06:45.470> website<00:06:45.890> but<00:06:46.160> knew<00:06:46.400> i<00:06:46.430> would<00:06:46.700> have

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
bat on the website but knew i would have

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.310 
bat on the website but knew i would have
a<00:06:46.850> really<00:06:47.150> difficult<00:06:47.330> time<00:06:47.750> wearing<00:06:48.080> them

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
a really difficult time wearing them

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.250 
a really difficult time wearing them
because<00:06:48.350> of<00:06:49.160> the<00:06:49.610> colors<00:06:50.030> it's<00:06:50.360> got<00:06:50.750> yellow

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
because of the colors it's got yellow

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.130 
because of the colors it's got yellow
like<00:06:51.980> a<00:06:52.010> really<00:06:52.370> dark<00:06:52.760> yellow<00:06:53.030> a<00:06:53.480> lighter

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
like a really dark yellow a lighter

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.380 
like a really dark yellow a lighter
yellow<00:06:54.440> a<00:06:54.800> light<00:06:55.130> blue<00:06:55.310> and<00:06:55.340> a<00:06:55.580> lavender<00:06:55.970> which

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
yellow a light blue and a lavender which

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.450 
yellow a light blue and a lavender which
is<00:06:56.660> really<00:06:56.960> pretty<00:06:57.230> but<00:06:57.620> it's<00:06:57.890> kind<00:06:58.160> of<00:06:58.220> an<00:06:58.340> odd

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
is really pretty but it's kind of an odd

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.070 
is really pretty but it's kind of an odd
combination<00:06:58.790> just<00:06:59.330> reminds<00:06:59.690> me<00:06:59.780> of<00:06:59.840> Easter

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
combination just reminds me of Easter

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.720 
combination just reminds me of Easter
for<00:07:00.470> some<00:07:00.650> reason<00:07:00.950> which<00:07:01.190> I<00:07:01.310> guess<00:07:01.520> they<00:07:01.670> were

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730 
for some reason which I guess they were

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.370 
for some reason which I guess they were
kind<00:07:01.940> of<00:07:01.970> going<00:07:02.120> in<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.390> spring<00:07:02.720> direction<00:07:03.170> but

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
kind of going in a spring direction but

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.440 
kind of going in a spring direction but
I<00:07:03.650> have<00:07:04.310> a<00:07:04.340> really<00:07:04.580> hard<00:07:04.790> time<00:07:04.910> finding

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450 
I have a really hard time finding

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.080 
I have a really hard time finding
something<00:07:05.780> to<00:07:05.930> wear<00:07:06.200> this<00:07:06.380> with<00:07:06.590> so<00:07:06.980> I<00:07:07.280> mean<00:07:07.910> I

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090 
something to wear this with so I mean I

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.270 
something to wear this with so I mean I
don't<00:07:08.180> really<00:07:08.690> like<00:07:09.080> to<00:07:09.380> go<00:07:09.500> the<00:07:09.680> super<00:07:09.980> plain

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
don't really like to go the super plain

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.620 
don't really like to go the super plain
route<00:07:10.580> with<00:07:10.760> this<00:07:10.940> I<00:07:11.090> think<00:07:11.150> if<00:07:11.390> you<00:07:11.480> had

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
route with this I think if you had

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.180 
route with this I think if you had
something<00:07:11.840> floral<00:07:12.290> maybe<00:07:12.680> this<00:07:12.950> would<00:07:13.070> be<00:07:13.100> a

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.190 
something floral maybe this would be a

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.580 
something floral maybe this would be a
cool<00:07:13.490> touch<00:07:13.700> because<00:07:14.570> it<00:07:14.690> ties<00:07:14.900> right<00:07:15.080> in<00:07:15.380> with

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
cool touch because it ties right in with

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.260 
cool touch because it ties right in with
that<00:07:15.620> and<00:07:15.980> normally<00:07:16.310> I'm<00:07:16.430> not<00:07:16.460> to<00:07:16.850> matching

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
that and normally I'm not to matching

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.450 
that and normally I'm not to matching
matching<00:07:17.360> with<00:07:17.690> all<00:07:17.840> my<00:07:17.990> stuff<00:07:18.260> but<00:07:18.560> um<00:07:18.860> I

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
matching with all my stuff but um I

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.310 
matching with all my stuff but um I
don't<00:07:19.820> know<00:07:19.970> I<00:07:20.240> really<00:07:20.570> like<00:07:20.780> the<00:07:20.930> shape<00:07:20.960> of

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
don't know I really like the shape of

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.650 
don't know I really like the shape of
them<00:07:21.470> so<00:07:21.710> much<00:07:21.890> and<00:07:22.190> just<00:07:22.580> the<00:07:22.880> feel<00:07:23.210> to<00:07:23.480> them

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660 
them so much and just the feel to them

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.600 
them so much and just the feel to them
but<00:07:24.320> like<00:07:24.650> i<00:07:24.680> said<00:07:24.800> the<00:07:25.070> colors<00:07:25.370> are<00:07:25.520> a<00:07:25.550> little

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610 
but like i said the colors are a little

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.250 
but like i said the colors are a little
bit<00:07:25.880> more<00:07:26.060> difficult<00:07:26.210> to<00:07:26.450> match<00:07:26.660> i<00:07:26.840> think<00:07:27.110> as

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260 
bit more difficult to match i think as

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.050 
bit more difficult to match i think as
we<00:07:27.800> get<00:07:27.950> more<00:07:27.980> into<00:07:28.400> spring<00:07:28.700> i'll<00:07:28.850> probably

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.060 
we get more into spring i'll probably

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.700 
we get more into spring i'll probably
have<00:07:29.210> an<00:07:29.330> easier<00:07:29.630> time<00:07:29.690> finding<00:07:30.170> something<00:07:30.560> to

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710 
have an easier time finding something to

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.320 
have an easier time finding something to
go<00:07:30.890> with<00:07:30.920> them<00:07:31.220> but<00:07:31.460> as<00:07:31.610> far<00:07:31.790> as<00:07:31.850> right<00:07:32.150> now<00:07:32.300> I

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
go with them but as far as right now I

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.610 
go with them but as far as right now I
couldn't<00:07:32.690> really<00:07:32.900> find<00:07:33.050> that<00:07:33.260> much<00:07:33.380> to<00:07:33.530> go

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
couldn't really find that much to go

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.260 
couldn't really find that much to go
with<00:07:33.770> them<00:07:33.950> they're<00:07:34.430> really<00:07:34.760> nice<00:07:34.940> heavy

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
with them they're really nice heavy

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.750 
with them they're really nice heavy
weight<00:07:35.600> and<00:07:35.930> they<00:07:36.650> just<00:07:36.830> I<00:07:37.100> know<00:07:37.220> they<00:07:37.520> feel

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760 
weight and they just I know they feel

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.700 
weight and they just I know they feel
like<00:07:37.790> they're<00:07:38.210> made<00:07:38.360> really<00:07:38.570> well<00:07:38.690> so<00:07:39.140> I<00:07:39.350> do

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:39.710 
like they're made really well so I do

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.370 
like they're made really well so I do
like<00:07:40.010> them<00:07:40.250> just<00:07:40.970> the<00:07:41.270> finding<00:07:42.050> something<00:07:42.230> to

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380 
like them just the finding something to

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.280 
like them just the finding something to
wear<00:07:42.590> them<00:07:42.740> with<00:07:42.950> would<00:07:43.160> be<00:07:43.280> my<00:07:43.430> only<00:07:43.610> concern

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.290 
wear them with would be my only concern

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.720 
wear them with would be my only concern
so<00:07:45.290> that's<00:07:45.500> it<00:07:45.740> for<00:07:45.770> all<00:07:46.100> of<00:07:46.130> the<00:07:46.340> stuff<00:07:46.550> that<00:07:46.580> i

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:46.730 
so that's it for all of the stuff that i

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.900 
so that's it for all of the stuff that i
got<00:07:46.880> for<00:07:47.090> january<00:07:47.780> i<00:07:48.770> filmed<00:07:49.370> the<00:07:49.430> close-ups<00:07:49.820> a

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:49.910 
got for january i filmed the close-ups a

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.920 
got for january i filmed the close-ups a
little<00:07:50.150> bit<00:07:50.240> differently<00:07:50.570> today<00:07:50.780> so

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:50.930 
little bit differently today so

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.960 
little bit differently today so
hopefully<00:07:51.170> they<00:07:52.040> came<00:07:52.280> out<00:07:52.400> alright<00:07:52.700> but

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:52.970 
hopefully they came out alright but

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.940 
hopefully they came out alright but
we'll<00:07:53.240> see<00:07:53.420> I<00:07:53.600> do<00:07:53.780> have<00:07:54.050> my<00:07:54.170> promo<00:07:54.500> codes<00:07:54.740> back

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:54.950 
we'll see I do have my promo codes back

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.010 
we'll see I do have my promo codes back
again<00:07:55.280> I<00:07:55.310> have<00:07:55.670> one<00:07:56.000> for<00:07:56.240> sixty<00:07:56.600> percent<00:07:56.750> off

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:57.020 
again I have one for sixty percent off

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.780 
again I have one for sixty percent off
for<00:07:57.230> new<00:07:57.380> members<00:07:57.590> and<00:07:58.010> twenty<00:07:58.340> percent<00:07:58.640> off

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:58.790 
for new members and twenty percent off

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.850 
for new members and twenty percent off
for<00:07:59.090> existing<00:07:59.660> members<00:07:59.960> they<00:08:00.440> did<00:08:00.650> change

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:00.860 
for existing members they did change

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.260 
for existing members they did change
that<00:08:01.100> code<00:08:01.310> though<00:08:01.490> so<00:08:01.670> I'll<00:08:01.820> put<00:08:02.000> it<00:08:02.120> in<00:08:02.180> the
