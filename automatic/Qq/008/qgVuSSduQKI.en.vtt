resize<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.430> in<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.580> moment<00:02:10.759> but<00:02:11.090> what<00:02:11.360> I'd<00:02:11.480> like

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
resize it in a moment but what I'd like

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.270 
resize it in a moment but what I'd like
to<00:02:11.780> do<00:02:11.900> first<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.710> demonstrate<00:02:13.610> how<00:02:13.910> these

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
to do first is demonstrate how these

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.700 
to do first is demonstrate how these
clipping<00:02:16.280> masks<00:02:16.730> work<00:02:17.530> I'm<00:02:18.530> gonna<00:02:18.740> drag<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
clipping masks work I'm gonna drag the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.280 
clipping masks work I'm gonna drag the
layer<00:02:21.710> on<00:02:22.040> top<00:02:22.460> of<00:02:22.670> picture<00:02:23.300> one<00:02:23.510> just<00:02:24.140> like

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
layer on top of picture one just like

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.530 
layer on top of picture one just like
this<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.520> you'll<00:02:25.670> notice<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:25.970> it's<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.300> top

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
this so you'll notice that it's on top

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.590 
this so you'll notice that it's on top
of<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.870> first<00:02:27.230> box<00:02:28.160> there<00:02:28.460> but<00:02:29.300> below<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
of that first box there but below the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.350 
of that first box there but below the
others<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.370> next<00:02:31.370> I'm<00:02:31.580> gonna<00:02:31.700> hold<00:02:31.940> down<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
others and next I'm gonna hold down the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.350 
others and next I'm gonna hold down the
option<00:02:32.600> key<00:02:33.190> positioning<00:02:34.190> my<00:02:34.310> cursor<00:02:34.850> between

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
option key positioning my cursor between

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.680 
option key positioning my cursor between
the<00:02:36.260> vector<00:02:36.980> shapes<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.460> I<00:02:37.490> drew<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.970> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
the vector shapes that I drew and the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.240 
the vector shapes that I drew and the
image<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.320> I've<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.590> dropped<00:02:39.800> into<00:02:40.040> the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
image that I've just dropped into the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.400 
image that I've just dropped into the
document<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.880> what<00:02:41.750> you'll<00:02:41.900> notice<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.350> that

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
document and what you'll notice is that

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.370 
document and what you'll notice is that
the<00:02:43.070> when<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:43.910> hold<00:02:44.120> down<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.390> option<00:02:44.420> key<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
the when I hold down the option key the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.650 
the when I hold down the option key the
cursor<00:02:45.860> actually<00:02:46.550> changes<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.330> clipping

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
cursor actually changes to the clipping

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.310 
cursor actually changes to the clipping
mask<00:02:47.690> icon<00:02:48.140> when<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.130> click<00:02:49.400> my<00:02:49.430> mouse<00:02:49.700> button

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
mask icon when I click my mouse button

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.060 
mask icon when I click my mouse button
that<00:02:51.320> object<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.520> now<00:02:52.880> contained<00:02:53.800> within<00:02:54.800> that

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
that object is now contained within that

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.860 
that object is now contained within that
shape<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:55.610> no<00:02:55.760> matter<00:02:55.940> where<00:02:56.210> I<00:02:56.240> move<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.720> it's

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
shape so no matter where I move it it's

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.970 
shape so no matter where I move it it's
going<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.110> stay<00:02:57.440> inside<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:59.450> rectangle<00:03:00.080> what

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
going to stay inside that rectangle what

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.620 
going to stay inside that rectangle what
I'm<00:03:01.070> going<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.250> do<00:03:01.400> now<00:03:01.580> having<00:03:02.060> selected<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
I'm going to do now having selected the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.800 
I'm going to do now having selected the
image<00:03:03.170> itself<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.830> hold<00:03:04.280> down<00:03:04.460> command<00:03:04.700> T<00:03:05.150> to

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
image itself is hold down command T to

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.460 
image itself is hold down command T to
resize<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:07.660> I'm<00:03:08.660> gonna<00:03:08.780> move<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.380> around

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
resize it and I'm gonna move it around

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.380 
resize it and I'm gonna move it around
and<00:03:09.830> resize<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.190> till<00:03:10.550> I<00:03:10.640> get<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:13.390> position

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and resize it till I get it in position

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.680 
and resize it till I get it in position
like<00:03:15.050> that<00:03:15.400> I'm<00:03:16.400> gonna<00:03:16.580> repeat<00:03:16.940> this<00:03:17.150> step<00:03:17.450> for

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
like that I'm gonna repeat this step for

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
like that I'm gonna repeat this step for
all<00:03:18.130> three<00:03:19.130> images<00:03:19.960> now<00:03:20.960> that<00:03:21.140> I've<00:03:21.260> added<00:03:21.410> the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
all three images now that I've added the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.600 
all three images now that I've added the
three<00:03:22.430> images<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:23.120> my<00:03:24.280> rectangles<00:03:25.280> what<00:03:25.520> I'm

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
three images to my rectangles what I'm

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.010 
three images to my rectangles what I'm
going<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.790> do<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.030> select<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.480> rectangles

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
going to do is select the rectangles

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.280 
going to do is select the rectangles
themselves<00:03:27.590> go<00:03:28.430> down<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.880> layer<00:03:29.480> styles<00:03:30.110> and

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
themselves go down to layer styles and

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.100 
themselves go down to layer styles and
I'm<00:03:31.100> just<00:03:31.370> going<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.580> add<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.760> stroke<00:03:32.270> around

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
I'm just going to add a stroke around

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.050 
I'm just going to add a stroke around
the<00:03:33.470> edge<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:33.830> each<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.130> these<00:03:34.220> objects<00:03:34.700> I'm

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
the edge of each of these objects I'm

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.020 
the edge of each of these objects I'm
going<00:03:35.240> to<00:03:35.300> leave<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.540> at<00:03:35.660> 3<00:03:35.930> pixels<00:03:36.910> but<00:03:37.910> I'm

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
going to leave it at 3 pixels but I'm

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.220 
going to leave it at 3 pixels but I'm
going<00:03:38.210> to<00:03:38.240> change<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.690> color

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
going to change the color

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.870 
going to change the color
once<00:03:39.770> again<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.970> white<00:03:41.860> just<00:03:42.860> like<00:03:42.920> that

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
once again to white just like that

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.390 
once again to white just like that
now<00:03:44.420> as<00:03:44.660> with<00:03:44.870> layers<00:03:45.170> if<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.620> go<00:03:46.100> over<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.310> my

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
now as with layers if I go over to my

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.570 
now as with layers if I go over to my
layer<00:03:46.670> palette<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.270> select<00:03:48.130> this<00:03:49.130> stroke

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
layer palette and select this stroke

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.360 
layer palette and select this stroke
while<00:03:49.970> holding<00:03:50.360> down<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.810> option<00:03:50.840> key<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.650> can

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
while holding down the option key I can

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.910 
while holding down the option key I can
actually<00:03:52.520> apply<00:03:53.210> that<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:56.390> other

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
actually apply that to the other

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.400 
actually apply that to the other
rectangles<00:03:58.210> so<00:03:59.210> what<00:03:59.720> I've<00:03:59.840> got<00:04:00.020> now<00:04:00.200> is<00:04:00.380> a

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
rectangles so what I've got now is a

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.770 
rectangles so what I've got now is a
nice<00:04:00.940> three-point<00:04:01.940> stroke<00:04:02.300> around<00:04:02.510> the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
nice three-point stroke around the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.890 
nice three-point stroke around the
outside<00:04:03.350> of<00:04:04.130> those<00:04:04.640> objects<00:04:05.090> and<00:04:05.330> that's

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
outside of those objects and that's

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.470 
outside of those objects and that's
looking<00:04:06.290> reasonably<00:04:06.860> good<00:04:07.240> what<00:04:08.240> I'm<00:04:08.330> going

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
looking reasonably good what I'm going

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.510 
looking reasonably good what I'm going
to<00:04:08.510> do<00:04:08.690> just<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:08.990> manage<00:04:09.890> this<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.160> bit<00:04:10.370> better

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
to do just to manage this a bit better

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.700 
to do just to manage this a bit better
is<00:04:10.850> click<00:04:11.180> on<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.570> top<00:04:12.020> layer<00:04:12.200> which<00:04:12.440> is<00:04:12.470> an

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
is click on the top layer which is an

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.220 
is click on the top layer which is an
image<00:04:12.950> scroll<00:04:13.730> down<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.480> bottom<00:04:14.930> layer

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
image scroll down to the bottom layer

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.729 
image scroll down to the bottom layer
which<00:04:15.530> is<00:04:15.580> one<00:04:16.580> of<00:04:16.670> the<00:04:16.760> rectangles<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.739> drag

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
which is one of the rectangles and drag

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.700 
which is one of the rectangles and drag
all<00:04:18.980> of<00:04:19.190> those<00:04:19.340> into<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.120> group<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.020> I'm<00:04:21.590> gonna

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
all of those into a group and I'm gonna
