that's<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> work<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.500> balanced<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that's kind of work it's balanced out a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.789 
that's kind of work it's balanced out a
little<00:01:26.369> bit<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:27.229> they<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.710> know

actually<00:01:52.790> seem<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.299> pretty

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
actually seem to be get in there pretty

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.179 
actually seem to be get in there pretty
good<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.020> depends<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.799> guess<00:01:55.829> who's

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
good it really depends I guess who's

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
good it really depends I guess who's
playing<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.790> game<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.240> sometimes

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
playing in that game because sometimes

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.499 
playing in that game because sometimes
we<00:01:58.409> don't<00:01:58.560> even<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.890> close<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.219> sometimes<00:02:00.060> we

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
we don't even get close and sometimes we

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.719 
we don't even get close and sometimes we
do<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.259> within<00:02:01.409> minutes<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.520> just

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
do it within minutes so it really just

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.120 
do it within minutes so it really just
depends<00:02:03.060> oh<00:02:04.579> okay

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
depends oh okay

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.089 
depends oh okay
so<00:02:06.549> basically<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.240> best<00:02:07.960> tactic<00:02:08.500> really<00:02:08.920> that

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
so basically the best tactic really that

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.680 
so basically the best tactic really that
I<00:02:09.130> can<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.640> is<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:10.119> kind<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.420> get<00:02:10.539> in

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
I can think of is to kind of get in

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.059 
I can think of is to kind of get in
there<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:10.929> try<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.230> kill<00:02:11.500> them<00:02:11.650> all<00:02:11.860> so

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
there just try to kill them all so

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.800 
there just try to kill them all so
they're<00:02:12.190> all<00:02:12.340> wolves<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.120> at<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.569> point

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
they're all wolves and at that point

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.600 
they're all wolves and at that point

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
detonate yourself up there by where the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.569 
detonate yourself up there by where the
room<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.930> that's<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.829> best<00:03:23.950> place<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.340> do<00:03:24.459> it

that wall right there and just get
straight<00:03:29.739> in<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.130> basically<00:03:30.910> it's<00:03:31.299> instant

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
straight in and basically it's instant

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.960 
straight in and basically it's instant
win<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.139> if<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:32.500> can<00:03:32.680> get<00:03:32.889> up<00:03:32.980> there<00:03:33.160> it's
