00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.580
 engine power increased by 50 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.480
 percent torque increased immediately by 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.299
 17 points maximum 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.330
 speed increased by 18 kilometers an hour 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.370
 acceleration time up to one hundred kilometers an hour 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.230
 decreased by 10 seconds fuel consumption fell in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.860
 an average of 1 liter per 100 kilometers with such 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.300
 impressive difference from 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.779
 predecessors in 1967 entered the market 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.320
 Muscovite 412 did the engine pipes get here 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.650
 back valve location suspected 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.269
 supposedly producing 75 horsepower at 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.940
 five thousand normal rpm 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.190
 characteristics are impressive however 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.030
 the designers made a blunder 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.200
 the power unit suffered a lack 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.380
 thrust at start along with acceptable 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.360
 the speakers could only be twisted 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.490
 engine over three thousand revolutions in 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.790
 minute nevertheless at that time the Muscovite 412 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.410
 was the fastest car 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.040
 Soviet car industry maximum 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.629
 speed was limited at mark 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.080
 140 kilometers per hour 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.110
 weak point 413 two Muscovites were box 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.210
 gear designed for less powerful 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.550
 408 model engine she rarely ever 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.440
 stood over a hundred thousand kilometers 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.000
 operation but the cost of repair 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.030
 was small 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.229
 therefore buyers forgave this mistake 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.200
 model cost greatly influenced 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.030
 sports car success all these 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.690
 riders have repeatedly become 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.450
 prize winners of the year 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.970
 so in the seventieth year of the last century on 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.590
 route london medics from 96 and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.590
 crews to the finish line reached only 22 and 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.360
 two of them 412 and Muscovites buyers 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.979
 I was happy to buy a car with 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.670
 sporty character and expense 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.759
 fuel 8 liters ninety second 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.520
 gasoline per hundred modern 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.659
 employee gas station 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.369
 can put under him please send 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.509
 vehicle documents and therefore 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.429
 that on the base is normally waving a hand 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.340
 in fact, the question is simply solved 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.330
 open on data 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.870
 as if the plane was made public for 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.720
 Dollar Muscovite 412 was securely unpretentious 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.670
 and dynamic enough for your 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.370
 machine time but designs 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.980
 car except new 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.150
 power unit could not boast 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.819
 novelty 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.759
 since the beginning of October in the mid seventies 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.249
 the car was already significantly inferior 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.200
 foreign counterparts of the same class a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.659
 the appearance of competitors form 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.700
 car vaz pushed even more 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.760
 Muscovites to the background
