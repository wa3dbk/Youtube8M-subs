00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
the other bottles it is pretty much a

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.530 
the other bottles it is pretty much a
scaled-down<00:02:01.850> version<00:02:03.580> obviously<00:02:04.580> same

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
scaled-down version obviously same

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.060 

design<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:10.880> more<00:02:11.209> standard<00:02:11.690> type<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.890> we

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
design a more standard type and so we

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.320 
design a more standard type and so we
might<00:02:13.340> have<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.640> DFC<00:02:14.000> head<00:02:14.360> as<00:02:14.510> well<00:02:16.330> you've

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
might have a DFC head as well you've

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.080 
might have a DFC head as well you've
been<00:02:17.360> testing<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:17.930> as<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.200> say<00:02:18.380> for<00:02:18.620> quite<00:02:18.950> a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
been testing this as you say for quite a

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.270 
been testing this as you say for quite a
while<00:02:20.090> he's<00:02:20.630> already<00:02:20.840> doing<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.280> these

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
while he's already doing that these

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.370 
while he's already doing that these
production<00:02:22.880> model<00:02:23.180> may<00:02:23.330> have<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.930> his<00:02:24.140> lawn

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
production model may have that his lawn

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.979 
production model may have that his lawn
hasn't<00:02:25.160> got<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> little<00:02:26.330> bit<00:02:26.480> early<00:02:26.840> to

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
hasn't got it's a little bit early to

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.810 
hasn't got it's a little bit early to
tell<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.440> think<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.010> far<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.400> test<00:02:28.670> has

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
tell but I think so far the test has

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.300 
tell but I think so far the test has
been<00:02:28.850> extremely<00:02:29.450> wet<00:02:30.050> when<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.800> touch<00:02:31.070> have

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
been extremely wet when the touch have

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.250 
been extremely wet when the touch have
gone<00:02:31.550> extremely<00:02:31.940> well<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:32.930> don't<00:02:33.110> think

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
gone extremely well so I don't think

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.570 
gone extremely well so I don't think
there's<00:02:33.470> going<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.709> be<00:02:33.739> many<00:02:33.890> changes<00:02:34.430> from

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
there's going to be many changes from

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.580 
there's going to be many changes from
this<00:02:34.760> point<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.300> thank<00:02:35.570> God<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:36.050> think<00:02:36.440> this

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
this point on I thank God I think this

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.320 
this point on I thank God I think this
is<00:02:36.739> putting<00:02:37.040> much<00:02:37.190> fun<00:02:37.459> obviously<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.120> need<00:02:38.209> to

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
is putting much fun obviously we need to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.540 
is putting much fun obviously we need to
do<00:02:38.420> more<00:02:38.570> testing<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.320> we<00:02:39.770> find<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.160> couple<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
do more testing and we find a couple of

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.680 
do more testing and we find a couple of
things<00:02:40.760> here<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.030> there<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:41.570> this

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
things here and there but I think this
