00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
now the reason for that is because the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.429 
now the reason for that is because the
the<00:02:06.030> very<00:02:06.420> very<00:02:06.630> important<00:02:07.020> thing<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the very very important thing is the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.919 
the very very important thing is the
fabric<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> will<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
fabric on here and what that will do is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.069 
fabric on here and what that will do is
actually<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.590> very<00:02:10.770> breathable
