00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello everybody is today a 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.230
 little tutorial on how to have species 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.340
 creator x10 so is it 14 years old playing on 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.930
 create a hand robert clergerie fps 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:21.840
 first person shooter 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.789
 it seems to me good that one day we grant 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.900
 a person and shoot with heart and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.000
 how many we have to kill others 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.779
 other more well known people are call 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.469
 of duty and battlefield crossfire warhawk 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.730
 and end here so we're going to crime so I 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.370
 I'll give you a little example of how 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 looks like that so I just want to make a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.660
 insolent 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.760
 here I go 2 3 people 2 in a 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.020
 weapon and that's it and then I'll go 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.850
 show how to have it free with 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.180
 French Lepage because it has English 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.829
 normally so here we go after 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.829
 it's just to show that name 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.409
 we want you m 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.760
 royal in fact it's the crier how 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:21.400
 well use it to it's really a 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:24.340
 day it weapons in usi flying versa on va 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.510
 start then 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.590
 so I speak before it starts so 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.760
 the way not actually we know fast enough 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.760
 more had to do a video project 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.850
 aulas good here in front of troyes but 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.220
 here they are going to kill actually there are just 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.660
 a year old forest that taught me my weapon years 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.400
 I had laid invisible took before we 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.730
 do not care 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.310
 so you can give yourself a weapon 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:10.350
 but do not want to do that, that's it 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.660
 so to have it in front you have to have 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.900
 a thorel as it goes through and that's it 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.670
 allows me to download the game so 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.430
 in this video there is not to be 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.100
 need damon the lights like 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.750
 some could seem could 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.490
 doubt 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.170
 so that's right or download a link 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.600
 so all the links of all that I 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.140
 tell you no to the exclusion 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.170
 here we download tower is then 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:54.570
 will you go and give the description 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:58.459
 a link that will be this one on etsy will be 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.459
 nothing or by d 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:12.880
 yes so that will be a link or download 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.000
 you have loads and although I 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.720
 gave you and you louvre and with 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.760
 a turret so that's going to load saÃ¢ne 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.530
 and after 45 minutes if you have a pc 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.720
 Normal more debt and once it 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.910
 looks like that so it's already finished you 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.550
 maybe it's not the same rate 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.230
 reindeer how does a month that's it 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.570
 a version finally it may be this 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.239
 is not the same I would put you well 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.989
 a woman does that makes me open a 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.180
 recession 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.330
 and there you will not have this folder had 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.010
 not changed you offer the winrar folder 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.750
 if you have not ouvrard download 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.400

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.010
 to have voice there you will have his jelly lost 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.680
 and then you put yourself in the folder 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.720
 that you want for so that your 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.690
 ankle this time we can obviously 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.700
 at cfp complete stator makes free at 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.910

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.970
 to show this file to nancy chila 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.769
 click on 7 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.400
 that you launch the trick that's it for that 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.410
 scares you 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.640
 I had the standard it will release 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.410
 you do a download and then 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.590
 what do you do to see if dense that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:31.180
