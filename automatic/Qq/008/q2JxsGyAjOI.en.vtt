00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.610 

I<00:00:00.120> think<00:00:00.539> my<00:00:00.690> turf<00:00:00.870> -<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.170> best<00:00:01.319> because

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
I think my turf - is the best because

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.390 
I think my turf - is the best because
after<00:00:02.220> g3<00:00:02.610> if<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.120> once<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.419> week<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.720> my<00:00:04.370> kingside

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
after g3 if I once a week in my kingside

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.820 
after g3 if I once a week in my kingside
he<00:00:05.970> can<00:00:06.150> play<00:00:06.330> nicely<00:00:06.540> if<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.870> Knight<00:00:07.049> takes<00:00:07.410> e4

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
he can play nicely if I Knight takes e4

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.770 
he can play nicely if I Knight takes e4
so<00:00:08.250> something<00:00:08.760> like<00:00:08.790> this<00:00:14.420> and<00:00:15.420> then<00:00:15.660> you

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
so something like this and then you

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.750 
so something like this and then you
always<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.350> deal<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.690> so<00:00:18.690> I

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
always have to deal with this so I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:35.389 
always have to deal with this so I
decided<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.880> allow<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:33.710> it's<00:00:34.710> very<00:00:34.890> difficult

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
decided to allow it it's very difficult

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.680 
decided to allow it it's very difficult
to<00:00:35.520> give<00:00:35.640> an<00:00:35.730> instant<00:00:35.969> evaluation<00:00:36.540> because

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to give an instant evaluation because

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.209 
to give an instant evaluation because
they're<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.440> board<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:37.920> very

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
they're at the board it was very

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.619 
they're at the board it was very
difficult<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.730> play<00:00:38.910> simply<00:00:44.360> there<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.480> too

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
difficult to play simply there are too

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
difficult to play simply there are too
many<00:00:45.719> resources<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.410> both<00:00:46.649> sides<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
many resources for both sides and I

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.470 
many resources for both sides and I
think<00:00:47.520> we'll<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:47.969> back<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.329> check

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
think we'll have to go back and check

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:59.840 
think we'll have to go back and check
this<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.329> he<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.170> think<00:00:58.609> nitrogen<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this I think he I think nitrogen is a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.260 
this I think he I think nitrogen is a
mistake<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:01.050> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.859> anyway

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
mistake because I want to do this anyway

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.330 
mistake because I want to do this anyway

party but that's somehow the beauty of
this<00:01:14.549> position<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> even<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.470> lose

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
this position that even when you lose

the<00:01:16.830> pair<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.130> moves<00:01:17.810> White's<00:01:18.810> Center<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.799> now

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the pair of moves White's Center is now

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.999 
the pair of moves White's Center is now
a<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.220> loose<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.650> anyway<00:01:22.650> black<00:01:22.830> has

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
a bit more loose so anyway black has

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.850 
a bit more loose so anyway black has
some<00:01:23.159> counter<00:01:23.430> play<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.610> could<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:27.860> quite

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
some counter play I could not quite

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
so on but anyway here I started to get

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.510 
so on but anyway here I started to get
excited<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.680> even<00:01:49.860> sure<00:01:49.979> root<00:01:50.130> K<00:01:50.250> 3<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.679 
excited I'm not even sure root K 3 is
correct<00:01:50.790> because<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.119> whole<00:01:51.270> thing<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.509> based

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
correct because the whole thing is based

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.609
