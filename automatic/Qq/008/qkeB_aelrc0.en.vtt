00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.410
 Hello friends with you amway921 not in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.630
 this video we will talk again about personal 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.130
 combat missions especially today we 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.470
 will be interested in the task of heavy 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.600
 tank number 12 it's called armor 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.220
 strong and this task for which 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.560
 need some amount of damage 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.970
 put on enemy tanks and some 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.810
 block damage 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.029
 own armor 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.890
 she can remind someone of the 15th mission 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.470
 where it is necessary in the amount that is to get 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.099
 one number totally blocked 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.010
 armor 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.440
 damage done and taken here 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.020
 you need no mind times to make these like 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.300
 would have tasks on different sides of the barricades 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.879
 example number 15 could perform 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.800
 just causing damage up to 50 n which 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.930
 obviously about no, and no on sausage 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.700
 there dofig dofig damage and you execute 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.870
 there is no such use here 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.090
 get to play 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.699
 really on a tight armored tank but 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.219
 at the same time that it is important that the damage bar 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.770
 blocked by your armor needed 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.290
 to the trajectory of the enemy projectile 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.729
 crossed the body of the tank did not pass 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.979
 as far as there is no punched but 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.930
 crossed for example if here's the most 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.460
 far gusli here at an angle if you 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.110
 put the rhombus back to the enemy 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.180
 and the enemy shot so the projectile 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 pass through thick knock but 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.009
 projectile trajectory will not pass through 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.509
 body and this will not be considered for 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.280
 some tanks are a big omission 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.020
 example like e100 but for some 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.479
 In principle, it is not very big. 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.520
 values ​​well and actually speaking about themselves 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.439
 conditions for each tank separately if you 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.570
 go to the thing there everything just need 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.299
 fight off exactly as much damage as hp 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.520
 in your tank plus another 1000 put 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.930
 accomplished this mission seems to me a little 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.490
 whether not every at least a little 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.460
 armored strips almost from the first 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.799
 Battlefield on t28 concept needs to be done 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.540
 the same thing only to recapture his same xn 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.780
 only already double the size and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.210
 one and a half thousand to inflict damage on t55a 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.460
 you need three times your hp 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.310
 fight off and it 's harder even in the case 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 tab which is almost there 6000 and put 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.860
 2000 principle is real and on object 260 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.619
 you need the same threefold your 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.479
 hp repel and inflict already three thousand damage 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.039
 There are additional conditions in 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.050
 which must be the same you 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.910
 and to win the battle and there but the Prussians 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.920
 individual buns by the way curious what 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.010
 for example on t55a you will be given another slot 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.990
 top on site 210 same two days right 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.940
 account but for everyone else 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.470
 there as on gran such usually or experience 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.390
 or there is no credit whatsoever 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.290
 special details which tanks for this 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.510
 exactly fit 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.310
 for example American strong towers and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.080
 starting from the seventh level 120 den t29 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.670
 t32 maybe m103 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.500
 I do not dare to guess 0 and only you 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.150
 American in it is quite possible that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.590
 please tank of course not in 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.280
 emphasis because its this compass 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.010
 Germans aim there e100 mouse and 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.840
 sneakers everything fits but another thing is that 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.310
 what do you have in the hangar and because 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.450
 most probably the easiest way to have the most 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.280
 low level hoods 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.430
 she will be the seventh level American 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.410
 t29 for example knowing nikitosa probably you 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.850
 He knows him very often to me 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.680
 I talked about the fact that he tried it 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.110
 together do exactly on t29 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.959
 problems with serving the damage as a rule 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.670
 there is no pumped up on the tower 20, if 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.560
 correctly hide your fragile body 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.570
 quite to yourself ok there might be 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.940
 more difficult to apply the required amount 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.920
 damage repulsed in principle is fine 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.540
 most probably the most optimum tank 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.769
 it's just for now for now 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.930
 time because its almost nobody 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.640
 punch even gold and can be very 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.040
 boldly allow yourself such here 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.870
 exotic ways are made to universities 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.780
 yes you probably saw in the best replays 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.400
 weeks this way where what the body drove 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.130
 in the same sneaker became like 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.410
 about and beat off expected fathers with a hook 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.269
 thousand damage it was of course crazy 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.400
 I am so unlucky here 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.380
 because they are so many enemies for me 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.070
 in the legs shot notice there devyanostyk 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.780
 papuli shaft 34 strelival and from 3 from 7 the 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.790
 there is not the whole team of course it would be 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.340
 more fun that right the whole team me 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.049
 shot 7b in boor and nobody cumulative 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.299
 didn't shoot the principle just the very 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.430
 case if it were not for the archive with which there 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.650
 almost 900 rode and just a little 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.750
 not here the carcass and that is, I would sometimes 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.670
 you didn't shoot me or if 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.109
 there was no left in general about but center 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.570
 robin fields know how in the best 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.579
 the maid tradition would have gone by 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.190
 to the center of the robin field to push all this 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.560
 topic is all meat but in the end so not 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.650
 left artery besieged and I still think 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.500
 what 's about not already 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.000
 fine rush is not worth the enemies with 1 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.710
 st it is not worth so fast to kill 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.540
 they are for me to still shoot a little bit 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.100
 is there anything not enough well and that's it 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.650
 probably the most probably 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.780
 universal there for thin it on all 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.270
 Occasions this so far 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.500
 he is until he was replaced by a little mouse 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.690
 which is still unknown what will happen 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.150
 because we have a sneaker 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.710
 Uzi may zone in fact only com turret 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.660
 he has that upper armor that lower 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.759
 bronelist equally strong can be 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.289
 it would affect e100 it would also be easier 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.419
 do but there lower nelson 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.539
 he heals and sometimes in the forehead of the tower 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.460
 comes cumulative everyone comes here 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.470
 cumulative at least you can somehow 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.270
 try to drown well yes there from the top 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.220
 the way even kahal yes of course punch 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.320
 sneaker but at least she is in this fight 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.240
 according to the opinion does not shoot any the same case 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.240
 This is when we talk about high-level 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.830
 tanks if i played here on 29 if k 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.020
 example you have no wang not these here 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.370
 high-strong armored cars that 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.830
 of course then it makes sense 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.680
 t29 she would not have needed 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.389
 go uphill and there trying trading 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.490
 the enemy's towers are just to oust 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.680
 squeeze out while trying so that they 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.139
 floor shooting Birlik provoked to 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.599
 it's not easy there shot and rolled back 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.940
 shot and waiting for your tower pack pony 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.680
 someone there bangs money to give but 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.630
 and that is all that is on every tank 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.030
 Of course you need to play creative everything 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.479
 in size to realize what you need 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.849
 necessarily better desirable to survive yes and 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.860
 fight win it all clear resist 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.960
 I would not go at all at all but 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.300
 no less here such we say 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.800
 peculiar way performed on the forehead for 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.570
 on robin we are just 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.440
 looked principle is all that we 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.510
 wanted to show 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.490
 good luck with doing and forehead for 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.490
 I remind you once again that this is the most 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.130
 easy and legal way to raise up 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.990
 you all different experiences silver and 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.340
 all other consumables there are not 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.530
 release these interesting features 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.970
 while they are active today everything 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.870
 subscribe to the channel for new meetings 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.870
 bye Bye
