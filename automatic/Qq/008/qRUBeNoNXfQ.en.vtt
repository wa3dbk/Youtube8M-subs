00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
thing probably maybe the biggest thing

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.420 
thing probably maybe the biggest thing
is<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.750> tackle<00:00:39.080> animations<00:00:39.650> and<00:00:39.949> they've

tackle<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:42.379> now<00:00:42.500> you<00:00:42.559> have<00:00:42.710> true<00:00:43.040> game<00:00:43.220> cackles

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:43.729 
tackle so now you have true game cackles

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.759 
tackle so now you have true game cackles
but<00:00:44.449> along<00:00:44.809> with<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.229> have<00:00:45.350> really

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
but along with that you have really

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.710 
but along with that you have really
awesome<00:00:46.220> midair<00:00:46.519> collisions<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:47.330> whenever

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
awesome midair collisions so whenever

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.390 
awesome midair collisions so whenever
you<00:00:47.930> go<00:00:48.080> over<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.350> middle<00:00:48.650> you<00:00:49.040> always<00:00:49.250> have

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
you go over the middle you always have

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.299 
you go over the middle you always have
the<00:00:49.430> chance<00:00:49.760> of<00:00:50.000> having<00:00:50.150> some<00:00:50.510> painful<00:00:51.309> tackle

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
the chance of having some painful tackle

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.680 
the chance of having some painful tackle
going<00:00:52.519> on<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.120> you'll<00:00:53.269> actually<00:00:53.390> see<00:00:53.629> you

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
going on and you'll actually see you

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.420 
going on and you'll actually see you
guys<00:00:53.809> bouncing<00:00:54.260> off<00:00:54.379> of<00:00:54.409> other<00:00:54.620> guys<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.190> you

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
guys bouncing off of other guys and you

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.610 
guys bouncing off of other guys and you
actually<00:00:55.699> see<00:00:56.000> defenders<00:00:56.540> accidentally<00:00:57.140> run

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
actually see defenders accidentally run

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.869 
actually see defenders accidentally run
into<00:00:57.650> other<00:00:57.920> defenders<00:00:58.400> and<00:00:58.580> stuff<00:00:58.729> like<00:00:58.820> that

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
into other defenders and stuff like that

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.910 
into other defenders and stuff like that
so<00:00:59.089> it<00:00:59.150> looks<00:00:59.330> very<00:00:59.540> realistic<00:01:00.260> but<00:01:00.650> there<00:01:00.830> are

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
so it looks very realistic but there are

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.579 
so it looks very realistic but there are
at<00:01:01.100> least<00:01:01.159> two<00:01:01.670> or<00:01:01.790> three<00:01:01.820> oh<00:01:02.269> my<00:01:02.839> god<00:01:03.019> moments

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
at least two or three oh my god moments

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.320 
at least two or three oh my god moments
in<00:01:03.739> just<00:01:04.040> about<00:01:04.220> every<00:01:04.610> game<00:01:04.760> of<00:01:04.909> madden<00:01:05.210> now

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
in just about every game of madden now

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.120 
in just about every game of madden now
and<00:01:05.659> a<00:01:05.780> lot<00:01:05.900> of<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.200> because<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.979> hit

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
and a lot of that is because of the hit

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.270 
and a lot of that is because of the hit
stick<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:07.549> point<00:01:07.790> out<00:01:08.979> so<00:01:09.979> what<00:01:10.070> they've<00:01:10.190> done

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
stick to point out so what they've done

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.010 
stick to point out so what they've done
with<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.460> hit<00:01:10.610> stick<00:01:10.850> now<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.330> you<00:01:11.930> can

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
with the hit stick now is you can

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.319 
with the hit stick now is you can
actually<00:01:12.080> choose<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.770> either<00:01:12.890> push<00:01:13.789> up<00:01:14.000> on<00:01:14.180> the

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
actually choose to either push up on the

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.359 
actually choose to either push up on the
right<00:01:14.479> thumbstick<00:01:14.719> or<00:01:15.200> down<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.829> up<00:01:16.009> will<00:01:16.189> get

right thumbstick or down and up will get

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.859 
right thumbstick or down and up will get
you<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.520> high<00:01:16.789> tackle<00:01:17.090> which<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.509> pretty<00:01:17.750> much

cut tackle and that goes after

cut tackle and that goes after
somebody's<00:01:21.200> legs<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:21.710> that's<00:01:22.009> when<00:01:22.159> you

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.359 
other things that were added to the
feature<00:01:42.259> set<00:01:42.560> because<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.950> was<00:01:43.100> one<00:01:43.219> of<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
feature set because I was one of the

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.679 
feature set because I was one of the
things<00:01:43.520> that's<00:01:43.670> really<00:01:43.850> lacking<00:01:44.179> in<00:01:44.479> last

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
things that's really lacking in last

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.779 
things that's really lacking in last
year's<00:01:44.869> man<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:45.590> we<00:01:45.679> have<00:01:45.770> superstar<00:01:46.340> mode

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
year's man so we have superstar mode

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.999 
year's man so we have superstar mode
returning<00:01:47.299> once<00:01:47.479> again<00:01:47.749> but<00:01:48.320> they<00:01:48.649> pull<00:01:48.859> back

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
returning once again but they pull back

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.410 
returning once again but they pull back
the<00:01:49.130> camera<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.670> they've<00:01:49.759> actually<00:01:49.909> just<00:01:50.299> at

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
the camera and they've actually just at

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.149 
the camera and they've actually just at
the<00:01:50.479> camera<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:50.929> that<00:01:50.960> every<00:01:51.590> position<00:01:51.859> has

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
the camera so that every position has

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.980 
the camera so that every position has
its<00:01:52.399> own<00:01:52.579> camera<00:01:52.999> angle<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:53.509> you're<00:01:53.780> no<00:01:53.869> longer

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
its own camera angle so you're no longer

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.749 
its own camera angle so you're no longer
going<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.259> have<00:01:54.439> those<00:01:54.619> things<00:01:54.890> good<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.579> try

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
going to have those things good you try

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.249 
going to have those things good you try
to<00:01:55.819> play<00:01:55.939> one<00:01:56.149> position<00:01:56.539> and<00:01:56.689> maybe<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.929> camel

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
to play one position and maybe the camel

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.630 
to play one position and maybe the camel
is<00:01:57.380> always<00:01:57.710> offset<00:01:58.100> when<00:01:58.249> we<00:01:58.310> shouldn't<00:01:58.609> be

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
is always offset when we shouldn't be

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.160 
is always offset when we shouldn't be
and<00:01:59.210> they<00:01:59.270> can<00:01:59.390> actually<00:01:59.479> play<00:01:59.780> now<00:01:59.929> literally

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
and they can actually play now literally

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.359 
and they can actually play now literally
because<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.530> camera<00:02:00.799> is<00:02:00.829> definitely<00:02:01.189> pull

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
because the camera is definitely pull

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.410 
because the camera is definitely pull
back<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.609> lot<00:02:01.850> more

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
back a lot more

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.300 
back a lot more
so<00:02:02.689> that<00:02:02.840> when<00:02:02.960> you're<00:02:03.080> running<00:02:03.259> back<00:02:03.470> see<00:02:04.189> the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
so that when you're running back see the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.920 
so that when you're running back see the
haulers<00:02:04.580> better<00:02:04.790> when<00:02:05.390> they<00:02:05.479> arrive<00:02:05.659> is<00:02:05.780> see

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
haulers better when they arrive is see

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.149 
haulers better when they arrive is see
where<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:06.110> can<00:02:06.229> actually<00:02:06.350> see<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.860> field<00:02:07.100> a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
where you can actually see the field a

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.889 
where you can actually see the field a
little<00:02:07.250> bit<00:02:07.400> more<00:02:07.610> know<00:02:07.880> where<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.149> cut<00:02:08.360> but

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
rating of calculating all that stuff

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.699 
rating of calculating all that stuff
that<00:02:34.459> run<00:02:34.610> rating<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.690> now<00:02:35.840> they'll<00:02:36.140> be<00:02:36.350> guys

who are specific weapons that are

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.970 
who are specific weapons that are
basically<00:02:38.780> better<00:02:39.170> at<00:02:39.350> something<00:02:39.560> like<00:02:39.800> you

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
basically better at something like you

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.740 
basically better at something like you
might<00:02:40.130> have<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.370> running<00:02:41.299> back<00:02:41.540> because<00:02:41.720> of

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
might have a running back because of

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.270 
might have a running back because of
stiff<00:02:42.170> arm<00:02:42.380> running<00:02:42.680> back<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.130> just

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
stiff arm running back and that just

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.340 
stiff arm running back and that just
means<00:02:43.400> he<00:02:43.700> delivers<00:02:44.120> powerful<00:02:44.600> stiff<00:02:45.019> arms

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
means he delivers powerful stiff arms

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.590 
means he delivers powerful stiff arms
now<00:02:45.560> here<00:02:46.250> has<00:02:46.340> not<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.580> stiff<00:02:46.850> arm<00:02:47.030> running

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
now here has not a stiff arm running

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.660 
now here has not a stiff arm running
back<00:02:47.720> he<00:02:48.019> still<00:02:48.230> do<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.410> stiff<00:02:48.680> arm<00:02:48.860> this<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.549> not

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
back he still do a stiff arm this is not

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.860 
back he still do a stiff arm this is not
going<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.850> be<00:02:49.940> as<00:02:50.030> effective<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.660> when<00:02:50.780> you

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
going to be as effective so when you

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
to him so as you're playing through the

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.690 
to him so as you're playing through the
season<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.590> actually<00:03:10.040> be<00:03:10.100> able<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.280> do<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
season you actually be able to do the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.430 
season you actually be able to do the
old<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.329> old<00:03:11.450> minigames<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.109> used<00:03:12.260> to

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
old the old minigames that you used to

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.229 
old the old minigames that you used to
but<00:03:13.010> for<00:03:13.190> training<00:03:13.519> out<00:03:13.609> to<00:03:13.730> be<00:03:13.820> training<00:03:14.150> them

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
but for training out to be training them

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.360 
but for training out to be training them
to<00:03:14.299> pick<00:03:15.230> what<00:03:15.410> weapons<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:15.799> want<00:03:16.010> them<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.160> be

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
to pick what weapons you want them to be

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.550 
to pick what weapons you want them to be
so<00:03:16.670> if<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.180> want<00:03:17.390> Adrian<00:03:17.810> Peterson<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.320> be<00:03:18.410> an

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
so if you want Adrian Peterson to be an

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.259 
so if you want Adrian Peterson to be an
elusive<00:03:18.920> back<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.549> basically<00:03:19.730> have<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.090> work

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
elusive back you basically have to work

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.150 
elusive back you basically have to work
on<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.870> build<00:03:21.200> points<00:03:21.590> into<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:21.890> until

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
on that and build points into that until

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.530 
on that and build points into that until
he<00:03:22.250> kind<00:03:22.430> of<00:03:22.489> gets<00:03:22.609> that<00:03:22.790> statistic<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.420> then

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
he kind of gets that statistic and then

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.300 
he kind of gets that statistic and then
you'll<00:03:23.930> be<00:03:23.959> able<00:03:24.049> to<00:03:24.230> do<00:03:24.350> like<00:03:24.829> better<00:03:25.040> Jukes

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
you'll be able to do like better Jukes

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.130 
you'll be able to do like better Jukes
have<00:03:25.609> new<00:03:25.790> Juke<00:03:25.970> animations<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.630> another

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
have new Juke animations that another

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.900 
have new Juke animations that another
player<00:03:27.410> wouldn't<00:03:27.739> have<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.459> can<00:03:28.640> really

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
player wouldn't have so you can really

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.970 
player wouldn't have so you can really
guide<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.870> way<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.260> want<00:03:30.410> players<00:03:30.829> to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
guide the way that you want players to

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.130 
guide the way that you want players to
