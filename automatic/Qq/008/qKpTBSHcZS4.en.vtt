june that gun it's actually really good
but<00:02:53.190> for<00:02:53.310> some<00:02:53.459> reason<00:02:53.730> when<00:02:53.940> you're<00:02:54.090> just

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
but for some reason when you're just

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.660 
but for some reason when you're just
standing<00:02:54.480> still<00:02:54.900> shooting<00:02:55.350> its<00:02:55.650> team<00:02:56.190> it

standing still shooting its team it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.910 
standing still shooting its team it
seems<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.239> get<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.630> really<00:02:57.840> inaccurate<00:02:58.260> and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
seems to get like really inaccurate and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.880 
seems to get like really inaccurate and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.000 
but for some reason accuracies a lot
better<00:03:06.209> with<00:03:06.330> red<00:03:06.450> dot<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.830> tends

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
better with red dot and that just tends

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.530
