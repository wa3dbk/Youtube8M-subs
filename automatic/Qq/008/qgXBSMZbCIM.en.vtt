00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.810 
so you can see that so that was causing
major<00:01:54.509> issues<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:55.740> people<00:01:56.040> would<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.460> into

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
major issues when people would go into

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.030 
major issues when people would go into
attack<00:01:57.119> before<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.409> would<00:01:58.500> attack<00:01:58.619> they

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
attack before they would attack they

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
attack before they would attack they
could<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.340> where<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> bomb<00:01:59.820> placements<00:02:00.450> were

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
could see where the bomb placements were

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.660 
could see where the bomb placements were
they<00:02:00.899> could<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.439> what<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.070> had<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> clan

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
they could see what they had in the clan

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.870 
they could see what they had in the clan
castle<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.390> they<00:02:04.200> could<00:02:04.469> prepare<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.759> their

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
castle so they could prepare for their

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.609 
castle so they could prepare for their
raid<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.600> take<00:02:06.810> those<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.350> could<00:02:07.469> drop

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
raid to take those out they could drop

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.619 
raid to take those out they could drop
like<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:08.099> hog<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> double<00:02:09.030> big<00:02:09.179> bomb<00:02:09.360> or

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
like one hog on a double big bomb or

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.029 
like one hog on a double big bomb or
whatever<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.080> he<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:10.289> getting<00:02:10.530> ridiculous

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
whatever and he was getting ridiculous

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
tournament streaming on MLG I think it

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.390

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
think a lot of people would enjoy it and

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.640 
think a lot of people would enjoy it and
maybe<00:05:50.910> not<00:05:51.120> even<00:05:51.180> just<00:05:51.510> MLG<00:05:52.020> just<00:05:52.289> competitive

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
maybe not even just MLG just competitive

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.890 
maybe not even just MLG just competitive

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
them to do that that way other people

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.839 
them to do that that way other people
can't<00:06:22.050> play<00:06:22.289> the<00:06:22.470> game<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:23.160> way<00:06:23.190> it's<00:06:23.669> meant

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
can't play the game the way it's meant

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.310 
can't play the game the way it's meant
to<00:06:24.000> be<00:06:24.030> played<00:06:24.389> but<00:06:24.630> if<00:06:24.750> you<00:06:24.870> were<00:06:24.990> still<00:06:25.139> able

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
to be played but if you were still able

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.740

to<00:06:25.560> play<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.889> game<00:06:26.099> so<00:06:26.849> that's<00:06:27.419> the<00:06:27.510> best

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
to play the game so that's the best

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
comparison I can make towards it so i

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.439 
comparison I can make towards it so i
