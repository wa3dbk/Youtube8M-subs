00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.090

 solid something else there is a map 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.270
 Memory is 4 gigabytes as far as I am 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:37.530
 I know everything here is nothing else means 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:46.649
 Well, the box is beautiful so the memory card 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:51.409
 everything is sealed well so there it is 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:57.390
 Such a book instruction in English 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:01.890
 this is he Chinese and English super 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:08.179
 can be sorted out but wow what 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:14.310
 see how terrible you are 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:17.640
 That's the kind of thing with the carabiner 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.870
 there is a circle can be fastened and 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.970
 Forward, everything with a box is understandable 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:34.110
 We will study the instruction here 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:39.720
 put and memory card so mean still 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:47.760
 since it is interesting like this 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:54.450
 the dome and here there is a usb charger 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:03:10.530
 connector so cool stored here are some 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:15.209
 they so it should be inside well so 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:22.200
 here is my feeling like she is cool 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:29.640
 there will be a duck skewer elanchik this how aha 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:37.970

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:41.459
 charging well yes that's all that's charging 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:48.810
 esbe connector is also a connection 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:52.530
 probably louder less but what you need 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:59.069
 watch I see charge first and then 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:04.700
 try the memory card 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:09.049
 by you, but in my opinion this memory card 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:16.650
 everything is here 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:19.340
 Korzh not dress on stock now can 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.340
 there are pictures 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:33.900
 because I never realized at once and 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:40.669
 there are no pictures 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:44.400
 you need to scream and understand everything and already 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.470
 so as I age it is all the more difficult and 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.169
 more difficult 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.419
 youth about youth grasps it all 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.740
 on the fly 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:59.780
 well here in the picture here look at 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:08.630
 lizka channel should be the same 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:08.630
 there must be no 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:24.820
 and here it is close 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:31.510
 that's what she looks like it means it goes 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:38.300
 forward it is 1 kla just so spring 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:43.840
 spins up spins up 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:47.510
 and the pants are turning like this 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.360
 ie it will be super like 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.380
 and darling not burst so my old yes and 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.620
 here is the clamp so unobtrusive because 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.910
 I served in the Navy as a radio operator I such 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.060
 head phones 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:06.320
 I have already said that I never them 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.510
 wore included r1 because so 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.420
 sit watch for six hours straight and 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.940
 then after six start again 1 on 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.240
 such a thing is still possible for the head 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:20.750
 endure those Soviet know these two 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.660
 burdock who saw the Soviet films here 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.960
 about the radio operator he will understand me 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:31.310
 everyone has seen and this is a gentle cool 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:36.410
 neat but cool thing then I will 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:43.700
 test and then will be further 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:46.160
 watch video now I study a good thing 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.320
 I liked it very much there are small 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.680
 the nuances but voiced it just not now 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:56.530
 a little later, look how cool yes 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:59.450

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:03.950

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:07.010
 phone via bluetooth these without listen 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.760

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:14.720
 run and I will ride a bike well here 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.639
