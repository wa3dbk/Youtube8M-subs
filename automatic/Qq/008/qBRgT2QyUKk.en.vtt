yarn i braid it down to where my head
stops<00:05:45.960> I<00:05:46.110> said<00:05:46.289> I<00:05:46.440> was<00:05:46.590> doing<00:05:46.830> it<00:05:47.160> on<00:05:47.310> yarn

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
stops I said I was doing it on yarn

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.040 
stops I said I was doing it on yarn
install<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.210> then<00:05:48.300> I<00:05:48.360> just<00:05:48.570> used<00:05:48.720> them<00:05:48.870> Rolly

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
install and then I just used them Rolly

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.310 
install and then I just used them Rolly
hair<00:05:49.289> and<00:05:49.500> wrap<00:05:49.590> it<00:05:49.770> around<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:50.970> think<00:05:51.600> that<00:05:52.110> way

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
hair and wrap it around I think that way

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.200 
hair and wrap it around I think that way
it's<00:05:52.680> a<00:05:52.830> little<00:05:52.979> bit<00:05:53.130> less<00:05:53.430> heavier<00:05:53.880> than<00:05:54.120> if

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
it's a little bit less heavier than if

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.900 
it's a little bit less heavier than if
you<00:05:54.330> were<00:05:54.419> to<00:05:54.450> braid<00:05:54.750> all<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:54.990> way<00:05:55.110> down<00:05:55.200> um<00:05:56.039> so

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
you were to braid all the way down um so

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.900 
you were to braid all the way down um so
yeah<00:05:57.360> that's<00:05:57.690> one<00:05:57.930> method<00:05:58.169> and<00:05:58.530> it's<00:05:58.650> also

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
yeah that's one method and it's also

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.330 
yeah that's one method and it's also
easier<00:05:59.910> to<00:05:59.970> save<00:06:00.240> money<00:06:00.450> that<00:06:00.720> way<00:06:01.039> hair<00:06:02.039> tends

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
easier to save money that way hair tends

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.520 
easier to save money that way hair tends
to<00:06:02.400> snap<00:06:02.700> onto<00:06:03.000> everything<00:06:03.570> I<00:06:04.080> think<00:06:04.380> that's

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
to snap onto everything I think that's

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.960 
to snap onto everything I think that's
really<00:06:04.680> what<00:06:04.890> turned<00:06:05.070> me<00:06:05.250> off<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.580> most<00:06:05.789> about

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
really what turned me off the most about

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.730 
really what turned me off the most about
using<00:06:06.419> marley<00:06:06.720> hair<00:06:06.870> for<00:06:07.110> this<00:06:07.229> it<00:06:07.410> tends<00:06:07.650> to

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
using marley hair for this it tends to

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.430 
using marley hair for this it tends to
snap<00:06:08.039> onto<00:06:08.280> everything<00:06:08.729> and<00:06:09.570> then<00:06:09.750> also<00:06:09.960> mini

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
snap onto everything and then also mini

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.800 
snap onto everything and then also mini
trim<00:06:11.070> it<00:06:11.250> like<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.640> flyaway<00:06:12.120> hairs<00:06:12.450> they

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
trim it like the flyaway hairs they

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.210 
trim it like the flyaway hairs they
dress<00:06:13.080> still<00:06:13.320> just<00:06:13.530> they<00:06:13.740> just<00:06:13.950> keep<00:06:14.100> on

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
dress still just they just keep on

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.580 
dress still just they just keep on
calling<00:06:14.490> it<00:06:14.669> coming<00:06:15.000> and<00:06:15.150> coming<00:06:15.300> and<00:06:15.630> it<00:06:16.350> kind

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
calling it coming and coming and it kind

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.790 
calling it coming and coming and it kind
of<00:06:16.710> I<00:06:17.010> guess<00:06:18.020> defeats<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.140> purpose

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
of I guess defeats the purpose

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.830 
of I guess defeats the purpose
I<00:06:19.830> mean<00:06:20.160> I<00:06:20.400> guess<00:06:20.729> locks<00:06:21.060> are<00:06:21.300> really<00:06:21.570> supposed

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
I mean I guess locks are really supposed

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.360 
I mean I guess locks are really supposed
to<00:06:21.960> be<00:06:22.110> smooth<00:06:22.410> but<00:06:22.590> I<00:06:22.620> mean<00:06:22.860> I<00:06:22.919> don't<00:06:22.979> know<00:06:23.190> I

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
to be smooth but I mean I don't know I

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.490 
to be smooth but I mean I don't know I
just<00:06:23.400> I<00:06:23.940> don't<00:06:24.390> like<00:06:24.600> that<00:06:24.840> aspect<00:06:25.110> of<00:06:25.320> there

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
just I don't like that aspect of there

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.690 
just I don't like that aspect of there
but<00:06:25.650> that's<00:06:25.740> again<00:06:26.010> a<00:06:26.039> personal<00:06:26.460> preference

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
but that's again a personal preference

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.000 
but that's again a personal preference
some<00:06:27.030> people<00:06:27.390> love<00:06:27.570> it<00:06:27.720> about<00:06:27.990> them<00:06:28.229> I<00:06:28.470> mean

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
some people love it about them I mean

synthetic<00:06:56.189> it's<00:06:56.639> going<00:06:56.819> to<00:06:56.909> have<00:06:57.059> terms<00:06:57.899> of

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
synthetic it's going to have terms of

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.049 
synthetic it's going to have terms of
heaviness<00:06:58.319> I'm<00:06:58.740> honestly<00:06:59.159> not<00:06:59.339> sure<00:06:59.399> which<00:06:59.909> is

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:00.059 
heaviness I'm honestly not sure which is

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:03.200 
heaviness I'm honestly not sure which is
heavier<00:07:00.419> I<00:07:01.430> honestly<00:07:02.430> think<00:07:02.610> it<00:07:02.759> depends<00:07:03.089> of

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
heavier I honestly think it depends of

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.179 
heavier I honestly think it depends of
how<00:07:03.240> many<00:07:03.539> strands<00:07:03.869> per<00:07:04.110> yarn<00:07:04.680> or<00:07:04.919> how<00:07:05.039> many

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:05.189 
how many strands per yarn or how many

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:07.129 
how many strands per yarn or how many
strands<00:07:05.490> per<00:07:05.699> marley<00:07:06.479> hair<00:07:06.659> you<00:07:06.779> used<00:07:06.990> to

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:11.309 
these tiny most likely they're gonna be

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:14.059

heavy if you're using more strands -

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:15.499 
heavy if you're using more strands -

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:27.209 
heavy at all I use four strands per

braid and four strands per back and

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.029
