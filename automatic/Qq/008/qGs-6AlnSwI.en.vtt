even<00:04:40.500> think<00:04:40.680> he's<00:04:40.860> really<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.190> zone<00:04:42.000> kind<00:04:42.720> of

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
even think he's really a zone kind of

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.970 
even think he's really a zone kind of
linebacker<00:04:43.110> he's<00:04:43.290> kind<00:04:43.440> of<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.590> blitzing

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
linebacker he's kind of a blitzing

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.460 
linebacker he's kind of a blitzing
linebacker<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:45.090> if<00:04:45.480> I<00:04:45.630> decide<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:45.960> hold<00:04:46.139> on<00:04:46.320> to

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
linebacker so if I decide to hold on to

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.500 
linebacker so if I decide to hold on to
him<00:04:46.560> which<00:04:46.680> I'm<00:04:46.800> still<00:04:47.070> not<00:04:47.190> sure<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.460> will<00:04:47.730> I

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
him which I'm still not sure I will I

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.120 
him which I'm still not sure I will I
might<00:04:48.930> put<00:04:49.080> him<00:04:49.169> at<00:04:49.260> outside<00:04:49.620> linebacker<00:04:49.740> I

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
might put him at outside linebacker I

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.070 
might put him at outside linebacker I
might<00:04:50.490> try<00:04:50.639> to<00:04:50.700> run<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:50.940> 3-4<00:04:51.240> scheme<00:04:51.600> putting

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
might try to run a 3-4 scheme putting

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.900 
might try to run a 3-4 scheme putting
him<00:04:52.169> at<00:04:52.290> a<00:04:52.320> middle<00:04:53.190> linebacker<00:04:53.310> number<00:04:53.640> one

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
him at a middle linebacker number one

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.280 
him at a middle linebacker number one
and<00:04:54.090> Keighley<00:04:54.450> at<00:04:54.540> middle<00:04:54.870> linebacker<00:04:54.900> number

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
and Keighley at middle linebacker number

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.800 
and Keighley at middle linebacker number
two<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:55.530> kind<00:04:55.740> of<00:04:55.830> like<00:04:56.040> using<00:04:56.700> Keithley<00:04:57.630> but

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
two I kind of like using Keithley but

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.390 
two I kind of like using Keithley but
let's<00:04:58.020> actually<00:04:58.140> compare<00:04:58.650> him<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:59.070> his

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
let's actually compare him to his

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.730 
let's actually compare him to his
original<00:05:00.150> ultimate<00:05:01.020> phrase<00:05:01.200> item<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.620> came

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
original ultimate phrase item that came

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.400 
original ultimate phrase item that came
out<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:03.720> see<00:05:03.930> if<00:05:04.020> there's<00:05:04.200> anything

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
out and see if there's anything

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.840 
out and see if there's anything
different<00:05:04.620> because<00:05:04.950> obviously<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.520> picture

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
different because obviously the picture

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.210 
different because obviously the picture
was<00:05:05.970> different<00:05:06.330> but<00:05:06.570> is<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:07.350> same<00:05:07.560> overall<00:05:08.010> so

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
was different but is the same overall so

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.380 
was different but is the same overall so
I'm<00:05:08.310> not<00:05:08.430> really<00:05:08.520> sure<00:05:08.640> I<00:05:08.760> never<00:05:09.000> really<00:05:09.210> got

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
I'm not really sure I never really got

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.990 
I'm not really sure I never really got
too<00:05:09.750> in<00:05:09.990> depth<00:05:10.230> with<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.650> Jack<00:05:11.400> Lambert<00:05:11.640> but

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
too in depth with that Jack Lambert but

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.760 
too in depth with that Jack Lambert but
let's<00:05:12.150> check<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.360> out<00:05:12.450> go<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.110> ultimate<00:05:13.470> freeze

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
let's check it out go to ultimate freeze

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.710 
let's check it out go to ultimate freeze
and<00:05:14.130> just<00:05:14.760> middle<00:05:15.000> linebacker<00:05:15.360> or<00:05:15.510> whatever

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
and just middle linebacker or whatever

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.060 
and just middle linebacker or whatever
and<00:05:15.900> we<00:05:16.050> should<00:05:16.260> be<00:05:16.350> able<00:05:16.440> to<00:05:16.560> find<00:05:16.710> him<00:05:16.890> pretty

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
and we should be able to find him pretty

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.850 
and we should be able to find him pretty
easy<00:05:17.220> I<00:05:17.690> think<00:05:18.690> hidden<00:05:19.169> clad<00:05:19.380> Matthews<00:05:19.710> will

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
easy I think hidden clad Matthews will

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.560 
easy I think hidden clad Matthews will
show<00:05:20.010> up<00:05:20.130> which<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.940> know<00:05:21.030> gives<00:05:21.210> us<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.419> little

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
show up which you know gives us a little

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.850 
show up which you know gives us a little

know 800 k plus that's a lot so let's
take<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.830> look<00:05:37.979> this<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.310> original

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
take a look this is the original

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.730 
take a look this is the original
Jacqueline<00:05:39.090> but<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.270> looks<00:05:39.419> pretty<00:05:39.690> badass<00:05:39.930> I

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
Jacqueline but it looks pretty badass I

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.409 
Jacqueline but it looks pretty badass I
think<00:05:41.190> this<00:05:41.310> one<00:05:41.430> looks<00:05:41.789> a<00:05:41.940> little<00:05:42.090> cooler

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
think this one looks a little cooler

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.580 
think this one looks a little cooler
than<00:05:42.570> mine<00:05:42.750> but<00:05:43.020> both<00:05:43.200> of<00:05:43.229> them<00:05:43.440> look<00:05:43.560> pretty

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
than mine but both of them look pretty

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.800 
than mine but both of them look pretty
sweet<00:05:43.979> so<00:05:44.940> it<00:05:45.000> looks<00:05:45.060> like<00:05:45.210> mine<00:05:45.479> has<00:05:45.660> one

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
sweet so it looks like mine has one

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.659 
sweet so it looks like mine has one
better<00:05:45.990> speed<00:05:46.289> one<00:05:46.590> less<00:05:46.770> awareness<00:05:47.250> one

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
better speed one less awareness one

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.240 
better speed one less awareness one
better<00:05:47.880> strength<00:05:48.240> one<00:05:48.780> less<00:05:49.229> block<00:05:49.620> shed<00:05:49.919> one

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
better strength one less block shed one

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.450 
better strength one less block shed one
better<00:05:50.460> pursue<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:51.090> two<00:05:51.330> less<00:05:51.630> sown<00:05:51.930> coverage

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
better pursue and two less sown coverage
