00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.600
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.540
 especially we are in new information 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.460
 of the news that I saw yesterday about the new 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.320
 call of duty called the call of duty 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.090
 duty ghosts and there is new information will be 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.490
 exclusive of the annexation and will be announced 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.780
 on May 1st you know that in the 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.289
 last hours information has leaked 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.490
 about the next call of duty property 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.340
 of activision that is being 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.109
 developed by several studies according to 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.539
 the data the next call of duty as 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.579
 I already said yesterday will take the last name the 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.489
 cost and it would be the equivalent of modern 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.920
 warfare 4 will be set in the future 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.010
 always according to this rumor and although it 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.829
 would use the current weapons because according to 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.409
 they say the event would have happened and there would be 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.600
 an event occurred that would prevent it from 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.149
 could use futuristic weapons this what 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.280
 what is said in the new information of 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.660
 not today 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.520
 the truth is that it is said that the screen 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.320
 of loaded multiplayer will be 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.110
 dynamics in the style of screenshots 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.899
 of black ops 2 basically these 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.159
 screens would be like a mini game in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.229
 which the player descends from a 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.820
 helicopter or breaks the window of a 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.850
 building to jump the battlefield 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.860
 all this is new information too 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.380
 there would be changes in the movements of 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.140
 players and the spec mode would disappear 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.810
 ops although you remind yourself typical of modern 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.970
 warfare although replacing would replace 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.920
 with something new with different mini-games 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.410
 different things to do worth 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.070
 a new game mode with additives 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.600
 would have would have more scenarios 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.090
 destructive than the current ones though 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.910
 this is still under 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.220
 implementation because it would work well in 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.800
 the single player mode but for nothing 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.820
 in the multiplayer and they are trying 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 implement this in multiplayer mode 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.259
 that are not so static scenarios 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.660
 as up to now in general it will be possible 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.360
 interact with many more elements that 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.729
 the current ones and as I said 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.560
 exclusively for pc and next 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.160
 generation of playstation 4 consoles and 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.710

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.950

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.650
 by several studies the official announcement 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.810
 would occur on May 1 and 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.690
 possibly days later 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.209
 of the announcement of the new xbox even in 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.150
