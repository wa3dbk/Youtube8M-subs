00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.409
 tweet election file rar extract here 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.539
 Once done that leaves you a folder 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.049
 like this one a container folder in the 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.210
 which will open and good there is a receive 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.319
 but the folder stops us from being these 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.319
 three elements and good of those three 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:20.470
 elements and remember that the application 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:23.229
 that we will open from movie maker is this way 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.720
 that there is no problem but before 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.250
 let's move on to this remember that you can not not 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.929
 you have to eliminate none of these 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.840
 files that come side of the 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:34.750
 application since on or let it do a 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.459
 error when opening it to give to the third of 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.050
 open motion application is 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:40.030
 good 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.460
 You can save the folder in what 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.250
 be in documents pictures good music 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.760
 where you have your important files 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.650
 ok and good you're very maker in which of 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.520
 serve you the right the ico that as 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.170
 administrator or opens we close and 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.620
 We wait for the opening of the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.940
 application ready once it has opened 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.370
 in this what we will do will not be left 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.160
 like this one if you want you can import 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.250
 from images to music images 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.010
 music videos and you can put effects 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.350
 transmissions and that good circuits 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.440
 more than anything you are in common for the 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:25.080
 project creator for the school is 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:29.980
 almost equal to 14 studies but they have 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.480
 nothing else works in the wine files 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.900
 style 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.930
 that its power is' by can reproduce 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.960
 with windows and windows live the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.780
 producer is good 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.780
 I have created what is a project more or 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.350
 unless it lasts a short time but good 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.780
 you can also create what is this the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.540
 micros for your difficult channel I do not know for 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.910
 a video tutorial good at what I 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.590
 personal you can add in pictures 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.810
 let's add a more or less character 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.570
 although the idea of copying images 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.800
 we import an image that we want later 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.810
 of that I do not know I will believe to be a portal 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.810
 ready once done that we drag the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.060
 Timeline in the ready image 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.100
 Now that we have our stand 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.500
 I do not know agency you can see 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.990
 put transitions on it and put it where 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.700
 as you want once you have done that to 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.940
 who can see how it is in the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.580
 transitions of the fan above and good 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.070
 in videos we also have in your folder 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.450
 once your project is ready 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.349
 post movie 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.470
 we remember you well and we will keep 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.930
 as a team if you have a / want 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.230
 save your project on a good disk is 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.660
 you promise to make him live and you choose to divide 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.640
 and it will be recorded ok on this equipment we give it 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.800
 following 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.080
 here we put the name where we want it 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.960
 save in next 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.960
 and well this nap does not stop being like 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.770
 this and good first of all remember that 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.260
 If your video project lasts more than two 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.780
 minutes will take what is in 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.180
 redemption and convert to w w 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.440

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.300
 Once you have chosen to publish and you 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.330

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.610
