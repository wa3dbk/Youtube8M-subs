00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.710
 good morning today we are going to do 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.120
 pork tongue to the same diet 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:16.570
 I have two languages to serve ya normal 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.430
 an hour and a half in an express in the gm 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.220
 for example, with twenty minutes 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.950
 seven months 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.720
 and I have good and this is for peeling 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.539
 of the console that take away a little 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.829
 skin has little 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.829
 they take this away from here 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.020
 and this, as you can see, does not have a hard time 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.320
 It has no flavor because there are people who 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.320
 he gives 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.420
 we have this way 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.079
 If you do hot, it costs half 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.399
 it happens that I do not let it cool 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.399
 It's like having a rod 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.179
 so fat 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.090
 served well 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.600
 give him pitas 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.840
 and now we know knife slices like 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.840
 this 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.180
 Trims fantastic and isolated well 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.900
 little pretty 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.900
 you can also 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.909
 kidney 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.000
 the vinaigrette is delicious 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.770
 it is not the language is a part 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.240
 very bad 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.810
 there are people that if you would not tell them it is 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.990
 tongue and turns 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.100
 It is not 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.100
 it's like you eat 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.770
 put them 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.590
 and the truth is that you like it 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.590
 yes 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 vinegar 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.269
 s 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.269
 from far 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.170
 two 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.170
 and we will make another layer 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.540
 I'm with a couple of works that 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.540
 you prepare before it's just a vinegar 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.100
 but the appetizer is great 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.100
 fast dinner 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.430
 with is like this 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.400
 you have seen that I have put first the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.280
 vinegar and oil already told you why 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.860
 I do it because if we put the salt on it 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.159
 pepper we think everything 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.159
 so 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.860
 then it is a way of remaining 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.870
 and stay fixed 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.870
 of that seed of truth 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:42.670
 yours when you put it in the fridge to 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.670
 the time or if you take a turn down 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.850
 yes 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.150
 yes 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.210
 good 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.010
 so you have 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:03.140
 pork tongues vinaigrette 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.140
 very rich to another
