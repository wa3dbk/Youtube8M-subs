you of a sharpener that I would not
recommend<00:00:07.680> picking<00:00:08.189> up<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.330> Gerber

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
recommend picking up this is the Gerber

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.620 
recommend picking up this is the Gerber

sharpener that you can pick up for about
five<00:00:12.840> bucks<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.469> very<00:00:14.099> small<00:00:14.460> lightweight<00:00:14.910> ways

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
five bucks a very small lightweight ways

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.540 
five bucks a very small lightweight ways
I<00:00:15.839> believe<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:16.289> two<00:00:16.470> ounces<00:00:16.949> very<00:00:17.310> nice

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
I believe like two ounces very nice

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.670 
I believe like two ounces very nice
lightweight<00:00:18.090> small<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.320> stick<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.590> in

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
lightweight small so you can stick it in

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.019 
lightweight small so you can stick it in
your<00:00:19.770> pack<00:00:20.010> very<00:00:20.250> easily<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.820> very

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
your pack very easily it's very

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.620 
your pack very easily it's very
unobtrusive<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:22.439> got<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> lanyard<00:00:22.859> hole<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:24.240> I

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
unobtrusive you got a lanyard hole and I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.849 
unobtrusive you got a lanyard hole and I
don't<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:24.869> if<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.680> it

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
don't know if you can see this here it

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.179 
don't know if you can see this here it
has<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.670> fine<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.510> coarse<00:00:27.930> set<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.650> rods<00:00:28.890> in

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
has a fine and a coarse set of rods in

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.429 
has a fine and a coarse set of rods in
here<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:29.939> very<00:00:30.060> similar<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.050> one

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
here so it's very similar to the one

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.280 
here so it's very similar to the one
that<00:00:31.529> we've<00:00:31.650> already<00:00:31.830> viewed<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> Smiths

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
that we've already viewed the Smiths

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.540 
that we've already viewed the Smiths
runner<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> much<00:00:35.250> better

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
runner this one is a much better

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.940 
runner this one is a much better
sharpener<00:00:36.390> than<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.230> Gerber<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.620> I'm<00:00:37.800> just

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
sharpener than the Gerber and I'm just

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.979 
sharpener than the Gerber and I'm just
gonna<00:00:38.040> kind<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.309> give<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.750> profile<00:00:39.750> here

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
gonna kind of give you a profile here

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.540 
gonna kind of give you a profile here
now<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> Gerber<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> smaller

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
now you can see the Gerber is smaller

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.610 
now you can see the Gerber is smaller
which<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:41.940> nice<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.570> know<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.140> packing

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
which is nice you know for just packing

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.930 
which is nice you know for just packing
and<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.980> know<00:00:44.040> you'd<00:00:44.280> almost<00:00:44.399> fit<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.820> in

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and you know you'd almost fit this in

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.760 
and you know you'd almost fit this in
your<00:00:45.030> pocket<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> little

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
your pocket or is this one is a little

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.139 
your pocket or is this one is a little
bit<00:00:46.890> bigger<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.219> little<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.520> bulkier<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.030> this

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
bit bigger a little bit bulkier but this

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.130 
bit bigger a little bit bulkier but this
one<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.360> gonna<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.840> better<00:00:48.989> job

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
one is gonna do a much better job

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.709 
one is gonna do a much better job
dismiss<00:00:49.800> over<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> gerber<00:00:50.640> reason<00:00:51.239> being<00:00:51.449> is

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
dismiss over the gerber reason being is

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
dismiss over the gerber reason being is
that<00:00:51.750> I've<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.410> tried<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.949> test<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.430> as

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that I've really tried to test this as

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
that I've really tried to test this as
much<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.030> could<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:55.020> all<00:00:55.050> sorts<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
much as I could with all sorts of

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.330 
much as I could with all sorts of
different<00:00:55.620> knives<00:00:55.860> running<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> through

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
different knives running it through

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.330 
different knives running it through
there<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.930> coarse<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.500> fine<00:00:58.559> rods<00:00:59.070> just

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
there and the coarse and fine rods just

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.770 
there and the coarse and fine rods just
don't<00:00:59.579> really<00:00:59.789> do<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> very<00:01:00.180> good<00:01:00.239> job<00:01:00.390> they

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
don't really do a very good job they

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
don't really do a very good job they
just<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.289> they<00:01:01.739> don't<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.070> sharpen<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
just they they don't really sharpen the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.670 
just they they don't really sharpen the
knife<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.969> well<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.510> woulda<00:01:03.690> liked<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.470> see

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
knife as well as I woulda liked to see

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.859 
knife as well as I woulda liked to see
with<00:01:04.799> other<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.390> sharpener

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
with other you know with this sharpener

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.039 
with other you know with this sharpener
the<00:01:07.020> Smiths<00:01:07.350> works<00:01:07.590> way<00:01:07.799> better<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:09.049> openings

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the Smiths works way better the openings

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
the Smiths works way better the openings
on<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.070> Smith<00:01:11.310> are<00:01:11.490> slightly<00:01:11.760> larger<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
on the Smith are slightly larger so you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.490 
on the Smith are slightly larger so you
can<00:01:12.570> get<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:12.990> bigger<00:01:13.200> blade

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
can get a little bit bigger blade

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.410 
can get a little bit bigger blade
through<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> Smith's<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
through the Smith's then you can of the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
through the Smith's then you can of the
Gerber<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.040> most<00:01:17.220> part<00:01:17.520> they're

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
Gerber and for the most part they're

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.160 
Gerber and for the most part they're
about<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> same<00:01:18.180> price<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.900> Gerber

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
about the same price I think the Gerber

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.230 
about the same price I think the Gerber
might<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> dollar<00:01:19.920> cheaper<00:01:20.119> but<00:01:21.119> it's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
might be like a dollar cheaper but it's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
might be like a dollar cheaper but it's
a<00:01:21.299> dollar<00:01:21.540> less<00:01:21.900> quality<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:23.070> either

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
a dollar less quality I know either

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.649 
a dollar less quality I know either
neither<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.790> these<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.060> amazing

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
neither one of these are amazing

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.330 
neither one of these are amazing
I<00:01:24.810> mean<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.680> depends<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> knife

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
I mean but it just depends on the knife

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.410 
I mean but it just depends on the knife
and<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> should<00:01:26.700> always<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:27.000> multiple

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and you should always have multiple

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.819 
and you should always have multiple
different<00:01:27.540> types<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> knife<00:01:28.110> sharpeners<00:01:28.619> on

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
different types of knife sharpeners on

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.060 
different types of knife sharpeners on
you<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.180> particularly<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.470> raw<00:01:31.740> these

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070

rods right in here the ceramic rods are

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.569 
rods right in here the ceramic rods are
really<00:01:34.350> nice<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.890> touch<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.310> lot<00:01:35.460> of

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
really nice and can touch up a lot of

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.850 
really nice and can touch up a lot of
knives<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.390> some<00:01:36.689> other<00:01:36.869> knife<00:01:37.380> kits<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.829> I

knives that some other knife kits that I

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.280 
knives that some other knife kits that I
own<00:01:38.100> can't<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:38.939> well<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.750> rods<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
own can't do as well these the rods the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
own can't do as well these the rods the
ceramic<00:01:40.650> rods<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.130> touch-ups<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.270> know

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
ceramic rods for touch-ups and you know

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.789 
ceramic rods for touch-ups and you know
the<00:01:42.479> final<00:01:42.840> piece<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> puzzle<00:01:43.350> work

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the final piece of the puzzle work

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.130 
the final piece of the puzzle work
really<00:01:44.040> well<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.820> carbide<00:01:45.299> down<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:45.899> isn't

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
really well the carbide down here isn't

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.670 
really well the carbide down here isn't
necessarily<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:46.860> good<00:01:46.939> of<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.390> Smith's<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
necessarily as good of the Smith's but I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.109 
necessarily as good of the Smith's but I
mean<00:01:49.860> it'll<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> job<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.820> better<00:01:51.000> than

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
mean it'll do the job it's better than

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.550 
mean it'll do the job it's better than
nothing<00:01:51.570> particularly<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.320> out<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.500> the

wilderness or something like that but

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.850 
wilderness or something like that but
this<00:01:54.149> one<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:54.960> subpar<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.619> doesn't

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
this one is just very subpar it doesn't

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.289 
this one is just very subpar it doesn't
even<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.369> other<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.820> does<00:01:57.030> either
