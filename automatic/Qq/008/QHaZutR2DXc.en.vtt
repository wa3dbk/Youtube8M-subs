this<00:00:15.240> match<00:00:15.420> before<00:00:15.599> hand<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.470> should<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.010> a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
this match before hand so it should be a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.460 
this match before hand so it should be a
lot<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.460> fun<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.660> opponent<00:00:19.109> leads<00:00:19.260> off

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
lot of fun so the opponent leads off

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.590 
lot of fun so the opponent leads off
with<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.740> politoed<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.880> rick<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
with a politoed and rick is going to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.349 
with a politoed and rick is going to
lead<00:00:21.779> off<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.260> their<00:00:22.500> era<00:00:22.800> fune<00:00:23.130> or<00:00:23.430> winter

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
lead off with their era fune or winter

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.300 
lead off with their era fune or winter
guard<00:00:24.570> goes<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> stun<00:00:25.590> spore<00:00:25.859> i<00:00:25.890> guess

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
guard goes with the stun spore i guess

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.620 
guard goes with the stun spore i guess
most<00:00:26.460> likely<00:00:26.760> thinking<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.240> might<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
most likely thinking this might be a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.300 
most likely thinking this might be a
scarf<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> would<00:00:28.769> be<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> pretty<00:00:29.220> good

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
scarf one so it would be a pretty good

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.420 
scarf one so it would be a pretty good
idea<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.910> get<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> stun<00:00:30.810> spore<00:00:31.140> off<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:32.160> it's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
idea to get the stun spore off but it's

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.819 
idea to get the stun spore off but it's
most<00:00:33.000> likely<00:00:33.059> especially<00:00:33.450> defensive<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.559> as

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
most likely especially defensive one as

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.450 
most likely especially defensive one as
he<00:00:35.340> shows<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.180> Encore<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.350> now<00:00:38.070> he<00:00:38.129> goes<00:00:38.309> with

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
he shows the Encore and now he goes with

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
he shows the Encore and now he goes with
the<00:00:38.520> toxic<00:00:39.090> which<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:40.140> bad<00:00:40.320> news<00:00:40.530> bears

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the toxic which really bad news bears

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.420 
the toxic which really bad news bears

stun spore and confused I mean a
freaking<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> toxic<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.910> kind<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
freaking a toxic so that was kind of a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.189 
freaking a toxic so that was kind of a
bad<00:00:54.870> start<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.590> Rick<00:00:56.039> gotta<00:00:56.430> say<00:00:57.020> but<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
bad start for Rick gotta say but now the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.389 
bad start for Rick gotta say but now the
opponent<00:00:58.829> switches<00:00:59.399> into<00:01:00.530> tornadus<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.949> mean

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
opponent switches into tornadus I mean

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.590 
opponent switches into tornadus I mean
oh<00:01:02.670> god<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.719> hate<00:01:03.960> these<00:01:04.140> genies<00:01:04.470> Honduras<00:01:05.430> and

oh god I hate these genies Honduras and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.539 
oh god I hate these genies Honduras and
Rick<00:01:06.600> still<00:01:06.900> goes<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> stun<00:01:07.650> spore<00:01:08.040> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
Rick still goes with the stun spore so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
Rick still goes with the stun spore so
that<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> great<00:01:09.420> play<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.750> Rick's<00:01:10.140> body

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that was a great play on Rick's body

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.640 
that was a great play on Rick's body
gotta<00:01:10.680> say<00:01:11.210> because<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.420> under<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> really

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
gotta say because at under is a really

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.789 
gotta say because at under is a really
fast<00:01:13.890> poke<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.290> paralyzes<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.650> good

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
fast poke so paralyzes a really good

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.340 
fast poke so paralyzes a really good
thing<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.189> get<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.270> thing<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.900> now<00:01:19.140> Rick

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
thing to get on that thing and now Rick

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.950 
thing to get on that thing and now Rick
switches<00:01:19.830> into<00:01:20.009> Mamoswine<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.659> take<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
switches into Mamoswine to take the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.230 
switches into Mamoswine to take the
t-bolt<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.979> hidden<00:01:23.250> power<00:01:23.430> eyes<00:01:23.670> because

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
t-bolt all the hidden power eyes because

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
t-bolt all the hidden power eyes because
Rick<00:01:24.479> most<00:01:24.720> likely<00:01:25.140> has<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.590> thick<00:01:25.950> fat

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
Rick most likely has the thick fat

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.429 
Rick most likely has the thick fat
ability<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> would<00:01:27.060> think<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
ability I would think and

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.840 
ability I would think and
paralyzed<00:01:30.439> Honduras<00:01:30.920> isn't<00:01:31.520> really<00:01:31.670> too

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
paralyzed Honduras isn't really too

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.730 
paralyzed Honduras isn't really too
helpful<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.810> opponent<00:01:33.229> just<00:01:33.409> leaves<00:01:33.590> that

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
helpful so the opponent just leaves that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.539 
helpful so the opponent just leaves that
thing<00:01:34.009> in<00:01:34.189> and<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:36.590> comes<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.950> politoed<00:01:37.310> again

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
thing in and it comes to politoed again

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.730 
thing in and it comes to politoed again
and<00:01:37.729> rick<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.450> just<00:01:38.720> going<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.930> go<00:01:39.020> with<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.409> e

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
and rick is just going to go with the e

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.539 
and rick is just going to go with the e
cube<00:01:40.189> just<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.180> see<00:01:41.299> how<00:01:41.420> much<00:01:41.600> he<00:01:41.869> can<00:01:41.990> do<00:01:42.549> and

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
cube just to see how much he can do and

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.969 
cube just to see how much he can do and
the<00:01:43.850> opponent<00:01:44.240> goes<00:01:44.360> with<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.570> scald<00:01:44.979> with

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
the opponent goes with the scald with

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.139 
the opponent goes with the scald with
the<00:01:46.070> rain<00:01:46.220> it's<00:01:46.430> probably<00:01:46.820> going<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.060> be

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
the rain it's probably going to be

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.450 
the rain it's probably going to be
enough<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.600> take<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:47.930> thing<00:01:47.990> out<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.710> yes<00:01:49.190> it

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
enough to take this thing out and yes it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.679 
enough to take this thing out and yes it
is<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:50.600> Down<00:01:50.960> Goes<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.259> Mamoswine<00:01:51.710> and

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
is so Down Goes to Mamoswine and

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.660 
is so Down Goes to Mamoswine and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.359 
pawtucket gets a bit of lefties but it's
not<00:01:55.820> too<00:01:55.970> bad<00:01:56.030> for<00:01:56.180> rake<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.590> rake<00:01:57.619> is<00:01:58.159> going

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
not too bad for rake and rake is going

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.930 
not too bad for rake and rake is going
to<00:01:58.460> send<00:01:58.640> out<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.909> arrow<00:01:59.060> foon<00:01:59.299> once<00:01:59.509> again

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
to send out the arrow foon once again

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.719 
to send out the arrow foon once again
not<00:02:01.940> sure<00:02:02.360> why<00:02:02.929> let's<00:02:03.649> see<00:02:03.830> oh<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.340> opponent

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
not sure why let's see oh the opponent

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.279 
not sure why let's see oh the opponent
switches<00:02:05.000> engine<00:02:05.119> nine<00:02:05.479> tail<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:05.899> this<00:02:06.080> is<00:02:06.200> a

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
switches engine nine tail so this is a

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.029 
switches engine nine tail so this is a
like<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.649> duel<00:02:06.979> very<00:02:07.880> better<00:02:08.420> team<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.959> Rick<00:02:09.860> is

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
like a duel very better team and Rick is

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.170 
like a duel very better team and Rick is
just<00:02:10.310> gonna<00:02:10.399> go<00:02:10.580> with<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.910> safe<00:02:11.330> lead<00:02:12.140> seed<00:02:12.440> I

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
just gonna go with the safe lead seed I

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.390 
just gonna go with the safe lead seed I
guess<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.390> opponent<00:02:14.810> doesn't<00:02:15.080> carry<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.830> ice

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
guess the opponent doesn't carry the ice

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.690 
guess the opponent doesn't carry the ice
beam<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.830> guess<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.069> was<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> pretty<00:02:19.580> good

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
beam so I guess that was a pretty good

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.650 
beam so I guess that was a pretty good
play<00:02:19.819> on<00:02:19.970> Rick's<00:02:20.360> pod<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.970> now<00:02:22.970> since<00:02:23.480> rick

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
play on Rick's pod and now since rick

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.690 
play on Rick's pod and now since rick
has<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.049> lead<00:02:24.590> see<00:02:24.769> trick<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.160> just<00:02:25.190> going<00:02:25.610> to

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
has the lead see trick is just going to

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.300 
has the lead see trick is just going to
switch<00:02:25.910> switch<00:02:26.630> out<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.019> go<00:02:27.140> into<00:02:27.350> miltank<00:02:28.069> as

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
switch switch out and go into miltank as

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.270 
switch switch out and go into miltank as
the<00:02:28.519> opponent<00:02:28.970> uses<00:02:29.090> confuse<00:02:29.780> ray<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:31.069> is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
the opponent uses confuse ray this is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.180 
the opponent uses confuse ray this is
really<00:02:31.549> confusing<00:02:32.410> what<00:02:33.410> kind<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.709> nine<00:02:33.950> tails

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
really confusing what kind of nine tails

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.860 
really confusing what kind of nine tails
is<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:37.000> no<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.150> opponent<00:02:38.540> probably

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
is this so no the opponent probably

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.259 
is this so no the opponent probably
switches<00:02:39.290> out<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.829> not<00:02:39.980> wanting<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.459> take<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.830 
moth and Rick is of course going to hit
himself<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:48.170> confusion<00:02:48.739> confusion<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:50.239> that

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
himself in confusion confusion and that

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.330 
himself in confusion confusion and that
will<00:02:51.019> give<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.380> opponent<00:02:51.769> chance<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.100> set<00:02:52.250> up

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
will give the opponent chance to set up

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.880 
will give the opponent chance to set up
a<00:02:52.459> free<00:02:53.150> butterfly<00:02:53.930> dance<00:02:54.140> which<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.650> really

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
a free butterfly dance which is really

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.250 
a free butterfly dance which is really
bad<00:02:55.130> news<00:02:55.340> bears<00:02:55.670> for<00:02:55.880> Rick<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.510> hopefully

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
bad news bears for Rick and hopefully

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.630 
bad news bears for Rick and hopefully
rig<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.590> able<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.980> hit<00:02:58.160> through<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.370> confusion

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
rig is able to hit through the confusion

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.940 
rig is able to hit through the confusion
this<00:02:59.180> turn<00:02:59.510> let's<00:03:00.350> see<00:03:00.620> yes<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.370> Rick<00:03:01.670> oh<00:03:01.930> oh

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.670 
this turn let's see yes and Rick oh oh
that<00:03:03.950> was<00:03:04.220> bad<00:03:04.959> he<00:03:05.959> hits<00:03:06.200> true<00:03:06.410> they're<00:03:06.560> gonna

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
that was bad he hits true they're gonna

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.800 
that was bad he hits true they're gonna
fuse<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.130> then<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.430> better<00:03:07.730> equal<00:03:08.030> select<00:03:08.329> yes

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
fuse and then I better equal select yes

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.540 
fuse and then I better equal select yes
but<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:09.769> he<00:03:09.950> was<00:03:10.070> like<00:03:10.280> no<00:03:10.700> ho

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
but then he was like no ho

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.710 
but then he was like no ho
and<00:03:12.730> now<00:03:13.210> he<00:03:13.270> finally<00:03:13.810> hits<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.320> toxic<00:03:15.160> and

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and now he finally hits the toxic and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.560 
and now he finally hits the toxic and
son<00:03:16.720> boosted<00:03:17.140> plus<00:03:17.380> one<00:03:17.820> firedance<00:03:18.820> does

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
son boosted plus one firedance does

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.520 
son boosted plus one firedance does
quite<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.930> lot<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:22.630> Rick<00:03:23.050> does<00:03:23.290> have

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
quite a lot and the but Rick does have

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.620 
quite a lot and the but Rick does have
to<00:03:23.680> take<00:03:23.860> fat<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.760> seems<00:03:25.000> because<00:03:25.210> he's<00:03:25.420> not

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
to take fat so it seems because he's not

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.930 
to take fat so it seems because he's not
taking<00:03:25.780> too<00:03:26.200> much<00:03:26.440> from<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.920> fiery<00:03:27.580> dance

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
taking too much from the fiery dance

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.450 
taking too much from the fiery dance
since<00:03:28.420> it's<00:03:28.570> technically<00:03:29.050> plus<00:03:29.350> two<00:03:29.590> but

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
since it's technically plus two but

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.250 
since it's technically plus two but
unfortunately<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:31.540> second<00:03:31.930> one<00:03:32.050> will<00:03:32.230> be

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
unfortunately this second one will be

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.900 
unfortunately this second one will be
enough<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:34.380> but<00:03:35.380> Rick<00:03:35.650> does<00:03:35.860> have<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.280> toxic

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
enough so but Rick does have the toxic

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.520 
enough so but Rick does have the toxic
so<00:03:37.120> that's<00:03:37.450> pretty<00:03:37.660> good<00:03:37.810> hopefully<00:03:38.380> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
so that's pretty good hopefully the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.650 
so that's pretty good hopefully the
opponent<00:03:38.920> doesn't<00:03:39.040> have<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.340> rest<00:03:40.060> or<00:03:40.270> anything

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
opponent doesn't have a rest or anything

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.410 
opponent doesn't have a rest or anything
I<00:03:41.250> think<00:03:42.250> he<00:03:42.400> had<00:03:42.550> left<00:03:42.730> his<00:03:42.880> on<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.270> thing

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
I think he had left his on this thing

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.630 
I think he had left his on this thing
anyway<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:43.870> probably<00:03:44.170> not<00:03:44.320> but<00:03:45.130> rick<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.490> going

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
anyway so probably not but rick is going

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.210 
anyway so probably not but rick is going
to<00:03:45.790> send<00:03:45.940> out<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.240> feraligatr<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:47.350> that

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
to send out the feraligatr and that

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.690 
to send out the feraligatr and that
thing<00:03:48.460> gets<00:03:48.670> one<00:03:49.120> hit<00:03:49.360> ko'd<00:03:50.160> his<00:03:51.160> piccolo

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
thing gets one hit ko'd his piccolo

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.550 
thing gets one hit ko'd his piccolo
 with<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.570> green<00:03:52.870> fist<00:03:53.200> but

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
 with the green fist but

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.450 
 with the green fist but
this<00:03:53.770> time<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.520> just<00:03:54.970> not<00:03:55.330> enough<00:03:56.460> and

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
this time it is just not enough and

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.270 
this time it is just not enough and
let's<00:03:57.790> see<00:03:57.940> what<00:03:58.060> okay<00:03:58.750> rick<00:03:59.230> has<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.680> idx<00:04:00.130> of

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
let's see what okay rick has the idx of
