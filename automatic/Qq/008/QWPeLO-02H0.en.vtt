in 2006 okay it great it was downgraded
to<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.450> dwarf<00:02:53.720> planet<00:02:53.870> yeah<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.830> what<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.070> the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
to a dwarf planet yeah and what is the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.320 
to a dwarf planet yeah and what is the
difference<00:02:55.340> between<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.880> planet<00:02:56.210> and<00:02:56.300> a

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
difference between the planet and a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.830 
difference between the planet and a
dwarf<00:02:56.630> planet<00:02:56.690> um<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:58.190> dwarf<00:02:58.910> planet<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.570> like

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
dwarf planet um a dwarf planet is like

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.880 
dwarf planet um a dwarf planet is like
not<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.380> planet<00:03:00.830> it's<00:03:01.220> like<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.610> little<00:03:02.360> dwarf

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.600 

that<00:03:06.890> clears<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.310> up<00:03:07.490> so<00:03:07.880> um<00:03:09.190> which<00:03:10.190> planet

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
that clears it up so um which planet

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.190 
that clears it up so um which planet
rotates<00:03:10.790> on<00:03:11.360> its<00:03:11.420> side

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
rotates on its side

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.060 
rotates on its side
Uranus<00:03:12.830> uh<00:03:13.070> huh<00:03:13.460> and<00:03:13.760> why<00:03:14.450> does<00:03:14.720> Uranus<00:03:15.230> rotate

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
Uranus uh huh and why does Uranus rotate

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.590 
Uranus uh huh and why does Uranus rotate
on<00:03:16.220> its<00:03:16.340> side<00:03:16.550> um<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.850> that's<00:03:20.000> why<00:03:20.300> I<00:03:20.330> might

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
on its side um and that's why I might

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.890 
on its side um and that's why I might
have<00:03:20.840> tipped<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.560> over<00:03:21.640> okay<00:03:22.780> that'll<00:03:23.780> happen

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
have tipped it over okay that'll happen

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.930 
have tipped it over okay that'll happen
to<00:03:24.140> Uranus<00:03:24.470> sometimes<00:03:25.810> why<00:03:26.810> ya<00:03:27.260> know<00:03:27.830> I'm<00:03:28.670> less

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
to Uranus sometimes why ya know I'm less

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.610 
to Uranus sometimes why ya know I'm less
mature<00:03:29.180> than<00:03:29.390> him<00:03:29.720> what<00:03:31.990> what<00:03:32.990> moons<00:03:33.320> did
