long you wait what you get inside there

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.890 
long you wait what you get inside there
when<00:08:03.730> you're<00:08:03.850> in<00:08:03.940> the<00:08:04.030> secondary<00:08:04.510> cube<00:08:04.780> back

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:04.900

here
that's<00:08:06.280> another<00:08:06.520> 15<00:08:06.970> minutes<00:08:07.150> at<00:08:07.390> least

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:07.570 
that's another 15 minutes at least

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.590 
that's another 15 minutes at least
that's<00:08:08.080> that's<00:08:08.440> 40<00:08:08.740> minutes<00:08:09.010> of<00:08:09.130> it<00:08:09.510> but<00:08:10.510> the

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:10.600 
that's that's 40 minutes of it but the

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.820 
that's that's 40 minutes of it but the
good<00:08:10.780> thing<00:08:10.810> is<00:08:10.960> we<00:08:11.290> don't<00:08:11.380> have<00:08:11.470> to<00:08:11.590> go<00:08:11.710> in

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:11.830 
good thing is we don't have to go in

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.950 
good thing is we don't have to go in
there
