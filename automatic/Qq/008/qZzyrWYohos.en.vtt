you<00:00:06.109> can<00:00:06.259> see<00:00:06.410> I've<00:00:06.559> got<00:00:06.740> a<00:00:06.799> steel<00:00:07.660> bar<00:00:08.660> here<00:00:09.049> in

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
you can see I've got a steel bar here in

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.320 
you can see I've got a steel bar here in
the<00:00:09.410> Chuck<00:00:09.889> with<00:00:10.459> some<00:00:10.610> black<00:00:10.789> tape<00:00:11.000> wrapped

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
the Chuck with some black tape wrapped

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.810 
the Chuck with some black tape wrapped
around<00:00:11.510> it<00:00:11.809> and<00:00:12.230> one<00:00:12.860> of<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:13.070> Mac<00:00:13.549> tech

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
around it and one of the Mac tech

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.679 
around it and one of the Mac tech
reflective<00:00:14.450> patches<00:00:14.929> on<00:00:15.110> it<00:00:16.300> and<00:00:17.300> see<00:00:17.539> if<00:00:17.599> I

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
reflective patches on it and see if I

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.900 
reflective patches on it and see if I
can<00:00:17.900> zoom<00:00:20.320> so<00:00:21.320> for<00:00:21.949> this<00:00:22.070> demonstration<00:00:22.310> I

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
can zoom so for this demonstration I

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.519 
can zoom so for this demonstration I
just<00:00:22.939> went<00:00:23.300> ahead<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:23.630> put<00:00:23.779> one<00:00:23.810> patch<00:00:24.230> on

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
just went ahead and put one patch on

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.950 
just went ahead and put one patch on
there<00:00:24.769> which<00:00:25.429> limits<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.000> lowest<00:00:26.300> rpm<00:00:26.480> that

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
there which limits the lowest rpm that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:35.890 
there which limits the lowest rpm that
we<00:00:27.080> can<00:00:27.320> display<00:00:33.550> so<00:00:34.550> we've<00:00:35.300> got<00:00:35.480> two<00:00:35.690> Mac

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
we can display so we've got two Mac

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.640 
we can display so we've got two Mac
techs<00:00:36.199> here

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
techs here

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.710 
techs here
one<00:00:37.190> of<00:00:37.309> them's<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.940> one<00:00:38.120> that's<00:00:38.330> installed

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
one of them's the one that's installed

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.079 
one of them's the one that's installed
in<00:00:38.870> my<00:00:38.989> lathe<00:00:39.229> and<00:00:39.470> then<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.799> one<00:00:40.610> on<00:00:40.640> top<00:00:41.030> is

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
in my lathe and then the one on top is

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.840 
in my lathe and then the one on top is
the<00:00:41.299> customers<00:00:42.049> Mac<00:00:42.500> Jack<00:00:42.799> he<00:00:43.489> was<00:00:43.519> having

problems with it having an erotic

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.939 
problems with it having an erotic
display<00:00:46.930> so<00:00:47.930> we've<00:00:48.110> got<00:00:48.290> a<00:00:48.320> little<00:00:48.589> filter

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
display so we've got a little filter

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.640 
display so we've got a little filter
here<00:00:49.570> that<00:00:50.570> we've<00:00:50.720> put<00:00:50.900> on<00:00:51.049> it<00:00:51.229> this<00:00:51.470> is<00:00:51.530> a

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
here that we've put on it this is a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.799 
here that we've put on it this is a
filter<00:00:51.949> that<00:00:52.250> we<00:00:52.369> sell<00:00:52.610> on<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.940> Mac<00:00:53.540> tech

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
filter that we sell on the Mac tech

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.939 
filter that we sell on the Mac tech
website<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:55.180> he<00:00:56.180> added<00:00:56.330> a<00:00:56.949> electrolytic

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
website and he added a electrolytic

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.619 
website and he added a electrolytic
capacitor<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.640> in<00:00:58.729> addition<00:00:59.119> to<00:00:59.299> the<00:00:59.390> two

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
capacitor and in addition to the two

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.630 
capacitor and in addition to the two
ceramic<00:01:00.229> ones<00:01:00.439> I'm<00:01:01.100> not<00:01:01.159> sure<00:01:01.489> if<00:01:01.580> that

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
ceramic ones I'm not sure if that

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.719 
ceramic ones I'm not sure if that
actually<00:01:01.939> made<00:01:02.239> any<00:01:02.390> difference<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:04.489> then

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
actually made any difference and then

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.480 
actually made any difference and then
the<00:01:04.909> wire<00:01:05.540> comes<00:01:05.900> down<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.799> a<00:01:06.830> plug<00:01:08.170> into<00:01:09.490> a

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
the wire comes down to a plug into a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.999 
the wire comes down to a plug into a
transformer<00:01:11.359> that's<00:01:12.229> plugged<00:01:12.500> into<00:01:12.679> the<00:01:12.829> same

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
transformer that's plugged into the same

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.849 
transformer that's plugged into the same
power<00:01:13.310> strip<00:01:13.729> that<00:01:14.000> my<00:01:14.649> variable<00:01:15.649> frequency

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
power strip that my variable frequency

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.690 
power strip that my variable frequency
drive<00:01:16.490> is<00:01:17.149> plugged<00:01:17.420> into<00:01:17.859> this<00:01:18.859> gray<00:01:19.100> box<00:01:19.369> down

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
drive is plugged into this gray box down

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.010 
drive is plugged into this gray box down
here<00:01:19.909> has<00:01:19.999> got<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.329> variable<00:01:20.840> frequency

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
here has got the variable frequency

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.200 
here has got the variable frequency
drive<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.219> it's<00:01:22.429> plugged<00:01:22.700> right<00:01:22.789> into<00:01:22.909> this

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
drive and it's plugged right into this

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.779 
drive and it's plugged right into this
strip<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:24.469> then<00:01:24.619> running<00:01:24.859> it<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:25.219> Mac<00:01:25.520> tap

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
strip and then running it in the Mac tap

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.209 
strip and then running it in the Mac tap
Mac<00:01:26.299> tech<00:01:26.570> but<00:01:27.229> because<00:01:27.469> we<00:01:27.590> got<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.859> filter

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
Mac tech but because we got the filter

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.599 
Mac tech but because we got the filter
on<00:01:28.340> there<00:01:28.579> it<00:01:28.939> should<00:01:29.119> be<00:01:29.270> okay<00:01:30.310> so<00:01:31.310> let's<00:01:31.490> go

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
on there it should be okay so let's go

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.969 
on there it should be okay so let's go
ahead<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:31.880> start<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.659> lathe<00:01:32.810> up<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:36.619> can<00:01:36.799> see

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
ahead and start the lathe up you can see

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.870 
ahead and start the lathe up you can see
I've<00:01:37.130> got<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.369> turning

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I've got it turning

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.719 
I've got it turning
pretty<00:01:39.540> slow<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.770> fact<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.250> turning<00:01:41.640> at

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
pretty slow here in fact it's turning at

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.899 
pretty slow here in fact it's turning at
70<00:01:42.119> rpm<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:43.250> you'll<00:01:44.250> notice<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.700> two

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
70 rpm and you'll notice the two

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.899 
70 rpm and you'll notice the two
displays<00:01:45.530> are<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:46.979> much<00:01:47.189> displaying<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
displays are pretty much displaying the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.240 
displays are pretty much displaying the
same<00:01:47.970> thing<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.159> bottom<00:01:50.520> when<00:01:50.700> there<00:01:50.850> is

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
same thing that the bottom when there is

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.310 
same thing that the bottom when there is
alternating<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.340> little<00:01:53.549> bit<00:01:53.700> between<00:01:54.000> 69<00:01:54.750> 70

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
alternating a little bit between 69 70

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.950 
alternating a little bit between 69 70
and<00:01:55.470> 71<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:57.060> reason<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.539> is<00:01:57.780> my

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and 71 and the reason for that is my

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.169 
and 71 and the reason for that is my
layout<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.740> my<00:01:58.829> patches<00:01:59.130> wasn't<00:01:59.670> very<00:01:59.789> good<00:02:00.030> on

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
layout of my patches wasn't very good on

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.120 
layout of my patches wasn't very good on
that<00:02:00.390> one<00:02:00.539> but<00:02:01.079> you'll<00:02:01.259> notice<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.649> top<00:02:01.829> one

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that one but you'll notice the top one

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.660 
that one but you'll notice the top one
is<00:02:02.310> pretty<00:02:02.759> steady<00:02:03.829> but<00:02:04.829> still<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
is pretty steady but still this is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
is pretty steady but still this is
within<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.240> hour<00:02:06.270> p.m.<00:02:06.689> which<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.079> plus<00:02:07.829> or

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
within one hour p.m. which is plus or

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.669 
within one hour p.m. which is plus or
minus<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.429> rpm<00:02:08.849> which<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.030> what<00:02:09.269> I<00:02:09.300> am

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
minus one rpm which is what I am

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.130 
minus one rpm which is what I am
advertised<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.979> Mac<00:02:11.160> tach

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
advertised for the Mac tach

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.300 
advertised for the Mac tach
so<00:02:13.140> let's<00:02:13.290> go<00:02:13.410> ahead<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.650> start<00:02:13.860> speeding

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
so let's go ahead and start speeding

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.410 
so let's go ahead and start speeding
this<00:02:14.430> up

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.720 

okay<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.580> we're<00:02:22.760> at<00:02:22.910> about<00:02:23.050> 150<00:02:24.069> 8:59<00:02:25.069> rpms

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
okay so we're at about 150 8:59 rpms

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.830 
okay so we're at about 150 8:59 rpms
right<00:02:26.000> there<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.390> can<00:02:26.510> see<00:02:26.690> both

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
right there and you can see both

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.720 
right there and you can see both
displays<00:02:27.470> are<00:02:27.740> pretty<00:02:28.670> much<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.090> same<00:02:30.730> so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
displays are pretty much the same so

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.339 
displays are pretty much the same so
I'll<00:02:31.819> go<00:02:31.940> ahead<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.240> run<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.540> up

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
I'll go ahead and run this up

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:42.100 
I'll go ahead and run this up
I'll<00:02:34.739> run<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:34.980> up<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.189> high-speed<00:02:35.489> here

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.660 

so<00:02:42.620> there<00:02:42.800> we<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:44.050> 657<00:02:45.050> RPM<00:02:45.650> or<00:02:45.890> 658

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
so there we have 657 RPM or 658

00:02:46.670 --> 00:03:03.309 
so there we have 657 RPM or 658
depending<00:02:47.180> which<00:02:47.300> display<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.810> look<00:02:48.110> at

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.050 

here's<00:03:04.319> our<00:03:04.530> second<00:03:05.099> setup<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.610> milling

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
here's our second setup a milling

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.020 
here's our second setup a milling
machine<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.980> what<00:03:08.220> I've<00:03:08.370> done<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.849> I've<00:03:09.000> taken

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
machine and what I've done is I've taken

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.820 
machine and what I've done is I've taken
the<00:03:09.450> same<00:03:11.510> steel<00:03:12.510> bar<00:03:12.780> with<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> tape<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:13.680> it

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
the same steel bar with the tape on it

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.449 
the same steel bar with the tape on it
and<00:03:14.430> put<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.390> collet<00:03:15.780> here<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.459> then

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
and put it in a collet here and then

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.220 
and put it in a collet here and then
I've<00:03:17.580> mounted<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.000> sensor<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:19.019> vise

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
I've mounted the sensor in a vise

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.610 
I've mounted the sensor in a vise
temporarily<00:03:19.970> with<00:03:20.970> approximately<00:03:21.659> 0.15

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
temporarily with approximately 0.15

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.390 
temporarily with approximately 0.15
inches<00:03:23.159> between<00:03:23.909> the<00:03:24.299> reflector<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.400> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
inches between the reflector and the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.940 
inches between the reflector and the
sensor<00:03:26.879> I<00:03:27.120> only<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:28.049> one<00:03:28.200> reflector<00:03:28.769> on

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
sensor I only have one reflector on

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.350 
sensor I only have one reflector on
there<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.280> we'll<00:03:32.430> go<00:03:32.549> ahead<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.819> turn<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.120> on

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
there so we'll go ahead and turn this on

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.770 
there so we'll go ahead and turn this on
and<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.109> see<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:37.410> turning<00:03:37.709> very<00:03:38.099> slowly

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
and you can see it's turning very slowly

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:47.880 
and you can see it's turning very slowly
and<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:39.900> fact<00:03:40.109> it's<00:03:41.450> sixty-four<00:03:42.450> rpms

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
does the same

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.250 
does the same
I'll<00:03:55.330> leave<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.830> rpm<00:03:56.830> setting<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.370> same<00:03:58.260> so

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
I'll leave the rpm setting the same so

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.520 
I'll leave the rpm setting the same so
here<00:03:59.440> we<00:03:59.590> are<00:03:59.620> again<00:03:59.800> same<00:04:00.580> setup<00:04:01.530> single

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
here we are again same setup single

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.640 
here we are again same setup single
patch<00:04:03.390> IR<00:04:04.390> sensor<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:06.430> time<00:04:06.700> we<00:04:06.880> have<00:04:07.090> a

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
patch IR sensor this time we have a

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.860 
patch IR sensor this time we have a
filter<00:04:08.650> on<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.100> setup<00:04:09.730> here<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.750> don't

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
filter on this setup here but I don't

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.449 
filter on this setup here but I don't
really<00:04:11.440> think<00:04:11.590> it's<00:04:11.800> making<00:04:12.130> any<00:04:12.250> difference

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
really think it's making any difference

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.400 
really think it's making any difference
because<00:04:13.000> on<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.270> particular<00:04:13.450> machine<00:04:14.020> it

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
because on this particular machine it

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.140 
because on this particular machine it
doesn't<00:04:14.620> seem<00:04:14.920> like<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.220> VFD<00:04:15.640> noise<00:04:15.880> is

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
doesn't seem like the VFD noise is

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.390 
doesn't seem like the VFD noise is
making<00:04:16.450> much<00:04:16.600> difference<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.070> can<00:04:18.220> see

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
making much difference and you can see

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.870 
making much difference and you can see
again<00:04:18.640> we<00:04:18.820> have<00:04:18.940> 64<00:04:19.570> rpms<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:21.400> while<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:21.609> hold

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
again we have 64 rpms so while I hold

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.580 
again we have 64 rpms so while I hold
the<00:04:22.030> camera<00:04:22.450> on<00:04:22.570> here<00:04:22.900> I'll<00:04:23.080> go<00:04:23.320> ahead<00:04:23.380> and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
the camera on here I'll go ahead and

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:35.080 
the camera on here I'll go ahead and
turn<00:04:23.680> this<00:04:23.890> up

00:04:58.859 --> 00:04:58.869 
so you can see it's going about plus or

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:02.320 
so you can see it's going about plus or
