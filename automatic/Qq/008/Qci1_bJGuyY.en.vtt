00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.500
 hello dear friends but communication 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.880
 alexandra is brewed today 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.090
 I want to tell you a little more about 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.469
 modifications gave but who knows 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.809
 percent volume 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 first customs services which both 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.090
 but those who do not know necessarily obediently 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.470
 because it is very useful and necessary 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.109
 modifier how can he have us 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.550
 apply but firstly 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.279
 Consider an example of course the arbitrator 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.130
 Turks 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.710
 prefecture simulation 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.700
 unfortunately and difficult there any 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.160
 super object 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.700
 we can say but imagine that 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.870
 to students 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.319
 ordinary house 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.430
 here he created 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.430
 see what we got rub 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.230
 and so firstly with the help of our 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.380
 modifier 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.620
 interest on the line roughly speaking and 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.860
 modification 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.870
 we can in many ways suppose to do 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.570
 for example changing for home 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.680
 but first of all of course let's 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.620
 let's start so let's start with the fact that 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.020
 percentage first we can do 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.470
 percent floor and ceiling is the simplest thing 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.820
 can make spaces 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.650
 apply multiplier 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.730
 failure 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.689
 moreover that we have like this 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.640
 so ready 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.170
 brutally great 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.000
 for example, here 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.190
 ready 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.240
 put aside the experience side I copy 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.440
 simply 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.950
 here and see how you can use this 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.370
 modifiers still do 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.270
 virginity 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.270
 for this one more week 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 uah 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.229
 now her 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.020
 hastily 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 prim 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.700
 Now 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 we make one line of two lines 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.649
 so that 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.419
 here we have religion one inside second 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.519
 and note that very 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.969
 it is important that these lines do not cross each other 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:17.729
 friend 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.749
 they should be 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.969
 not intersected 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.249
 and now pumping macbook another older from 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.599
 these two lines one single discipline 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.510
 now when we apply to her 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.939
 sent 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.369
 boat driver 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.289
 the entrance turns out we have such a final 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.289
 can it carefully any height 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
 Here is such a painstaking 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.349
 raise the floor 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.779
 please we don't have enough 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:50.990
 if we want 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.469
 can do 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.469
 ceiling 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.899
 and get inside 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:01.299
 like that 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.199
 But that is not all 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.609
 among other things with the help of this 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.029
 modifier 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.349
 quite a long time to do 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.109
 preachers 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.549
 decorations such as 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:14.759
 forged 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.099
 packaging demand some sort of fence 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.499
 eg 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.389
 if I am very fast at the center of the curve 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.409
 do and attention is drawn to you 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:24.549
 then yourself 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.569
 practice figure it out 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.839
 can be done carefully and 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.509
 more correctly 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.969
 i just do it 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.969
 anyhow 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.719
 if the moment is also aware that 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.079
 I'll do it yes 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.189
 I note that genius is not 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.639
 intersect 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.499
 no way because 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.279
 if in any place we have 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:04.279
 cross direction 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.759
 modifier 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.699
 percentage and maybe they will be used 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.879
 i.e 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.780
 we will not succeed volumetric 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.780
 and we will succeed 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:23.779
 Well, that's something the curve of the countries received from 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.829
 funny i hope that no sign in 

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:28.029
 London 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:31.479
 his experience in this case me 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.300
 first horrifying 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.330
 but here we apply to this rule 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.680
 did not roll we got volumetric 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.680
 such a funny figure 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.959
 taking up sales toyota and whip up 

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:53.289
 so itâ€™s crooked if you have a drawing 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.449
 any 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.330
 here's a fence elizabove 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.090
 either for satire adobe reader 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.800
 can the court be completely bold and calm 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.189
 will not apply 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:05.469
 tons per year 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.129
 use this indicator output gave 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.080
 only a few years 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.080
 will turn out 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.870
 at this venue r 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.230
 pipeline to next busy
