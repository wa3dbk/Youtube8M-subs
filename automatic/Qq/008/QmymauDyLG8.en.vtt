00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
these types of earphones bother me

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.230 
these types of earphones bother me
because<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.520> glasses<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
because like when my glasses are on the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.600 
because like when my glasses are on the
side<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> my<00:01:39.540> ear<00:01:39.720> these<00:01:40.259> will<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> pinch<00:01:41.400> up

side of my ear these will be a pinch up
against<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.360> not<00:01:42.570> very

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
against it so it's really not very

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.480 
against it so it's really not very
comfortable<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.770> these<00:01:43.890> actually<00:01:44.310> found

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
comfortable but for these actually found

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.830 
comfortable but for these actually found

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
yourselves I don't think you'll have an

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.660 
yourselves I don't think you'll have an
issue<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.320> all<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.649> these<00:01:59.280> are<00:01:59.430> very

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
issue with that at all so these are very

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.429 
issue with that at all so these are very
very<00:02:00.210> tough<00:02:00.509> everywhere<00:02:00.869> bus<00:02:01.079> these<00:02:01.320> are

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
very tough everywhere bus these are

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.020 
very tough everywhere bus these are
actually<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> tested<00:02:02.219> against<00:02:02.490> US<00:02:02.670> military

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
actually a tested against US military

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.929 
actually a tested against US military
standards<00:02:03.479> against<00:02:04.259> rain<00:02:04.740> dust

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
standards against rain dust

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.910 
standards against rain dust
shock<00:02:06.570> resistance<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.229> if<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.500> drop<00:02:07.740> these

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
shock resistance so if you drop these

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.290 
shock resistance so if you drop these
they're<00:02:08.310> they're<00:02:08.580> pretty<00:02:08.610> lightweight<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.270> I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
they're they're pretty lightweight so I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.490 
they're they're pretty lightweight so I
don't<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:09.629> anything<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:09.989> gonna<00:02:10.050> happen<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
don't think anything is gonna happen to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.199 
don't think anything is gonna happen to
them<00:02:10.619> if<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.770> do<00:02:10.979> you're<00:02:11.459> sweating<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.940> lot<00:02:12.090> if

talktime three hours on music time

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.890 
talktime three hours on music time
and<00:04:25.520> if<00:04:25.699> you<00:04:25.759> just<00:04:25.880> let<00:04:26.060> them<00:04:26.240> sit<00:04:26.419> by<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:26.780> not

and if you just let them sit by and not

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.900 
and if you just let them sit by and not
using<00:04:27.169> them<00:04:27.259> in<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.410> last<00:04:27.620> four<00:04:28.009> days<00:04:28.250> on

using them in the last four days on

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.790 
using them in the last four days on
standby<00:04:29.120> time<00:04:29.570> so<00:04:30.110> it's<00:04:30.320> that's<00:04:30.500> actually

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
standby time so it's that's actually

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.629 
standby time so it's that's actually
pretty<00:04:30.949> impressive<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:31.310> only<00:04:31.400> takes<00:04:31.580> about

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
pretty impressive it only takes about

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.820 
pretty impressive it only takes about
two<00:04:31.880> hours<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.210> fully<00:04:32.960> charge<00:04:33.139> them<00:04:33.530> up<00:04:33.620> once

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
two hours to fully charge them up once

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.320 
two hours to fully charge them up once
they're<00:04:33.949> completely<00:04:34.280> drained<00:04:34.639> so<00:04:34.820> that's

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
they're completely drained so that's

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.390 
they're completely drained so that's

those to the things now these retail for
$99<00:05:01.940> which<00:05:02.090> i<00:05:02.180> think<00:05:02.240> is<00:05:02.510> you<00:05:02.780> know<00:05:02.840> that's

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
$99 which i think is you know that's

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.240 
$99 which i think is you know that's
pretty<00:05:03.260> average<00:05:03.410> for<00:05:03.530> any<00:05:03.770> kind<00:05:03.919> of<00:05:03.979> Bluetooth
