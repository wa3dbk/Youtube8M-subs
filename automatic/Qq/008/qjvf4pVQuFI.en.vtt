I'm bringing you a weapon review of the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.480 
I'm bringing you a weapon review of the
a91<00:00:20.660> carbine<00:00:21.349> we're<00:00:21.949> going<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.130> talk<00:00:22.250> a<00:00:22.279> little

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
a91 carbine we're going to talk a little

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.890 
a91 carbine we're going to talk a little
bit<00:00:22.609> about<00:00:23.150> what<00:00:23.330> I<00:00:23.359> think<00:00:23.420> are<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:23.720> best

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
bit about what I think are the best

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.470 
bit about what I think are the best
attachments<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.679> use<00:00:24.859> with<00:00:25.039> it<00:00:25.099> and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
attachments to use with it and

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.099 
attachments to use with it and
ultimately<00:00:26.480> I'm<00:00:26.630> going<00:00:26.779> to<00:00:26.839> give<00:00:26.929> you<00:00:26.990> my

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
ultimately I'm going to give you my

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.529 
ultimately I'm going to give you my
verdict<00:00:27.679> as<00:00:27.859> to<00:00:28.279> whether<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:28.669> think<00:00:28.789> it<00:00:29.269> is<00:00:29.509> a

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
verdict as to whether I think it is a

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.230 
verdict as to whether I think it is a
good<00:00:29.929> weapon<00:00:30.499> or<00:00:30.589> not<00:00:30.759> so<00:00:31.759> without<00:00:31.999> further

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
good weapon or not so without further

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.450 
good weapon or not so without further
ado<00:00:32.599> let's<00:00:33.260> have<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.560> look<00:00:33.829> at<00:00:34.010> some<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.400> the

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
ado let's have a look at some of the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.630 
ado let's have a look at some of the
basic<00:00:34.940> statistics<00:00:35.180> for<00:00:35.990> this<00:00:36.110> weapon<00:00:36.640> the

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
basic statistics for this weapon the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.390 
basic statistics for this weapon the
recoil<00:00:38.180> on<00:00:38.420> this<00:00:38.720> weapon<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.440> high<00:00:39.680> there's<00:00:40.340> no

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
recoil on this weapon is high there's no

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.610 
recoil on this weapon is high there's no
doubt<00:00:40.760> about<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.690> problem<00:00:42.140> with<00:00:42.590> that

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
doubt about it and the problem with that

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.710 
doubt about it and the problem with that
recoil<00:00:43.220> is<00:00:43.430> it's<00:00:43.640> not<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.060> vertical<00:00:44.540> recoil

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
recoil is it's not the vertical recoil

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.750 
recoil is it's not the vertical recoil
that's<00:00:45.380> a<00:00:45.500> bit<00:00:45.650> easier<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.010> control<00:00:46.160> at<00:00:46.550> at

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
that's a bit easier to control at at

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.360 
that's a bit easier to control at at
firing<00:00:47.300> or<00:00:47.720> mouse<00:00:48.020> control<00:00:48.590> depending<00:00:49.280> on

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
firing or mouse control depending on

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.190 
firing or mouse control depending on
whether<00:00:49.610> or<00:00:49.700> not<00:00:49.910> you<00:00:50.060> play<00:00:50.270> on<00:00:50.390> console<00:00:50.840> pc

this<00:00:51.980> recoil<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:53.000> side<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.600> side<00:00:53.840> recoil<00:00:54.200> and

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
this recoil is side to side recoil and

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.490 
this recoil is side to side recoil and
it<00:00:55.040> pulls<00:00:55.310> five<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.240> the<00:00:56.300> left<00:00:56.390> five<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.470> the

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
it pulls five to the left five to the

right

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.950 
right
it's<00:00:58.130> the<00:00:58.220> highest<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.700> any<00:00:58.820> carbine<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.600> to

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
it's the highest of any carbine and to

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.140 
it's the highest of any carbine and to
put<00:01:00.110> it<00:01:00.200> into<00:01:00.320> perspective<00:01:00.800> for<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.700> it's

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
put it into perspective for you it's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.840 
put it into perspective for you it's
higher<00:01:02.540> than<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.050> AEK<00:01:03.710> assault<00:01:04.189> rifle<00:01:04.699> and

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
higher than the AEK assault rifle and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.360 
higher than the AEK assault rifle and
it's<00:01:05.449> basically<00:01:05.960> on<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.229> same<00:01:06.530> level<00:01:06.980> that's

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
it's basically on the same level that's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.520 
it's basically on the same level that's
the<00:01:07.490> famous<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:08.150> problem<00:01:08.900> with<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.080> side<00:01:09.320> to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the famous the problem with this side to

the famous the problem with this side to
side<00:01:09.770> recoil<00:01:10.190> is<00:01:10.670> it's<00:01:11.090> kind<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.660> random<00:01:11.870> it's

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
side recoil is it's kind of random it's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.160 
side recoil is it's kind of random it's
a<00:01:12.620> very<00:01:13.040> very<00:01:13.520> bloody<00:01:13.820> hard<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.540> control<00:01:14.870> and

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
a very very bloody hard to control and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.340 
a very very bloody hard to control and
it's<00:01:15.710> not<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.070> plus<00:01:16.370> point<00:01:16.700> for<00:01:17.000> this<00:01:17.540> carbine

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
it's not a plus point for this carbine

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.710 
it's not a plus point for this carbine

recoil like this now the quick reload is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.210 
recoil like this now the quick reload is
2.7<00:01:25.850> seconds<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.930> put<00:01:27.110> into<00:01:27.320> perspective<00:01:27.560> it's

2.7 seconds to put into perspective it's

2.7 seconds to put into perspective it's
the<00:01:28.310> second<00:01:28.970> highest<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.630> all<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.409> carbines

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
the second highest of all the carbines

the second highest of all the carbines
the<00:01:31.640> long<00:01:31.880> reload<00:01:32.300> is<00:01:32.540> 3.3<00:01:33.170> seconds<00:01:33.800> which<00:01:34.010> is

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
the long reload is 3.3 seconds which is

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.899 
the long reload is 3.3 seconds which is
gargantuan<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:37.100> carbine<00:01:37.580> sorry

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
gargantuan this is this carbine sorry

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.469 
gargantuan this is this carbine sorry
takes<00:01:38.510> a<00:01:38.659> bloody<00:01:39.140> age<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:40.130> reload<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.360> is

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
takes a bloody age to reload and that is

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.580 
takes a bloody age to reload and that is
another<00:01:41.990> big<00:01:42.590> downside<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.790> this<00:01:43.970> weapon<00:01:44.590> it

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
another big downside to this weapon it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.370 
another big downside to this weapon it
has<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.220> standard<00:01:46.549> max<00:01:47.090> damage<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:48.049> most

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
has the standard max damage but most

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.560 
has the standard max damage but most
carbines<00:01:49.159> have<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.900> 25<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:52.010> nice<00:01:52.490> high<00:01:53.060> rate

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
carbines have of 25 and a nice high rate

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.490 
carbines have of 25 and a nice high rate
fire<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.320> 800<00:01:55.190> rounds<00:01:55.580> per<00:01:55.640> minute<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:57.140> all<00:01:57.290> of

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
fire of 800 rounds per minute so all of

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.430 
fire of 800 rounds per minute so all of
these<00:01:57.620> facts<00:01:58.159> put<00:01:58.490> together<00:01:58.700> for<00:01:59.600> me<00:01:59.810> make

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
these facts put together for me make

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.399 
these facts put together for me make
this<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.920> pretty<00:02:01.369> worthless<00:02:02.119> carbine<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:02.990> use

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
this a pretty worthless carbine to use

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.260 
this a pretty worthless carbine to use
it's<00:02:03.979> not<00:02:04.250> something<00:02:04.670> I'd<00:02:04.760> really<00:02:05.150> enjoy

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
it's not something I'd really enjoy

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.559 
it's not something I'd really enjoy
using<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.320> given<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.220> choice<00:02:07.400> there<00:02:08.030> are<00:02:08.209> so

using and given the choice there are so
many<00:02:08.840> better<00:02:09.170> options<00:02:09.319> than<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.129> a91<00:02:10.819> I<00:02:11.209> would

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:11.749 
many better options than the a91 I would

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.760 
many better options than the a91 I would

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
a night you want to go but I cannot say

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.410 
a night you want to go but I cannot say
it's<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.750> decent<00:02:34.260> weapon<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.310> only<00:02:35.340> thing<00:02:36.239> I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
it's a decent weapon the only thing I

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.140 
it's a decent weapon the only thing I
can<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.860> carbine<00:02:38.400> has<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.970> for

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
can see that this carbine has going for

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.710 
can see that this carbine has going for
it<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.830> hipfire<00:02:41.280> accuracy<00:02:41.640> which<00:02:42.239> is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
it is the hipfire accuracy which is

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.360 
it is the hipfire accuracy which is
basically<00:02:43.140> one<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.650> best<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.190> game

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
basically one of the best in the game

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.870 
basically one of the best in the game
certainly<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.480> best<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.080> carbines<00:02:46.530> in

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
certainly the best of the carbines in

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.660 
certainly the best of the carbines in
conjunction<00:02:47.880> with<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.510> type<00:02:48.780> 95<00:02:49.530> B<00:02:49.890> now

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
conjunction with the type 95 B now

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.479 
conjunction with the type 95 B now
that's<00:02:51.120> all<00:02:51.300> well<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.690> good<00:02:51.920> hipfire<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.190> for

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
that's all well and good hipfire is for

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.090 
that's all well and good hipfire is for
close<00:02:53.700> range<00:02:54.050> situations<00:02:55.050> right<00:02:55.260> yeah

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
close range situations right yeah

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.710

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
they're spraying prey have a bit of

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.750 
they're spraying prey have a bit of
hipfire<00:02:58.170> with<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> laser<00:02:58.739> sight<00:02:59.130> but<00:02:59.640> then

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
hipfire with the laser sight but then

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.240 
hipfire with the laser sight but then
you've<00:02:59.940> got<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> free<00:03:00.420> Plus<00:03:00.720> second<00:03:01.230> reload<00:03:01.650> you

those supporters and you know I just
cannot<00:03:07.260> recommend<00:03:07.800> this<00:03:08.420> weapon<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:09.600> any

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
cannot recommend this weapon for any

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.860 
cannot recommend this weapon for any
situation<00:03:10.130> it's<00:03:11.130> not<00:03:11.280> good<00:03:11.730> at<00:03:11.850> range<00:03:12.120> it's

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
situation it's not good at range it's

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.020 
situation it's not good at range it's
okay<00:03:13.620> it's<00:03:13.769> got<00:03:13.920> good<00:03:14.069> hipfire<00:03:14.580> for<00:03:14.819> close

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
okay it's got good hipfire for close

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.180 
okay it's got good hipfire for close
range<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.319> be<00:03:16.440> honest<00:03:16.680> with<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.980> I'd

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
range but to be honest with you I'd

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.180 
range but to be honest with you I'd
rather<00:03:17.430> use<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.880> acw-r<00:03:18.620> because<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.950> quick

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
rather use the acw-r because the quick

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.330 
rather use the acw-r because the quick
reload<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.959> far<00:03:22.410> superior<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.130> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
reload of that is so far superior to the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.569 
reload of that is so far superior to the
a91<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.360> unbelievable<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.440> at<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.370> end<00:03:26.519> of

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
a91 it's unbelievable and at the end of

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.550 
a91 it's unbelievable and at the end of
the<00:03:26.670> day<00:03:26.820> 800<00:03:27.540> rounds<00:03:27.840> per<00:03:27.989> minute<00:03:28.110> it's<00:03:28.410> on

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the day 800 rounds per minute it's on

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.710 
the day 800 rounds per minute it's on
the<00:03:28.709> high<00:03:28.920> side<00:03:29.310> but<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.150> not<00:03:30.480> like

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the high side but it's not like

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.240 
the high side but it's not like
incredibly<00:03:31.680> fast

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
incredibly fast

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.310 
incredibly fast
there<00:03:32.489> are<00:03:32.610> carbines<00:03:33.120> with<00:03:33.630> much<00:03:33.870> higher

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
there are carbines with much higher

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.890 
there are carbines with much higher
rates<00:03:34.769> of<00:03:35.010> fire<00:03:35.280> than<00:03:35.670> 800<00:03:36.269> rounds<00:03:36.570> per<00:03:36.750> minute

if you want a close-quarters carbine for

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.870 
if you want a close-quarters carbine for
example<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.890> acw-r

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880

I<00:03:51.390> just<00:03:51.750> can't<00:03:52.079> ever<00:03:52.320> see<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.829> situation<00:03:53.670> where

anything I just wouldn't see a reason to

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.900 
anything I just wouldn't see a reason to
use<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.780> other<00:04:04.230> than<00:04:04.769> basically<00:04:05.220> just<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.670> rank

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
use it other than basically just to rank

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.660 
use it other than basically just to rank
it<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.870> having<00:04:07.290> basically<00:04:07.769> trashed<00:04:08.340> this

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
it up so having basically trashed this

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.000 
it up so having basically trashed this
weapon<00:04:09.209> what<00:04:09.660> attachments<00:04:10.290> do<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.470> recommend

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
weapon what attachments do I recommend

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.800 
weapon what attachments do I recommend
if<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.280> insist<00:04:11.579> on<00:04:11.820> using<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.299> or<00:04:12.570> if<00:04:12.690> you

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
if you insist on using it or if you

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.870 
if you insist on using it or if you
basically<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.410> want<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.950> rank<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.340> up<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.670> max

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
basically just want to rank it up to max

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.180 
basically just want to rank it up to max
level<00:04:15.000> before<00:04:15.870> moving<00:04:16.140> onto<00:04:16.380> another<00:04:16.530> carbine

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
level before moving onto another carbine

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.699 
level before moving onto another carbine
and<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.729> want<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.090> painless<00:04:18.630> way<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:18.930> do<00:04:19.380> so

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
and you want a painless way to do so

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.670 
and you want a painless way to do so
well<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:21.060> can<00:04:21.239> stick<00:04:21.659> the<00:04:21.870> laser<00:04:22.049> sight<00:04:22.470> on

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
well you can stick the laser sight on

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.260 
well you can stick the laser sight on
there

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
there

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.409 
there
make<00:04:23.569> this<00:04:23.840> thing<00:04:24.169> even<00:04:25.039> more<00:04:25.280> better<00:04:25.879> of<00:04:26.210> what

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
make this thing even more better of what

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.360 
make this thing even more better of what
it's<00:04:26.599> good<00:04:26.870> at<00:04:27.050> which<00:04:27.259> is<00:04:27.440> hit<00:04:27.650> by<00:04:27.680> if<00:04:28.160> that's

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
it's good at which is hit by if that's

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.279 
it's good at which is hit by if that's
what<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.669> want<00:04:28.849> to<00:04:28.970> do<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.330> if<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:29.780> want<00:04:30.080> to

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
what you want to do and if you want to

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.409 
what you want to do and if you want to
run<00:04:30.680> around<00:04:30.830> in<00:04:31.220> really<00:04:31.699> close<00:04:31.940> quarters

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
run around in really close quarters

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.749 
run around in really close quarters
situations<00:04:33.020> maybe<00:04:33.289> play<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.650> few<00:04:34.069> domination

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
situations maybe play a few domination

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.180 
situations maybe play a few domination
game<00:04:34.970> modes<00:04:35.270> then<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.139> laser<00:04:36.349> sight<00:04:36.650> would<00:04:36.889> be

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
game modes then the laser sight would be

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.550 
game modes then the laser sight would be
a<00:04:37.490> good<00:04:37.819> attachment<00:04:38.360> for<00:04:38.479> this<00:04:38.569> weapon<00:04:38.780> the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
a good attachment for this weapon the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.710 
a good attachment for this weapon the
compensator<00:04:40.250> might<00:04:40.669> help<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.150> little<00:04:41.180> bit

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
compensator might help a little bit

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.240 
compensator might help a little bit
because<00:04:42.349> it's<00:04:42.620> going<00:04:42.740> to<00:04:42.800> reduce<00:04:42.979> that

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
because it's going to reduce that

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.999 
because it's going to reduce that
side-to-side<00:04:43.940> recoil<00:04:44.659> but<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:45.500> still<00:04:45.800> don't

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
side-to-side recoil but I still don't

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.409 
side-to-side recoil but I still don't
recommend<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.639> even<00:04:46.759> for<00:04:47.090> this<00:04:47.150> weapon

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
recommend it even for this weapon

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.619 
recommend it even for this weapon
because<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.229> is<00:04:48.530> going<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:49.009> reduce<00:04:49.370> your

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
because it is going to reduce your

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.270 
because it is going to reduce your
aim-down-sights<00:04:50.629> accuracy<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:52.190> be

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
aim-down-sights accuracy and to be

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.730 
aim-down-sights accuracy and to be
honest<00:04:52.639> this<00:04:53.090> rifle<00:04:53.360> does<00:04:53.780> not<00:04:54.050> have<00:04:54.289> good<00:04:54.530> aim

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
honest this rifle does not have good aim

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.129 
honest this rifle does not have good aim
down<00:04:55.099> sights<00:04:55.430> accuracy<00:04:56.120> anyway<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.110> I

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
down sights accuracy anyway so I

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.290 
down sights accuracy anyway so I
probably<00:04:57.500> wouldn't<00:04:58.099> put<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.370> compensator<00:04:59.030> on

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
probably wouldn't put the compensator on

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.180 
probably wouldn't put the compensator on
there<00:04:59.539> and<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.990> certainly<00:05:00.259> wouldn't<00:05:00.800> put<00:05:01.099> the

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
there and I certainly wouldn't put the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.640 
there and I certainly wouldn't put the
muzzle<00:05:01.520> break<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.789> mean<00:05:01.909> if<00:05:02.060> I<00:05:02.120> had<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.509> put<00:05:02.780> over

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
muzzle break I mean if I had to put over

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.920 
muzzle break I mean if I had to put over
the<00:05:03.770> muzzle<00:05:03.979> break<00:05:04.310> all<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.729> compensator<00:05:05.419> you

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
the muzzle break all the compensator you

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.140 
the muzzle break all the compensator you
know<00:05:06.050> if<00:05:06.139> I<00:05:06.259> was<00:05:06.349> forced<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:07.009> gunpoint<00:05:07.699> to<00:05:08.000> put

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
know if I was forced a gunpoint to put

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.450 
know if I was forced a gunpoint to put
one<00:05:08.300> on<00:05:08.419> there<00:05:08.630> I'd<00:05:08.840> put<00:05:09.199> the<00:05:09.409> compensator<00:05:10.220> on

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
one on there I'd put the compensator on

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.100 
one on there I'd put the compensator on
there<00:05:10.669> it's<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.150> sensible<00:05:11.509> one<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:11.960> put<00:05:12.080> on

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
there it's the sensible one to put on

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.830 
there it's the sensible one to put on
there<00:05:12.380> but<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:12.770> don't<00:05:13.130> recommend<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.789> so<00:05:14.630> if<00:05:14.750> you

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
there but I don't recommend it so if you

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.330 
there but I don't recommend it so if you
have<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.110> put<00:05:15.289> a<00:05:15.319> barrel<00:05:15.650> attachment<00:05:15.949> on

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
have to put a barrel attachment on

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.520 
have to put a barrel attachment on
because<00:05:17.030> basically<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.630> don't<00:05:17.780> really<00:05:18.199> need

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
because basically you don't really need

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.290 
because basically you don't really need
one<00:05:18.770> but<00:05:18.979> you<00:05:19.069> could<00:05:19.190> put<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.490> flash<00:05:19.699> hider<00:05:19.969> on

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
one but you could put the flash hider on

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.779 
one but you could put the flash hider on
there<00:05:20.539> having<00:05:21.259> said<00:05:21.469> that<00:05:21.500> I<00:05:21.919> do<00:05:22.219> actually

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
there having said that I do actually

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.029 
there having said that I do actually
quite<00:05:23.270> like<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.719> suppressor<00:05:24.289> on<00:05:24.469> this<00:05:24.860> weapon

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
quite like the suppressor on this weapon

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.129 
quite like the suppressor on this weapon
you<00:05:25.669> can<00:05:25.819> see<00:05:26.030> me<00:05:26.180> running<00:05:26.479> around<00:05:26.599> with<00:05:26.990> the

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
you can see me running around with the

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.370 
you can see me running around with the
suppressor<00:05:27.669> reason<00:05:28.669> being<00:05:28.880> it<00:05:29.210> has<00:05:29.479> such<00:05:30.199> a

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
suppressor reason being it has such a

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.520 
suppressor reason being it has such a
long<00:05:30.590> reload<00:05:31.099> time<00:05:31.460> that<00:05:32.060> killing<00:05:32.870> people<00:05:33.319> and
