could<00:04:02.930> work<00:04:03.110> in<00:04:03.260> both<00:04:03.410> ways<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.860> can<00:04:03.980> have<00:04:04.070> one

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
could work in both ways you can have one

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.230 
could work in both ways you can have one
that<00:04:04.459> is<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:05.000> very<00:04:05.690> tall<00:04:06.320> straight<00:04:06.709> up<00:04:06.890> angle<00:04:07.340> go

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
that is a very tall straight up angle go

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.150 
that is a very tall straight up angle go
this<00:04:08.510> way<00:04:08.720> it's<00:04:09.050> more<00:04:09.320> of<00:04:09.410> an<00:04:09.500> angle<00:04:09.650> for

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
this way it's more of an angle for

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.760 
this way it's more of an angle for
viewing<00:04:10.580> if<00:04:10.820> you're<00:04:10.970> further<00:04:11.240> away<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.620> it

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
viewing if you're further away and it

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.580 
viewing if you're further away and it

works great so fly grip gives the

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.039 
works great so fly grip gives the
