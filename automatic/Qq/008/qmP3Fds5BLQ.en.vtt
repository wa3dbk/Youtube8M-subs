00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.139
 in March 2012 the european parliament 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.020
 decided with the support of 415 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.600
 MEPs recommend the introduction 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.029
 of chess as a subject in all the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.250
 European schools actually like 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.369
 the initiatives happen so many times 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.560
 governments tend to be behind 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.859
 what happens in reality because 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.260
 scientific studies carried out in the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.500
 five continents for more than 100 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.020
 years show that children who play 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.079
 to chess not only develop more their 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.629
 intelligence but they also improve their 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.320
 academic performance on average 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.829
 by 17% and especially in mathematics 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.039
 and in reading more recently and in addition 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.199
 the author of this study the authors are 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.570
 some Spanish psychologists of the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.100
 University of the lagoon in Tenerife have 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.070
 demonstrated that the practice of chess 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.470
 not only improves intelligence 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.330
 let's say pure or cognitive but 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.130
 emotional intelligence is more there 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.160
 experiences even with children of 2 and 3 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.880
 years in various countries especially in 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.030
 colombia in uruguay and in spain 'the idea 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.090
 is learning by playing and playing by learning 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.510
 situ using chess as a game 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.730
 more you teach children of 3 or 4 years what 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.100
 is a vertical a diagonal or a 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.680
 horizontal insurance that will enter 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.070
 much better than if you try to explain it 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.840
 let's say with technical words in the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.140
 field of pedagogy and chess in 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.150
 reality there are many sub fields very 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.119
 interesting for example there are tests 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.979
 of the usefulness of chess 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:02:00.300
 against the syndrome of dawn against td 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.540
 h that is hyperactivity also in 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.540
 jails in reformatories with autistic 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.060
 Asperger's syndrome of course with 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.950
 older people there is no doubt that with 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.530
 gifted because for them it is a 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.010
 infinite challenge finally there are many 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.680
 camps 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.340
 with the common factor of pedagogy and in 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 this book because we try to detail a 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.019
 little because chess is so useful in 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.189
 each of those fields and especially in 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.189
 the pedagogy in general
