00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
bareMinerals does come with a brush or

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.960 
bareMinerals does come with a brush or
they<00:02:09.140> have<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.380> brush<00:02:09.679> specifically<00:02:10.520> for<00:02:10.790> this

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
they have a brush specifically for this

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.690 
they have a brush specifically for this
serum<00:02:11.570> and<00:02:11.810> I<00:02:12.260> thought<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:13.010> came<00:02:13.340> with<00:02:13.580> the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
serum and I thought it came with the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.330 
serum and I thought it came with the
foundation<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.590> realized<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.220> have

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
foundation but then I realized you have

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.090 
foundation but then I realized you have
to<00:02:16.459> buy<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.670> separately<00:02:17.050> sponge<00:02:18.050> out<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.890> as

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
to buy it separately sponge out just as

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.180 
to buy it separately sponge out just as
easily<00:02:19.700> as<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.120> physician's<00:02:20.840> formula<00:02:21.190> it's

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
easily as a physician's formula it's

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:30.250 
easily as a physician's formula it's
gonna<00:02:22.340> add<00:02:22.580> another<00:02:22.880> two<00:02:23.720> drops

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.979 

so<00:02:30.800> I'd<00:02:31.069> have<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.310> say<00:02:31.459> everything<00:02:32.090> was<00:02:32.720> pretty

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
so I'd have to say everything was pretty

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.229 
so I'd have to say everything was pretty
much<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.680> same<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:34.310> consistency<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.030> the

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
much the same the consistency of the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.690 
much the same the consistency of the
foundation<00:02:35.870> was<00:02:36.049> exactly<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.890> same<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.459> mean

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
foundation was exactly the same I mean

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.789 
foundation was exactly the same I mean
the<00:02:37.760> colors<00:02:38.239> look<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.930> same<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.769> only

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
the colors look the same the only

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.670 
the colors look the same the only
difference<00:02:40.099> was<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.629> sent<00:02:41.959> Physicians

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
difference was the sent Physicians

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.250 
difference was the sent Physicians
Formula<00:02:42.769> has<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.489> pretty<00:02:43.819> strong<00:02:44.019> scent<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:45.200> I

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
Formula has a pretty strong scent and I

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.080 
Formula has a pretty strong scent and I
could<00:02:45.440> still<00:02:45.680> smell<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.459> then<00:02:46.940> the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
could still smell it and then the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.420 
could still smell it and then the
bareMinerals<00:02:47.560> doesn't<00:02:48.560> smell<00:02:48.769> like<00:02:48.830> anything

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
bareMinerals doesn't smell like anything

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
bareMinerals doesn't smell like anything

guys notice a difference like I don't
feel<00:04:40.610> that

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
feel that

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.400 
feel that
one<00:04:41.040> side<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.430> oilier<00:04:41.910> than<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.630> other<00:04:42.780> have

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.460 
one side is oilier than the other have
to<00:04:43.620> say<00:04:43.830> all<00:04:44.130> in<00:04:44.400> all<00:04:44.610> they<00:04:45.390> are<00:04:45.540> both<00:04:45.780> quite

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
to say all in all they are both quite

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.660 
to say all in all they are both quite
similar

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
similar

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.640 
similar
I'm<00:04:47.850> surprised<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:48.690> can't<00:04:48.930> even<00:04:49.200> notice<00:04:49.350> the

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
I'm surprised you can't even notice the

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.960 
I'm surprised you can't even notice the
color<00:04:49.860> difference<00:04:50.310> between<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.760> two

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
color difference between the two

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.610 
color difference between the two
especially<00:04:51.300> since<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.870> bareMinerals<00:04:52.230> had

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
especially since the bareMinerals had

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.160 
especially since the bareMinerals had
more<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.040> yellow<00:04:53.460> or<00:04:54.030> golden<00:04:54.390> undertone<00:04:54.900> as

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
more of a yellow or golden undertone as

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.980 
more of a yellow or golden undertone as
you<00:04:55.560> can<00:04:55.710> see<00:04:55.980> they<00:04:56.610> were<00:04:56.670> very<00:04:57.270> similar

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
you can see they were very similar

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.030 
you can see they were very similar
I<00:04:58.020> did<00:04:58.350> notice<00:04:58.590> like<00:04:59.480> some<00:05:00.480> dry<00:05:00.930> spots<00:05:01.410> but<00:05:01.980> I

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
I did notice like some dry spots but I

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.590 
I did notice like some dry spots but I
think<00:05:02.430> throughout<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.790> day<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.150> just<00:05:03.180> kind<00:05:03.570> of

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
think throughout the day it just kind of

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.450 
think throughout the day it just kind of
diminished<00:05:04.110> because<00:05:04.530> oil<00:05:04.560> build-up

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
diminished because oil build-up

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.820 
diminished because oil build-up
personally<00:05:06.420> I<00:05:06.630> wouldn't<00:05:07.260> buy<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.530> bare

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
personally I wouldn't buy the bare

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.610 
personally I wouldn't buy the bare
minerals<00:05:08.250> again<00:05:08.610> because<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.420> had<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.110> shade

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
minerals again because I had a shade

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.440 
minerals again because I had a shade
that<00:05:10.650> fit<00:05:11.190> me<00:05:11.370> well<00:05:11.550> with<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.940> physician's

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
that fit me well with the physician's

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.600 
that fit me well with the physician's
formula<00:05:12.540> and<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:13.650> end<00:05:13.830> up<00:05:13.950> saving<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.400> lot<00:05:14.550> of

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
formula and I end up saving a lot of

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.090 
formula and I end up saving a lot of
money<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:15.300> say<00:05:15.600> if<00:05:15.780> you<00:05:15.990> do<00:05:16.260> have<00:05:16.590> similar

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
money so I say if you do have similar

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.520 
money so I say if you do have similar
skin<00:05:17.460> tone<00:05:17.640> as<00:05:17.790> me<00:05:17.940> or<00:05:17.970> even<00:05:18.360> lighter<00:05:18.660> then<00:05:19.320> go

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
skin tone as me or even lighter then go

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.200 
skin tone as me or even lighter then go
with<00:05:19.740> this<00:05:19.890> physician's<00:05:20.550> formula<00:05:20.610> because

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
with this physician's formula because

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.650 
with this physician's formula because
it's<00:05:21.360> much<00:05:21.510> cheaper<00:05:21.540> but<00:05:22.470> if<00:05:22.970> you<00:05:23.970> have<00:05:24.300> deeper

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
it's much cheaper but if you have deeper

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.230 
it's much cheaper but if you have deeper
skin<00:05:24.930> tone<00:05:25.230> then<00:05:25.740> you<00:05:26.430> have<00:05:26.610> no<00:05:26.790> other<00:05:26.940> choice

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
skin tone then you have no other choice

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.740 
skin tone then you have no other choice
than<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.660> go<00:05:27.900> for<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.290> bare<00:05:28.620> minerals<00:05:29.450> yeah<00:05:30.450> so

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
than to go for the bare minerals yeah so

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.390 
than to go for the bare minerals yeah so
that's<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.110> for<00:05:31.320> my<00:05:31.470> review<00:05:31.500> comment<00:05:32.250> below
