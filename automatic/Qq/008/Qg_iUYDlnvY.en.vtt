00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.750
 logo in the videos block in logic in the skin 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.340
 It's not 100% perfect, right? 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.640
 We are a cheap little thing. 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.260
 So much baseline coverage then but you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.689

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.789

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.250
 the rest is all stain on the face because it is 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.510
 a person who has a lot more in the face 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.000
 I do not know why we still go there then how 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.120
 they are national national products and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.809
 accessible to the then the basis that I was 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.239
 using this here it is essential that it is a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:07.680
 marcelo de lime and campi line and me 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.460
 like her speech is net net is 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.470
 so it was cheap, it's just 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:20.570
 eight reais and sell confirms that it sells 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:23.189
 these brands are celbi type so come on 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.049
 I'm going to apply it so we can have a 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.509
 nice coverage make a scheme 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.229
 so here but I'll explain to you 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.030
 it is 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.189
 it is very liquid, that is if you do not 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:39.540
 I can see the people here. 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.030
 in the hand it is well established then 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.590
 Come on and on and on and on. 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.590
 here's the jaw 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:02:16.190
 I think the danger come ready 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.450
 girls applied by scoundrel base is O 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.220
 she covered a little bit as well but 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.970
 did not mean that she did not 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.019
 She did it because she covered it and I 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.790
 give a drying 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.160
 meanwhile she passes a concealer 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.760
 so the old one that I'm going to use is this 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.160
 here the maxi lopez already left until the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.410
 bunny was my first collective and 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.850
 it is much more clarinha what I'm in 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.130
 My skin but I could not get better. 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.049
 active has everything 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.049
 buses that I use even are 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:50.220
 the gadgets on May 15, curitiba 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.950
 is here in nagoya shopping and that is 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.660
 which is porcelain 01 but it is much more 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.940
 of course 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:26.700
 so come on, I'll apply it to yourself 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:29.549
 after school ready scared girl 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.950
 his wife much more clearly and so than 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.959
 I drink coffee and if I do I'll go 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.060
 standardize it by passing the base 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.590
 again then I'll move on 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.720
 luggage but I will never pass a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.609
 especially in areas where 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.280
 I had to cover it with correction. 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.490
 so I'm going to apply it I founded it on 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:04:13.390
 base and then I pick up brush and 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:04:15.580
 we then girls tennis started to be 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.970
 mentioned from home but I passed but did not 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.360
 felt the need and so this 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.870
 base it is not a slaughter that I recommend 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.360
 for oily skin because it leaves a 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.610
 aspect so wet neither oily 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.140
 but then you will have a tip 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.460
 so why am I going to use this here? 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.390
 gray until I get the name I use 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.700
 very much 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.870
 My race to three because you want to know 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.750
 then the corrective must be about six reais 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.510
 the base does not make 18 reais that this 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.840
 this poc I bought it on March 25 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.200
 so it was $ 2 so look he's very 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.500
 good 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:01.720
 I use a lot of it is very poisonous to fight. 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.260
 with the brush but you can tease 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.260
 little school 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.170
 I will apply for greater coverage 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.270
 ready girls now just for us not 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.280
 get a real dead guy face 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.440
 I'll use this snack he is too. 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.450
 Cheapest has to do what I have 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:38.470
 he is the one of max love he is the body is and 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.840
 It's like a bronze tone, world. 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.510
 White I'm not white but 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.180
 and if you do not have bronze you can 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.669
 invest in this color here in blue 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.710
 chips even because the blush it will do 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.320
 the bronze paper 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.100
 if it be more earthly so but evil 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.930
 used 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.570
 So it's this boy, I hope you 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.430
 have enjoyed the skin รณ stays 100% more 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.979

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.110
 my stains and are cheap products 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.650
