00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.050
 you have a willpower 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.529
 limited because to use it you need 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.630
 energy in the form of oxygen and glucose 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.480
 that's why it's harder to say no when 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.330
 you are tired a thought is a way 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.670
 physical in the brain when more times 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.650
 have a thought the footprint that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.800
 it will be bigger and it will be more 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.080
 easy to remember that's why it's never a 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.650
 good idea to think because I'm not worth to 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.170
 nothing talking about thinking a person 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.410
 has about 70 thousand thoughts a day 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.360
 although many will be repeated so the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.899
 most of those thoughts are 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.690
 positive even if you are a person who 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.270
 use more the left hemisphere every 90 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.790
 or 120 minutes your brain will have more 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.739
 activity in the opposite hemisphere more 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.210
 about the ultra-target rhythms of 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 brain 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.949
 read aloud accelerates the development 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.080
 brain in children rethink the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.090
 negative events so 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 positive alters the connections 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.240
 neuronal making you one more person 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.259
 happy weighs a kilo and a half but consumes 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.300
 more than 20% of the body's energy 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.430
 your brain has 10 raised to a million 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 in different ways to connect their 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.649
 neurons there are 1.1 trillion cells in 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.690
 the brain 100 billion are neurons 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:38.360
 the information that slowest goes by your 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.070
 brain goes to 418 43 kilometers per hour 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.869
 when you were born, your brain was 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.500
 disproportionately large in 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.840
 comparison with other organs if you lose 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.270
 brain blood will take about 10 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.920
 seconds to lose consciousness your 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.460
 brain has no news tores 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.770
 pain receptors although the amygdala 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.319
 regulates the danger the cerebellum control 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.439
 motor limbic system emotions 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.750
 etcetera this is somewhat deceptive since it does not 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.670
 act independently and all 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.790
 they need other areas of the brain 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.579
 so that your work is fulfilled your vision 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.709
 improving peripheral night leaving 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.590
 side neurodegenerative diseases 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.019
 your brain never forgets the way 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.570
 learn and change because it's plastic and 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.780
 the neurons are able to reconnect 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.530
 by itself is a myth that we use 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.700
 only 10% of the brain if you still believe it 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.790
 cut a piece to see what happens 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.700
 if you could measure your brain waves 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.890
 you would not see them go down when you sleep this 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.050
 it's basically because the brain is 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.810
 handles other functions such as 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.180
 digestion the heart beats or 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.430
 keep your blood pressure more than 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.610
 nothing to avoid the hassle of sunrise 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.980
 dead investigations have put of 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.470
 manifest that the hippocampus that manages 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.120
 spatial visual awareness is greater 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.060
 in london taxi drivers 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.489
 there the taxi drivers spend months or 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.500
 even years learning are all the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.190
 streets of the city to be removed 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.319
 the license until relatively 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.540
 little and scientists believed that the 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.750
 brain was the only area of ​​the body that 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.610
 did not generate new cells now you know 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.560
 that in some areas of the brain of 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.650
 adult individual new ones are produced 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.310
 neurons you have some cells called 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.650
 mirror neurons among other things are 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.920
 responsible for you feel a hit 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.440
 received by another person when someone 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.290
 takes cocaine the center of the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.620
 pleasure nucleus accumbens liberating 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.590
 dopamine and serotonin is fortunately 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.720
 the only way to do it being 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.190
 able to do several things at once 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.380
 it is a myth 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.170
 you can do another question is that what 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.139
 do well according to the University of Utah 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.510
 only 25 percent of people 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.190
 are able to do several things to the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.560
 its time without affecting its 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.299
 performance in most of the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.549
 people the brain changes 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.829
 constantly from one action to another so 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.120
 fast we have the illusion of 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.239
 multitask 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.590
 your brain is cheating you 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.320
 constantly since it can not process 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.120
 all the details that you see why 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.120
 simply fill them with what 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.580
 suppose there is and does not record your 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.889
 memories like a video but saves 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.590
 the most important fragments and when 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.770
 you try to remember the ones they fill in 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.930
 based on your previous experience due to 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.350
 previous point your brain has great 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.720
 ease to create false memories 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.120
 when some scientists showed some 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.490
 people modified images of them 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.010
 in several events a few years before 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.010
 They could remember it perfectly despite 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.380
 of not having been there there will be occasions 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.620
 in which I would swear that something happened like you 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.870
 we remember but never passed the reason 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.030
 why many Chinese people have 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.490
 difficulty in pronouncing the erre is 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.340
 because that phoneme does not exist in your language 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.500
 if your brain is not exposed to a 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.110
 language that contains it before the three 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.630
 years the area of ​​the brain that intervenes 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.630
 in its pronunciation it will be dedicated to another 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.670
 homework 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.590
 your brain is pretty bad 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.160
 distinguishing between reality and 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.590
 fiction 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.020
 that's why horror movies give 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.350
 fear and porn movies triumph at 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.230
 despite his scripts the brain either 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.790
 It is very good to concentrate 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.180
 needing a break as much every 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.490
 90 minutes why when you study is 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.750
 better to take several short breaks 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.750
 that a very long
