00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.390 
element like I know now we have VHS and
we<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.810> few<00:02:25.500> other<00:02:25.650> films<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.130> have

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
we have like a few other films that have

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.690 
we have like a few other films that have
done<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.760> kind<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:28.010> anthology<00:02:29.010> with<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.430> but

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
done that kind of anthology with it but

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.660 
done that kind of anthology with it but
to<00:02:29.850> bring<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.570> new<00:02:30.750> medium<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.340> tape

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
to bring in a new medium and it's a tape

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.729 
to bring in a new medium and it's a tape
that<00:02:32.940> causes<00:02:33.390> people<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.780> go<00:02:33.989> disappearing

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
that causes people to go disappearing

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.229 
that causes people to go disappearing
and<00:02:34.860> if<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.100> watch<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.090> will

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
and if you watch it this is what will

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.120 
and if you watch it this is what will
happen<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> mean<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.709> was<00:02:37.860> kind<00:02:38.100> of

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
happen and I mean it's it was kind of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.410 
happen and I mean it's it was kind of
scary<00:02:38.280> because<00:02:38.580> you're<00:02:38.850> watching<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.300> movie

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
scary because you're watching the movie

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.120 
scary because you're watching the movie
and<00:02:39.570> I'm<00:02:39.720> like<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.590> happen<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:41.010> me

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
and I'm like is this gonna happen to me

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.020 
and I'm like is this gonna happen to me
right<00:02:41.810> definitely<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.500> didn't<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.550> could

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
right definitely it didn't but it could

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.390 
right definitely it didn't but it could
I<00:02:45.330> think<00:02:45.720> what<00:02:46.200> also<00:02:46.560> made<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:46.950> really

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
I think what also made this really

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.430 
I think what also made this really
powerful<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.150> there<00:02:49.110> were<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> lot<00:02:49.410> of

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
powerful is that there were a lot of

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.760 
powerful is that there were a lot of
elements<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.130> things<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.940> could<00:02:51.770> could

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
elements of things that could could

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.860 
elements of things that could could
actually<00:02:53.040> happen<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.420> wasn't<00:02:54.720> really

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
actually happen to you it wasn't really

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.540 
actually happen to you it wasn't really
that<00:02:54.900> far<00:02:55.230> fetch<00:02:55.470> amazing<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.070> have<00:02:56.220> an<00:02:56.340> average

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
that far fetch amazing I have an average

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.100 
that far fetch amazing I have an average
everyday<00:02:57.209> things<00:02:57.540> scary

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.039 
also there's a lot of imagery and it's
it's<00:03:10.640> interesting<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.760> they<00:03:11.880> set<00:03:12.269> up<00:03:12.540> kind<00:03:12.900> of

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
it's interesting is they set up kind of

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.840 
it's interesting is they set up kind of
all<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.500> little<00:03:13.680> elements<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.370> video<00:03:14.670> at

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
all the little elements in the video at

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.009 
all the little elements in the video at
the<00:03:14.940> beginning<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:16.290> then<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.280> very<00:03:17.459> slow

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
the beginning and then it's a very slow

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.100 
the beginning and then it's a very slow
reveal<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.980> film<00:03:20.220> kind<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.880> slow<00:03:21.780> like<00:03:21.989> they

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
reveal the film kind is slow like they

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.490 
reveal the film kind is slow like they
couldn't<00:03:22.380> Claudia<00:03:22.950> um<00:03:23.420> but<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:24.570> over<00:03:24.810> yeah

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
couldn't Claudia um but it's over yeah

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.580 
couldn't Claudia um but it's over yeah
so<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.220> mean<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:27.480> dragged<00:03:27.810> out<00:03:27.989> but<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.380> also

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
so I mean it dragged out but it also

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.120 
so I mean it dragged out but it also
builds<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.489> lot<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.620> lot<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.799> momentum

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
builds a lot of you a lot of momentum

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
builds a lot of you a lot of momentum
and<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.760> lot<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.200> creepiness<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:35.700> think<00:03:36.060> that

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
and a lot of creepiness and I think that

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.449 
and a lot of creepiness and I think that
makes<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.420> very<00:03:36.750> powerful<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.320> think<00:03:38.250> Gore

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
makes it very powerful I think Gore

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.640 
makes it very powerful I think Gore
Verbinski<00:03:39.060> did<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.450> film<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.049> mean<00:03:40.200> as<00:03:40.410> we

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
Verbinski did this film and I mean as we
