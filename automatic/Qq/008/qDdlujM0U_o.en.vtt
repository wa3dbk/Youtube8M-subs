the same fingers index in middle and
we're<00:03:37.660> going<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.810> slide<00:03:38.110> from<00:03:38.470> well<00:03:39.310> we're

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
we're going to slide from well we're

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.330 
we're going to slide from well we're
going<00:03:39.550> to<00:03:39.610> pluck<00:03:39.790> fourth<00:03:40.210> fret<00:03:40.450> one<00:03:41.440> time<00:03:41.740> and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
going to pluck fourth fret one time and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.800 
going to pluck fourth fret one time and
we're<00:03:42.490> going<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.640> slide<00:03:42.880> from<00:03:43.150> four<00:03:43.540> down<00:03:43.690> to

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
we're going to slide from four down to

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.530 
we're going to slide from four down to
three<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:45.400> then<00:03:45.880> we're<00:03:45.970> going<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.120> slide<00:03:46.330> from

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
three and then we're going to slide from

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.950 
three and then we're going to slide from
three<00:03:46.840> down<00:03:47.020> to<00:03:47.140> two<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:48.060> then<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.330> back<00:03:49.630> up<00:03:49.840> to

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
three down to two and then to back up to

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.780 
three down to two and then to back up to
four<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.790> pluck<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.060> again

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
four and pluck that again

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.449 
four and pluck that again
okay<00:03:54.750> let's<00:03:55.049> let's<00:03:55.409> focus<00:03:56.069> on<00:03:56.430> that

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
okay let's let's focus on that

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.789 
okay let's let's focus on that
rhythmically<00:03:57.299> that's<00:03:57.900> going<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.319> start<00:03:58.560> on

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
rhythmically that's going to start on

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:08.140 
rhythmically that's going to start on
beat<00:03:59.129> three<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.849> measure<00:04:00.060> two<00:04:00.360> there<00:04:03.590> one<00:04:04.590> two

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:17.300 

one<00:04:09.150> two<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:16.260> make<00:04:16.410> sure<00:04:16.440> when<00:04:16.859> you're<00:04:16.979> sliding

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
one two so make sure when you're sliding

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.640 
one two so make sure when you're sliding
from<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:18.419> very<00:04:18.630> last<00:04:18.840> slide<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.350> going<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.560> be

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
from the very last slide is going to be

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:28.850 
from the very last slide is going to be
from<00:04:19.829> two<00:04:20.100> up<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.789> four<00:04:21.139> so<00:04:27.530> okay<00:04:28.530> now<00:04:28.680> if<00:04:28.740> we

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
from two up to four so okay now if we

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.529 
from two up to four so okay now if we
put<00:04:29.070> all<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.340> together<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:30.180> we've<00:04:30.330> learned

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
put all that together that we've learned

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:38.170 
put all that together that we've learned
so<00:04:30.750> far<00:04:30.780> we've<00:04:31.590> got<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:32.039> one<00:04:32.669> two<00:04:33.270> three<00:04:34.020> a

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:49.580 

little<00:04:39.180> slower<00:04:39.510> one<00:04:40.320> two<00:04:41.130> three<00:04:48.199> so<00:04:49.199> work<00:04:49.410> on

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
little slower one two three so work on

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.500 
little slower one two three so work on
that<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:50.310> know<00:04:50.400> check<00:04:50.610> out<00:04:50.729> that<00:04:50.880> tablature

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
that you know check out that tablature

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.879 
that you know check out that tablature
and<00:04:51.539> try<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.870> get<00:04:52.080> all<00:04:52.320> those<00:04:52.470> slides

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
and try to get all those slides

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.600 
and try to get all those slides
happening<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.940> slide<00:04:54.240> is<00:04:54.449> just<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:55.310> line<00:04:56.310> in

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
happening the slide is just the line in

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.760 
happening the slide is just the line in
between<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.970> numbers<00:04:57.240> with<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.690> arch<00:04:58.050> over

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
between the numbers with the arch over

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.339 
between the numbers with the arch over
top<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.520> numbers<00:04:59.880> that's<00:05:00.150> like<00:05:00.900> say<00:05:01.139> when

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
top of the numbers that's like say when

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.469 
top of the numbers that's like say when
here's<00:05:01.650> two<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.580> sliding<00:05:03.000> from<00:05:03.150> three<00:05:03.360> to

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
here's two and sliding from three to

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.839 
here's two and sliding from three to
four<00:05:03.949> that's<00:05:04.949> just<00:05:05.160> those<00:05:05.310> two<00:05:05.550> lines

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
four that's just those two lines

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.670 
four that's just those two lines
connecting<00:05:06.630> three<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.080> four<00:05:07.289> that<00:05:07.410> means<00:05:07.530> a

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
connecting three to four that means a

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.460 
connecting three to four that means a
slide<00:05:08.510> I'm<00:05:09.510> just<00:05:09.660> going<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.840> pluck<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.110> and

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
slide I'm just going to pluck it and

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:17.740 
slide I'm just going to pluck it and
just<00:05:11.280> slide<00:05:11.520> it

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.510 

okay<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:19.350> we<00:05:19.500> should<00:05:19.530> have<00:05:19.770> that<00:05:19.800> down<00:05:20.220> and

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
okay so we should have that down and

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.610 
okay so we should have that down and
then<00:05:20.970> we<00:05:21.330> just<00:05:21.360> do<00:05:21.600> a<00:05:21.630> quick<00:05:21.900> slide<00:05:22.170> from<00:05:22.410> 9:00

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
then we just do a quick slide from 9:00

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.240 
then we just do a quick slide from 9:00
to<00:05:22.800> 11:00<00:05:22.830> just<00:05:23.250> kind<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.669> ghosted<00:05:24.120> slide

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
to 11:00 just kind of a ghosted slide

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.659 
to 11:00 just kind of a ghosted slide
then<00:05:26.250> go<00:05:26.430> right<00:05:26.639> back<00:05:26.850> to<00:05:26.880> 9:00<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.780> just<00:05:28.669> and

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
then go right back to 9:00 so I just and

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.129 
then go right back to 9:00 so I just and
I<00:05:29.820> just<00:05:29.850> kind<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.300> touch<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.720> strings

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
I just kind of touch the strings

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.050 
I just kind of touch the strings
sometimes<00:05:31.919> I<00:05:32.070> use<00:05:32.190> palm<00:05:32.430> blocking<00:05:32.910> other

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
sometimes I use palm blocking other

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.030 
sometimes I use palm blocking other
times<00:05:33.389> with<00:05:34.050> muting<00:05:34.410> I<00:05:34.500> just<00:05:34.680> touch<00:05:34.860> the

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
times with muting I just touch the

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.570 
times with muting I just touch the
strings

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
strings

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.370 
strings
that's<00:05:35.970> called<00:05:36.180> pic<00:05:36.450> blocking<00:05:36.960> when<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.200> mute

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
that's called pic blocking when you mute

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.340 
that's called pic blocking when you mute
with<00:05:37.620> your<00:05:37.770> with<00:05:38.010> your<00:05:38.160> picks<00:05:39.110> now<00:05:40.110> I'm<00:05:40.200> just

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
with your with your picks now I'm just

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.129 
with your with your picks now I'm just
going<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.850> just<00:05:41.850> do<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.000> slow<00:05:42.330> slide<00:05:42.630> from<00:05:42.930> 9:00

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
going to just do a slow slide from 9:00

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.650 
going to just do a slow slide from 9:00
all<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.500> way<00:05:43.590> up<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:43.770> 16<00:05:44.220> you<00:05:44.880> can<00:05:44.940> see<00:05:45.210> that<00:05:45.419> on

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
all the way up to 16 you can see that on

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.530 
all the way up to 16 you can see that on
my<00:05:45.990> third<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:46.830> second<00:05:47.160> string<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:48.350> then<00:05:50.540> you

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
my third and second string and then you

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.180 
my third and second string and then you
can<00:05:51.720> see<00:05:51.990> that<00:05:52.230> there<00:05:52.500> I'm<00:05:52.680> just<00:05:52.770> plucking<00:05:53.160> my
