00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.960 
snipers are going to be very good in
this<00:00:22.170> game<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.619> know<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.949> killfeeds<00:00:23.160> different

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
this game I know the killfeeds different

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580 
this game I know the killfeeds different
so<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.630> might<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.960> good<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.170> lot<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.439> people

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
so that might be good a lot of people

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.960 
so that might be good a lot of people
were<00:00:25.740> saying<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.160> Twitter<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.730> good

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
were saying on Twitter that it's good

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.279 
were saying on Twitter that it's good
that<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.359> killfeeds<00:00:27.510> different<00:00:28.109> it's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that the killfeeds different it's

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.720 
that the killfeeds different it's
something<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:28.949> different<00:00:29.220> than<00:00:29.519> before

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
something a little different than before

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.759 
something a little different than before
and<00:00:30.210> that's<00:00:30.810> something<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.380> usually

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and that's something that we usually

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.000 
and that's something that we usually
like<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:33.630> honestly<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.620> didn't<00:00:34.829> talk

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
like but like honestly they didn't talk

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.979 
like but like honestly they didn't talk
about<00:00:35.130> sniping<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.480> also<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
about sniping at all which can also be a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.479 
about sniping at all which can also be a
good<00:00:37.050> thing<00:00:37.469> because<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.040> we're<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.340> really

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
good thing because then we're not really

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.979 
good thing because then we're not really
sure<00:00:38.579> about<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.480> might<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.690> some

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
sure about it and there might be some

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.040 
sure about it and there might be some
good<00:00:40.200> things<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.890> some<00:00:41.129> good<00:00:41.309> aspects<00:00:41.790> of

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
good things like some good aspects of

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.360 
good things like some good aspects of
sniping<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.770> didn't<00:00:44.010> talk<00:00:44.190> about

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
sniping but they just didn't talk about

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.979 
sniping but they just didn't talk about
it<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.760> we're<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.210> sure<00:00:45.270> yet<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.870> now

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it so we're not really sure yet so now

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.350 
it so we're not really sure yet so now
we<00:00:46.050> still<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.590> wait<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.010> other<00:00:47.879> stuff<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
we still have to wait for other stuff to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.959 
we still have to wait for other stuff to
come<00:00:48.539> out<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:50.010> game<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> actually<00:00:50.820> be

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
come out for this game to actually be

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.049 
come out for this game to actually be
good<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> did<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.680> two<00:00:52.710> snipers<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
good so I did see two snipers in it that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.360 
good so I did see two snipers in it that
I'm<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.690> excited<00:00:54.989> about<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I'm kind of excited about and I kind of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.029 
I'm kind of excited about and I kind of
feel<00:00:56.879> bad<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:58.050> having<00:00:58.320> these<00:00:58.559> snipers<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
feel bad about having these snipers in

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.729 
feel bad about having these snipers in
and<00:00:59.309> one<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> snipers<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> MSR<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and one of the snipers is the MSR and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.539 
and one of the snipers is the MSR and
the<00:01:01.829> MSR<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.439> mp3<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.430> really

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the MSR was in mp3 and I'm not really

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.399 
the MSR was in mp3 and I'm not really
sure<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.270> sniper<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.229> in

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
sure if this sniper is going to be in

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
sure if this sniper is going to be in
this<00:01:07.560> game<00:01:07.799> because<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.189> would<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.820> look

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
this game because it would kind of look

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700 
this game because it would kind of look
like<00:01:09.060> an<00:01:09.360> MSR<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:09.960> i'm<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.170> sure<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.560> was

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
like an MSR but i'm not sure if it was

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469 
like an MSR but i'm not sure if it was
and<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.400> l11<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:12.030> pretty<00:01:12.270> sure<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
and the l11 I'm pretty sure is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.080 
and the l11 I'm pretty sure is
definitely<00:01:13.020> back<00:01:13.320> because<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.340> saw<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
definitely back because I saw that and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179 
definitely back because I saw that and
the<00:01:15.210> picture<00:01:15.540> definitely<00:01:15.900> looks<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> 11

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the picture definitely looks like the 11

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.670 
the picture definitely looks like the 11
from<00:01:17.400> mw3<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.659> we're<00:01:19.049> never<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.439> sure<00:01:19.650> if

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
from mw3 so we're never really sure if

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.770 
from mw3 so we're never really sure if
these<00:01:19.979> snipers<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.400> actually<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.420> that's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
these snipers are actually in but that's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
these snipers are actually in but that's
what<00:01:22.020> they<00:01:22.110> were<00:01:22.170> showing<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:23.009> kind<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
what they were showing that kind of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
what they were showing that kind of
scares<00:01:23.729> me<00:01:23.820> as<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.780> don't<00:01:25.140> want

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
scares me as well because I don't want

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.719 
scares me as well because I don't want
this<00:01:25.350> game<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> complete<00:01:26.189> copy<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.580> em

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
this game to be a complete copy of em

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.569 
this game to be a complete copy of em
billion<00:01:27.240> own<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.720> liked<00:01:27.960> endo<00:01:28.290> III<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
billion own really liked endo III and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.870 
billion own really liked endo III and
also<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:30.570> didn't<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.560> attack<00:01:32.340> knives<00:01:32.640> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
also they didn't have attack knives in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
also they didn't have attack knives in
the<00:01:33.030> live<00:01:33.360> stream<00:01:33.659> which<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.470> means<00:01:35.070> they

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the live stream which that means they

kill another guy also they were talking
about<00:03:08.960> how<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.260> maps<00:03:09.620> kind<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.010> change<00:03:10.340> in

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
about how the maps kind of change in

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.060 
about how the maps kind of change in
this<00:03:11.600> live<00:03:11.810> stream<00:03:11.840> they<00:03:12.500> were<00:03:12.560> saying<00:03:12.890> that

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
this live stream they were saying that

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.520 
this live stream they were saying that
the<00:03:13.280> maps<00:03:13.760> in<00:03:14.060> call<00:03:14.300> duty<00:03:14.450> ghosts<00:03:14.840> they<00:03:15.020> like

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
the maps in call duty ghosts they like

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.440 
the maps in call duty ghosts they like
change<00:03:15.830> around<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.490> like<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:17.060> can<00:03:17.209> kind<00:03:17.390> of

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
change around and like you can kind of

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.870 
change around and like you can kind of
like<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.720> show<00:03:17.990> stuff<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.650> like<00:03:18.770> stuff<00:03:19.280> moves

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
like to show stuff and like stuff moves

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.820 
like to show stuff and like stuff moves
around<00:03:20.090> in<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.360> map<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:21.200> might<00:03:21.410> be<00:03:21.440> kind<00:03:21.590> of

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
around in the map that might be kind of

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.110 
around in the map that might be kind of
cool<00:03:22.040> for<00:03:22.250> trick<00:03:22.400> shutters<00:03:22.730> there<00:03:22.910> might<00:03:23.090> be

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
cool for trick shutters there might be

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.270 
cool for trick shutters there might be
like<00:03:23.390> different<00:03:24.290> ways<00:03:24.410> trick<00:03:24.770> shutters<00:03:25.070> can

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
like different ways trick shutters can

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.920 
like different ways trick shutters can
implement<00:03:25.610> that<00:03:25.880> into<00:03:26.180> their<00:03:26.300> trick<00:03:26.480> shots<00:03:26.720> I

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
implement that into their trick shots I

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.990 
implement that into their trick shots I
don't<00:03:27.380> really<00:03:27.560> know<00:03:27.830> but<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.459> might<00:03:28.670> seem<00:03:28.880> like

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
don't really know but it might seem like

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.480 
don't really know but it might seem like
a<00:03:29.030> cool<00:03:29.300> idea<00:03:29.740> from<00:03:30.740> right<00:03:30.950> now<00:03:31.100> from<00:03:31.310> what<00:03:31.430> I

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
a cool idea from right now from what I

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.010 
a cool idea from right now from what I
see<00:03:31.760> we<00:03:32.180> don't<00:03:32.300> know<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.600> much<00:03:32.959> about

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
see we don't know that much about

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.810 
see we don't know that much about
trickshotting<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:33.920> sniping<00:03:34.220> from<00:03:34.280> call<00:03:34.640> duty

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
trickshotting and sniping from call duty

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.400 
trickshotting and sniping from call duty
ghosts<00:03:35.180> we<00:03:35.300> obviously<00:03:35.510> know<00:03:35.990> that<00:03:36.020> they're

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
ghosts we obviously know that they're

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.290

lot of people like competitive that

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.960 
lot of people like competitive that
scene<00:03:48.080> is<00:03:48.170> getting<00:03:48.380> huge<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:49.250> we<00:03:49.520> really<00:03:49.790> want

trickshotting side and they never
actually<00:03:53.060> talked<00:03:53.420> about<00:03:53.660> it<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.020> it<00:03:54.680> does<00:03:55.010> kind

some nice stuff that they implement it

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.080 
some nice stuff that they implement it
into<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.020> game<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.680> snipers<00:04:01.130> did<00:04:01.670> kind<00:04:01.970> of

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
into the game the snipers did kind of

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.990 
into the game the snipers did kind of
looks<00:04:02.360> like<00:04:03.370> different<00:04:04.370> in<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.610> game<00:04:04.790> like

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
looks like different in the game like

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.280 
looks like different in the game like
when<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.239> scope<00:04:05.540> in<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.900> looks<00:04:06.080> a<00:04:06.170> lot

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
when you scope in it looks a lot

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.229 
when you scope in it looks a lot
different<00:04:06.350> than<00:04:06.739> before<00:04:06.920> it's<00:04:07.880> not<00:04:08.030> something

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
different than before it's not something

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
really sure we haven't even played the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.320

game<00:04:11.450> yet<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:12.680> game<00:04:12.890> does<00:04:13.160> feel<00:04:13.370> like<00:04:13.550> n33<00:04:14.090> a

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.490
