animation<00:04:13.930> an<00:04:14.650> animatic<00:04:15.069> is<00:04:15.459> what<00:04:15.940> comes

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
animation an animatic is what comes

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.390 
animation an animatic is what comes
after<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.870> storyboards<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:17.650> before<00:04:18.160> the

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
actual animation it is mostly needed to

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.710 
actual animation it is mostly needed to
get<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.190> staging<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.060> timing<00:04:22.450> of<00:04:22.540> the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
scene correctly this way the possibility

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.360 
scene correctly this way the possibility
of<00:04:25.330> having<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:26.080> delete<00:04:26.350> an<00:04:26.500> entire<00:04:26.650> background

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
of having to delete an entire background

of having to delete an entire background
or<00:04:27.639> animation<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.479> turns<00:04:28.720> out<00:04:28.900> bad<00:04:29.169> is

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
or animation that turns out bad is

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.920 
or animation that turns out bad is
avoided<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.220> also<00:04:30.820> come<00:04:31.240> on<00:04:31.389> now<00:04:31.600> do<00:04:31.660> you

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
avoided and also come on now do you

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.480 
avoided and also come on now do you
really<00:04:32.139> think<00:04:32.410> this<00:04:32.710> would<00:04:32.979> be<00:04:33.040> something

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
really think this would be something

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.840 
really think this would be something
final<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.960> this<00:04:35.169> but<00:04:35.590> with<00:04:35.800> colors<00:04:36.160> this<00:04:36.580> is

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
final just this but with colors this is

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.879 
final just this but with colors this is
not<00:04:37.270> how<00:04:37.510> it's<00:04:37.660> going<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.870> look<00:04:37.990> like<00:04:38.050> do<00:04:38.770> you
