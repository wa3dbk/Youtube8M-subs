00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
feel like listening to I feel like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.600 
feel like listening to I feel like
aren't<00:01:36.470> completely<00:01:36.920> separate<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.370> feel<00:01:37.520> like

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
aren't completely separate I feel like

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.870 
aren't completely separate I feel like
they<00:01:37.730> can<00:01:37.909> kind<00:01:38.150> of<00:01:38.180> be<00:01:38.240> intertwined<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:40.430> I

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
they can kind of be intertwined and I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.490 
they can kind of be intertwined and I
think<00:01:41.060> it's<00:01:41.180> really<00:01:41.270> important<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.750> like<00:01:41.960> go

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
think it's really important to like go

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.740 
think it's really important to like go
with<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.830> flow<00:01:43.040> in<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.340> sense

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.090 

well<00:01:47.750> sometimes<00:01:48.110> lines<00:01:48.380> just<00:01:48.590> call<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:49.010> you

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
well sometimes lines just call to you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.219 
well sometimes lines just call to you
because<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:50.000> really<00:01:50.300> feel<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:50.510> flow<00:01:50.960> and

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
because you really feel that flow and

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.480 
because you really feel that flow and
like<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.680> feel<00:01:51.860> like<00:01:51.920> that's<00:01:52.159> what's<00:01:52.370> really

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
like I feel like that's what's really

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.430 
like I feel like that's what's really
beautiful<00:01:52.700> about<00:01:53.030> skiing<00:01:53.479> is<00:01:53.720> when<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.290> watch

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
beautiful about skiing is when you watch

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.020 
beautiful about skiing is when you watch
someone<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.010> they're<00:01:55.100> super<00:01:55.310> fluid<00:01:55.820> and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
someone and they're super fluid and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.210 
someone and they're super fluid and
they're<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.900> know<00:01:56.960> dropping<00:01:57.290> cliffs<00:01:57.680> or<00:01:58.010> just

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
they're you know dropping cliffs or just

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.100 
they're you know dropping cliffs or just
arcing<00:01:58.580> super-great<00:01:59.090> turns<00:01:59.450> but<00:01:59.750> you<00:02:00.020> know

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
arcing super-great turns but you know

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.630 
arcing super-great turns but you know
that<00:02:00.320> essential<00:02:00.890> flow<00:02:01.190> where<00:02:01.400> they're<00:02:01.520> not

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
that essential flow where they're not

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.610 
that essential flow where they're not
stopping<00:02:02.000> they<00:02:02.240> just<00:02:02.390> keep<00:02:02.570> going<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:02.960> really

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
stopping they just keep going is really

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.320 
stopping they just keep going is really
important<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.460> lot<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.760> times<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:05.030> do<00:02:05.090> use

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
important and so a lot of times I do use

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.090 
important and so a lot of times I do use
music<00:02:05.720> for<00:02:05.870> that<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.170> know<00:02:06.290> whatever<00:02:06.470> IQ<00:02:06.950> in

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
music for that you know whatever IQ in

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.400 
music for that you know whatever IQ in
that<00:02:07.280> day<00:02:07.490> can<00:02:08.420> play<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.660> big<00:02:08.869> part<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.260> just

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
that day can play a big part and just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.750 
that day can play a big part and just
kind<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.590> keeping<00:02:09.860> me<00:02:10.010> loose<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.459> through<00:02:10.640> it

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
kind of keeping me loose and through it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.280 
kind of keeping me loose and through it
and<00:02:10.940> ready<00:02:11.920> mother<00:02:12.920> don't<00:02:13.610> worry<00:02:13.880> she's<00:02:14.780> got<00:02:15.260> a
