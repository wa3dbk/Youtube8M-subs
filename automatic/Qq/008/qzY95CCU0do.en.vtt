00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
this so it's been really nice it's also

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.270 
this so it's been really nice it's also
quite<00:01:48.130> flexible<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.789> sides<00:01:49.979> I've<00:01:50.979> got<00:01:51.190> it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
quite flexible on the sides I've got it

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.109 
quite flexible on the sides I've got it
mounted<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.619> little<00:01:53.740> bit<00:01:53.920> lower<00:01:54.100> but<00:01:54.970> you

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
mounted going a little bit lower but you

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.290 
mounted going a little bit lower but you
can<00:01:55.240> flip<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.450> over<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:57.030> mount<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.149> the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
can flip it over to and mount it the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.850 
can flip it over to and mount it the
opposite<00:01:58.659> direction<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.570> I'm<00:02:01.750> mounting<00:02:02.710> the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
opposite direction so I'm mounting the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.190 
opposite direction so I'm mounting the
handle<00:02:03.100> bar<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:04.060> pretty<00:02:04.509> easy<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.899> I<00:02:07.960> didn't

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
handle bar it's pretty easy but I didn't

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.009 
handle bar it's pretty easy but I didn't
see<00:02:08.350> anything<00:02:08.530> online<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.570> was<00:02:10.690> kind<00:02:10.959> of

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
see anything online so it was kind of

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.430 
see anything online so it was kind of
confusing<00:02:11.680> at<00:02:12.190> first

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
confusing at first

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.569 
confusing at first
so<00:02:14.440> for<00:02:14.709> on<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:14.950> road<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.489> doing

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
so for on the road and doing
