viable in this and then you want to go

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
viable in this and then you want to go
over<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.240> common<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.240> no<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:54.020> where<00:01:55.020> is

born<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.760> thingy<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.350> can<00:02:16.680> set<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.220> set

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
born a thingy so you can set you can set

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.250 
born a thingy so you can set you can set
this<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.910> all<00:02:18.120> sorts<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.540> things<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.020> you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
this to do all sorts of things and you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.040 
this to do all sorts of things and you
can<00:02:19.800> set<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> go<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.030> side<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.660> down

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
can set it to go to the side and down

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.290 
can set it to go to the side and down
and<00:02:22.500> stuff<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.790> want<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.270> your

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
and stuff so if you want this in your

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.010 
and stuff so if you want this in your
ceiling<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.500> don't<00:02:25.650> want<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.010> be<00:02:26.100> seen

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
ceiling and you don't want it to be seen

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.060 
ceiling and you don't want it to be seen
but<00:02:28.020> at<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.140> moment<00:02:28.470> we're<00:02:28.590> going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.920> just

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
but at the moment we're going to just

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.130 
but at the moment we're going to just
set<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.460> three<00:02:29.790> which<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.060> some<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> did

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
set it to three which is some what I did

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.170 
set it to three which is some what I did
with<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.380> one<00:02:31.770> other<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.640> other<00:02:32.850> one<00:02:33.060> over

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
with that one other that other one over

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.020 
with that one other that other one over
there<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:34.290> we'll<00:02:34.860> set<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.400> three<00:02:35.760> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
there so we'll set that to three and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.840 
there so we'll set that to three and
we'll<00:02:36.720> set<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> max<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.530> spawn<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.130> an<00:02:38.220> area<00:02:38.610> to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
we'll set the max to spawn in an area to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.550 
we'll set the max to spawn in an area to
one<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:40.650> want<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.010> make<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.910> ticks<00:02:42.560> now

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
one and you want to make the ticks now

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.860 
one and you want to make the ticks now
these<00:02:43.860> don't<00:02:44.070> really<00:02:44.340> matter<00:02:44.520> but<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.090> will<00:02:45.630> set

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
these don't really matter but I will set

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.210 
these don't really matter but I will set
that<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.320> 100<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.550> spawns<00:02:47.910> quickly<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:50.070> it

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
that to 100 so it spawns quickly so it

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.070 
that to 100 so it spawns quickly so it
takes<00:02:50.459> twenty<00:02:50.820> six<00:02:51.000> twenty<00:02:51.300> text<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> spawn

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
takes twenty six twenty text to spawn

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.600 
takes twenty six twenty text to spawn
which<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.440> twenty<00:02:52.739> redstone<00:02:53.130> tix<00:02:53.400> in

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
which is twenty redstone tix in

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.690 
which is twenty redstone tix in
minecraft<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.350> which<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.530> 20<00:02:55.950> ticks<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.340> how

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
minecraft and which is 20 ticks of how

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.449 
minecraft and which is 20 ticks of how

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.750 
far the sun's gone and everything your
minecraft<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.030> ticks<00:03:00.450> it's<00:03:00.989> not<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.459> second<00:03:02.459> or

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
minecraft is ticks it's not a second or

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.160 
minecraft is ticks it's not a second or
I<00:03:03.260> don't<00:03:04.260> know<00:03:04.440> what<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:06.170> not

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
I don't know what it is it's a it's not

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.250 
I don't know what it is it's a it's not
like<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.500> millisecond<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:08.340> it's<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.870> slower

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
like a millisecond but it's it's slower

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.170 
like a millisecond but it's it's slower
it's<00:03:10.739> faster<00:03:11.130> than<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.310> second<00:03:11.670> it's<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:12.120> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
it's faster than a second it's like a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.410 
it's faster than a second it's like a
weird<00:03:13.430> third<00:03:14.430> or<00:03:14.700> something<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.270> I'm

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
weird third or something like that I'm

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.600 
weird third or something like that I'm
not<00:03:15.540> sure<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.739> can<00:03:16.920> change<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.370> play

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
not sure you can change the play

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.070 
not sure you can change the play
detection<00:03:18.120> range<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.630> can<00:03:18.720> change<00:03:18.989> a

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
detection range you can change a

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.830 
detection range you can change a
spawning<00:03:19.380> range<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.950> I'll<00:03:20.040> change<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.549> I

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
spawning range and I'll change that I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.880 
spawning range and I'll change that I
think<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.080> leave<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.290> because<00:03:22.769> I've

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
think you can leave that because I've

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.080 
think you can leave that because I've
got<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.330> positioning<00:03:24.330> mode<00:03:24.510> on<00:03:24.810> actually<00:03:25.769> I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
got the positioning mode on actually I

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.840 
got the positioning mode on actually I
will<00:03:27.090> set<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.480> relative<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.610> what<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:29.730> do

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
will set it to relative and what you do

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.960 
will set it to relative and what you do
there<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.239> then<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.570> just<00:03:30.780> click<00:03:30.959> filter<00:03:31.410> and

there and then you just click filter and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.539 
there and then you just click filter and
such<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.870> here<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.290> guys<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.799> working<00:03:35.280> gas
