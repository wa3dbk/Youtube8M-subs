00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.140
 How are you going to solve now? 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.310
 question 23 the military fire department did not 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.179
 with the cost and missiles 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.349
 they are the next day 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.639
 It is estimated that Brazil has said 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.639
 5% of its gross domestic product 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.050
 with the air corruption 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.839
 are 72 billion reais 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.289
 more than is spent on education 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.349
 according to this data gives the gross domestic product 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.650
 of Brazil 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.880
 I want to call attention is that one thing 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.480
 in the harvests here 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.410
 are 72 billion reais 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.220
 comma 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.700
 it's a shame either 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.790
 maniche of what is spent on education that is a fraction 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.630
 here is another deadline 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.730
 more 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.090
 in green spm math are more to add only that who counts the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.280
 preparation of 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.240
 to fifths and following stock 72 billion reais the product 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.720
 It is estimated that in Brazil it loses 5% 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.810
 is 72 billion reais 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.470
 more than the letter-commitment 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.869
 Education is avoided if this pec here 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.869
 is the seaside and what if it is spent with education 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.130
 the album 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.700
 in 5% 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.960
 is 72 5% in the internal product is equal 72 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.720
 Let's settle here. 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.810
 she seemed to go 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.039
 and the following the Brazilian pib is difficult 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.930
 he says the following 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.930
 5% of this value 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.780
 is diverted Brazil loses 5% its pib 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.190
 5% say isaiah rabbit multiply 5 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.660
 the center 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.350
 which implies for chips 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.750
 this here at 5% of x it also says that this value 5 7 x 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.170
 mare 72 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.890
 billions of reais 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 on here 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.979
 five per cent of its gross domestic product with corruption 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.919
 they demand are 72 billion reais 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.599
 that is to say 1 72 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.989
 the question is in accordance with this data would be the gross domestic product of the 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.399
 Brazil he wants to calculate xix 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.399
 let's calculate chinese 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:38.419
 5% let this international product 5 be decisive 72 25% holiday 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.039
 about 20 years ago 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.229
 with the columnist here 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.239
 I would have them that 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.699
 is equal to 72 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.089
 I'll take that fraction to multiplication 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.449
 I adored her on the other hand life is almost as 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.619
 the five of the multiplying the Chinese it will pass from life going the saints 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:02.839
 It divides the x it replaces by multiplying 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:05.029
 I will stay 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.399
 thus 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:10.599
 always money 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.489
 our multiplying 72 sit and click sort of revide renault 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.639
 OK 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.209
 chile will be the same 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.209
 without divided by 5 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.830
 we will have 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.309
 20 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.309
 until now they are utopian 72 times 20 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.589
 multiply with a number that has 0 and you are prompted for it at the end 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.329
 and now I'm going to do 2002 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.169
 4 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.979
 and 2 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.369
 you have 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:51.789
 14 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:52.930
 this here 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.599
 it's given to me 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.019
 billion 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.069
 In SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil is the foot of the Brazilian people who are like this today. 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.170
 my 7 44 billion 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.009
 and the question 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.769
 only we always focused on filar we have not got here we have a viva 44 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.729
 trillions 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.739
 this is the following 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.809
 144 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.529
 $ 54 billion 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.749
 we do here normal in reais would stay 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.509
 the motto of the piece you promised in your vote 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.509
 three more house 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.509
 and it gave me 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.509
 three more houses ready until I 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.210
 nolan 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.430
 billion are missing three more ready 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.620
 here until friend's house 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.240
 millions 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.180
 thousands 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.050
 millions 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.460
 billion 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.860
 to transform into trillions 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.490
 three more casinos 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.440
 three more than china is what i have 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.380
 that 500 million for 3 2 your missing three beasts came vow 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.559
 Two friends come here. 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.559
 as soon as I have 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.009
 the government to 44 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 trillions 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.009
 Isis and then due not only to have made we can finish the year we 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.610
 stayed at 44 the same as here she enters 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.809
 23 letter (s) to be checked 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:43.809
 are 23 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.460
 did not go in 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:49.420
 that's it 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.050
 to the next
