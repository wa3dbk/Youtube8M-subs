00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
thought some pictures on google and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.250 
thought some pictures on google and
maybe<00:00:29.640> someone<00:00:30.029> then<00:00:30.840> will<00:00:31.200> be<00:00:31.910> upgraded<00:00:32.910> soon

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
maybe someone then will be upgraded soon

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.400 
maybe someone then will be upgraded soon
some<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.559> them<00:00:35.100> are<00:00:35.809> upgraded<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:37.019> now<00:00:37.199> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
some of them are upgraded right now and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
some of them are upgraded right now and
we<00:00:37.859> start<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.280> Goblin<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.179> see<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
we start with the Goblin you see the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.380 
we start with the Goblin you see the
Goblin<00:00:39.870> level<00:00:40.170> 6<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:41.129> side<00:00:41.429> I<00:00:41.699> think

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
Goblin level 6 on the right side I think

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.470 
Goblin level 6 on the right side I think
the<00:00:42.570> green<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> better<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:44.239> well<00:00:45.239> who

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the green one is better but well who

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.310 
the green one is better but well who
cares<00:00:45.859> some<00:00:46.910> difference<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.510> important

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
cares some difference is not important

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.880 
cares some difference is not important
anymore<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:51.210> next<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> dragon<00:00:52.499> we

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
anymore the next one is the dragon we

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.619 
anymore the next one is the dragon we
have<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.239> red<00:00:54.239> dragon<00:00:54.929> the<00:00:55.079> fire<00:00:55.350> dragon<00:00:56.629> there

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
have a red dragon the fire dragon there

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.799 
have a red dragon the fire dragon there
I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> looks<00:00:58.679> like<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.269> dragon<00:01:00.269> from<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
I think it looks like the dragon from a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.100 
I think it looks like the dragon from a
lot<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.379> rings<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.190> Hobbit<00:01:02.550> film<00:01:03.110> looks

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
lot of rings when you Hobbit film looks

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.469 
lot of rings when you Hobbit film looks
great<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.439> good<00:01:07.439> stuff<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:09.270> we

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
great and good stuff right there then we

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.649 
great and good stuff right there then we
have<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.899> a<00:01:09.930> Pico<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.829> have<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> ultra<00:01:11.939> but

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
have to not a Pico we have a ultra but

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.639 
have to not a Pico we have a ultra but
you<00:01:12.869> eyes<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.340> level<00:01:14.700> 4<00:01:15.030> pika<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.990> I

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
you eyes then the level 4 pika and I

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.090 
you eyes then the level 4 pika and I
think<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.240> not<00:01:18.240> important<00:01:18.750> because

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
think it's not important because

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.740 
think it's not important because
everyone<00:01:20.100> used<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.700> whatever<00:01:21.000> free<00:01:21.360> pika

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
everyone used with whatever free pika

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.160 
everyone used with whatever free pika
and<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.170> maybe<00:01:22.860> too<00:01:23.040> strong<00:01:23.990> there<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.140> have

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and it's maybe too strong there we have

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.520 
and it's maybe too strong there we have
loaded<00:01:25.469> six<00:01:25.860> claws<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.630> level<00:01:27.930> six<00:01:28.140> giant

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
loaded six claws so the level six giant

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.039 
loaded six claws so the level six giant
but<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> already<00:01:30.060> won<00:01:30.299> maybe<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
but we are a way of already won maybe it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.999 
but we are a way of already won maybe it
is<00:01:31.170> level<00:01:31.619> 71<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.369> all<00:01:33.140> was<00:01:34.140> bigger<00:01:34.439> app<00:01:34.710> as

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009

the level 61 as you can see in right

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.520 
the level 61 as you can see in right
corner<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.750> healer<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
corner then we are for healer and the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
corner then we are for healer and the
healer<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.039> cool<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.969> so<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.289> can

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
turn to the dark heater it makes damage

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.139

cool to see something like that with a

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.500 
cool to see something like that with a
test<00:03:05.780> on<00:03:05.959> it<00:03:06.020> or<00:03:06.440> against<00:03:07.400> spells<00:03:07.970> against<00:03:08.390> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that wouldn't give a very do it then we

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.039 
that wouldn't give a very do it then we
have<00:03:13.850> some<00:03:14.120> can<00:03:14.420> level<00:03:14.900> 12<00:03:15.250> maybe<00:03:16.900> not<00:03:17.900> the

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
have some can level 12 maybe not the

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.850

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
great and you can update I think it's

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.420 
great and you can update I think it's
more<00:03:24.950> important<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.519> upgrade<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:27.100> motor<00:03:28.100> or

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
more important to upgrade the motor or

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.650 
more important to upgrade the motor or
the<00:03:29.180> wizard<00:03:29.540> tower<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:31.180> very<00:03:32.180> important

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
the wizard tower and the very important

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.229 
the wizard tower and the very important
thing<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.620> see<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.860> ship<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:35.030> it's

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
thing is you see a ship and it's

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.479 
thing is you see a ship and it's
very<00:03:35.570> cool<00:03:35.930> because<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.799> can<00:03:36.830> attack<00:03:37.310> them

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
very cool because you can attack them

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.860 
very cool because you can attack them

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
from the water site and make it they are

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.800 
from the water site and make it they are
like<00:03:42.049> troops<00:03:42.500> um<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.640> that<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.269> have<00:03:44.390> to

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
like troops um so that you have to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.910
