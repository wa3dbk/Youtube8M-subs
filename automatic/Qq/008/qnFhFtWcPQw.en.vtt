our giveaway so there's a there's a line
but<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> figured<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.170> since<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.590> had<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.920> in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
but I figured that since we had it in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.229 
but I figured that since we had it in
our<00:00:41.040> possession<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.700> would<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> good<00:00:42.090> idea

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
our possession it would be a good idea

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.250 
our possession it would be a good idea

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it says it quite small on purpose

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.070 
it says it quite small on purpose
azimuth<00:01:23.280> watch<00:01:23.460> company<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.810> can't

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
azimuth watch company but you can't

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.690 
azimuth watch company but you can't
really<00:01:25.200> tell<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.830> they<00:01:25.950> made<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.400> there

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
really tell and so they made it so there

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.039 
really tell and so they made it so there
is<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:27.000> branding<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:27.840> very

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
is some branding but it's not very

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.859 
is some branding but it's not very
visible<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.030> dial<00:01:30.299> itself<00:01:30.750> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
visible I like that the dial itself is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.410 
visible I like that the dial itself is
actually<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.259> brown<00:01:31.650> color<00:01:32.070> which<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.909> unique<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
actually a brown color which is unique I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
actually a brown color which is unique I
think<00:01:33.450> that's<00:01:33.780> very<00:01:33.990> interesting<00:01:34.290> almost<00:01:35.009> all

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
think that's very interesting almost all

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.789 
think that's very interesting almost all
of<00:01:35.189> these<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.549> black<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.170> brown<00:01:37.470> with

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
of these are black so it's brown with

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.230 
of these are black so it's brown with
this<00:01:37.950> sort<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.930> tan<00:01:40.820> cream-colored<00:01:41.820> hands<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
this sort of tan cream-colored hands and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.620 
this sort of tan cream-colored hands and
our<00:01:42.360> indicators<00:01:43.460> very<00:01:44.460> much<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.909> pilot<00:01:45.420> watch

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
our indicators very much a pilot watch

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
our indicators very much a pilot watch
and<00:01:45.869> style<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.409> mean<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.890> no<00:01:47.100> denying<00:01:47.850> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and style I mean this is no denying this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.550 
and style I mean this is no denying this
I<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> case<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.170> thick

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
I like that the case is not that thick

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.679 
I like that the case is not that thick
it's<00:01:49.979> relatively<00:01:50.759> thin<00:01:51.060> which<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.509> nice

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
it's relatively thin which is nice

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.590 
it's relatively thin which is nice
inside<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.920> watch<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> manually<00:01:54.360> round

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
inside of this watch is a manually round

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.690 
inside of this watch is a manually round
movement<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.409> actually<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> vintage

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
movement it's actually a vintage

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.359 
movement it's actually a vintage
movement<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:58.159> probably<00:01:59.159> at

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
movement that I think is probably at

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.429 
movement that I think is probably at
least<00:01:59.430> 40<00:01:59.820> or<00:01:59.909> 50<00:02:00.149> years<00:02:00.360> old<00:02:00.570> new<00:02:01.079> old<00:02:01.350> stock

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
least 40 or 50 years old new old stock

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.889 
least 40 or 50 years old new old stock
so<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.100> azimuth<00:02:03.090> did<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.420> they<00:02:03.540> took<00:02:03.719> these

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
so it's azimuth did is they took these

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.469 
so it's azimuth did is they took these
movements<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.619> batch<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.490> them<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:06.119> create<00:02:06.390> this

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
movements a batch of them to create this

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.449 
movements a batch of them to create this
limited-edition<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.190> said<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
limited-edition this is like I said the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.430 
limited-edition this is like I said the
6<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.879> version<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> Bob<00:02:09.539> deer<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.259> not

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
6 of the version of the Bob deer so not

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.170 
6 of the version of the Bob deer so not
all<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.679> those<00:02:10.950> watches<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> movement

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
all of those watches have this movement

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.699 
all of those watches have this movement
but<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.390> particular<00:02:12.840> version<00:02:12.989> does<00:02:13.379> so<00:02:13.590> it's

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
but this particular version does so it's

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.150 
but this particular version does so it's
kind<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.890> cool

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.030 
buffalo I believe so it has that kind of
hard<00:02:41.760> leather<00:02:42.660> look<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.560> kind<00:02:43.980> of
