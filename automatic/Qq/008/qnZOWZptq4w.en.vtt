00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
file so I'm not sure I haven't tried but

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.229 
file so I'm not sure I haven't tried but
backup<00:00:38.250> your<00:00:38.399> files<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.090> going

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
backup your files because this is going

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.670
