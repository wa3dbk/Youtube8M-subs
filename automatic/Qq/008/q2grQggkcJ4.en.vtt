00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.030
 perfect micro test men I have a good 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.420
 and bad news the bad 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.980
 news 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.539
 what I'm going to tell you will come up 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.279
 more questions than will come from 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.420
 answer the good news for you one 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.670
 I only have three minutes 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.350
 I'm just al haouz and I'm doing 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.029
 magic and psychology and that's 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.590
 great because magic use 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.790
 the neutral mechanisms do you our 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.500
 brain and student psychology 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.300
 I will show you with my ring everything 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.149
 the world must the ring look good 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.750
 that's how it works 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:45.059
 do not laugh I see is not you 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.129
 deceived your brain did it for me 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.860
 I just leave the tray on my 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.300
 finger yet some of you 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.620
 will have imagined it not these two moms 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 a good point is because your 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.800
 brain lice the information in 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.730
 from his environment of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.520
 consistent way 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.980
 in the end we do not see and perceive 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.739
 than what we expect to see and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 to perceive and it is necessary since 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.590
 our attention is limited our 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.670
 Warning 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.650
 this ability that we have to 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.510
 select and maintain in the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.790
 consciousness a sap an event or a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.990
 thought she is limited to the point that she 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.180
 can not follow both my hand 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.250
 right my left hand and my ring and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.590
 yet we can humans drive 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.140
 cars fly planes handle 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.680
 nuclear power plants how is this 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.560
 possible 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.880
 do not panic our brain works 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.040
 excessively well so 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 automatic 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.920
 if you happen to drive a car 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.299
 in discussing and that your passage and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.829
 it's thanks to your experience of 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.570
 conduct that allows you to perform 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.850
 complex actions like passing 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.500
 speeds maintain your pace without 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.119
 even be aware of it 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.210
 you can use your attention 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.229
 for the conversation imagine now 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.329
 as you rolled on a plate of 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.829
 ice and rats foot the situation 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.750
 is no longer quite familiar 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.520
 and it is unfortunately possible that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.240
 your reaction at this moment does not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.240
 not the most appropriate 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.070
 so we touch 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.960
 the essential thing is the paradox of 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.670
 presence of human beings in 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.190
 complex industrial systems 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.300
 this presence is fundamental because our 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.770
 brain remains much stronger than a 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.970
 nate hours to improvise 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.280
 reactions to these situations 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.130
 unforeseen but that does not hide the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.600
 fact that these degraded situations are 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.660
 those facing which our brain is 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.460
 the least well armed through our 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.410
 imagination we could bring back 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.080
 the crew of Apollo 13 safe and sound 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.050
 on earth and at times the accident 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.330
 happens we talk about human errors 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.010
 yet understand the functioning of 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.560
 our brain its strengths and its 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.270
 weaknesses is fundamental this has 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.340
 allowed after years of work 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.410
 of engineer of psychologists 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.420
 the ergonomists sociologist to conceive 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.850
 safer systems is as well 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.290
 saved thousands of lives 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.460
 how unfortunately this is a point 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.950
 that I should leave in suspense this 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.300
 evening since before I stop I you 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.460
 have an apology I lied to you at 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.230
 beginning raised more questions than 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.920
 brings answers that's the essence 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.080
 science 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.060
 it was the good news the bad 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.060
 new I only had three minutes 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.320
 very good fall we would have liked that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.270
 continues indeed does that messi 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.550
 if we take a camera and then we 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.290
 replay the movie in slow motion with 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.150
 different speeds than at a time 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.890
 given even a human being would have 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.630
 realized that your ring remained 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.390
 on your back this is the process 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.430
 of learning does that surprise the 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.500
 brain will very quickly make it 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.820
 finally known phenomenon since you 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.890
 go watch then watch and then 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.330
 look and you will end up 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.840
 to learn and when to learn to drive 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.780
 a car 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.130
 it's very hard and after a few years 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.780
 a few thousand kilometers 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.250
 we can discuss while driving so well 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.390
 sure our brain to take is like 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.080
 we manage nuclear power plants 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.240
 or fly rockets yes then 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.650
 it's fictional in me I do not have you too much 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.360
 early the army in front of it really does 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.510
 think about man in space then 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.490
 man or robots to go explore 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.000
 near you to explore new 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.640
 planets 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.350
 I bet on the man and as I 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.709
 say the presence of humans in the 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.440
 systems is essential since in 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.050
 degraded mode the human brain is going 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.130
 can operate its automation these 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.860
 talent regulations and his knowledge 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.960
 to invent news 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.790
 solutions and we are able today 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.560
 to take off a plane to do it 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.790
 fly and have it pose all that with 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.800
 a flight simulator but I do not you 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.540
 do not learn why do we keep 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.090
 pilots because when the situation 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.570
 out of the programming domain of 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.010
 computer 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.050
 and remember that the plane will have been 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.320
 built and the board computer 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.640
 programmed by a human it will take this 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.560
 human brain to invent a 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.850
 solution is for example to put a plane 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.130
 from american airlines on hudson 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.290
 what a computer would not have 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.700
 may not have known how to do good if you 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.660
 win claudie will give you the prize 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.660
 because here not 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:12.740
 I would like to extend the question 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:14.749
 previous in actions what you 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.919
 talk spend it and timing 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:20.840
 because finally ironing pass again 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.569
 and ironing things down but 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.610
 all go to what in microseconds 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.900
 and there are a number of things that 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.689
 can be done in nano seconds or 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.509
 even smaller smaller ones 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.439
 so how how does the man that he 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.490
 place in there 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:39.199
 finally it is still too slow 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.120
 it's a very good note is 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.939
 actually there is this question of 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.379
 speed and we know the phenomenon of 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:46.789
 retinal persistence that makes a 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:47.960
 together the moving picture pass 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.219
 quickly enough gives us 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.960
 the impression of seeing a movie and a 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:52.639
 animation continues so there are some 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.740
 physiological problems that make by 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.409
 example that our brain is less well 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.599
 equipped to operate at 130 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.150
 kilometers / hour 140 150 for the most 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.770
 reckless and 160 for the outlaws 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.659
 when you're driving 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.250
 our brain receives more image than this 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.110
 that he has got used to over 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.599
 thousands of years of our evolution of 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.560
 receive at 160 compared to five km 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.479
 time when I walk so actually 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.490
 it depresses physiological but there is a 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.490
 even more important question is 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.149
 that the crew of the infamous flight 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.849
 air france 447 rio paris heard 88 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:28.069
 information times staels times talent 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.229
 stall stall stall that 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.310
 the onboard computer send him this so 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.960
 is not a matter of time of 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.759
 perception of the message it is a 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.770
 question of strength and weakness of the 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.210
 brain that I evoked which one needs 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.689
 be aware in the design of the 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.310
 system and not just physiological 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.960
 so they heard 80 this 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.279
 information is unfortunately their 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.930
 diagnosis of action could not 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.860
 use it wisely is what we 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.169
 call the tunnel effect 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.069
 he was convinced that what they 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.219
 heard were not in the process of 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.219
 pass 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.949
 no
