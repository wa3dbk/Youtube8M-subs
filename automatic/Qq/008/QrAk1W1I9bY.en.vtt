to<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:58.980> glove<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.399> mean<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.609> love<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.940> glove

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
to this glove I mean I love this glove

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.400 
to this glove I mean I love this glove
and<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.660> said<00:01:00.719> I've<00:01:00.899> been<00:01:00.930> using<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> for

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and like I said I've been using it for

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.619 
and like I said I've been using it for
years<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> only<00:01:02.219> downside<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.940> when

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
years but the only downside is that when

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.299 
years but the only downside is that when
I<00:01:03.660> hit<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> heavy<00:01:04.140> bag<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.949> does<00:01:05.129> hurt

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I hit the heavy bag with it it does hurt

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.429 
I hit the heavy bag with it it does hurt
my<00:01:05.460> hand<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.119> since<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
my hand you know I think since it's so

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.100 
my hand you know I think since it's so
compact<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.549> forming<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.180> my<00:01:09.299> hand<00:01:09.570> it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
compact and forming to my hand it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.719 
compact and forming to my hand it
doesn't<00:01:10.470> give<00:01:10.560> my<00:01:10.710> hand<00:01:11.130> enough<00:01:11.310> room<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
doesn't give my hand enough room and I

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.219 
doesn't give my hand enough room and I
can't<00:01:12.000> hit<00:01:12.180> flush<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.810> four<00:01:13.020> knuckles

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
can't hit flush with all four knuckles

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.890 
can't hit flush with all four knuckles
so<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> couple<00:01:15.180> rounds<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> bag

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
so if I do go a couple rounds on the bag

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
so if I do go a couple rounds on the bag
I<00:01:16.110> will<00:01:16.380> feel<00:01:16.740> some<00:01:17.400> pain<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.729> my<00:01:17.790> notebook<00:01:18.090> but

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
I will feel some pain in my notebook but

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
I will feel some pain in my notebook but
that's<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.600> they're<00:01:18.840> designed<00:01:18.990> for

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that's because they're designed for

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.630 
that's because they're designed for
sparring<00:01:19.560> they're<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:19.950> designed<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
sparring they're not designed for the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.240 
sparring they're not designed for the
bag<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.479> what<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.840> your<00:01:21.869> response<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.100> this
