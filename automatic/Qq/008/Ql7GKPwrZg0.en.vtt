00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.350
 Oh, sell something. 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.350
 Mam ermam 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.170
 you 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.170
 give 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.960
 There will be a detailed schedule for blogs and teams, 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:27.490
 Hence, I was able to change the schedule accordingly 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.820
 Now kkophin national situation is different and I think that the ego was distressed and 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:35.560
 There will be an experience like this, and fans will 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:40.450
 Gonna have focused much of their 60 games left the tournament finals was a lot of expectation 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:45.160
 I think it was clear now because I was hurt. 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.970
 Well, a lot of fans have been a little disappointed in that sort of thing . 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.120
 And 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:54.420
 This is a situation where the controversy is enough . 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.420
 Can I now understand that you are in the film holding 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.580
 Of course , I think it's the conclusion I had to endure myself. 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:08.840
 Anyway, you are an individual . 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:13.100
 I have chosen to win the championship because there is something like that falling 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:17.720
 But for the individual, lg is a little more like that now . 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.520
 Tha There is also seen a fairly large scale sent every spring cups 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:27.580
 If you play top-rated professional game, 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.580
 I think that as a choice, I can get enough energy. 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:38.780
 There can certainly criticize the little humble about learning about this.They to 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.650
 Also accept the idea that you must be a reference, and should take a look at the following 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.200
 I do not think it's a good idea to be honest. 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.040
 Lee, Seung - Hyun players and maybe even fall 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.210
 Anyway , did you think that mag is more important than date ? 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.900
 It seems to be entered to determine what this does Lee Seung Hwan-digit transplantation in Yonsei 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.850
 I do not have a dream player who is vacant, 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:06.650
 Doengeol'm aware why've pepper For something a judgment on their own judgment 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:11.330
 It is not something that has happened, 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:15.710
 I'll be buying ol exhausted to hard it happened now four and now 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:20.630
 I got my score. I think it's a score. 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:24.170
 I do not know the credibility now , but I do not think there's a score. 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:28.160
 I think this is probably why there is much point saying even point allergies 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.690
 Since the stinkbirds are much higher, it is natural that they should go there. 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.290
 I'm a professional gamer. 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.500
 Not act for himself who's not going to mean whats the cloth 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.220
 So what is it that you have there and see what I could dry up 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.900
 Lee Se-eun any player I probably would have got so I could write so 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.440
 I do what I want to do . 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.550
 That's not going obvious you do not know I have to do so again 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.910
 Talking is not about having such a mind, but about what they blame 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.000
 I 'm sure it will be accepted. 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.450
 We have to pay twice as much for the game. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.580
 When another kept because it was getting a lot more these days, even abroad to be about 1 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:08.180
 Anyway, this case can be 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.690
 This is what happens, because it can happen. 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.489
 I do not think the players early so bad about it, even wealth 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.450
 About fans who blame 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:21.080
 Of course, you have to take that part of your life. 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.209
 Also , we have to deal with several other companies to prevent this from happening. 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.989
 Where you are 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.340
 Yireongeo'll be good to write a coordinating care once the professional game in perspective 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.320
 I want you to think. 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.140
 Anyway, why do professional gamers go out to clear the Jed Temple and now have a big title 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.760
 Follow not come to the country which was and is not critical water 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.630
 It is also important to leave, but the individual thinks that the tournament is about two 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.490
 You'll be there. 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:50.480
 For this reason it has cares tha I will be giving a bad place 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:54.650
 The best professional gamer , you know, 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.100
 I'm going to make it hard for some people to be criticized, 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.720
 After all, it had risen to the top spot is yet to lead to so many now 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.310
 Maybe it's because fans are watching the good performances of their hearts. 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.090
 I wish I was. 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.840
 In writing about the criticism care eopgetjiman the need to insist on its performance 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.230
 Since those accusations also talk to the players interested in are counted humbly 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.840
 Accept and double the triple effort over those many more 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.100
 When it comes to meeting a great performance, 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.630
 The minds of those who think that the rain can make me dance . 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.889
 I will cheer for all future games . Perl t 1 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:36.360
 Lee Seung-Hyun I am a professional gamer who has been living for a long time. 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:40.139
 If now such that they are a little more important when the competition schedule override 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.190
 I have to choose the competition . 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.940
 Once haeteotneunde's important that if you select the one you reluctant opposite 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.600
 I did remember to eat even the bath there is not support on behalf of the others are low 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.530
 That's why professional gamers always have to carry all my stuff 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.960
 That's why I have never been able to do this myself , 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:04.590
 I think that would be no wonder that the opinion of the blame, but it 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:09.030
 This is the process of growing up and Lee Seung-hyun is in the best position right now 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.479
 I do not think it's too shrinking because it's because I'm rewarded for my performance. 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.479
 It's Haiti. 

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:27.479
