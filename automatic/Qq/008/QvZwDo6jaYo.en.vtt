recent items and applications change you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.109 
recent items and applications change you
can<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.689> more<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.110> less<00:01:42.380> you'd<00:01:43.380> have

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
can have more or less you'd have

can have more or less you'd have
smoothing<00:01:45.119> most<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.509> these<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.780> completely

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
smoothing most of these are completely

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.480 
smoothing most of these are completely
normal<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.799> wouldn't<00:01:47.040> worry<00:01:47.189> too<00:01:47.340> much

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
normal so I wouldn't worry too much

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
preferences which I really like

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.640 
preferences which I really like
particularly<00:05:15.820> if<00:05:16.030> you've<00:05:16.210> got<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:18.960> Mac<00:05:19.960> Mouse

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
particularly if you've got a Mac Mouse

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.909 
particularly if you've got a Mac Mouse
one<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.250> the<00:05:21.370> new<00:05:21.669> mighty<00:05:22.000> Mouse's<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.919> that

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
one of the new mighty Mouse's and that

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.480 
one of the new mighty Mouse's and that
is<00:05:24.070> how<00:05:24.340> you<00:05:24.400> determine<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.930> mouse<00:05:26.620> button<00:05:27.220> so

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
is how you determine the mouse button so

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.909 
is how you determine the mouse button so
you've<00:05:27.610> got<00:05:27.760> keyboards<00:05:28.650> don't<00:05:29.650> worry<00:05:29.830> about

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
you've got keyboards don't worry about

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.690 
you've got keyboards don't worry about
that<00:05:30.160> too<00:05:30.340> much<00:05:30.370> that's<00:05:30.789> fine<00:05:31.150> as<00:05:31.330> it<00:05:31.450> is<00:05:32.700> the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
that too much that's fine as it is the

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.969 
that too much that's fine as it is the
primary<00:05:34.030> button<00:05:34.660> I<00:05:34.900> like<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.530> be<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.800> left

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
primary button I like to be the left

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.040 
primary button I like to be the left
button<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.789> that<00:05:36.940> means<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.360> first<00:05:37.599> click

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
button and that means the first click

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.400 
button and that means the first click
that<00:05:38.320> you<00:05:38.470> make<00:05:38.680> is<00:05:39.039> a<00:05:39.099> left<00:05:40.410> secondary

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
that you make is a left secondary

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.450 
that you make is a left secondary
buttons<00:05:41.740> are<00:05:41.950> bright

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
buttons are bright

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.909 
buttons are bright
okay<00:05:43.030> so<00:05:43.090> I've<00:05:43.570> changed<00:05:44.050> that<00:05:44.139> to<00:05:44.440> secondary

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
okay so I've changed that to secondary

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.680 
okay so I've changed that to secondary
that<00:05:45.099> initially<00:05:45.580> is<00:05:45.700> primary<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:46.360> that<00:05:46.510> means

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
that initially is primary so that means

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.230 
that initially is primary so that means
if<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:47.020> click<00:05:47.830> on<00:05:47.979> its<00:05:48.130> secondary<00:05:48.580> I'll<00:05:48.910> end<00:05:49.150> up

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
if I click on its secondary I'll end up

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.480 
if I click on its secondary I'll end up
getting<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:52.110> whole<00:05:53.110> menu<00:05:53.500> of<00:05:53.740> things<00:05:54.130> that<00:05:54.370> I

in<00:06:17.450> the<00:06:17.660> Mac<00:06:18.610> scrolling<00:06:19.610> I've<00:06:19.970> got<00:06:20.150> a<00:06:20.180> 360

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
in the Mac scrolling I've got a 360

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.780 
in the Mac scrolling I've got a 360
degrees<00:06:21.230> I<00:06:21.590> think<00:06:22.130> it<00:06:22.340> makes<00:06:22.490> a<00:06:22.610> lot<00:06:22.760> of

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
degrees I think it makes a lot of

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.070 
degrees I think it makes a lot of
difference<00:06:23.180> here<00:06:23.420> you've<00:06:23.630> got<00:06:23.750> a<00:06:23.780> choice<00:06:24.020> here

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
difference here you've got a choice here

vertical horizontal I just leave it at
360<00:06:28.130> I<00:06:28.310> tend<00:06:29.090> to<00:06:29.210> like<00:06:29.420> the<00:06:29.780> tracking<00:06:30.140> to<00:06:30.440> be

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
360 I tend to like the tracking to be

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.520 
360 I tend to like the tracking to be
fast<00:06:31.360> scarlet<00:06:32.360> to<00:06:32.450> be<00:06:32.570> fast<00:06:32.870> and<00:06:33.230> that<00:06:33.380> I'm
