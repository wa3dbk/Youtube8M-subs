 with a new challenge that does not sword and good 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.350
 this challenge caught my attention because of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.990
 that not many have uploaded it I thought 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.689
 original and is not as hardcore as others 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.279

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.070

 it's a bit complicated not impossible 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 complicated as all the challenges 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.899
 complicated ones more than others 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.809

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.820
