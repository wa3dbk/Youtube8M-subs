video you saw the last one actually it
was<00:00:14.670> almost<00:00:14.820> looking<00:00:15.210> like<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.420> full<00:00:15.719> car<00:00:16.520> I<00:00:17.520> had

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
was almost looking like a full car I had

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.099 
was almost looking like a full car I had
a<00:00:18.119> change<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.570> heart

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
a change of heart

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.240 
a change of heart
as<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.070> can<00:00:20.189> see<00:00:20.460> quite<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> big<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:22.250> have

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
as you can see quite a big one I have

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.730 
as you can see quite a big one I have
here<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.850> roll<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.600> platinum<00:00:26.660> brushed<00:00:27.740> aluminum

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
here a roll of platinum brushed aluminum

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.849 
here a roll of platinum brushed aluminum
vinyl<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.090> been<00:00:30.300> sat<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.650> ages

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
vinyl and it's been sat here for ages

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.240 
vinyl and it's been sat here for ages
honestly<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.759> get<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> focus

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
honestly if I can get it to focus

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.950 
honestly if I can get it to focus
probably<00:00:35.250> not<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.820> looks<00:00:36.149> exactly<00:00:36.420> like

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
probably not it looks exactly like

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.900 
probably not it looks exactly like
brushed<00:00:37.590> aluminum<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.670> roll<00:00:38.879> out

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
brushed aluminum just like that roll out

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.880 
brushed aluminum just like that roll out
there<00:00:39.149> look<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> platinum<00:00:40.710> white<00:00:41.329> and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
there look but it's a platinum white and

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
there look but it's a platinum white and
it's<00:00:43.890> been<00:00:44.070> sat<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.820> um<00:00:44.969> dinar<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it's been sat there and I um dinar in I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
it's been sat there and I um dinar in I
even<00:00:46.230> before<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.710> started<00:00:46.800> wrapping<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.520> read

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
even before I started wrapping this read

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.260 
even before I started wrapping this read
I<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.329> wrapped<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.020> panel<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.789> on<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.000> car

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
I just wrapped a panel in it on this car

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.490 
I just wrapped a panel in it on this car
just<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.809> how<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.989> looked<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
just to see how it looked and at the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.080 
just to see how it looked and at the
time<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.920> really<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:53.940> wasn't

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
time I just really really really wasn't

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.250 
time I just really really really wasn't
happy<00:00:55.640> but<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.940> got<00:00:57.210> me<00:00:57.390> thinking<00:00:57.899> about<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
happy but it got me thinking about the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.950 
happy but it got me thinking about the
overall<00:00:58.379> project<00:00:59.190> the<00:01:00.030> speaker<00:01:00.809> system

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
overall project the speaker system

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.009 
overall project the speaker system
that's<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.190> silver<00:01:03.019> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that's going in there is all silver the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.160 
that's going in there is all silver the
chrome<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:05.510> really<00:01:06.510> thought<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.900> would<00:01:06.960> look

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
chrome I really thought it would look

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.700 
chrome I really thought it would look
fresh<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:09.240> car<00:01:09.510> had<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.140> bare<00:01:10.409> metal

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
fresh if the car had a bare metal

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.179 
fresh if the car had a bare metal
appearance<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.510> what<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> does<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
appearance to it so what this does is it

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.200 
appearance to it so what this does is it
basically<00:01:14.400> makes<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> car<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:17.210> bare

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
basically makes the car look like bare

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.560 
basically makes the car look like bare
metal<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.259> know<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.159> probably<00:01:20.570> impossibly

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
metal I know this is probably impossibly

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
metal I know this is probably impossibly
hard<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.049> pick<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:24.229> but<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:26.610> actually

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
hard to pick up here but it actually

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.350 
hard to pick up here but it actually
reflects<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.810> light<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:29.250> well<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
reflects the light really really well so

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.530 
reflects the light really really well so
I'm<00:01:30.840> already<00:01:30.990> quite<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> ways<00:01:31.740> into<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.540> as

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
I'm already quite a ways into this as

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.190 
I'm already quite a ways into this as
you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:35.479> there<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.509> go<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.869> light<00:01:37.049> in

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you can see there you go the light in

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
you can see there you go the light in
effect<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> way<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.000> reflects

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
effect you can see the way it reflects

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330 
effect you can see the way it reflects
light<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.229> lightning<00:01:40.829> through<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
light is like lightning through the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.330 
light is like lightning through the
actual<00:01:41.490> vinyl<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.590> gonna<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.189> can

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
actual vinyl and I'm gonna see if I can

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760 
actual vinyl and I'm gonna see if I can
get<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> picture<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> grain<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:46.049> there

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
get a picture of the grain here there

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.039 
get a picture of the grain here there
you<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.040> look<00:01:47.810> literally<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.170> metal

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
you go look literally just like metal

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.630 
you go look literally just like metal
now<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:52.439> sure<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.829> some<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.460> out<00:01:53.490> there

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
now I'm sure that some of you out there

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.230 
now I'm sure that some of you out there
won't<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.210> happy<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:56.090> there<00:01:57.090> may<00:01:57.210> be

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
won't be happy with this there may be

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.020 
won't be happy with this there may be
something<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:58.399> this<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> sort<00:01:59.969> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
something that is this is a sort of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.800 
something that is this is a sort of
process<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.170> right<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:01.469> I

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
process of it going on right now I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.240 
process of it going on right now I
really<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.100> gives

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
really really like it I think it gives

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.690 
really really like it I think it gives
the<00:02:05.460> car<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.850> completely<00:02:06.630> new<00:02:06.869> look<00:02:07.550> when<00:02:08.550> it's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the car a completely new look when it's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
the car a completely new look when it's
all<00:02:08.879> done<00:02:09.119> it'll<00:02:09.360> look<00:02:09.509> very<00:02:09.569> different<00:02:10.259> so

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
all done it'll look very different so

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.750 
all done it'll look very different so
what<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.590> looks<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.920> right<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.550> very

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
what it looks like right now it's very

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.760 
what it looks like right now it's very
very<00:02:11.819> hard<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.239> picture

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
very hard to picture

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.060 
very hard to picture
course<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.430> two-tone<00:02:14.770> but<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.800> can

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
course with the two-tone but I can

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.890 
course with the two-tone but I can
assure<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.760> will<00:02:16.970> look<00:02:17.000> absolutely

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
assure you it will look absolutely

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.600 
assure you it will look absolutely
amazing<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:21.110> seems<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.470> make<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.710> car<00:02:21.920> look<00:02:22.280> a

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
amazing it seems to make the car look a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.110 
amazing it seems to make the car look a
little<00:02:23.390> bit<00:02:23.600> longer<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.470> don't<00:02:25.250> know<00:02:25.400> why<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
little bit longer I don't know why the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.880 
little bit longer I don't know why the
car<00:02:26.300> looks<00:02:26.510> longer<00:02:26.810> rather<00:02:27.290> than<00:02:27.620> sort<00:02:27.860> of

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
car looks longer rather than sort of

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.640 
car looks longer rather than sort of
squatter<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.260> guess<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> little<00:02:30.530> bit

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
squatter and I guess a little bit

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.260 
squatter and I guess a little bit
smaller<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.400> higher<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.940> looks<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.240> bit

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
smaller and higher it looks a bit

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.010 
smaller and higher it looks a bit
sleeker<00:02:33.610> I'm<00:02:34.610> not<00:02:34.760> sure<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.030> feel<00:02:35.210> about<00:02:35.480> that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
sleeker I'm not sure I feel about that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.220 
sleeker I'm not sure I feel about that
but<00:02:36.790> overall<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:38.060> looks<00:02:38.240> good<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.990> front

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
but overall it looks good so the front

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.230 
but overall it looks good so the front
bumper<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.950> talked<00:02:40.280> about<00:02:40.460> how<00:02:40.850> we<00:02:40.880> were<00:02:41.090> going

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
bumper I talked about how we were going

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.480 
bumper I talked about how we were going
to<00:02:41.330> blend<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.900> mold<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.620> have<00:02:43.280> not

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
to blend and mold that I have not

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.350 
to blend and mold that I have not
finished<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:44.030> right<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.750> shot<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.650> paint

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
finished this right I shot it with paint

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.670 
finished this right I shot it with paint
just<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.480> sort<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.810> see<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.200> highs<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.410> lows

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
just to sort of see the highs and lows

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.220 
just to sort of see the highs and lows
again<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.360> see<00:02:50.510> where<00:02:50.690> I've<00:02:50.810> got<00:02:50.960> to<00:02:51.110> do

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
again just to see where I've got to do

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.080 
again just to see where I've got to do
more<00:02:51.440> work<00:02:51.710> but<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.550> what<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.700> wanted<00:02:52.970> to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
more work but this is what I wanted to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.430 
more work but this is what I wanted to
show<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.330> all<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.800> come<00:02:55.070> round<00:02:55.280> here<00:02:56.440> look

show you all if I come round here look
down<00:02:57.680> here<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:59.180> what<00:02:59.420> we've<00:02:59.570> got<00:02:59.600> here<00:02:59.780> is<00:02:59.960> the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
down here so what we've got here is the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.450 
down here so what we've got here is the
modified<00:03:02.570> from<00:03:02.960> bumper<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:03.800> is<00:03:03.950> actually

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
modified from bumper so this is actually

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.530 
modified from bumper so this is actually
the<00:03:05.350> factory<00:03:06.350> OE<00:03:06.530> bumper<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:08.030> I've<00:03:08.180> blended

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
into the body kit I have done some

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.580 
into the body kit I have done some
smoothing<00:03:14.030> but<00:03:14.630> what<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.810> want<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.080> show<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.290> is

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
now when I put this light in here and

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.020 
now when I put this light in here and
seat<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.730> correctly<00:03:22.990> there's<00:03:23.990> your<00:03:24.320> line<00:03:25.030> that

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
seat it correctly there's your line that

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
seat it correctly there's your line that
is<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.570> much<00:03:26.870> cleaner<00:03:28.630> than<00:03:29.630> what<00:03:29.840> was<00:03:30.020> in

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
is so much cleaner than what was in

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.860 
is so much cleaner than what was in
there<00:03:30.410> before<00:03:30.590> I'm<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.940> much<00:03:32.240> happier<00:03:32.660> with

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
there before I'm so much happier with

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.730 
there before I'm so much happier with
how<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:33.260> sits<00:03:35.050> again<00:03:36.050> I'll<00:03:36.290> show<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.530> on

how that sits again I'll show you on
this<00:03:36.890> side<00:03:37.160> if<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.459> can<00:03:37.610> get<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.850> in<00:03:38.050> there<00:03:39.050> we<00:03:39.170> go

this side if I can get it in there we go

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.940 
this side if I can get it in there we go
brute<00:03:40.459> force<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.790> ignorance

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
brute force and ignorance

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.699 
brute force and ignorance
look<00:03:42.950> at<00:03:43.070> that<00:03:43.220> look<00:03:44.110> it<00:03:45.110> just<00:03:45.350> marries<00:03:45.680> a

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
look at that look it just marries a

look at that look it just marries a
perfectly<00:03:46.490> here's<00:03:46.790> my<00:03:47.000> line<00:03:47.590> all<00:03:48.590> filled

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
perfectly here's my line all filled

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.590 
perfectly here's my line all filled
again<00:03:51.080> about<00:03:51.470> an<00:03:51.620> inch<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:52.910> a<00:03:53.240> lip<00:03:53.420> at<00:03:53.570> the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
again about an inch of a lip at the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.699 
again about an inch of a lip at the
front<00:03:53.990> and<00:03:54.290> then<00:03:55.070> it<00:03:55.190> widens<00:03:55.670> off<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.709> tapers

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
front and then it widens off and tapers

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.980 
front and then it widens off and tapers
off<00:03:57.830> up<00:03:58.310> into<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.880> actual<00:03:59.209> light<00:03:59.540> so<00:03:59.870> it

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
off up into the actual light so it

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.949 
off up into the actual light so it
blends<00:04:00.320> in<00:04:00.650> it's<00:04:00.910> really<00:04:01.910> nice<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.390> smooth

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.830 

shame<00:04:05.959> about<00:04:06.140> all<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.440> dust<00:04:07.300> but<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.810> is

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
shame about all the dust but it is it is

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.010 
shame about all the dust but it is it is
a<00:04:08.959> really<00:04:09.530> really<00:04:09.830> nice<00:04:10.630> lying-in<00:04:11.630> for<00:04:11.870> that

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
a really really nice lying-in for that

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.600 
a really really nice lying-in for that
there<00:04:12.200> is<00:04:12.290> still<00:04:12.500> more<00:04:12.739> work<00:04:12.950> that<00:04:13.190> needs<00:04:13.250> to

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
there is still more work that needs to

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.479 
there is still more work that needs to
go<00:04:13.760> on<00:04:13.810> as<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.870> bit<00:04:15.080> of<00:04:15.110> an<00:04:15.290> area<00:04:15.680> just<00:04:15.770> here<00:04:16.220> look

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
go on as a bit of an area just here look

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.340 
go on as a bit of an area just here look
that<00:04:17.140> isn't<00:04:18.140> quite<00:04:18.530> parallel<00:04:19.750> but<00:04:20.750> overall

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.990 

and<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.500> around<00:04:24.800> about<00:04:25.070> one

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
and is around about one

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.709 
and is around about one
and<00:04:27.000> 1/2<00:04:27.330> inches<00:04:28.189> the<00:04:29.189> whole<00:04:29.340> way<00:04:29.550> down<00:04:29.819> and<00:04:30.569> it

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:30.719 
and 1/2 inches the whole way down and it

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:34.459 
and 1/2 inches the whole way down and it
just<00:04:31.199> blends<00:04:31.680> in<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:33.240> much<00:04:33.509> nicer<00:04:33.840> with<00:04:34.289> the

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:34.469 
just blends in so much nicer with the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:38.749 
just blends in so much nicer with the
hood<00:04:36.500> see<00:04:37.500> if<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.680> can<00:04:37.830> go<00:04:37.949> around<00:04:38.069> the<00:04:38.280> side<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
hood see if I can go around the side and

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.170 
hood see if I can go around the side and
sort<00:04:38.939> of<00:04:39.030> capture<00:04:39.479> this<00:04:39.599> for<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:41.030> but<00:04:42.030> this<00:04:42.120> is

sort of capture this for you but this is

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.450 
sort of capture this for you but this is
what<00:04:42.360> I'm<00:04:42.479> talking<00:04:42.840> about<00:04:42.900> that<00:04:43.229> line<00:04:43.469> look<00:04:44.370> at

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
what I'm talking about that line look at

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.230 
what I'm talking about that line look at
how<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.610> hood

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
how the hood

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.830 
how the hood
now<00:04:45.990> flows<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.979> pops<00:04:47.400> at<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.669> moment<00:04:48.120> but<00:04:48.659> when

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
now flows is pops at the moment but when

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.390 
now flows is pops at the moment but when
it's<00:04:48.990> down<00:04:49.139> he<00:04:49.349> just<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.740> can<00:04:49.949> see<00:04:50.129> it<00:04:50.250> from

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
it's down he just so you can see it from

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.839 
it's down he just so you can see it from
there<00:04:50.639> flow<00:04:51.180> was<00:04:51.389> right<00:04:51.659> down<00:04:51.960> into<00:04:52.199> that<00:04:52.439> hood

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
there flow was right down into that hood

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.119 
there flow was right down into that hood
down<00:04:53.849> into<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.419> front<00:04:54.599> bumper<00:04:54.870> really<00:04:55.830> happy

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
down into the front bumper really happy

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.279 
down into the front bumper really happy
with<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:57.120> looks<00:04:57.300> so<00:04:57.509> much<00:04:57.539> nicer<00:04:57.930> than

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
with that it looks so much nicer than

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.860 
with that it looks so much nicer than
that<00:04:58.319> overhang<00:04:59.090> just<00:05:00.090> gives<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.389> whole<00:05:00.449> front

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
that overhang just gives the whole front

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.189 
that overhang just gives the whole front
end<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.500> smoother<00:05:02.490> look<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.699> it<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.389> can<00:05:03.990> see

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
end a smoother look to it you can see

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:04.939 
end a smoother look to it you can see
there<00:05:04.439> look

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
there look

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.649 
there look
I<00:05:04.979> wish<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.789> bumper<00:05:06.090> was<00:05:06.210> like<00:05:06.419> that<00:05:06.599> I've

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
I wish the bumper was like that I've

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:08.029 
I wish the bumper was like that I've
looked<00:05:06.900> online<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.529> there<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.740> actually

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
looked online and there is actually

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.269 
looked online and there is actually
bumpers<00:05:08.520> that<00:05:08.699> I<00:05:08.789> like<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.300> out<00:05:09.449> of<00:05:09.599> the<00:05:09.659> mold

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.279 
bumpers that I like that out of the mold

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.029 
bumpers that I like that out of the mold
that<00:05:11.279> I'm<00:05:11.430> sure<00:05:11.909> would<00:05:12.419> have<00:05:12.539> been<00:05:13.009> ten<00:05:14.009> times

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
that I'm sure would have been ten times

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.999 
that I'm sure would have been ten times
less<00:05:14.520> of<00:05:14.729> a<00:05:14.819> headache<00:05:15.080> and<00:05:16.080> little<00:05:16.529> less<00:05:16.650> work

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
less of a headache and little less work

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.429 
less of a headache and little less work
than<00:05:17.039> that<00:05:17.599> but<00:05:18.599> what<00:05:18.719> can<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:18.960> do<00:05:19.199> that's

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:19.439 
than that but what can you do that's

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.100 
than that but what can you do that's
what<00:05:19.710> I've<00:05:19.830> got<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.460> that's<00:05:20.550> what<00:05:20.729> I've<00:05:20.849> done

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
what I've got and that's what I've done

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.260 
what I've got and that's what I've done
I<00:05:22.110> still<00:05:22.889> quite<00:05:23.129> like<00:05:23.310> how<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.550> silver<00:05:24.029> blends

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
I still quite like how the silver blends

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.629 
I still quite like how the silver blends
in<00:05:24.509> with<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:24.719> silver<00:05:25.560> lip<00:05:25.710> on<00:05:25.889> the<00:05:26.039> wheels<00:05:26.310> but

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
in with the silver lip on the wheels but

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.860 
in with the silver lip on the wheels but
I'm<00:05:26.789> still<00:05:27.060> not<00:05:27.210> sure<00:05:27.270> if<00:05:27.449> we're<00:05:27.629> having<00:05:27.719> to

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
I'm still not sure if we're having to

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.890 
I'm still not sure if we're having to
stay<00:05:28.050> in<00:05:28.110> black<00:05:28.379> or<00:05:28.590> not<00:05:28.860> I<00:05:29.449> kind<00:05:30.449> of<00:05:30.569> went<00:05:30.750> with

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
stay in black or not I kind of went with

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.519 
stay in black or not I kind of went with
all<00:05:31.050> this<00:05:31.169> red<00:05:31.469> interior<00:05:31.919> again<00:05:33.020> down<00:05:34.020> here<00:05:34.050> as

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
all this red interior again down here as

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.540 
all this red interior again down here as

you know and I think that the red and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.159 
you know and I think that the red and
the<00:05:38.729> silver<00:05:38.759> actually<00:05:39.270> complement<00:05:40.050> each

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
the silver actually complement each

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.800 
the silver actually complement each
