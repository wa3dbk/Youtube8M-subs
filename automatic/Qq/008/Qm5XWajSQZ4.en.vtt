00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello friends how come i 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.230
 two days at work actively used 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.099
 multitool leatherman serzh and today 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.200
 somewhere before lunch 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.320
 discovered some very interesting 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.510
 unpleasant to sechin 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 I certainly looked understood what the problem was 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.869
 that this is all quickly resolved corrected 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.980
 but the fact itself is rather unpleasant 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.800
 let's see what today 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 discovered in this multitool 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.559
 and we immediately tell u no such 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.100
 super duper hard work i didn't do everything 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:45.860
 languages ​​of limits normal human 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.860
 look at work open look 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.699
 This hook did not happen thank God 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.640
 discovered my bit here we have 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.690
 driver and opener now see 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.690
 turn over the title 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.909
 even if we put it this way by 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.219
 the driver is in working position 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:19.079
 like this , everything is normal here 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:21.000
 that is, you hear what sounds you know 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:27.689
 changed the driver close open 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 opener so it's not nice what seconds 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.670
 state when you close it 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.520
 completely open there close he 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.039
 somehow manages to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.009
 cling I somehow discovered that I had 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.250
 here here here somehow 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.259
 caught and did not understand how you either 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.179
 This is how it happened in general. 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.899
 moment of opening how it all happened 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.090
 so very strange these are nothing 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.110
 deadly something is not right 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.549
 I understand that we will fix it now 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:06.170
 literally seconds almonds account the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.170
 there should be just like that twist 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:15.590
 hold that is everything 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:26.190
 I guess I even twisted a little 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:30.299
 okay, the buffer opens a little bit 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:35.370
 nicely enough does not fall out of this 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.200
 there is no such side let's try it 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.230
 with minimal effort, that is, here too 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.739
 a little bit of something 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.739
 wants to crank 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.290
 that is, I do not want to completely twist 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.970
 screws but assuming you are now 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.540
 just saw these such 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.370
 suspicion that there is no thread lock 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:07.170
 using find was not that is everything 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.870
 happened stupidly like titles that 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.330
 there are many scolded hero there some 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.709
 the Chinese are fairly well assembled 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.430
 this regret some materials 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.980
 It turns out here the same regret 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.370
 thread lock something that means such here 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.590
 time today it was really unpleasant 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.319
 there is and barely reached the house so that 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.319
 make a video but also because at home 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.600
 I have that here was no screwdriver Do 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.130
 still not pick any assistants 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:42.239
 means meaning forte 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:48.450
 Well, here's a fact on you firm 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:51.510
 carries 2013 modification if such 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.880
 problemka screws have the most property 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.090
 unwind I do not know only on my 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.600
