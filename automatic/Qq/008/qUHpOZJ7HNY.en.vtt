00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.090
 a fifth match between a gas terra flames and parkpop will be released 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.090
 den bosch in the semifinals for the national championship 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.739
 for gasterra flames to kill fourth game this afternoon 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.699
 in and against the forest 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.470
 and it was in particular thanks to the shooters of the woods that the home team won 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.070
 Marco van den Berg couldn't get his team up and running 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.029
 there was none that prevailed for flames 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.029
 den bosch was even better under the plates 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.990
 He managed to score that from John Turek 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.430
 halfway through the third quarter in hand, the backlog is still to be seen seven 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.950
 points 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.980
 gymnast along everything and over everyone 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 and he brings the difference back to ten points 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.690
 the zone defense of the forest and there flames have a lot 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.760
 difficulties with it the number runs through the shot clock 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.550
 and so there is the chance for the forest to walk further 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.980
 he did try Marco van den Berg from his team 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.950
 but it did not succeed but baugÃ© is blocked 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.700
 and so the chance for the bosch lap ahead to make the shot bigger 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.500
 anchor tree 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.800
 he was driving the old dollar player 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.870
 marco van den berg says helping each other but nothing happens 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.640
 because this is another shooter on the side of the forest old donar player rogier 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 jansen 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.090
 that difference at the end of the third quarter first thirteen points 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.220
 and again flames have difficulty defending the forest 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.640
 and the team is also in photo trouble 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 gymnast towards blue shirt is actually an offensive mistake but it builds you 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.100
 gets one out of five errors and he can watch the rest of the game 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.660
 browser is a major player for flames 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.230
 and that the team will feel in the test earlier minutes of the game 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.769
 until then also top scorer 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.979
 in the woods on all fronts better also on taking free throws 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:19.059
 that has been the protocol of strange and especially in the entire season 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.469
 this series against the forest 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.499
 or play 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:28.539
 he also launches bah on the verge plays with four errors and will be one 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.039
 abandoned too 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.559
 make space field with five mistakes 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:35.719
 goes into the forest 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.039
 must also win 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.759
 otherwise it's over for the people of Brabant 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:44.209
 and they have the with its completely under control of flames playing too weak 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.459
 and then everything goes well again a rogier jansen's three point 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.540
 he is together with akerboom 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.849
 the great the man on the side of the forest 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.659
 again with a 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.259
 far far point 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:01.459
 79 61 is the anp 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.979
 and again the false also revealed that they worked well at flames again the score 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.329
 from provider jansen 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.069
 with pride at flames 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.149
 also does not work 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.190
 the attempt of conversion and then you can 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.459
 talk what you want 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.949
 but nothing succeeds on the side of flames at the forest because everything succeeds 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:23.689
 sels van der list is going to shoot from then on and made the head three-point 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.439
 Then ross again for flames 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:32.279
 that does not work and then again the fall speaks again via turner about everything and 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.389
 everyone go 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.919
 and then the match is over 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.369
 92 78 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:45.179
 those are staggering figures for flames and forest ad big excellence 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:47.079
 this anchor tree 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.419
 Flames plays the worst game in this series so far it will occur 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.919
 must also guard against rogier jansen tuesday is the decisive fifth 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.459
 competition in groningen
