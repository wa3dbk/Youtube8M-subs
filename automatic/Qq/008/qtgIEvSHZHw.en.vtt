00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.090
 gamescom outdoor has moderately wants you

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.030
 especially not because the tv-pictures 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.019
 umzuschwenken I'm sorry but we 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.660
 have some information for you 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.960
 and that was too little at the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.880
 presentation press presentation again 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 with a good price and i have that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.140
 in the complete article of LeitwÃ¶lfen at 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.699
 wrestling eins.de so if the whole 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.869
 want to have time in text form then could 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.429
 read it there but I will get you 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.960
 now just here in the video of 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.369
 to tell everything in my sight 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.160
 So we have bmw to basics team 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.140
 gets shown or gets presentation 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.890
 even 30 minutes then then 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.809
 small interview 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.579
 But that will come the days sometime 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.050
 or finished soon 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.360
 so it started 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.620
 turkey is not a game on the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.850
 gamescom has the good i can easily 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 read aloud by the presentation 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.989
 accompanied us wants now is even 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.789
 and director racing in a short 30 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.590
 minutes presentation , he will be there 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.210
 Again, it is important to imagine something 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.829
 tk says, looking forward to the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.809
 release of the way to basics expected 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.610
 and that the new litter should be to 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.229
 in the framework uk helps a little more 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.030
 stability is called earth 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.670
 with others with us so he says im 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140
 principle the www to basics i have one 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 development of fonts is and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.580
 so that is and everyone expected so of 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.110
 So do not be serious about a big surprise 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.119
 shown the calorie trailer and then 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.280
 he said that www sixt strong 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.570
 have been based on the feedback applies 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.579
 us then pictures shown by 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.710
 wallace brian m breast in berlebeck ins 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.040
 bed and page then there were old pictures 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.020
 from ok because screenshots of rhine and 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.149
 the mosel 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 and then he says the creation suite 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.380
 is improved, it was also this 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.329
 information had indeed been a 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.590
 at the article of ign you can 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.850
 through life or translated 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.979
 version you can via rating eins.de 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.319
 read through and then my career mode 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.969
 because racing has said about it that they 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.009
 general racing presentation though good 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.259
 Been future but more those who 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.459
 that already quite a bit 26 10 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.920
 so they should be represented 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.909
 interfaces with interviews to stop the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.850
 own character 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.670
 carril micro motives to give that 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.739
 ultimate goal in this case would be the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.269
 hall of fame the name short three-headed 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.500
 commentators team saw that you have 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.630
 you know him with meanwhile when 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.860
 her food games she pursues and he has 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.440
 I 'll tell you soon 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.760
 an announcement may expect that 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.860
 comments sent even more 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.569
 University will be back but more 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.120
 infos to be followed later sometime 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.079
 Showcase mode would be more information 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.360
 we're there within the next two 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.209
 weeks against such price young and has 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.790
 said that we have a game with a lot 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.110
 feeling like in uk 15 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.489
 Then it went on because is going on with 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.599
 gameplay since we obtain the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.040
 We have already seen that decision 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.750
 have liked to see that is if 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.350
 Bella and Air France were so 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.950
 Interesting 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.590
 without loading times and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.150
 yes there was this one on the top right 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.620
 The share of an ad is only 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.660
 may because you want to know when 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.900
 you can lead and top left was yes 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.040
 still the indication for breakout at 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.620
 sensations and now just that 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.550
 you could tilt your own 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.650
 I have engines again now 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.880
 Asked and there I said 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.410
 so like skipping moderately yes said 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.819
 then it will be shown again we have 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.799
 get some new animations or 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.840
 panda animation seen in the 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.360
 we have seen remaining videos 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.950
 have all seen from dan brown against 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.540
 Patwas was pretty interesting 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.370
 and first said that 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.810
 The textures of the cloud have been improved 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.250
 and that is more diversity in the audience 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.709
 will get 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.650
 There was something like that here with the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.840
 with the match that's a nice one 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.489
 animations at the chain wrestling for 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.280
 example that one opponent the other in 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.019
 the corner presses and the opponent intervenes 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.910
 not the opponent that the referee the 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.860
 intervene as it does in the real world 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.630
 www human also the case would be typical 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.549
 were also a few gbl sayings the 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.959
 Claims that you saw then gave 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.220
 there are a few nice animations all 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.459
 Well listed or I still remember 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.810
 I just noticed that there 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.329
 Articles insert the periods in the 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.690
 video description bends blown 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.120
 Has 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.350
 there we have seen with details 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.019
 new animations as I said in 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.750
 frustration of wrestling gamestar.de and 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.120
 at the very end 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.060
 nice animations seen from the trade 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.040
 mark maneuvers of jetbird from here in 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.620
 In this case, Michael is shown big at the end 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.750
 has a nice touch of the movie 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.890
 animation and then the gameplay was too 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.660
 already over, we are responsible 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.400
 Greetings from Arnold 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.160
 schwarzenegger and fossil from the but 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:36.410
 these trailers seem to be running anyway 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.660
 publicly so then we have at the end 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.950
 he still has racing has explicitly 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.510
 said that the four platforms the 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.130
 previously announced only 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.320
 platform are announced so far 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.620
 somehow have been so accordingly 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.230
 are there are the hopes for one 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.350
 pc version attached very well so then 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.140
 says in the end it will be the 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.060
 eckdaten shown how to read them 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.260
 and I'm platform again just 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.070
 yes that it was actually with 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.660
 information 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.730
 because they forgot something best 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.290
 So by the way , we have who then extreme 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.200
 action seen with facebook i believe 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.480
 in the gameplay the conductor was flowing 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.620
 without seeing facebook 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.750
 That's it , that's it 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.000
 our first resume from 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.800

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.550
 260 mails are similar because the 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.830
 presentation 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.690
 that's the best you can get 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.580
 you can there is a small room where 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.280

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.680
 10 pairs of nice things are with you 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.110
 I forgot to mention that so 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.760
 with animations come on foot or 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.890

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.270

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.160
 are that he frost picture and that 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.860

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.620
 to make her half knock on the side 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.270
 but I'm not as good at it as 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.520
 to watch some other youtube because there 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.200
