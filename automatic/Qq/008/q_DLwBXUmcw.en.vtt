00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
is without adding any accidentals so in

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.050 
is without adding any accidentals so in
the<00:01:41.439> key<00:01:41.619> of<00:01:41.649> C<00:01:41.950> those<00:01:42.369> are<00:01:42.490> all<00:01:42.610> white<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:42.909> think

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
the key of C those are all white I think

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:52.600 
the key of C those are all white I think
so<00:01:43.719> anything<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.259> want<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.469> play

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.359 

three<00:01:53.610> chords<00:01:54.680> could<00:01:55.680> involve<00:01:55.890> those<00:01:56.159> three

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
three chords could involve those three

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.800 
three chords could involve those three
chords<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:56.820> they're<00:01:57.030> most<00:01:57.210> likely<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
chords there they're most likely to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.039 
chords there they're most likely to
occur<00:01:58.729> but<00:01:59.729> then<00:01:59.939> after<00:02:00.299> those<00:02:00.450> three<00:02:00.750> chords

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
occur but then after those three chords

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.990 
occur but then after those three chords
the<00:02:01.320> next<00:02:01.619> most<00:02:01.799> likely<00:02:02.009> after<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.700> are

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the next most likely after that are

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.039 
the next most likely after that are
three<00:02:03.420> minor<00:02:03.689> chords<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.439> two<00:02:04.680> chord<00:02:06.049> which

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
three minor chords the two chord which

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.830 
three minor chords the two chord which
is<00:02:07.080> minor<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:08.220> three<00:02:08.489> chord<00:02:08.819> which<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.420> minor

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
is minor the three chord which is minor

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.680 
is minor the three chord which is minor
and<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:11.099> sixth<00:02:11.430> chord<00:02:12.890> which<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.920> minor<00:02:14.690> now

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and the sixth chord which is minor now

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.180 
and the sixth chord which is minor now
if<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.959> know<00:02:16.080> all<00:02:16.260> six<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.709> those<00:02:16.830> chords

if you know all six of those chords

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.330 
if you know all six of those chords
you've<00:02:17.310> got<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> long<00:02:17.849> ways<00:02:18.150> towards<00:02:18.569> mastering

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
you've got a long ways towards mastering

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.300 
you've got a long ways towards mastering
tons<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.610> songs<00:02:20.880> because<00:02:21.510> most<00:02:22.230> most<00:02:23.040> songs

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
so mastered those six chords in the key

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.030 
so mastered those six chords in the key
that<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.750> want<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.019> play<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.319> okay<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.950> just

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
that you want to play in okay so I just

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.150 
that you want to play in okay so I just
play<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.580> key<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.790> C<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.780> say<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.200> my

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
play in the key of C but I say that my

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.710 
play in the key of C but I say that my
the<00:02:41.489> group<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:41.880> play<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.269> likes<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> play

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
the group that I play and likes to play

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.780 
the group that I play and likes to play
in<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> key<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.080> F<00:02:43.290> okay<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.400> means<00:02:44.549> they're

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
in the key of F okay that means they're

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.850 
in the key of F okay that means they're
basing<00:02:45.330> their<00:02:45.480> playing<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.080> scale<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.500> F

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
basing their playing on the scale of F

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.420 
basing their playing on the scale of F
which<00:02:47.130> goes<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.769> will<00:02:49.980> review

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
which goes like that and I will review

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.270 
which goes like that and I will review
why<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:51.049> why<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.110> key<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.440> F<00:02:52.590> has<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.860> b-flat

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
why that why the key of F has a b-flat

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.259 
why that why the key of F has a b-flat
but<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.700> does<00:02:53.849> okay<00:02:55.579> so<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:56.730> one<00:02:56.910> quarter<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
but it does okay so the one quarter the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.020 
but it does okay so the one quarter the
key<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.570> F<00:02:57.720> therefore<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.260> F<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.769> no

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.510 

the<00:03:01.510> five<00:03:01.810> chord<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.350> key<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.530> F<00:03:02.740> is<00:03:02.920> what

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.010 

5c<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.570> four<00:03:07.780> chord<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.170> what<00:03:09.600> b-flat

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
5c and the four chord is what b-flat

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.830 
5c and the four chord is what b-flat
so<00:03:11.980> again<00:03:12.370> most<00:03:12.760> everything<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.360> want<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.660> play

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.660 
are the secondary chords in the key of G
well<00:04:33.790> if<00:04:34.000> if<00:04:34.330> if<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.350> primary<00:04:35.890> chords<00:04:36.340> are<00:04:36.460> one

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
well if if if the primary chords are one

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.820 
well if if if the primary chords are one
four<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.120> five<00:04:37.540> then<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:37.990> secondary<00:04:38.410> chords

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
four and five then the secondary chords

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.420 
four and five then the secondary chords
are<00:04:38.980> two<00:04:39.600> which<00:04:40.600> would<00:04:40.750> be<00:04:40.810> a<00:04:41.080> minor<00:04:41.430> three

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
are two which would be a minor three

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.510 
are two which would be a minor three
which<00:04:43.300> should<00:04:43.510> be<00:04:43.630> minor<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.250> six<00:04:45.250> which

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
which should be minor and six which

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.090 
which should be minor and six which
would<00:04:45.700> be<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:46.000> minor<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:47.260> if<00:04:47.350> I<00:04:47.470> master<00:04:47.920> those

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
would be a minor so if I master those

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.190 
would be a minor so if I master those
