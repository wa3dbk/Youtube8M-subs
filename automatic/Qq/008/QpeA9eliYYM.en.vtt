there's a lot of zombies up there it for
here

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
here

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.179 
here
let's<00:02:13.049> try<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> find<00:02:13.439> the<00:02:13.590> spawner<00:02:13.860> from<00:02:14.069> the

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
let's try to find the spawner from the

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:22.100 
let's try to find the spawner from the
bottom<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:16.099> take<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.220> out<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.549> way

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:32.740 

and<00:02:22.890> that's<00:02:23.220> not<00:02:23.340> gonna<00:02:23.550> be<00:02:23.610> easy<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.510> find<00:02:26.720> but

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.600 

actually<00:02:33.750> maybe<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.560> will<00:02:34.740> looks<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.400> it's

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
actually maybe it will looks like it's

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.160 
actually maybe it will looks like it's
going<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.760> turn<00:02:36.090> into<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.360> square<00:02:36.780> here<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:39.170> don't

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
going to turn into a square here I don't

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.990 
going to turn into a square here I don't
know<00:02:40.230> if<00:02:40.290> all<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.530> spawn<00:02:40.860> room<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.730> bald<00:02:41.910> spot

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
know if all the spawn room the bald spot

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.290 
know if all the spawn room the bald spot
of<00:02:42.270> rooms<00:02:42.420> are<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> same<00:02:42.720> size<00:02:43.290> or<00:02:43.350> what<00:02:44.300> this

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
of rooms are the same size or what this

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:57.730 
of rooms are the same size or what this
one<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:47.940> last<00:02:48.240> one<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> found

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.230 

I'm<00:02:58.740> not<00:02:58.890> sure<00:02:59.100> if<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.490> spawner<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.030> going<00:03:00.150> to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
I'm not sure if the spawner is going to

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
I'm not sure if the spawner is going to
be<00:03:00.330> on<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.570> cobblestone<00:03:01.110> or<00:03:01.470> not<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:03.020> guess<00:03:04.020> we'll

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
be on a cobblestone or not I guess we'll

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.410 
be on a cobblestone or not I guess we'll
see

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
see

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.790
