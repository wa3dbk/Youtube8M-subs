00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
 two 

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 to romania 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.360
 then maybe also those are the 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.500
 Features of Simon Angel entered 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.840
 to play against the big 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.180
 hitters that she is a rock in all 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.230
 the facets of the game will return to origin 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.230
 track to garbín 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.690
 and quick hands that José teaches us 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.369
 Luis is born with that and trains 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:33.460
 also yes good here 351 has been played 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.110
 a parallel rest but the speed in a 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.020
 situation of five equals would not have 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.820
 done but the marker allows it with 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.440
 clearly wants to close the game in 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.239
 this game if you have the opportunity to 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.740
 make them quick in those hands 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.810
 incredible if gonzález 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.740
 and now moved and removed it from the area 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.780
 from behind 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.480
 Top with another 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.870
 it's a winner I've killed him from above 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.000
 below and second 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.530
 match ball the second match ball 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.530
 for the number one in Romania 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.490
 well we're going to tear the clothes 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.490
 for this game because it was expected 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.720
 as well 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.470
 to the second match ball gets 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.470
 close 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.820
 the first point of the tie play 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.890
 be party simona halep 6/2 and 6/1 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.300
 it seems a corrective seems a result 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.010
 pretty hard because they have only been 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.350
 of party in addition for about only one hour 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.500
 and ten minutes that you thought 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.340
 a clear victory on the part of the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.820
 urals where from beginning to end has been 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.890
 she the great dominator that start of 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.860
 match 23 first games that have 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.229
 I could mark the tonic but I was 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.390
 Antoja more maybe a poetic first set 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.950
 not after it has been very superior 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.840
 simona halep as soon as he has taken the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.430
 pulse to the party has been much more is 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.709
 president of the country that will be 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.950
 very clear content, it does not seem so 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.860
 great star because he has won the first 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.740
 point of the tie and has put in 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.690
 value that favoritism was 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.920
 presupposed before starting the match 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.920
 well this player is
