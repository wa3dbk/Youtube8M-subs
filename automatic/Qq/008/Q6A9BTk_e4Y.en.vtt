richness of surface that you'll have

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.860 
richness of surface that you'll have
then<00:02:54.070> I'll<00:02:54.190> take<00:02:54.430> my<00:02:54.460> bubble<00:02:54.970> wrap<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.480> with

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
then I'll take my bubble wrap and with

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.860 
then I'll take my bubble wrap and with
the<00:02:56.020> bubble<00:02:56.350> side<00:02:56.620> down<00:02:57.070> I'm<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.630> going<00:02:58.810> to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
the bubble side down I'm just going to

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.260 
the bubble side down I'm just going to
lay<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.230> right<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.470> top<00:02:59.890> of<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.790> plate<00:03:01.030> and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
lay it right on top of the plate and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.170 
lay it right on top of the plate and
just<00:03:01.480> gently<00:03:01.950> smooth<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.430> surface<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.090> the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
just gently smooth it the surface of the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.930 
just gently smooth it the surface of the
jelly<00:03:04.420> plate<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:05.230> very<00:03:05.440> sensitive<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.790> it

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
jelly plate is very sensitive so it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.050 
jelly plate is very sensitive so it
picks<00:03:07.240> up<00:03:07.420> impressions<00:03:08.320> easily<00:03:09.250> then<00:03:09.970> I'm

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
picks up impressions easily then I'm

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.720 
picks up impressions easily then I'm
going<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.330> remove<00:03:10.540> my<00:03:10.750> bubble<00:03:11.410> wrap<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.980> I'm

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
going to remove my bubble wrap and I'm

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.500 
going to remove my bubble wrap and I'm
going<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.090> take<00:03:14.040> my<00:03:15.040> sketch<00:03:15.430> book<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:16.030> I'm

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
going to take my sketch book and I'm

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.510 
going to take my sketch book and I'm
going<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.690> put<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.080> right<00:03:17.380> down<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.920> top<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
going to put it right down on top of the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.150 
going to put it right down on top of the
jelly<00:03:18.730> plate<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.600> then<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:20.140> gently<00:03:20.470> just

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
jelly plate and then just gently just

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.220 
jelly plate and then just gently just
firm<00:03:21.910> hand<00:03:22.390> pressure<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:28.140> then<00:03:29.140> I'm

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
firm hand pressure do that and then I'm

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.470 
firm hand pressure do that and then I'm
going<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.530> lift<00:03:29.800> up

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.220 

and<00:03:33.690> there<00:03:34.590> you'll<00:03:34.800> see<00:03:35.069> we<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.550> beautiful

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
and there you'll see we have a beautiful

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.770 
and there you'll see we have a beautiful
shimmery<00:03:37.250> bubble<00:03:38.250> wrap<00:03:38.459> texture<00:03:39.060> on<00:03:39.360> our

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
shimmery bubble wrap texture on our

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.290 
shimmery bubble wrap texture on our
jelly<00:03:39.989> plate<00:03:40.459> from<00:03:41.459> our<00:03:41.610> jelly<00:03:41.819> plate<00:03:42.090> onto

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
jelly plate from our jelly plate onto

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.710 
jelly plate from our jelly plate onto
our<00:03:42.890> sketch<00:03:43.890> book<00:03:44.099> page<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.489> if<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.480> see

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
our sketch book page and if you can see

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.710 
our sketch book page and if you can see
it<00:03:45.840> here<00:03:46.140> not<00:03:46.950> all<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.459> ink<00:03:47.720> has

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
it here not all of the ink has

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.479 
it here not all of the ink has
transferred<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:49.620> that's<00:03:49.800> one<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.250> things

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
transferred and that's one of the things

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.040 
transferred and that's one of the things
I<00:03:50.640> like<00:03:50.819> about<00:03:50.849> using<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.569> jelly<00:03:51.780> plate

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
I like about using the jelly plate

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.740 
I like about using the jelly plate
rather<00:03:52.590> than<00:03:52.860> just<00:03:53.069> painting<00:03:53.340> or<00:03:53.880> stenciling

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
rather than just painting or stenciling

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.680 
rather than just painting or stenciling
on<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.349> the<00:03:55.890> page<00:03:56.160> some<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:56.849> its<00:03:57.060> left<00:03:57.239> behind

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
on to the page some of its left behind

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.630 
on to the page some of its left behind
and<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:57.959> you're<00:03:58.170> really<00:03:58.440> assure<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.370> thin

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
and so you're really assure just a thin

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.869 
and so you're really assure just a thin
layer<00:03:59.880> of<00:03:59.940> acrylic<00:04:00.780> ink<00:04:01.200> on<00:04:01.380> your<00:04:01.709> page<00:04:01.950> next

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
layer of acrylic ink on your page next

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.900 
layer of acrylic ink on your page next

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
background we can see the difference

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.750 
background we can see the difference
between<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:55.080> gold<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.860> went<00:04:56.039> down<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.669> the

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
between the gold that went down and the

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.060 
between the gold that went down and the
color<00:04:57.000> that's<00:04:57.240> going<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:57.539> go<00:04:57.630> on<00:04:57.660> top<00:04:58.020> okay<00:04:58.560> so

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
color that's going to go on top okay so

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.250 
color that's going to go on top okay so
that's<00:04:59.250> not<00:04:59.520> really<00:04:59.880> going<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.660> lift<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:01.229> the

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
that's not really going to lift to the

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.070 
that's not really going to lift to the
stencil<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:03.180> can<00:05:03.389> probably<00:05:03.750> see<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:05.000> design

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
stencil you can probably see the design
