00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 the problem with the SD card is not 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.139
 I realized sometimes the problem 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:14.759
 on the samsung android smartphone that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.449
 my sd card mister ken block found 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:29.840
 which was the reason and it is so if 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:33.480
 one then the smartphone the pc hangs 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.070

 Of course, connect and now decide 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.410
 the real decision that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.270
 some users will connect 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.350

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.559
 sd card which actually can not be up 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.710
 I work both sides at the same time 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.580

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.700

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.770
 Enter at the same time words 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:24.860
 you can see that now on the computer 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.070
 there no request now the automatic 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.960
 something would like to take pictures 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.700
 he has automatic playback 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.170
 allowed power and if I have that now 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:46.829

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:50.820
 entry in the work done you do that 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:55.579
 pc too, but if i do it now i do 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.579
 yes, if we are inside then then up 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.579
 system 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.320
 Stanislavsky the scanner 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:10.819
 who has that then everything is okay 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:15.470
 painting group I still have you when 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.090
 I now my dates back to the system 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.560
 shows that now but if you do that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.540
 just like that from trend since it can often 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.150
 she wants to pay as soon as she is tethered 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.310
 from the other side then he will be here 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.080
 out of date 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.080
 I close it again now at 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:41.470
 Now I'm on my feet saying ok 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.459
 usb wants it connects and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:49.010
 not us actually on the 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:51.620
 other side usb memory and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.940
 off on the other side 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.510
 it starts running again you stand running 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.910
 go break off now I'm going in 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.269
 my drive so that with me here 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.760
 the helaba goes to this data store 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.519
 make me an SD card 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.959
 I put a contact cap on denser 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:22.690
 Fire had always happened sees the 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:25.810
 service but later on from happening 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.590
 that there exactly now I no sd 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.140
 reloading capitalism 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.959
 The money often sometimes hangs like 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.010
 you can just correct the whole thing 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.989
 again went connect 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.269
 connect the usb because you can see now 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.400
 connect with where is final 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.459
 if we reloaded that anyway 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.459
 the sd-card tenant dar 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.870
 and during the operation he may have had 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.049
 no sd access 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.609
 that means even though we are now during 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.670
 I connect now with usb 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.040
 if I want to be connected now 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.380
 an application somehow makes you say 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.040
 schiemer phone book that has everything 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.750
 affiliated 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.069
 there may be a while pointing 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.180
 access which means they can to 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.980
 example, not ball contacts 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:17.630
 now a reader of the contacts 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:21.340
 sd card now good that has the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.340
 you could look it goes 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.250
 The swimmers have shit the erfurter 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.600
 but both would not have done no 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:37.640
 The star does not access a network 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.360
 Westrum always came back that came 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.360
 not connected 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:47.450
 So it's up to him as soon as he's connected 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.790
 other nonsense falls off whenever 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.070
 the clinics if the whole thing 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.120
 linked usb connected 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.030
 if you look now if 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.240
 I now have a phone book lg important 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.370
 somehow import contacts , he said 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.840
 can she be children again and exactly 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.050
 that happens once I close now 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.470
 times warm up to sec is important that 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.060
 Now about the SD card that this one 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.010
 Media scanner is performed when 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.490
 which is done with then only helps 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.140
 the usb cable again a piece of usb 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.610
 connection is, and then unplug 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.610
 restarted
