what<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.050> ripen<00:00:28.769> those<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.400> put<00:00:29.609> them

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
what I do to ripen those is I put them

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.470 
what I do to ripen those is I put them
in<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.970> cardboard<00:00:30.779> box<00:00:31.189> that's<00:00:32.189> usually<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.820> put

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
in a cardboard box that's usually I put

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.819 
in a cardboard box that's usually I put
them<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> cardboard<00:00:33.989> box<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.559> some<00:00:34.739> of

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
them in the cardboard box with some of

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
them in the cardboard box with some of
the<00:00:35.090> lightly<00:00:36.090> orange<00:00:36.390> ones<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.050> end<00:00:37.290> up

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the lightly orange ones they all end up

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.119 
the lightly orange ones they all end up
ripening<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:40.129> green

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
ripening up so if you have green

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.130 
ripening up so if you have green
tomatoes<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.850> fall<00:00:42.090> off<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> pick

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
tomatoes that fall off or if you pick

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500 
tomatoes that fall off or if you pick
them<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.010> ripen<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.670> eventually<00:00:45.030> they

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
them they do ripen up eventually they

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.920 
them they do ripen up eventually they
still<00:00:45.930> find<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:47.030> making<00:00:48.030> sauces<00:00:48.510> out<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.809> them

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
still find for making sauces out of them

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.950 
still find for making sauces out of them
I<00:00:49.280> don't<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.579> their<00:00:50.730> flavor<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.360> worse

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
I don't know if their flavor is worse

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.979 
I don't know if their flavor is worse
probably<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.559> not<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.460> good<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> nice<00:00:54.660> ripe

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
probably is not as good as a nice ripe

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.880
