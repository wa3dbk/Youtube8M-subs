00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.450
 so good day to you evgeny 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.219
 next and today we will analyze the next 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.130
 basic contact element which 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.130
 called meters this is the most delicious 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.439
 an element that should include some 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.150
 your numbers because based on this 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.820
 contact you can make some your own 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.400
 original ideas about it a little bit further 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.849
 but now I will show how to do it. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.849
 this item 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.770
 go friend 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.630
 look to do this 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.610
 difficult element you need to immediately try 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.070
 make completely this element we 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.720
 we break it into pieces the first thing that we 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.840
 need to do it learn to do 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.820
 This is the element we need because 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.120
 what's with this item usually seem like 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.949
 on the rotation of the planet so let's say we 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.390
 this item is already getting next 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.300
 the part we need 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.820
 as soon as we lay down the pole and i will make god 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.769
 here to sit as soon as it turns out 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.850
 goes here as soon as I see him 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.290
 here I raise my shoulder a little 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.500
 pole turns feels it 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.399
 i put my right hand and under 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.320
 the action of the dynamics going in the direction of the pole 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:25.710
 goes like this through the arm and goes 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.640
 these me here if you learn to do 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.220
 this element here come here 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.840
 parts this means that we already have percent 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.619
 60 made fumer 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.869
 why him 60 percent because most 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.420
 complicated in this element go to this one 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.390
 part that is, you need more 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.140
 arrange the hour turn it here i 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.040
 raised his shoulder appeared 6 came out all this 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.570
 already great 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.560
 the next part will just break 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.260
 her on elements 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.760
 the first part is good 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.760
 now we need like 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.640
 Here is the second part of the old age 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.000
 endure the weight of the body on the left here is the lever 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.700
 to the right and what is it necessary to give 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.920
 good momentum we push the pole away 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.460
 shoulder and under the influence of good dynamics 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.820
 itâ€™s easier to get us a friend see how 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.820
 this is the floor 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.840
 I have just a little bit, even flow 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.560
 in general then 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.560
 options for it 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.340
 and all you get here is part 2 with us 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.130
 already worked out and the third part I transfer 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.410
 the pole here I have touched his shoulder not 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.020
 raising your left hand and start walking 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.150
 side and pole under the influence of dynamics 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.630
 comes under the left hand moves to 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.910
 shoulder 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:00.080
 Well, then the simple element is the floor 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:03.510
 Steve on the right hand top pole you 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.930
 here it is the main points watch out for 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.640
 to your matrix when you do this 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:16.050
 an element so that it does not work out 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.810
 well lived in general make sure that 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.270
 when you are these six so he doesn't go anywhere 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.880
 rose he clearly goes to engage here 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.620
 accounting is clearly moving to the horizontal 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.410
 goes over here, that's not right here. 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.830
 He does not come to hand but that's clearly here 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.530
 armpit passes over his shoulder through yet 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.040
 and clearly top it all in horizontal 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.410
 plane 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.410
 now variations 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.530
 with you was eugeny next subscribe 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.840
 on my youtube channel and see you 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.840
 next video see you bye
