they're<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:09.590> going<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.920> select<00:02:10.130> all<00:02:10.520> of<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
they're just going to select all of the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.300 
they're just going to select all of the
points<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.540> top<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:15.050> iPad<00:02:16.630> right<00:02:18.070> I'm<00:02:19.070> just

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
points on the top so iPad right I'm just

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.610 
points on the top so iPad right I'm just
going<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.550> show<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.000> four<00:02:20.240> purposes<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.960> you

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
going to show you four purposes and you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.730 
going to show you four purposes and you
could<00:02:21.770> use<00:02:22.010> these<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.240> one<00:02:23.450> here<00:02:23.740> no

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
could use these like this one here no

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.440 
could use these like this one here no
actually<00:02:25.070> let's<00:02:25.430> just<00:02:25.610> take<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.120> one<00:02:26.180> here

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
actually let's just take this one here

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.330 
actually let's just take this one here
and<00:02:26.600> show<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.110> what<00:02:27.320> happens<00:02:27.650> if<00:02:27.860> you

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
and show you what happens if you

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.510 
and show you what happens if you
accidentally<00:02:28.970> not<00:02:29.240> have<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> slot<00:02:29.930> have<00:02:30.110> one<00:02:30.520> so

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
accidentally not have a slot have one so

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.770 
accidentally not have a slot have one so
now<00:02:31.790> go<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.209> belt<00:02:32.660> again<00:02:32.990> I<00:02:33.850> put<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:35.030> belt<00:02:35.540> or

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
now go to the belt again I put a belt or

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.140 
now go to the belt again I put a belt or
a<00:02:35.870> drag<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.350> head<00:02:36.560> inside<00:02:37.459> of<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.700> belt<00:02:37.970> on

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
a drag the head inside of the belt on

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.880 
a drag the head inside of the belt on
and<00:02:39.010> click<00:02:40.010> on<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.310> set<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:41.530> now<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.590> should

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
and click on this set and now you should

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.199 
and click on this set and now you should
see<00:02:43.130> all<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.280> these<00:02:43.520> yellow<00:02:43.760> points<00:02:44.090> up<00:02:44.180> here

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
see all of these yellow points up here

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.360 
see all of these yellow points up here
if<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.750> want<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.080> rid<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.290> them<00:02:45.470> go<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.160> the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
if you want to get rid of them go to the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.020 
if you want to get rid of them go to the
belt<00:02:46.550> tag<00:02:46.730> again<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.209> take<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:47.989> draw<00:02:48.290> off

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
belt tag again and take the draw off

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.680 
belt tag again and take the draw off
like<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.760> now<00:02:52.910> what<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.209> want<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.420> do<00:02:53.570> is

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
like that so now what you want to do is

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.180 
like that so now what you want to do is
go<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.020> head<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.470> now<00:02:54.709> we<00:02:54.800> want<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.040> add

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
go to the head and now we want to add

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.460 
go to the head and now we want to add
another<00:02:55.220> tag<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.420> dental<00:02:56.840> simulation<00:02:57.260> tags

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
another tag so dental simulation tags

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.240 
another tag so dental simulation tags
and<00:02:58.310> go<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.550> cloth<00:02:58.910> Collider<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.530> what<00:03:01.100> this

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
and go to cloth Collider and what this

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.699 
and go to cloth Collider and what this
basically<00:03:01.430> does<00:03:01.610> just<00:03:02.120> makes<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.750> cloth<00:03:03.020> or

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
basically does just makes the cloth or

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.930 
basically does just makes the cloth or
the<00:03:03.860> hair<00:03:04.100> not<00:03:04.670> go<00:03:04.790> inside<00:03:05.239> of<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.630> head<00:03:05.840> and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
the hair not go inside of the head and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.390 
the hair not go inside of the head and
that<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.090> basically<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:09.010> let<00:03:10.010> me<00:03:10.070> just<00:03:10.220> show

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
that is basically it let me just show

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.030 
that is basically it let me just show
you<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:11.299> set<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.480> keyframe<00:03:11.690> at<00:03:12.019> 30<00:03:12.440> just<00:03:12.769> let<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
you so set a keyframe at 30 just let the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.009 
you so set a keyframe at 30 just let the
hair<00:03:13.220> settle<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.610> little<00:03:13.730> bit<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.450> to<00:03:14.630> keep<00:03:14.780> em

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
hair settle a little bit so to keep em

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.440 
hair settle a little bit so to keep em
at<00:03:15.110> 30<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.680> another<00:03:16.280> keyframe<00:03:16.489> at<00:03:16.850> 50<00:03:17.209> we've

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
at 30 and another keyframe at 50 we've

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.840 
at 30 and another keyframe at 50 we've
just<00:03:17.720> moved<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:18.140> little<00:03:18.230> bit<00:03:18.410> it's<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.430> put<00:03:19.790> it

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
just moved a little bit it's like put it

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.400 
just moved a little bit it's like put it
down<00:03:21.220> like<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:24.280> as<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.340> see<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:27.140> moves

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
down like that and as you see it moves

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.090 
down like that and as you see it moves
pretty<00:03:27.739> good<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:29.390> now<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.110> don't<00:03:30.470> like<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.860> when

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
pretty good and now I don't like it when

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.949 
pretty good and now I don't like it when
it's<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.580> loose<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.239> hair<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:32.540> this<00:03:32.660> loose

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
it's this loose the hair is this loose

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.210 
it's this loose the hair is this loose
to<00:03:33.650> go<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:34.070> cloth<00:03:34.370> tag<00:03:34.790> on<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.900> hair<00:03:36.160> go<00:03:37.160> to

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
to go to the cloth tag on the hair go to

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.170 
to go to the cloth tag on the hair go to
tags<00:03:37.850> down<00:03:38.420> here<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:39.700> iterations<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:40.910> believe

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
tags down here and iterations I believe

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.789 
tags down here and iterations I believe
is<00:03:41.299> called<00:03:41.450> said<00:03:41.750> it's<00:03:41.900> ten<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.440> song<00:03:42.620> like<00:03:42.769> that

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
is called said it's ten a song like that

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.949 
is called said it's ten a song like that
a<00:03:42.980> little<00:03:43.220> bit<00:03:43.340> higher<00:03:43.489> than<00:03:43.700> one<00:03:44.000> now<00:03:44.780> what

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
a little bit higher than one now what

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.390 
a little bit higher than one now what
that<00:03:44.989> they<00:03:45.200> painted<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.590> makes<00:03:45.860> up<00:03:45.980> my<00:03:46.130> hair

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
that they painted just makes up my hair

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.940 
that they painted just makes up my hair
a<00:03:46.430> little<00:03:46.549> bit<00:03:46.700> more<00:03:46.970> stiff<00:03:47.440> there's<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.709> just

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
a little bit more stiff there's you just

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.090 
a little bit more stiff there's you just
moves<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.280> little<00:03:49.430> bit<00:03:49.519> less<00:03:50.680> okay<00:03:51.970> now<00:03:52.970> as<00:03:54.100> you

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
moves a little bit less okay now as you

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.910 
moves a little bit less okay now as you
can<00:03:55.220> see<00:03:55.280> what<00:03:56.090> happens<00:03:56.390> here<00:03:56.750> we<00:03:57.650> have<00:03:57.739> this

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
can see what happens here we have this

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.090 
can see what happens here we have this
little<00:03:58.130> bulge<00:03:58.519> up<00:03:59.060> here<00:03:59.560> where<00:04:00.560> we<00:04:00.590> forgot<00:04:01.010> to

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
little bulge up here where we forgot to

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.830 
little bulge up here where we forgot to
set<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.280> point

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
set the point

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.710 
set the point
so<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:03.079> there's<00:04:03.620> no<00:04:03.739> big<00:04:03.920> deal<00:04:04.130> about<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.730> so

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
so in there's no big deal about that so

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.970 
so in there's no big deal about that so
the<00:04:05.840> only<00:04:05.989> thing<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.350> wants<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.560> do<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:06.799> go<00:04:06.950> to

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
the only thing you wants to do is go to

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.930 
the only thing you wants to do is go to
the<00:04:07.299> position<00:04:08.299> cloth<00:04:08.630> belt<00:04:08.989> tag<00:04:09.470> again<00:04:09.940> clear

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
the position cloth belt tag again clear

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.180 
the position cloth belt tag again clear
it<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:13.090> yeah<00:04:14.090> clear<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.900> gives<00:04:15.319> you<00:04:15.440> f<00:04:15.650> -<00:04:15.920> again

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
it and yeah clear it gives you f - again

just press it again if you push draw on
as<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.340> can<00:04:28.430> see<00:04:28.550> now<00:04:28.760> we<00:04:28.820> saw<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:30.280> so

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
as you can see now we saw the of it so

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.279 
as you can see now we saw the of it so
that's<00:04:31.940> basically<00:04:32.360> how<00:04:32.450> fix<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:32.960> if<00:04:33.080> you've

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
that's basically how fix it if you've

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.310 
that's basically how fix it if you've
gotten<00:04:33.620> one<00:04:33.800> point<00:04:34.039> and<00:04:34.990> there's<00:04:35.990> no<00:04:36.110> works

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
gotten one point and there's no works

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.730 
gotten one point and there's no works
perfectly<00:04:36.680> fine<00:04:37.330> now<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.660> still<00:04:39.229> don't<00:04:39.440> like<00:04:39.500> it

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
perfectly fine now I still don't like it

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.430 
perfectly fine now I still don't like it
and<00:04:40.099> because<00:04:40.580> it's<00:04:41.000> all<00:04:41.120> flat<00:04:41.419> so<00:04:42.080> what's<00:04:42.260> out

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
and because it's all flat so what's out

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.339 
and because it's all flat so what's out
add<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.680> little<00:04:43.039> more<00:04:43.280> depth<00:04:43.700> to<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:45.080> I'm

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
add a little more depth to it so I'm

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.250 
add a little more depth to it so I'm
going<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.680> go<00:04:45.919> to<00:04:45.979> head<00:04:46.570> or<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.780> hair<00:04:47.960> start

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
going to go to head or the hair start

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.810 
going to go to head or the hair start
the<00:04:48.380> attack<00:04:48.760> go<00:04:49.760> to<00:04:50.030> hold<00:04:50.390> alt<00:04:51.490> on<00:04:52.490> my<00:04:52.640> keyboard

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
the attack go to hold alt on my keyboard

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.110 
the attack go to hold alt on my keyboard
could<00:04:53.720> simulate<00:04:54.110> cloth<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.280> cloth<00:04:55.640> surface

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
could simulate cloth and cloth surface

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.510 
could simulate cloth and cloth surface
or<00:04:56.330> cloth<00:04:56.720> herbs<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:59.169> so<00:05:00.169> when<00:05:00.950> I<00:05:00.979> press<00:05:01.130> alt

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
or cloth herbs and so when I press alt

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.540 
or cloth herbs and so when I press alt
oh<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:02.300> hope<00:05:02.780> all<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.229> while<00:05:03.380> I'm<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:03.890> get<00:05:04.160> this<00:05:04.280> a

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
oh I hope all the while I'm I get this a

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.510 
oh I hope all the while I'm I get this a
cloth<00:05:04.940> nerve<00:05:05.270> service<00:05:05.750> and<00:05:06.220> what<00:05:07.220> that<00:05:07.370> base

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
cloth nerve service and what that base

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.960 
cloth nerve service and what that base
just<00:05:07.789> makes<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.380> mixed<00:05:09.380> attack<00:05:09.680> a<00:05:09.979> parent<00:05:10.760> of

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
just makes the mixed attack a parent of

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.670 
just makes the mixed attack a parent of
the<00:05:11.240> hair<00:05:11.539> material<00:05:13.270> so<00:05:14.270> go<00:05:14.810> to<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.140> cloth<00:05:15.380> or

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
the hair material so go to the cloth or

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.909 
the hair material so go to the cloth or
the<00:05:15.950> tag<00:05:16.220> which<00:05:16.370> is<00:05:16.460> important<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.150> takes<00:05:17.750> the

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
the tag which is important and takes the

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.850 
the tag which is important and takes the
subdivisions<00:05:18.919> to<00:05:19.099> zero<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.590> doesn't

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
subdivisions to zero and so it doesn't

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.510 
subdivisions to zero and so it doesn't
bulge<00:05:22.280> out<00:05:22.550> like<00:05:22.880> that<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:24.130> want<00:05:25.130> to<00:05:25.220> go<00:05:25.310> down<00:05:25.490> to

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
bulge out like that I want to go down to

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.159 
bulge out like that I want to go down to
thickness<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.270> just<00:05:26.390> add<00:05:26.570> a<00:05:26.599> little<00:05:26.780> bit<00:05:26.960> so

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
thickness and just add a little bit so

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.710 
thickness and just add a little bit so
just<00:05:27.200> one<00:05:27.560> centimeter<00:05:27.979> and<00:05:28.400> like<00:05:29.330> that

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
just one centimeter and like that

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.360 
just one centimeter and like that
so<00:05:30.110> I<00:05:30.140> should<00:05:30.470> see<00:05:30.620> if<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.890> hair<00:05:31.070> has<00:05:31.190> already

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
so I should see if the hair has already

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.040 
so I should see if the hair has already
gotten<00:05:31.729> a<00:05:31.880> lot<00:05:32.060> more<00:05:32.120> depth<00:05:32.510> and<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:32.990> don't

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
gotten a lot more depth and I don't

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.469 
gotten a lot more depth and I don't
really<00:05:33.409> care<00:05:34.070> about<00:05:34.310> these<00:05:34.520> sites<00:05:34.729> here<00:05:35.000> cuz

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
really care about these sites here cuz

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.120 
really care about these sites here cuz
when<00:05:35.720> you<00:05:35.840> render<00:05:36.080> it<00:05:36.200> out<00:05:38.080> we<00:05:39.080> go<00:05:39.229> they<00:05:40.010> look

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
when you render it out we go they look

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.399 
when you render it out we go they look
pretty<00:05:40.370> good

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
pretty good

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.240 
pretty good
and<00:05:42.409> if<00:05:42.650> you<00:05:42.710> want<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:42.950> go<00:05:43.070> again<00:05:44.260> this<00:05:45.260> is<00:05:45.409> e<00:05:45.530> it

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
and if you want to go again this is e it

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.310 
and if you want to go again this is e it
moves<00:05:46.460> pretty<00:05:46.669> good<00:05:46.909> looks<00:05:47.870> just<00:05:47.960> actually

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
moves pretty good looks just actually

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.540 
moves pretty good looks just actually
quite<00:05:48.500> good<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:50.240> I<00:05:50.360> really<00:05:50.570> like<00:05:50.720> it<00:05:50.900> I've

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
quite good and I really like it I've

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.130 
quite good and I really like it I've
have<00:05:52.550> really<00:05:52.849> figured<00:05:53.210> out<00:05:53.360> a<00:05:53.599> really<00:05:53.960> good

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
have really figured out a really good

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.690 
have really figured out a really good
method<00:05:54.380> for<00:05:54.560> this<00:05:54.830> yet<00:05:55.039> but<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.280> think<00:05:55.460> this<00:05:55.550> is

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
method for this yet but I think this is

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.089 
method for this yet but I think this is
pretty<00:05:55.880> it's<00:05:56.390> kind<00:05:56.659> of<00:05:56.690> good<00:05:56.870> good<00:05:57.560> I<00:05:57.620> still

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
pretty it's kind of good good I still

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.700 
pretty it's kind of good good I still
use<00:05:58.310> a<00:05:58.340> little<00:05:58.520> bit<00:05:58.640> more<00:05:58.820> to<00:05:59.570> it<00:05:59.599> but<00:05:59.990> I<00:06:00.140> like

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
use a little bit more to it but I like

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.050 
use a little bit more to it but I like
it

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
it

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.440 
it
yep<00:06:02.120> that<00:06:02.900> is<00:06:03.050> how<00:06:03.169> to<00:06:03.229> create<00:06:03.740> am<00:06:04.430> a<00:06:04.729> hair

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
yep that is how to create am a hair

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.020
