 topic in which we have to learn to 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.920

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.700
 we connect that fluency is not that 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.500
 I'm going to say how because our body 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.600

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.980

 in your life I've thought about it but really 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.630
 as I do not know and is not part of me 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.430
 daily routine does not come down from the thought it 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.200

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.239

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.680
 with the color of the light that you have and the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.930
 objects that surround you in your home can 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.790
 be a very practical way that 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.220

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.290
 say how can you do that 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.450
 to change within your own house what 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.070
 interesting the lighting is true what 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.930
 listened to a lot is part of the whole of a 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.000
 atmosphere that can give you then 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.800
 how can we do for example with the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.480
 color of light when I grab you the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.040
 mood counter in the color of nothing 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 clear well the color of the light of the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.060
 objects affect all our reflexes 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.100
 decision making and states and of 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.840
 according to your mood the walls 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.880
 from your house the colors that surround you 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.610
 can also affect also has 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.500
 therapeutic effects the lighting and the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.750
 color of our architectural environment 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.610
 they are the most influential because the colorful 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.619
 for example from the ceilings of the walls 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.810
 or the furniture the furniture that you have 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.300
 in your house it has to be from 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.619
 a way that everything is in harmony for 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.619
 which then has to do with the 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.270
 I also work a little bit but you 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.090
 no no 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.799
 suddenly you go to a spa or you go to a guy 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.840
 one is going to put that example and 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.329
 everything is painted blue or a color 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 cake that has nine colors 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.250
 colors they make transport you like 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.110
 an atmosphere of relaxation and for 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.790
 course instead look here in this set 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.470
 what we have here with bright colors 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.330
 because we are here every morning 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.910
 with you and we have to wake up and 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.830
 be in action 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.709
 through an attitude of like for 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.180
 the values between all is true 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.430
 then lighting for example 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.709
 conditions visual acuity and that 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.239
 perception of the colors that you have a 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.670
 bright light from one intensity 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.890
 of 1,000 watts is like for example the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.870
 daylight awakens the spirit and 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.390
 this set without need for example of 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.280
 tobacco coffee and nothing because it provides 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.500
 serotonin in the brain that is by the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.269
 light provides cellular or because the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.870
 teacher rapporteur puts that is to hurt 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.000
 it gets addressed and then this hormone 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.379
 start to put you in a good mood like the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.209
 it is known as the hormone of the 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.160
 true happiness the good hormone 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.560
 humor sees the govern to that goal that of the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.220
 joy of being gentlemen so what 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.260
 funny 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.240
 Exactly it's true because I just arrived 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.730
 to the mornings here I say wow let's go to 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.440
 start and it 's the first message that 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.510
 I want to send the other two very 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.300
 decorator architects who handle this 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.010
 kind of information know in what way 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.170
 paint your room how do you have to put 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.300
 the kitchen the furniture everything has a 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.780
 reason also in addition to the amount of 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.980
 lighting also affects us at the level 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.870
 neurophysiological the color of light is 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.360
 evident that happy colors 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.070
 intense motivate in a positive way the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.810
 darker colors is not that they put you 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.520
 in a negative way but you turn off a 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.620
 little if you really want to cost 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.990
 sleep that's why they tell you when you go to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.260
 sleep do not put in your room first 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.570
 that swims a wall with the wall color 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.320
 that is very dark that is very clear 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.690
 sorry 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.370
 rather dark for that to motivate you 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.380
 that when I go to bed and you 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.300
 body you go preparing that then 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.280
 I say let's go inside what is 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.530
 welfare a decoration advisor 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.540
 it can be you can paint a wall 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.100
 Darker colored that you'll 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.630
 wrap like in a different atmosphere 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.060
 to feel that you are like in a 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.420
 hospital all painted in exact white 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.730
 for example the wall 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.680
 I like to paint a darker color 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.780
 is the back wall of the back of the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.970
 that you see nothing but I see it but that of 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.800
 flyer but you feel it then that 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.419
 dark brown example a brown 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.030
 chocolate that always for example the 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.980
 abuse of white indoors or 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.200
 predominance of serious and sad colors 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.630
 like gray or beige for example 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.520
 also in your wardrobe is not only 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.310
 in the house is also a symptom of a 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.930
 depressive behavior now there are many people 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.490
 which says that black is the color of 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.380
 renewal because when you do not dress 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.200
 black is when you die and are reborn 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.910
 that's why the great executives 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.950
 the big brands always wear 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.510
 black or blue marc ideas about marin 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.669
 of colors that denote a bit of 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.260
 seriousness of seriousness you also have to 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.000
 have that but in this case we're 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.010
 talking about light we already have 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.050
 fluorescent lamps full type 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.880
 spectrum what they call that produces a 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.710
 similar pure white lighting 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.479
 in the sunlight and this allows that 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.850
 correct observation especially in the 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.370
 offices you are in your office more than 8 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.979
 10 12 hours there in front of a 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.020
 computer with those lights in a box that 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.490
 they are very strong 10 whitened by 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.710

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.419
 little light in tunisia that you can change 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.759

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.580
 start marching what wonder 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.440
 we learned a lot about the 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.750
 lighting and how to flow through 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.360
 this is a great tool with which 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.190
 we can help ourselves to be better and good 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.020
 with this great advice for the welfare 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.280
 we said goodbye now but not without 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.840
 invite her to stay for the 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.759
