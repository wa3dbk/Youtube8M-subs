00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
 good afternoon dear friends with you to and 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.350
 today I will show you the mechanism that 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.990
 it will be easy to build 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.500
 survival he I think he is very 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.010
 need this auto simple auto stove 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.230
 so but this is the framework I made for beauty 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.680
 Let us take this now 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.600
 more coal 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.910
 take the coal and here we put the ore 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.039
 which we need to recycle and lay down 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.309
 it is possible even though we are false 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.160
 let's say we put iron ore here 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.160
 then gold ore and take what coal and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:47.460
 all and here we will cut here's how 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.469
 see carried away the iron goes the same liza 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.059
 already crossbar 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.969
 that is, you have nothing to control and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:59.280
 just threw wait until that's all already 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.090
 ready the mechanism is not expensive does not require 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.329
 many resources 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 there is no cost is kraft paper craft 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.540
 Kuiper 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.020
 will under the description you create 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.600
 simple buildings that let about 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.420
 the mechanism of the rabbi is not so big of all 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.180
 one block this is here everything is all 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.470
 same in one unit for building on 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.920
 need 5 hackers one chest 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.549
 trap 2 is usually a chest and no stove 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.229
 redstone we do not need so that 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.810
 build here we will have a little in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.400
 system operations but to closing so 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.759
 to build you need to put a stove 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.579
 in one block from the ground above the stove to put 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.119
 hopper on him put a trap chest 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.820
 that is, it will load normal 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.060
 ore it will be loaded into the furnace here 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.409
 here is the upper crust further put hopper 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.360
 hopper god and put hopper up here 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.300
 put the usual chest so that these signs do not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.240
 interbred 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.310
 and the craft of the chest trap will also be in 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.850
 video description 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.680
 then this coal will be with us 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.150
 take coal will rush here 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.920
 further do the hopper so copper so 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.920
 wait a second so put the chest 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.800
 Hopper directed to the chest I clamp 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.530
 shift and put remove this hopper also 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.920
 falls out and directs it all our 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.060
 the mechanism is ready now we can all this 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.980
 close here and so and your can 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.780
 to use as well as it is possible 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.390
 close like this if you have it 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.970
 somewhere here let's say floor level 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.500
 it will be like this we build up I don't know 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.690
 some sort of location but pretty 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.430
 mechanism to get a little more comfortable and 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.800
 survival a few 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.500
 he will build a great help this is now 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.300
 close here as well from level 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.260
 gender raise this will be ours 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.730
 easier to get 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.680
 well, below and above it will be convenient well 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.300
 Well, all while you were coke 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.840
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.840
 bye everyone
