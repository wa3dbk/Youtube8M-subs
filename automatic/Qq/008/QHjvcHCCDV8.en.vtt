you said they play as a team what what

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.460 
you said they play as a team what what
is<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.240> thing<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.690> fear<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.350> they

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
is the thing that you fear that they

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.809 
is the thing that you fear that they
bring<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.920> table<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.310> you've<00:02:25.520> got<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.730> be

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
able to do a counteract I think that's

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.190 
able to do a counteract I think that's
the<00:02:28.910> thing<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.330> matters<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.600> most<00:02:29.690> you'd<00:02:30.110> be

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
the thing that matters the most you'd be

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.240 
the thing that matters the most you'd be
played<00:02:30.380> together<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.830> on<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.340> same<00:02:31.520> page<00:02:32.170> and

stage of fitness is he yeah I think he's
about<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:14.600> know<00:04:14.690> sort<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:14.989> 50<00:04:15.320> 50s

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.710 
yeah the good sign for us is that he
played<00:04:21.739> out<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.039> game<00:04:22.190> he<00:04:22.340> came

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
Kahn and fuchsia came quite strongly but

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.940 
Kahn and fuchsia came quite strongly but
yeah<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.270> downside<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:25.840> at<00:04:26.470> recovery<00:04:26.830> on

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
yeah the downside is at recovery on

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.550 
yeah the downside is at recovery on
Saturday<00:04:27.280> morning<00:04:27.610> he<00:04:27.700> was<00:04:27.820> on<00:04:27.910> crutches<00:04:28.090> so

in<00:04:29.560> amongst<00:04:29.980> all<00:04:30.160> that<00:04:30.370> I'm<00:04:30.610> not<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.240> physio<00:04:31.600> but

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
in amongst all that I'm not a physio but

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.680 
in amongst all that I'm not a physio but
so<00:04:32.080> hopefully<00:04:32.740> he<00:04:33.100> comes<00:04:33.310> up<00:04:33.490> any<00:04:34.240> self-doubt

as<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.440> result<00:04:35.830> of<00:04:35.950> yesterday<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:37.840> was<00:04:37.930> an

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
as a result of yesterday it was an

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.350 
as a result of yesterday it was an
interesting<00:04:38.290> day<00:04:38.650> for<00:04:38.860> us<00:04:38.920> yesterday

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
interesting day for us yesterday

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.700 
interesting day for us yesterday
probably<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.660> know<00:04:40.780> very<00:04:41.700> clinical<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:42.850> fast

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
probably you know very clinical and fast

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.750 
probably you know very clinical and fast
period<00:04:44.710> for<00:04:44.890> us<00:04:44.920> in<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.310> probably<00:04:45.490> first

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
period for us in that probably first

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.390 
period for us in that probably first
half<00:04:46.000> an<00:04:46.210> hour<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.740> leaving<00:04:47.740> out<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.890> nil<00:04:48.220> and

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
half an hour and leaving out a nil and

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.910 
half an hour and leaving out a nil and
then<00:04:48.490> obviously<00:04:48.930> second<00:04:49.930> half<00:04:50.080> just<00:04:50.350> had<00:04:50.770> no

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
then obviously second half just had no

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.640 
then obviously second half just had no
momentum<00:04:51.390> probably<00:04:52.390> took<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.320> foot<00:04:53.470> off<00:04:53.560> the

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
momentum probably took the foot off the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.190 
momentum probably took the foot off the
accelerator<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:54.220> little<00:04:54.490> bit<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:55.170> certainly<00:04:56.170> a

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
accelerator a little bit and certainly a

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.650 
accelerator a little bit and certainly a
disappointing<00:04:56.740> result<00:04:56.890> in<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.310> end<00:04:57.400> but

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
disappointing result in the end but

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.720 
disappointing result in the end but
we're<00:04:58.660> here<00:04:58.810> now<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.200> as<00:04:59.890> you<00:05:00.340> know<00:05:00.460> I'm<00:05:00.700> sure
