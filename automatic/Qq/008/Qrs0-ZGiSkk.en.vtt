but Paul Ryan can handle all of that in

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.760 
but Paul Ryan can handle all of that in
10<00:02:03.860> minutes<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.790> his<00:02:05.120> debate<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:06.230> I<00:02:06.260> think<00:02:06.440> it

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
10 minutes in his debate so I think it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.370 
10 minutes in his debate so I think it
was<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> wasted<00:02:07.490> opportunity<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:08.840> what<00:02:09.080> could

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
was a wasted opportunity of what could

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.500 
was a wasted opportunity of what could
have<00:02:09.500> been<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.800> great<00:02:10.010> stirring<00:02:10.760> rousing

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
taxes and all that as as Obama was but

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.910 
taxes and all that as as Obama was but
he<00:03:01.490> made<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.760> very<00:03:02.090> decisive<00:03:02.810> shift<00:03:03.080> which<00:03:03.680> for

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
he made a very decisive shift which for

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.850 
he made a very decisive shift which for
Obama<00:03:04.370> was<00:03:04.670> natural<00:03:05.330> because<00:03:06.320> he<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:06.530> by

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
Obama was natural because he is by

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.520 
Obama was natural because he is by
instinct<00:03:07.459> a<00:03:07.550> centrist<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.300> Obama<00:03:09.260> is

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
instinct a centrist and Obama is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.760 
instinct a centrist and Obama is
instinctually<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.670> far<00:03:11.330> more<00:03:11.570> left<00:03:11.989> Democrat

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
instinctually a far more left Democrat

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.759 
instinctually a far more left Democrat
and<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.670> because<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.570> that<00:03:14.720> shift<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.590> the

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
and it's a because of that shift to the

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.040 
and it's a because of that shift to the
center<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.730> Clinton<00:03:17.180> succeeded<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:17.959> he

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
center that Clinton succeeded that he

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.440 
center that Clinton succeeded that he
passed<00:03:18.260> welfare<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.670> he<00:03:19.820> ended<00:03:20.060> up<00:03:20.209> with

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
passed welfare that he ended up with

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.229 
passed welfare that he ended up with
about<00:03:20.590> budget<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.769> it's<00:03:22.340> because<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.120> he

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
about budget and it's because that he

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.620 
about budget and it's because that he
did<00:03:23.750> not<00:03:23.780> ship<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:25.130> Obama<00:03:25.610> is<00:03:25.790> where<00:03:26.300> he<00:03:26.450> is

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
did not ship that Obama is where he is

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.320 
you know an icon and I think there is a
kind<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.740> a<00:04:12.830> symbolism<00:04:13.400> in<00:04:13.730> Clinton<00:04:14.120> saying

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
kind of a symbolism in Clinton saying

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.390 
kind of a symbolism in Clinton saying
and<00:04:14.770> particularly<00:04:15.770> because<00:04:15.890> he<00:04:16.220> was<00:04:16.370> a

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
and particularly because he was a

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.660 
and particularly because he was a
centrist<00:04:16.910> Obama<00:04:17.270> is<00:04:17.450> not<00:04:17.660> he's<00:04:18.410> okay<00:04:18.860> support

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
centrist Obama is not he's okay support

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.330 
centrist Obama is not he's okay support
him<00:04:19.910> etc<00:04:20.140> but<00:04:21.140> I<00:04:21.380> don't<00:04:21.590> think<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:21.950> has<00:04:22.130> any

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
him etc but I don't think it has any

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.660 
him etc but I don't think it has any
resonance<00:04:22.930> beyond<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.110> hall<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.620> that's<00:04:25.430> why

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
resonance beyond the hall and that's why

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.340 
resonance beyond the hall and that's why
I<00:04:25.700> think<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.180> was<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.330> missed<00:04:26.600> opportunity<00:04:26.720> it

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
I think it was a missed opportunity it

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.320 
I think it was a missed opportunity it
could<00:04:27.530> have<00:04:27.620> been<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.770> tight<00:04:28.070> speech<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:29.090> could

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
could have been a tight speech it could

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.970 
could have been a tight speech it could
have<00:04:29.420> been<00:04:29.510> an<00:04:29.630> Obama<00:04:29.990> oriented<00:04:30.560> spaceman<00:04:30.950> I

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
have been an Obama oriented spaceman I

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.430 
have been an Obama oriented spaceman I
think<00:04:31.190> there's<00:04:31.340> one<00:04:31.400> great<00:04:31.820> irony<00:04:32.300> here<00:04:32.510> think

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
think there's one great irony here think

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.670 
think there's one great irony here think
about<00:04:33.680> how<00:04:33.980> long<00:04:34.280> Obama<00:04:34.880> was<00:04:35.660> hiding<00:04:36.140> behind

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
about how long Obama was hiding behind

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.700 
about how long Obama was hiding behind
the<00:04:37.160> curtains<00:04:37.580> waiting<00:04:38.540> for<00:04:39.110> Clinton<00:04:39.500> to

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
the curtains waiting for Clinton to

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.700 
the curtains waiting for Clinton to
finish<00:04:40.070> in<00:04:40.820> some<00:04:41.240> way<00:04:41.420> it<00:04:41.690> was<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.260> Clinton

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
finish in some way it was the Clinton

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.730 
finish in some way it was the Clinton
revenge<00:04:43.160> 408<00:04:43.850> I'm<00:04:44.600> sure<00:04:44.900> he<00:04:45.020> was<00:04:45.200> sort<00:04:45.680> of

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
revenge 408 I'm sure he was sort of

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
revenge 408 I'm sure he was sort of
having<00:04:46.370> his<00:04:46.490> watch<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.630> whole<00:04:47.810> time<00:04:48.080> in

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
having his watch the whole time in

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.790 
having his watch the whole time in
disbelief<00:04:49.760> about<00:04:50.360> how<00:04:50.780> long<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.170> was<00:04:51.260> going<00:04:51.530> on

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
disbelief about how long it was going on

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.060 
disbelief about how long it was going on
and<00:04:52.130> in<00:04:52.700> a<00:04:52.820> way<00:04:52.850> it<00:04:53.000> was<00:04:53.330> a<00:04:53.660> Clinton<00:04:54.620> keeping

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
and in a way it was a Clinton keeping

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.760 
and in a way it was a Clinton keeping
people<00:04:55.460> waiting<00:04:55.670> as<00:04:56.030> he<00:04:56.660> always<00:04:56.840> does<00:04:57.290> except

people waiting as he always does except
