are death traps do not drive them they
are<00:03:58.170> plastic<00:03:58.890> things<00:03:59.220> on<00:03:59.490> wheels<00:03:59.900> but<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
are plastic things on wheels but the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.610 
are plastic things on wheels but the
fact<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.280> US<00:04:02.640> safety<00:04:03.230> safety<00:04:04.230> board

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
fact is the the US safety safety board

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.270 
fact is the the US safety safety board
is<00:04:04.770> so<00:04:04.920> small<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:06.000> just<00:04:06.440> they<00:04:07.440> they<00:04:07.860> get

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
is so small it's just they they get

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.190 
is so small it's just they they get
stuff<00:04:08.580> past<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.240> you<00:04:09.840> get<00:04:09.990> a<00:04:10.020> lot<00:04:10.170> of

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
stuff past and you get a lot of

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.560 
stuff past and you get a lot of
fabrication<00:04:10.740> done<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.880> don't<00:04:12.300> really<00:04:12.390> have

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
fabrication done I don't really have

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.480 
fabrication done I don't really have
enough<00:04:12.600> time<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:12.960> talk<00:04:13.200> about<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.830> put

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
enough time to talk about this I put

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.090 
enough time to talk about this I put
this<00:04:14.580> up<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.910> another<00:04:15.180> video<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:16.100> I'll

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
this up to another video and I'll

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.739 
this up to another video and I'll
further<00:04:17.700> explain<00:04:18.229> domestic<00:04:19.229> vs.<00:04:19.470> Ford
