 I think it's me I'm against because it's generated by a perverse 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.210
 red cape girl and holiday clothes in May at the beach power with the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.089
 I work the people 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.130

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.550
 burns a fedex forum by cana 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.980
 little by little I'm a little bit attacked 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.060
 worth stressing the game with the naval goes now let's take a look at the games 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.620
 when I was little I spent afternoons and evenings and many other sciences of 8 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.250
 bits 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.370
 in three fight games like the murban tv1 previously quoted that in the biennium 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.110
 I had to wait for the worst ones since I was a child 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.450
 but there are days I'm a bit different in terms of graphics in the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.850
 sixth they play and only seeking more and more realism 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.130
 and helping to carry out fight games that we are going to talk about ufc the dispute 10 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.840
 it's very difficult to actually treat a fighting game 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
 because in sporting and uespi various combinations of blows 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.140
 for being literally a free fight but this game overcame the challenges and 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.180
 was able to mix the fight types perfectly 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 You're not understanding. Pay attention. 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.710
 I will not give it all if I can stand up in the strongest style and tai other or one 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.460
 show in the style of james 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 standing al punctures and kicks can be intercities and different ways beyond 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.750
 to attend but this is normal in fighting games 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.000
 but this game can hold the turkey right at the exact moment when 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.010
 trash 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.920
 with other movements you can hug and strike more closely and even knock down 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.260
 your opponent 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.280
 only you can punch but you can pack jiu-jitsu blocks that can 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130
 end the fight 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.430
 plus a great gameplay with cpf the awesome 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.870
 the light modeling and textures are beautifully crafted reaching very close to the 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.490
 real 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.979
 the characters are real fighters having each a different style of play and 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.979
 so it's up to you how to win from your nest 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:19.459
