00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hi guys this is an explanation of why 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.020
 I did not have it today, it's six in the morning, I 'm 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.760
 with hair and badu I did not take a shower 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.740
 I still did not sleep because I was 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.049
 trying to record a recent video to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.350
 now but because it does not have decent video 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.910
 Today you ask yourself and I answer to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.029
 You the next I was trying to do 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.359
 a video of that game here the magic book 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:30.500
 just for the test here is a passage for you 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:39.300
 Come on, it was to turn the page, dammit. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:43.140
 again want me to do so do not turn around 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.680
 I turned around I was thankful 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.670
 here it is without showing the magic now 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.670
 okay 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.699
 the lawyer exactly I was trying 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.070
 make a video of this game here more than 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.809
 It happens this game is very annoying I had 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.270
 to be trying something to be able to 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.400
 to make the video gateway not work 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.619
 only that but I had to bring a board 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.600
 from passing here to my room to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.220
 be able to support the book on it for 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.330
 playstation camera crap that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.950
 It's here on my side, that's why I 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.049
 I'm pointing you 're seeing 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.780
 I could see a business were 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.000
 several attempts had no way of 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 business for free in the last that deal 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.020
 with a little better god of 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.030
 audio sync with video and I do not 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.369
 I can handle this. I'm messing with 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.159
 mouth to say something're leaving another 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.900
 sound the video sucked at the top 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.240
 I can overthrow my 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.220
 mixer in the end and he stopped 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.259
 work right, you're seeing this mix 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.299
 Iraq where the book my microphone I 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.490
 use to record videos now only 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.310
 half of it is running that half 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.680
 you ask yourself the half that I do not use 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.200
 because what I need there is not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.450
 working, but look how wonderful it is there 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.939
 What happens is there is no video today. 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.009
 because I decided to make an English box 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.810
 Why I fell here that I bought in Portugal. 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.630
 everybody is asking for video of this 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.460
 Now, this is boring, right? 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 with a book I have to use a board 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.149
 to pass to support the free on top 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.879
 so the camera can see 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.560
 So this is the spell book game. 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.480
 does not comply 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.890
 I would not recommend it to anyone because it is not a 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.660
 cool game is more a story 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.950
 interactive and can not do video 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.170
 this crap 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.780
 so it's there for you because it did not have 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.190
 video today and now it's six in the morning I 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.319
 I'm sleepless because I was so far. 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.150
 trying to make something work 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:37.440
 Well I say my mixer there is not even 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:42.200
 How I try is this, people. 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.610
 What a happy day for all of us. 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.680
 you do not have to make video games that 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.650
 use music if you do not have a room 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.830
 because in front of the pc it is difficult 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:58.830
 Do you have to bring a ironing board? 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.700
 to keep things up is 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.000
 these people 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.390
 Thank you patience, good morning, everyone. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.390
 bye
