00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.290
 yesterday's video but you know I have 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.420

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.330

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.320
 One pass like this I say and it is already because

 endure this situation for Monday it 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.310
 I suppose I have to be 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.990
 holding on with my computer that you know 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.150
 that is very very broken I have to process 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.739
 the warranty directly with asus I have 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.119
 to depend on my sister's laptop 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.880
 that who I have a sister because then 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.400
 you know how the little sisters are 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.810
 I leave that's when you put this 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.310
 introduction with the tcr that was a 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.080
 start of game that I can is not for 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.090
 so much but what is really fat is what 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.720
 you are going to see below is a chain 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:51.100
 of casualties with the w a chain of 10 casualties 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.590
 and then I put there's a round that 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.600
 destroy with the ballista who charged me to 5 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.250
 it comes is also very good but neither 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.960
 you can see many more videos 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.580
 long like the one you're seeing now 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.680
 if you are seeing it, it is that I could 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.199
 render well and all that but good 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.430
 kids here already killed the first pw 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.470
 quick charger muffler 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.970
 the second the third here they are staying 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:18.000
 a little bit of this race we recharged 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.800
 4th 5th 6th down here seventh eighth 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 the one that went by the sale does not escape me 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.020
 but the other one not ninth and tenth in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.120
 a chain of casualties here the other appears 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.680
 I can not kill him anymore 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.090
 past kids you will see here that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.350
 movie mode is left as it was 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 watching the death chamber and when 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.310
 reappear I was standing as I was 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.360
 screaming for the team the expertise the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.590
 He devised for you kid to stop to stop it 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.420
 in a more euphoric way at least 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.780
 here and here I am watching the round with the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.979
 ballista is pretty good especially 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.530
 especially when I start that I order there 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.750
 to three or four people and it's pretty 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.490
 quick here pointed down there in cardio 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.290
 they are always appearing enough people are 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.509
 the first one escapes me with the shield that 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.509
 then it goes quite for ass but good 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.000
 pointed there to the car I charge the first 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.920
 pointed the second he turned me here to the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.229
 left that you always usually put one 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.020
 the third the red dot I turned around 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.030
 the fourth quest cloud and the fifth that already 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.580
 It's the shield that costs me a little 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.110
 a little more to find it but good at 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.430
 end to end here is the type with the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.720
 shield that always make you nervous 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.300
 when you see it but good 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.680
 in the end it falls so after this 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.420
 chain of casualties that if you want some 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.250
 council meters in land earth pinion 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.470

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.970

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.110
