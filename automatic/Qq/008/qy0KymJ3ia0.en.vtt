00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.189
 jacket 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.210
 if you call it right let's 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:28.650
 Now take a closer look and in the back of it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.470
 cloak every dent is seen well its white 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.270
 the shirt is also gorgeous done well let's 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.729
 let's go a little higher look at 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.360
 his head is beautifully painted 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.820
 so macro yes here we see it 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.790
 wonderful green joker 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.340
 his insidious white smile is healthy 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.159
 green blog his hair but his sure 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.679
 crazy 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.719
 here my eyes are small 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.490
 the boys on the collar if you see there 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.359
 green paint but it's not very sad 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.179
 but now let's see it 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.700
 mobility so head turns on 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.250
 160 degrees 360 and I will not try 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.399
 I will not risk it up so and of course 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.799
 down here everything's small here 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.680
 a problem they do not turn on 360 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.959
 degrees and over his shoulders in many 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.019
 figures you see now is made so 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.150
 that you can not turn 260 but it is not 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.430
 too important here you can turn up and 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.560
 farther farther because farther 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.239
 hinder shoulders 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.760
 if you ask me where you purchased 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.110
 I bought it in England for somewhere 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.720
 twenty three dollars with pennies well 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.790
 probably you can buy on ebay 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.310
 there and so now create you show 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.879
 elbow mobility rises 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.620
 hand scrolls too 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:56.000
 rotate 360 â€‹â€‹degrees and and you can 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.549
 pull out but i won't be the same 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.950
 hand all the same here nothing 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.930

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.299
 lower to his feet 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.829
 many don't move back because 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.579

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.620
