00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
pressure plate activated so as you can

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.200 
pressure plate activated so as you can
see<00:00:39.910> just<00:00:40.170> walk<00:00:41.170> over<00:00:41.440> it<00:00:41.739> it<00:00:41.950> closes<00:00:42.610> or<00:00:42.940> it

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:42.560 
block as a floor all right so you want
to<00:02:33.910> mirror<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:35.170> side<00:02:35.560> we<00:02:40.200> go<00:02:41.200> and

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
to mirror that on this side we go and

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.380 
to mirror that on this side we go and
yeah<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.630> just<00:02:44.080> make<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.040> same<00:02:45.310> thing<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:46.030> the

other side I'm sorry about the lag spike
my<00:02:48.850> computer<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.600> dying<00:02:53.550> yeah<00:02:54.550> you<00:02:54.610> just<00:02:54.820> want

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
my computer is dying yeah you just want

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.479 
my computer is dying yeah you just want
to<00:02:55.150> do<00:02:55.360> this<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:59.080> repeater<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.739> the<00:03:00.100> default

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
to do this and a repeater on the default

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.199 
to do this and a repeater on the default
amount<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.790> ticks<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.480> redstone<00:03:01.810> dust

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
amount of ticks and a redstone dust

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.759 
amount of ticks and a redstone dust
sticky<00:03:04.209> piston<00:03:04.690> facing<00:03:04.870> upwards<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.650> can

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
sticky piston facing upwards you can

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.670 
sticky piston facing upwards you can
also<00:03:05.920> use<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:07.769> normal<00:03:08.769> piston<00:03:09.750> with<00:03:10.750> sand<00:03:11.500> on

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
also use a normal piston with sand on

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.570 
also use a normal piston with sand on
top<00:03:11.709> if<00:03:12.160> you're<00:03:12.340> really<00:03:13.200> in<00:03:14.200> dire<00:03:14.709> need<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.130> the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
top if you're really in dire need of the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.780 
top if you're really in dire need of the
slowing<00:03:16.030> balls<00:03:16.269> or<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.680> you're<00:03:18.160> just<00:03:18.190> not<00:03:18.580> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
slowing balls or you you're just not the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.940 
slowing balls or you you're just not the
end<00:03:19.000> game<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:20.550> this<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:22.290> basically<00:03:23.290> all<00:03:23.739> you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
end game and this is basically all you

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.370 
end game and this is basically all you
want<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.190> place<00:03:24.790> two<00:03:25.090> blocks<00:03:25.300> right<00:03:25.630> here<00:03:26.050> to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
want to place two blocks right here to

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.080 
want to place two blocks right here to
prevent<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:28.830> water<00:03:29.830> from<00:03:30.010> flowing<00:03:30.519> into<00:03:30.700> your

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
prevent the water from flowing into your

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.880 
prevent the water from flowing into your
present<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:31.570> that's<00:03:31.720> done

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
present so that's done

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.090 
present so that's done
so<00:03:34.520> if<00:03:34.670> we<00:03:34.819> just<00:03:35.120> activated<00:03:35.810> once<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.470> we<00:03:36.770> get

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
so if we just activated once and we get

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.290 
so if we just activated once and we get
a<00:03:37.430> few<00:03:38.270> buckets<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.280> one<00:03:40.280> bucket<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.760> water<00:03:40.940> I

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
a few buckets and one bucket of water I

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.430 
a few buckets and one bucket of water I
can<00:03:42.200> place<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.190> bucket<00:03:43.850> in<00:03:44.180> each<00:03:44.720> dispenser

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
can place in a bucket in each dispenser

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.530 
can place in a bucket in each dispenser
if<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:45.709> will<00:03:45.920> drop<00:03:46.430> them<00:03:48.880> go<00:03:49.880> so<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.270> want<00:03:50.450> to

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
if I will drop them go so you want to

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.320 
if I will drop them go so you want to
outline<00:03:51.380> where<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.640> water<00:03:52.850> is<00:03:52.970> going<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.240> be

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
outline where the water is going to be

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:03.280 
outline where the water is going to be
and<00:03:56.330> place<00:03:56.570> water<00:03:56.810> down<00:03:57.080> right<00:03:57.770> there<00:04:02.170> build<00:04:03.170> a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
and place water down right there build a

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.620 
and place water down right there build a
nice<00:04:03.470> little<00:04:03.770> frame<00:04:04.160> around<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.360> don't

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
nice little frame around it so you don't

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.750 
nice little frame around it so you don't

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
a redstone dust on top under the button

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.650 
a redstone dust on top under the button
going<00:04:27.470> out<00:04:27.620> into<00:04:28.100> this<00:04:28.550> redstone<00:04:28.970> dust<00:04:29.390> is<00:04:29.630> a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
going out into this redstone dust is a

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.250 
going out into this redstone dust is a
repeater<00:04:30.169> or<00:04:31.120> yeah<00:04:32.120> out<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.480> this<00:04:32.660> block<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.080> a

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
repeater or yeah out of this block is a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.890 
repeater or yeah out of this block is a
repeater<00:04:33.710> facing<00:04:34.370> towards<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.270> other<00:04:35.540> side

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
repeater facing towards the other side

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.580 
repeater facing towards the other side
and<00:04:36.110> then<00:04:36.830> just<00:04:37.160> put<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> block<00:04:37.610> right<00:04:37.790> there<00:04:38.590> so

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
and then just put a block right there so

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.360 
and then just put a block right there so
the<00:04:39.860> button<00:04:40.130> just<00:04:40.310> activates<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:42.140> door

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.830 

so<00:04:47.370> if<00:04:47.639> you're<00:04:47.879> in<00:04:48.059> a<00:04:48.150> situation<00:04:48.180> like<00:04:48.689> this

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
so if you're in a situation like this

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.999 
so if you're in a situation like this
and<00:04:49.349> on<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:50.069> on<00:04:50.129> it<00:04:50.189> takes<00:04:50.460> too<00:04:50.639> long<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:52.050> should

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
and on and on it takes too long I should

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.100 
and on and on it takes too long I should
mention<00:04:53.039> this<00:04:53.699> door<00:04:54.120> is<00:04:55.580> sprint<00:04:56.580> proof

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
mention this door is sprint proof

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.980 
mention this door is sprint proof
meaning<00:04:58.110> it<00:04:58.319> just<00:04:59.009> opens<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.699> closes<00:04:59.990> even

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
meaning it just opens and closes even

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.589 
meaning it just opens and closes even
when<00:05:01.499> in<00:05:01.740> sprint<00:05:04.069> so<00:05:05.069> yeah<00:05:05.610> that's<00:05:05.879> extremely

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
strength but it shouldn't happen too

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.749
