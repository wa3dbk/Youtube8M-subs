00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
out as well as my channel so basically

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.450 
out as well as my channel so basically
what<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.540> glitch<00:00:45.839> will<00:00:46.260> allow<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:47.220> is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
what this glitch will allow you to do is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.509 
what this glitch will allow you to do is
catapult<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.210> launch<00:00:48.720> any<00:00:49.019> vehicle<00:00:49.649> basically

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
catapult or launch any vehicle basically

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.880 
catapult or launch any vehicle basically
a<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.970> decent<00:00:51.360> amount<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.019> space<00:00:52.589> or

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
a pretty decent amount of space or

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.009 
a pretty decent amount of space or
basically<00:00:53.579> halfway<00:00:54.059> across<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> map<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
basically halfway across the map and

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.319 
basically halfway across the map and
it's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.470> very<00:00:55.500> fun<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.309> very<00:00:56.399> cool<00:00:57.089> glitch

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it's a very fun and very cool glitch

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.569 
it's a very fun and very cool glitch
which<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.229> yourself<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.800> with

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
which you can do with yourself and with

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970 
which you can do with yourself and with
your<00:00:59.789> friends<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.960> basically<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.859> want

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
your friends so basically what you want

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.400 
your friends so basically what you want
to<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.519> have<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> tank<00:01:03.179> and<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:04.050> can<00:01:04.259> be

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
to do is have a tank and it can be

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.070 
to do is have a tank and it can be
destroyed<00:01:04.800> but<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.759> know<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.360> video<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
destroyed but you know for the video and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.340 
destroyed but you know for the video and
I<00:01:07.530> guess<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:07.920> purposes<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.399> fun<00:01:08.940> it<00:01:09.929> would<00:01:10.229> be

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
I guess for purposes of fun it would be

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.139 
I guess for purposes of fun it would be
better<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.100> destroyed<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.000> can

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
better if it's not destroyed as you can

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.520 
better if it's not destroyed as you can
always<00:01:12.420> move<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:12.929> it's<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.410> good

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
always move it if it's not in a good

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.010 
always move it if it's not in a good
spot<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.850> need<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> normal<00:01:15.450> vehicle

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
spot and you just need a normal vehicle

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.510 
spot and you just need a normal vehicle
now<00:01:16.440> you're<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> need<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> experiment

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
now you're going to need to experiment

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.149 
now you're going to need to experiment
with<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.479> vehicle<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:19.050> it<00:01:19.440> sometimes<00:01:19.770> works

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
with the vehicle as it sometimes works

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
with the vehicle as it sometimes works
with<00:01:20.490> certain<00:01:20.729> vehicles<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.659> sometimes

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
with certain vehicles and then sometimes

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
with certain vehicles and then sometimes
it<00:01:22.229> doesn't<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.100> basically<00:01:23.460> you're<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it doesn't so basically you're going to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.600 
it doesn't so basically you're going to
need<00:01:24.149> to<00:01:24.179> figure<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.409> what<00:01:25.860> vehicle<00:01:26.460> works

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
need to figure out what vehicle works

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.820 
need to figure out what vehicle works
best<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.479> don't<00:01:27.929> really<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.500> set

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
best with you I don't really have a set

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.480 
best with you I don't really have a set
choice<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.520> vehicles<00:01:29.940> as<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:31.079> got<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> lot<00:01:32.460> of

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
choice of vehicles as I got a lot of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.889 
choice of vehicles as I got a lot of
times<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.939> certain<00:01:33.060> vehicles<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.780> then

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
times with certain vehicles and then

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.120 
times with certain vehicles and then
sometimes<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.439> didn't<00:01:34.649> work<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
sometimes it didn't work with that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370 
sometimes it didn't work with that
vehicle<00:01:35.520> again<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.479> once<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> tank

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
vehicle again so once you have a tank

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.310 
vehicle again so once you have a tank
and<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.920> vehicle<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.450> want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.079> take

and a vehicle all you want to do is take

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.889 
and a vehicle all you want to do is take
that<00:01:40.500> tank<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> flat<00:01:41.369> area<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.540> seems<00:01:42.719> to

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that tank to a flat area as it seems to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.569 
that tank to a flat area as it seems to
work<00:01:43.049> best<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.590> does<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.890> work<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.460> well

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
work best it does not work really well

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.910 
work best it does not work really well
