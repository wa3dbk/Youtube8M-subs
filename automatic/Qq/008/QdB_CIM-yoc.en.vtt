00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.870 
singular
so<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:12.010> spliced<00:02:13.010> all<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.640> cable<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.720> looks<00:02:15.110> like

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
so I spliced all the cable it looks like

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.940 
so I spliced all the cable it looks like
using<00:02:16.880> these<00:02:17.300> little<00:02:17.720> button<00:02:18.110> connectors

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.370 

pretty<00:02:21.950> simple<00:02:22.340> push<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.480> wires<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:24.080> go<00:02:24.140> all

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
pretty simple push the wires that go all

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.460 
pretty simple push the wires that go all
the<00:02:24.530> way<00:02:24.560> into<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.580> end<00:02:25.989> when<00:02:26.989> you<00:02:27.080> crimp<00:02:27.290> it

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
the way into the end when you crimp it

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.930 
the way into the end when you crimp it
you<00:02:27.590> want<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.800> crimp<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.069> as<00:02:28.190> square<00:02:28.489> as<00:02:28.670> you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
you want to crimp it as square as you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.020 
you want to crimp it as square as you
can<00:02:29.150> get<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.100> because<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.700> likes<00:02:31.850> to

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
can get so that it because it likes to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.540 
can get so that it because it likes to
bind<00:02:32.270> but<00:02:32.900> then<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.770> squeezes<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.220> little<00:02:34.459> bit

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
bind but then it squeezes a little bit

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.330 
bind but then it squeezes a little bit
of<00:02:34.670> jelly<00:02:34.940> out<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:36.280> supposedly<00:02:37.599> is<00:02:39.340> spliced

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
of jelly out and supposedly is spliced

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.979 
of jelly out and supposedly is spliced
so<00:02:41.330> now<00:02:41.480> I'm<00:02:41.930> gonna<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:43.120> thought<00:02:44.120> about<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.510> I

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
so now I'm gonna I thought about this I

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.180 
so now I'm gonna I thought about this I
kind<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:45.980> want<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.250> hook<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:48.010> hook<00:02:49.010> at

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
kind of want to hook the hook at

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.500 
kind of want to hook the hook at
everything<00:02:49.580> up<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.850> test<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.360> make<00:02:50.390> sure

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
everything up and test it to make sure

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.380 
everything up and test it to make sure
it<00:02:50.690> works<00:02:50.870> before<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.519> cover<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.640> back<00:02:52.760> over<00:02:53.000> so

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
it works before I cover it back over so

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.840 
it works before I cover it back over so
I<00:02:53.600> think<00:02:53.720> I'll<00:02:53.959> do<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.080> next

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
I think I'll do that next

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.160 
I think I'll do that next
okay<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:57.230> finished<00:02:57.799> my<00:02:58.040> pipe<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.959> decided<00:02:59.959> to

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
okay so I finished my pipe I decided to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.070 
okay so I finished my pipe I decided to
just<00:03:00.380> finish<00:03:00.709> it<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.450> hope<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.780> did<00:03:02.959> it

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
just finish it and hope that I did it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.400 
just finish it and hope that I did it
right<00:03:03.970> instead<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.120> waiting<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:06.049> checking

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
right instead of waiting and checking

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.870 
right instead of waiting and checking
everything<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:07.340> putting<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.819> all

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
everything and then putting it all

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.309 
everything and then putting it all
together<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.239> right<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:08.630> I'm<00:03:08.750> splicing<00:03:09.019> these

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
together so right now I'm splicing these

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.599 
together so right now I'm splicing these
in<00:03:11.260> doing<00:03:12.260> them<00:03:12.350> by<00:03:12.470> memory<00:03:12.950> for<00:03:13.190> now

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
in doing them by memory for now

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.410 
in doing them by memory for now
Hey<00:03:14.329> look<00:03:14.480> there's<00:03:14.690> instructions<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:17.060> it's<00:03:17.239> a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
Hey look there's instructions so it's a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.420 
Hey look there's instructions so it's a
text<00:03:17.720> written<00:03:17.780> Balram<00:03:18.680> fully<00:03:19.010> insert<00:03:19.220> and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
text written Balram fully insert and

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.490 
text written Balram fully insert and
hold<00:03:19.579> drop<00:03:19.820> layers<00:03:20.030> while<00:03:20.180> rotating<00:03:20.500> I'm

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
hold drop layers while rotating I'm

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.509 
hold drop layers while rotating I'm
trying<00:03:22.480> that's<00:03:23.480> why<00:03:23.600> is<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.780> planets<00:03:24.079> using

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.080 

that's<00:03:28.519> what<00:03:28.640> I'm<00:03:28.700> doing

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
that's what I'm doing

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.670 
that's what I'm doing
so<00:03:29.930> we're<00:03:30.380> here<00:03:30.590> inside<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.250> garage<00:03:31.450> we<00:03:32.450> have

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
so we're here inside the garage we have

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.520 
so we're here inside the garage we have
this<00:03:33.680> wire<00:03:33.950> here<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:35.000> comes<00:03:35.299> to<00:03:35.540> this<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.989> it

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
this wire here it comes to this and it

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.319 
this wire here it comes to this and it
goes<00:03:36.709> up<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.250> box<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.820> mounted<00:03:38.120> on<00:03:38.239> the

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
goes up to the box that I mounted on the

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.840 
goes up to the box that I mounted on the
outside<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:39.709> come<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.250> comes<00:03:40.489> in<00:03:40.640> from<00:03:40.820> the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
outside so come this comes in from the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.699 
outside so come this comes in from the
street<00:03:41.150> go<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.109> now<00:03:42.230> I'm<00:03:42.290> going<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.470> put<00:03:42.620> it

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
street go but now I'm going to put it

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.060 
street go but now I'm going to put it
into<00:03:42.890> this<00:03:43.010> box<00:03:43.070> on<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:43.940> side<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:45.470> wire<00:03:46.040> it

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
into this box on this side and wire it

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.130 
into this box on this side and wire it
into<00:03:46.280> those<00:03:46.519> then<00:03:47.359> I've<00:03:47.480> got<00:03:47.630> these<00:03:47.810> cables

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
into those then I've got these cables

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.860 
into those then I've got these cables
