00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.640
 e each of the students can have in their hands for the class 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.570
 pepe 7 of the issued a response to a question lagarde by the teacher in 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.909
 screen 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.839
 per cent what we need are for the relevant cites 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.839
 who demands and wants to comment every student has his 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.800
 one is the axis would be would pick up the answer 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 and then a program that our case has chosen ones for its simplicity that 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.640
 She was asked 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.840
 per cent what this new brand can give us percent and not loggia is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.589
 a hand go way to understand act 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.360
 between professor kilos 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.650
 for example if we have a very large wave in which the participation then 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.350
 can not accept either 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 mccann 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.590
 dean of the number of students 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.190
 the teacher issues a question the students answer that question if 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.360
 can guide 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.610
 by the way directed to the students they are understanding they are not understanding well 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.460
 there is also more 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.490
 percent later can be a debate on the response on the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 questions the process has asked 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.850
 the students have a better knowledge of the form but you ask about the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.550
 teacher 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.640
 and then they also know what more or less 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.460
 if they go well if so well oriented to the way of studying the subject 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.330
 Per hundred we have it also as it happened 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.250
 no way to make classes more participatory 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.470
 how to motivate 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.600
 so that the students are active during these master classes and that 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.270
 so to speak, do not limit yourself publicly to copy 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.240
 by the way no master class a class is positive highlighting the teacher 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.770
 that is, we want 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.740
 that the classes are much more active and we believe 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.340
 which is one that usually 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.830
 will include in all classes at the university I could have a crib 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.960
 it impacted in this one another way you got the activity on the part of the student 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.969
 currently you are using it in the first right in the first 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.559
 second and third d min 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.499
 i of engineers in san sebastiÃ¡n in peking 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.670
 but also also the santiscal the first and second of medicine 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.709
 Our goal is that, as I have already mentioned, all the students of the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.279
 diversity have a click here 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:35.449
 in this way we can motivate and do more seem to make them more participants 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.449
 on the shoulder and their own classes 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:40.309
 the new norm
