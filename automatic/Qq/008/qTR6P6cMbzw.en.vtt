be an a major scale daily play for you a
lot<00:00:33.600> slower<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.440> go

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.890 

okay<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.160> your<00:01:05.339> major<00:01:05.640> scale<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.450> that

okay so that's your major scale and that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.860 
okay so that's your major scale and that
would<00:01:07.050> actually<00:01:07.230> be<00:01:07.440> for<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.160> key<00:01:08.370> of<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
would actually be for the key of a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.150 
would actually be for the key of a
because<00:01:09.870> we're<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:10.350> playing<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
because we're actually playing the a

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.780 
because we're actually playing the a
note<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:14.010> root<00:01:14.250> note<00:01:14.430> that's<00:01:14.610> our

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
note as the root note that's our

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.460 
note as the root note that's our
starting<00:01:15.120> point<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.660> we<00:01:15.810> moved<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> let's<00:01:16.350> say

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
starting point if we moved it let's say

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.310 
starting point if we moved it let's say
down<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.800> here<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.450> we'd<00:01:18.690> be<00:01:18.810> starting<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.260> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
down to here and we'd be starting on the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
down to here and we'd be starting on the
sixth<00:01:19.560> string<00:01:19.590> third<00:01:19.950> fret<00:01:20.160> which<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.670> key

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
sixth string third fret which is the key

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.160 
sixth string third fret which is the key
of<00:01:20.970> G<00:01:21.270> okay<00:01:22.260> so<00:01:22.320> let<00:01:22.620> me<00:01:22.650> move<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.010> down<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.780> G<00:01:24.780> if

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
of G okay so let me move it down to G if

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
of G okay so let me move it down to G if
you<00:01:25.380> start<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> sixth<00:01:26.310> string<00:01:26.340> third

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you start here on the sixth string third

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:55.040 
you start here on the sixth string third
fret<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.840> playing<00:01:28.110> G<00:01:28.560> major<00:01:53.570> ok<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
fret here we playing G major ok so that

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.039 
fret here we playing G major ok so that
scale<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.950> movable<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.150> not<00:01:57.299> using<00:01:57.659> any<00:01:57.780> it's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
scale is movable it's not using any it's

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.260 
scale is movable it's not using any it's
not<00:01:58.380> using<00:01:58.710> any<00:01:58.979> open<00:01:59.370> position<00:01:59.729> string<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
not using any open position string so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.030 
not using any open position string so
you<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.479> move<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> anywhere<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.830> fret

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
you can move it anywhere on the fret

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.450 
you can move it anywhere on the fret
board<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:03.060> if<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:04.310> obviously<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.370> you

that's a great way to practice this is
actually<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.560> start<00:03:07.860> let's<00:03:08.070> say<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.280> fer<00:03:10.430> start

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
actually to start let's say on fer start

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.740 
actually to start let's say on fer start
on<00:03:11.520> F<00:03:11.640> sharp<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.910> played<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.210> f-sharp<00:03:12.360> major

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
on F sharp you played the f-sharp major

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.680 
on F sharp you played the f-sharp major
bar<00:03:13.080> chord<00:03:13.110> like<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.610> then<00:03:15.360> play<00:03:15.540> the

bar chord like this and then play the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:33.710 
bar chord like this and then play the
scale<00:03:31.100> get<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.190> idea<00:03:32.460> right<00:03:32.490> but<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> thing<00:03:33.540> I

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
scale get the idea right but the thing I

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.950 
scale get the idea right but the thing I
was<00:03:33.870> mentioning<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:35.690> reason<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.720> have

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
heard of there in G flat or what to the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.560 
heard of there in G flat or what to the
key<00:04:22.890> signature<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.550> all<00:04:23.700> these<00:04:23.880> flats<00:04:24.210> not

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
key signature so all these flats not

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.930 
key signature so all these flats not
very<00:04:24.870> normal<00:04:25.260> so<00:04:25.920> then<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.370> move<00:04:26.520> up<00:04:26.610> another

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
very normal so then you move up another

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.730 
very normal so then you move up another
half<00:04:27.090> so<00:04:27.210> we<00:04:27.330> got<00:04:27.480> G<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.350> then<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.560> move<00:04:28.710> up

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
half so we got G and then you move up

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.190 
half so we got G and then you move up
here<00:04:28.860> we<00:04:29.520> call<00:04:29.700> this<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:30.060> flat<00:04:30.360> Gillian<00:04:30.810> guitar

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
here we call this a flat Gillian guitar

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.100 
here we call this a flat Gillian guitar
because<00:04:31.590> G<00:04:32.010> sharp<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.520> kind<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.210> weird<00:04:33.570> key

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
because G sharp is kind of a weird key

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.750 
because G sharp is kind of a weird key
right<00:04:35.510> although<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.570> could<00:04:36.840> have<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.050> g-sharp

key of E major you could have G sharp

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.640 
key of E major you could have G sharp
minor<00:04:46.160> ok<00:04:47.160> but<00:04:48.110> generally<00:04:49.110> speaking<00:04:49.140> we<00:04:49.500> call

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
reason call daddy flat instead of a

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.120 
reason call daddy flat instead of a
sharp<00:04:56.850> because<00:04:57.150> he<00:04:57.360> flies<00:04:57.570> more<00:04:57.810> calmly<00:04:57.990> mm<00:04:58.620> ok

then see

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.300 
then see
sharp<00:05:00.629> or<00:05:00.900> D<00:05:01.169> flat<00:05:01.440> those<00:05:01.889> are<00:05:02.039> both<00:05:02.129> pretty

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
sharp or D flat those are both pretty

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.510 
sharp or D flat those are both pretty
common<00:05:02.729> in<00:05:02.879> D<00:05:03.509> and<00:05:03.840> E<00:05:04.229> flat<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.979> then<00:05:05.069> he<00:05:05.250> and

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
common in D and E flat and then he and

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.950 
common in D and E flat and then he and
then<00:05:05.669> it<00:05:05.789> starts<00:05:06.060> over<00:05:06.150> again<00:05:06.300> because<00:05:06.569> once

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
then it starts over again because once

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.839 
then it starts over again because once
you<00:05:07.050> get<00:05:07.169> up<00:05:07.229> to<00:05:07.319> the<00:05:07.440> 12th<00:05:07.530> fret<00:05:07.889> then<00:05:08.699> you're

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
you get up to the 12th fret then you're

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.450 
you get up to the 12th fret then you're
just<00:05:08.879> repeating<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.770> note<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.069> you<00:05:11.159> have<00:05:11.370> to

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
just repeating the note so you have to

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.580 
just repeating the note so you have to
open<00:05:11.699> the<00:05:11.789> E<00:05:11.849> string<00:05:12.150> well<00:05:12.900> this<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.080> also<00:05:13.289> an<00:05:13.500> E

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
open the E string well this is also an E

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.309 
open the E string well this is also an E
it's<00:05:14.550> just<00:05:14.699> an<00:05:14.789> octave<00:05:15.150> higher<00:05:15.229> where<00:05:16.229> you

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
it's just an octave higher where you

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.510 
it's just an octave higher where you
would<00:05:16.740> also<00:05:16.860> play<00:05:17.039> that<00:05:17.250> you<00:05:17.340> here<00:05:17.610> I'm<00:05:18.569> sorry

we're<00:05:45.449> in<00:05:45.659> our<00:05:45.810> moment<00:05:52.280> okay<00:05:53.810> all<00:05:54.810> right<00:05:56.150> in

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
we're in our moment okay all right in

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.850 
we're in our moment okay all right in
guitar<00:05:57.629> theory<00:05:58.050> we<00:05:58.199> have<00:05:58.379> something<00:05:58.830> called

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
guitar theory we have something called

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.490 
guitar theory we have something called
an<00:05:59.340> inharmonic<00:06:00.060> equivalent<00:06:00.870> which<00:06:01.169> is<00:06:01.319> like<00:06:01.469> a

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
an inharmonic equivalent which is like a

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.529 
an inharmonic equivalent which is like a
super<00:06:01.770> nerd<00:06:02.219> term<00:06:02.639> that<00:06:02.909> basically<00:06:02.969> means<00:06:03.449> the

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
super nerd term that basically means the

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:09.290 
super nerd term that basically means the
same<00:06:03.870> note<00:06:04.169> but<00:06:05.159> in<00:06:05.759> other<00:06:05.940> words<00:06:08.060> let<00:06:09.060> me<00:06:09.150> give

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
same note but in other words let me give

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.279 
same note but in other words let me give
you<00:06:09.389> an<00:06:09.479> example<00:06:09.539> here<00:06:11.599> let's<00:06:12.599> let's<00:06:12.870> take<00:06:13.139> for

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
you an example here let's let's take for

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.189 
you an example here let's let's take for
example<00:06:13.349> a<00:06:14.039> flat<00:06:14.669> all<00:06:15.029> right<00:06:15.210> this<00:06:15.930> note<00:06:16.169> right

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
example a flat all right this note right

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.390 
example a flat all right this note right
here<00:06:16.380> is<00:06:16.650> a<00:06:16.770> flat<00:06:17.300> well<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:19.380> in<00:06:19.590> harmonic

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
here is a flat well the in harmonic

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.659 
here is a flat well the in harmonic
equivalent<00:06:21.120> to<00:06:21.750> a<00:06:21.779> flat<00:06:22.169> is<00:06:22.409> G<00:06:22.860> sharp<00:06:23.219> so<00:06:23.550> in

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
equivalent to a flat is G sharp so in

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:24.830 
equivalent to a flat is G sharp so in
other<00:06:23.729> words<00:06:23.940> if<00:06:24.060> you<00:06:24.120> start<00:06:24.360> here<00:06:24.659> and<00:06:24.750> you're

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
other words if you start here and you're

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.350 
other words if you start here and you're
making<00:06:25.080> it<00:06:25.199> flat<00:06:25.710> you<00:06:26.580> can<00:06:26.669> make<00:06:26.819> a<00:06:26.849> note<00:06:27.000> flat

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
making it flat you can make a note flat

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.089 
making it flat you can make a note flat
you<00:06:27.539> go<00:06:27.659> this<00:06:27.900> way<00:06:28.139> your<00:06:28.380> lower<00:06:28.620> and<00:06:28.800> a<00:06:28.860> half

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
you go this way your lower and a half

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:30.860 
you go this way your lower and a half
step<00:06:29.370> if<00:06:29.550> you<00:06:29.639> lower<00:06:29.879> a<00:06:29.969> note<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:30.330> go<00:06:30.479> towards

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
step if you lower a note you go towards

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.839 
step if you lower a note you go towards
the<00:06:30.930> headstock<00:06:31.349> if<00:06:31.560> you<00:06:31.680> raise<00:06:31.979> the<00:06:32.340> note<00:06:32.550> you

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
the headstock if you raise the note you

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.580 
the headstock if you raise the note you
go<00:06:33.539> towards<00:06:34.050> the<00:06:34.319> pickups<00:06:35.060> ok<00:06:36.199> or<00:06:37.199> towards

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
go towards the pickups ok or towards

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.140 
go towards the pickups ok or towards
your<00:06:37.710> sound<00:06:37.919> or<00:06:38.219> whole<00:06:38.699> or<00:06:38.940> whatever<00:06:39.680> but

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
your sound or whole or whatever but

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.249 
your sound or whole or whatever but
basically<00:06:42.150> an<00:06:42.330> in<00:06:42.449> harmonic<00:06:42.779> equivalent

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 
basically an in harmonic equivalent

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.379 
basically an in harmonic equivalent
means<00:06:43.349> it's<00:06:43.590> the<00:06:43.740> same<00:06:44.039> note<00:06:44.430> but<00:06:44.849> it<00:06:44.969> has<00:06:45.090> two

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
means it's the same note but it has two

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:48.559 
means it's the same note but it has two
different<00:06:45.539> names<00:06:46.039> it's<00:06:47.039> just<00:06:47.250> like<00:06:47.340> a<00:06:47.370> coin<00:06:47.669> if

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:48.569 
different names it's just like a coin if

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.240 
different names it's just like a coin if
you<00:06:48.659> look<00:06:48.779> at<00:06:48.900> a<00:06:48.930> coin<00:06:49.199> it<00:06:49.740> might<00:06:49.889> have<00:06:50.009> two

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
you look at a coin it might have two

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.510 
you look at a coin it might have two
sides<00:06:50.520> but<00:06:51.389> still<00:06:51.659> just<00:06:51.810> one<00:06:52.020> coin<00:06:52.319> right<00:06:52.620> ok

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
sides but still just one coin right ok

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.149 
sides but still just one coin right ok
what's<00:06:53.699> the<00:06:53.729> same<00:06:53.940> idea<00:06:54.270> G<00:06:55.229> sharp<00:06:55.560> is<00:06:55.770> the<00:06:55.800> same

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
what's the same idea G sharp is the same

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.180 
what's the same idea G sharp is the same
note<00:06:56.460> as<00:06:56.490> a<00:06:56.789> flat<00:06:57.319> hey<00:06:58.319> that's<00:06:58.500> an<00:06:58.680> harmonic

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
note as a flat hey that's an harmonic

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.899 
note as a flat hey that's an harmonic
equivalent<00:07:00.289> the<00:07:01.289> flat<00:07:01.770> is<00:07:01.800> the<00:07:02.310> same<00:07:02.610> note<00:07:02.879> as

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:02.909 
equivalent the flat is the same note as

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.129 
equivalent the flat is the same note as
a<00:07:03.360> shark<00:07:04.219> ok<00:07:05.219> and<00:07:05.520> actually<00:07:06.300> ironically

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
a shark ok and actually ironically

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.920 
a shark ok and actually ironically
enough<00:07:08.180> drug<00:07:09.180> my<00:07:09.330> bees

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.030 

excuse<00:07:12.930> me<00:07:13.050> we're<00:07:13.170> talk<00:07:13.350> yeah<00:07:13.800> when<00:07:13.980> you're

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040 
excuse me we're talk yeah when you're

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.280 
excuse me we're talk yeah when you're
talking<00:07:14.280> about<00:07:14.370> be<00:07:14.610> it's<00:07:15.000> the<00:07:15.270> same<00:07:15.570> be<00:07:15.960> is<00:07:16.110> the

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.290 
talking about be it's the same be is the

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.650 
talking about be it's the same be is the
in<00:07:16.500> harmonic<00:07:16.980> equivalent<00:07:17.520> this<00:07:18.360> note<00:07:18.630> is

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
in harmonic equivalent this note is

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.330 
in harmonic equivalent this note is
actually<00:07:19.170> the<00:07:19.260> end<00:07:19.440> of<00:07:19.530> harmonic<00:07:19.890> equivalent

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
actually the end of harmonic equivalent

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.110 
actually the end of harmonic equivalent
of<00:07:20.520> Z<00:07:21.360> flat<00:07:21.750> so<00:07:22.110> C<00:07:22.350> flat<00:07:22.530> is<00:07:22.830> really<00:07:23.100> like<00:07:23.340> we

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
of Z flat so C flat is really like we

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.350 
of Z flat so C flat is really like we
just<00:07:24.210> call<00:07:24.360> it<00:07:24.390> be<00:07:24.600> as<00:07:24.780> if<00:07:24.960> C<00:07:25.500> flat<00:07:26.060> the<00:07:27.060> reason

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
just call it be as if C flat the reason

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.750 
just call it be as if C flat the reason
you<00:07:27.450> have<00:07:27.660> those<00:07:27.960> different<00:07:28.800> names<00:07:29.460> is

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760 
you have those different names is

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.910 
you have those different names is
because<00:07:30.000> in<00:07:30.090> the<00:07:30.210> different<00:07:30.540> keys<00:07:30.920> certain

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:31.920 
because in the different keys certain

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.460 
because in the different keys certain
notes<00:07:32.070> your<00:07:32.190> culture<00:07:32.520> and<00:07:32.670> things<00:07:32.910> okay<00:07:33.810> so

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
notes your culture and things okay so

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.440 
notes your culture and things okay so
for<00:07:34.650> example<00:07:34.710> and<00:07:35.250> the<00:07:35.610> key<00:07:35.730> of<00:07:35.850> a<00:07:35.940> major<00:07:36.150> B

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:36.450 
for example and the key of a major B

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.590 
for example and the key of a major B
flat<00:07:36.480> major<00:07:37.490> this<00:07:38.490> is<00:07:38.610> going<00:07:38.730> to<00:07:38.790> be<00:07:38.880> an<00:07:38.940> A<00:07:39.060> flat

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.600 
flat major this is going to be an A flat

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.610 
flat major this is going to be an A flat
major<00:07:40.200> chord<00:07:40.580> key<00:07:41.580> of<00:07:41.700> G<00:07:41.940> sharp<00:07:42.300> major<00:07:42.660> just

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 
major chord key of G sharp major just

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.760 
major chord key of G sharp major just
kind<00:07:43.830> of<00:07:43.860> weird<00:07:44.070> this<00:07:44.310> would<00:07:44.490> be<00:07:44.550> a<00:07:44.610> g-sharp

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.770 
kind of weird this would be a g-sharp

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.130 
kind of weird this would be a g-sharp
okay<00:07:46.770> that's<00:07:47.700> why<00:07:47.910> you<00:07:47.970> have<00:07:48.330> all<00:07:48.480> this<00:07:48.690> weird

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:49.140 
okay that's why you have all this weird

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.690 
okay that's why you have all this weird
and<00:07:49.680> that's<00:07:49.950> why<00:07:50.070> you<00:07:50.130> basically<00:07:50.490> have<00:07:50.670> all

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.700 
and that's why you basically have all

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.490

kind of confusing is because a lot of

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.800
