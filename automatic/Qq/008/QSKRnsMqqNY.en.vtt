and<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.620> things<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:45.110> extension<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.550> want<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and the things are extension I want to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
and the things are extension I want to
be<00:00:47.879> able<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.180> change<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.140> length<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.530> the

be able to change the length of the
extension<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.399> by<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> mean<00:00:51.809> here's<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
extension and by that I mean here's the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.970 
extension and by that I mean here's the
fixed<00:00:52.829> point<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:53.969> fixed

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
fixed point so this is going to be fixed

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.279 
fixed point so this is going to be fixed
so<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.129> bracket<00:00:56.550> fixes<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
so this bracket fixes on to the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.709 
so this bracket fixes on to the
handlebars<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.219> road<00:00:59.430> bike<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.510> can

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
handlebars of a road bike and I can

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
handlebars of a road bike and I can
slide<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:02.039> back<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.460> forth<00:01:02.760> along

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
slide that up that back and forth along

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.810 
slide that up that back and forth along
the<00:01:03.270> extension<00:01:03.960> okay<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.250> reason<00:01:05.670> why<00:01:05.790> I

hands<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> end<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> extension<00:01:10.770> or

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
hands to the end of the extension or

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
hands to the end of the extension or
they<00:01:11.070> need<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.430> holding<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.090> something

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
they need to be holding on to something

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.880 
they need to be holding on to something
doesn't<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> end<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
doesn't have to be the end of the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.179 
doesn't have to be the end of the
extension<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.460> prefer<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> end

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
extension I prefer that it is to the end

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
extension I prefer that it is to the end
but<00:01:17.189> they<00:01:18.119> obviously<00:01:18.210> can't<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.659> hanging<00:01:19.049> off

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
but they obviously can't be hanging off

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
but they obviously can't be hanging off
the<00:01:19.350> end<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> bar<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.549> needs<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.119> be

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the end of the bar so this needs to be

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.789 
the end of the bar so this needs to be
able<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.659> extended<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.680> it's

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
able to be extended you can see it's

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.499 
able to be extended you can see it's
quite<00:01:22.950> long<00:01:23.340> okay

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
quite long okay

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.200 
quite long okay
the<00:01:25.500> second<00:01:25.979> thing<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.369> look<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the second thing that I look for and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.219 
the second thing that I look for and
this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.869> important<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:29.869> if<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.990> take

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
this is really important is if I take

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.170 
this is really important is if I take
off<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.560> pad<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.340> look<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> armrest

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
off this pad and we look at the armrest

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.310 
off this pad and we look at the armrest
is<00:01:37.159> for<00:01:38.159> after<00:01:38.640> movement<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.600> armrest<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
is for after movement in this armrest so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
is for after movement in this armrest so
I<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.650> move<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.909> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
I can move you can see here on this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.030 
I can move you can see here on this
particular<00:01:44.930> era<00:01:45.930> bar<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.649> move<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
particular era bar that I can move the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460 
particular era bar that I can move the
pad<00:01:47.310> forward<00:01:48.240> or<00:01:48.450> backwards<00:01:48.990> there's<00:01:49.229> four

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
pad forward or backwards there's four

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.289 
pad forward or backwards there's four
different<00:01:49.500> spaces<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.579> move<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.939> through

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
different spaces to move that through

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.690 
different spaces to move that through
and<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:52.320> important<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.189> want<00:01:53.490> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and that's important because I want to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.450

down we can slide the whole mechanism

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.630 
down we can slide the whole mechanism
along<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:25.050> extension<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.890> lot<00:05:26.490> of
