bit like that and the video was about I
was<00:01:28.549> when<00:01:28.820> I<00:01:28.850> first<00:01:29.360> started<00:01:29.720> changing<00:01:29.960> leads

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
was when I first started changing leads

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.810 
was when I first started changing leads
on<00:01:30.470> doing<00:01:30.680> flying<00:01:30.920> lead<00:01:31.159> changes<00:01:31.460> on<00:01:31.610> him<00:01:31.729> and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
on doing flying lead changes on him and

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.219 
on doing flying lead changes on him and
I<00:01:31.939> was<00:01:32.060> saying<00:01:32.329> in<00:01:32.479> this<00:01:32.540> video<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.140> just

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
I was saying in this video that I just

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.620 
I was saying in this video that I just
recently<00:01:34.009> started<00:01:34.490> working<00:01:34.939> on<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.240> counter

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
recently started working on the counter

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.039 
recently started working on the counter
bend<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.890> counter<00:01:37.219> canter<00:01:37.579> so<00:01:38.119> a<00:01:38.420> counter

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
bend and the counter canter so a counter

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.810 
bend and the counter canter so a counter
band<00:01:39.290> would<00:01:39.500> be<00:01:39.710> if<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:39.979> was<00:01:40.130> cantering<00:01:40.549> around

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
band would be if I was cantering around

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.730 
band would be if I was cantering around
in<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.119> left<00:01:41.390> circle<00:01:41.750> on<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.020> left<00:01:42.049> lead<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:42.680> I

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
in a left circle on the left lead and I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.219 
in a left circle on the left lead and I
had<00:01:42.829> his<00:01:42.950> head<00:01:43.100> bent<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.610> right<00:01:43.640> okay<00:01:44.659> the

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
had his head bent to the right okay the

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.929 
had his head bent to the right okay the
counter<00:01:45.560> counter<00:01:45.920> would<00:01:46.340> be<00:01:46.399> if<00:01:46.729> I<00:01:46.820> was

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
counter counter would be if I was

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.929 
counter counter would be if I was
carrying<00:01:47.149> around<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:48.310> left<00:01:49.310> circle<00:01:49.700> on<00:01:49.880> a

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
carrying around in a left circle on a

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.090 
carrying around in a left circle on a
right<00:01:50.420> lead<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.229> had<00:01:51.350> his<00:01:51.469> head<00:01:51.649> bent<00:01:51.920> to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
right lead and I had his head bent to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.499 
right lead and I had his head bent to
either<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:52.430> left<00:01:52.549> or<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.119> right<00:01:53.149> depending

either the left or the right depending

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.850 
either the left or the right depending
on<00:01:53.659> which<00:01:53.780> way<00:01:53.960> your<00:01:54.140> counter<00:01:54.439> count<00:01:54.619> is<00:01:54.710> true

on which way your counter count is true

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.319 
on which way your counter count is true
ways<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.159> counter<00:01:55.430> can<00:01:55.579> even<00:01:55.789> counter<00:01:56.030> counter

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
ways to counter can even counter counter

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.550
