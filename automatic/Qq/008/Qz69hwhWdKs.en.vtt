doctor let me ask you real quick we
talked<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.000> root<00:00:03.720> canals<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:04.170> little<00:00:04.380> bit

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
talked about root canals a little bit

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.079 
talked about root canals a little bit
what<00:00:04.740> are<00:00:04.770> some<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.160> reasons<00:00:05.580> that<00:00:05.640> people

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
what are some of the reasons that people

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.660 
what are some of the reasons that people
get<00:00:06.359> those<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.680> first<00:00:07.919> place<00:00:08.130> that

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
get those in the first place that

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.259 
get those in the first place that
perhaps<00:00:09.210> starts<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.870> problem<00:00:10.800> rolling

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
perhaps starts this problem rolling

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.299 
perhaps starts this problem rolling
fifty<00:00:12.269> years<00:00:12.480> ago<00:00:12.540> when<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.590> got<00:00:13.620> out<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.009> dental

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
fifty years ago when I got out of dental

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.760 
fifty years ago when I got out of dental
school<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:15.030> had<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> root<00:00:15.540> canal<00:00:15.900> done<00:00:15.929> because

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
school you had a root canal done because

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.779 
school you had a root canal done because
somebody<00:00:17.310> had<00:00:17.580> elbowed<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.140> mouth

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
somebody had elbowed you in the mouth

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.310 
somebody had elbowed you in the mouth
yeah<00:00:20.789> where<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> grew<00:00:21.779> up<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:23.760> only<00:00:24.390> sport<00:00:25.019> Nam

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
yeah where I grew up the only sport Nam

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.189 
yeah where I grew up the only sport Nam
the<00:00:25.710> favorite<00:00:26.640> sport<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.269> hockey<00:00:27.740> well<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:30.199> was

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the favorite sport was hockey well I was

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.770 
the favorite sport was hockey well I was
almost<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.740> well<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.940> almost<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.450> big<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
almost as well I was almost as big in

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
almost as well I was almost as big in
junior<00:00:34.110> high<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.710> am<00:00:34.890> now<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> became<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
junior high as I am now so I became the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.869 
junior high as I am now so I became the
goalie<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.590> couldn't<00:00:38.010> skate<00:00:38.219> backwards<00:00:38.460> so

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
goalie now I couldn't skate backwards so

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.030 
goalie now I couldn't skate backwards so
that's<00:00:39.059> another<00:00:39.329> reason<00:00:39.680> goalie<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:41.660> boom

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
that's another reason goalie but boom

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.410 
that's another reason goalie but boom
you<00:00:44.040> get<00:00:44.250> hit<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.579> mouth<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
you get hit in the mouth with of a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.930 
you get hit in the mouth with of a
hockey<00:00:45.870> puck<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.309> need<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.730> root<00:00:47.910> canal

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
hockey puck and you need a root canal

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.869 
hockey puck and you need a root canal
because<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.930> killed<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> tooth<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:50.430> if

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
because you just killed the tooth or if

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.020 
because you just killed the tooth or if
decay<00:00:51.770> burrows<00:00:52.770> into<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> tooth<00:00:53.550> into<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
decay burrows into the tooth into the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.229 
decay burrows into the tooth into the
pulp<00:00:54.360> chamber<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.960> kills<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:56.340> quote<00:00:56.789> need

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
pulp chamber and kills it you quote need

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.880 
pulp chamber and kills it you quote need
a<00:00:57.480> root<00:00:57.840> canal<00:00:58.579> which<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> beginning<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
a root canal which is the beginning of

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.310 
a root canal which is the beginning of
heart<00:01:01.890> disease<00:01:02.930> neurological<00:01:03.930> disease

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
heart disease neurological disease

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.210 
heart disease neurological disease
kidney<00:01:04.979> disease<00:01:05.990> cancers<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
kidney disease cancers so on all of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.870 
kidney disease cancers so on all of
these<00:01:08.610> diseases<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.960> didn't<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.439> that

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
these diseases but we didn't know that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
these diseases but we didn't know that
we<00:01:11.880> should<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.270> known<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.320> was

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
we should have known it because it was

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.539 
we should have known it because it was
brought<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.189> first<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.450> onine<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.490> don't

with males dr. rosen off there found
that<00:01:30.240> yeah<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.650> problems

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that yeah there are a lot of problems

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.700 
that yeah there are a lot of problems
with<00:01:32.280> root<00:01:32.520> canals<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.380> if<00:01:34.380> he<00:01:34.560> had<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
with root canals because if he had a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
with root canals because if he had a
person<00:01:35.070> who'd<00:01:35.220> had<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> heart<00:01:35.670> attack<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> can

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
person who'd had a heart attack you can

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.690 
person who'd had a heart attack you can
take<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.049> root<00:01:37.229> canal<00:01:37.560> tooth<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.189> then

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
take out the root canal tooth and then

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
take out the root canal tooth and then
planted<00:01:39.210> under<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> skin<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.200> rabbit<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
planted under the skin of a rabbit and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
planted under the skin of a rabbit and
in<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.640> couple<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.030> weeks<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.780> rabbit<00:01:43.140> dies<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
in a couple of weeks the rabbit dies of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.160 
in a couple of weeks the rabbit dies of
a<00:01:43.680> heart<00:01:43.710> attack<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a heart attack so you take it out and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.590 
a heart attack so you take it out and
put<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.649> another<00:01:46.710> rabbit<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.390> couple

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
put it in another rabbit and in a couple

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.319 
put it in another rabbit and in a couple
of<00:01:48.750> weeks<00:01:48.899> dies<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> heart<00:01:50.040> attack<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.240> you

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
of weeks dies of a heart attack so you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.520 
of weeks dies of a heart attack so you
should<00:01:51.450> take<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.750> out<00:01:51.899> he<00:01:52.380> would

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
should take it out he would

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.679 
should take it out he would
conventionally<00:01:53.159> do<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:53.790> 30<00:01:54.000> rabbits

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
conventionally do this for 30 rabbits

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.260 
conventionally do this for 30 rabbits
and<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:55.470> heart<00:01:55.770> disease<00:01:56.280> he<00:01:56.579> could<00:01:56.759> transfer

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and with heart disease he could transfer

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.240 
and with heart disease he could transfer
heart<00:01:57.600> disease<00:01:58.700> through<00:01:59.700> 30<00:02:00.119> rabbits<00:02:01.040> 100%<00:02:02.040> of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
heart disease through 30 rabbits 100% of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.639 
heart disease through 30 rabbits 100% of
the<00:02:02.369> time<00:02:02.750> there<00:02:03.750> were<00:02:03.869> other<00:02:04.079> diseases

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the time there were other diseases

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.999 
the time there were other diseases
diabetes<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.210> things<00:02:06.329> like<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.829> could

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
diabetes and things like this that could

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.609 
diabetes and things like this that could
be<00:02:08.190> transferred<00:02:08.789> through<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.209> root<00:02:09.569> canal<00:02:09.899> so

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
be transferred through the root canal so

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.550 
be transferred through the root canal so
that<00:02:10.649> information<00:02:11.039> came<00:02:11.700> out<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.319> 1990

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
that information came out in 1990

60<00:03:46.420> million<00:03:46.660> root<00:03:47.019> canals<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.680> year<00:03:48.010> and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
60 million root canals a year and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.069 
60 million root canals a year and
Dentistry<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.650> up<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:51.130> 40<00:03:51.610> million<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:52.239> year<00:03:52.750> now

so<00:03:53.530> they're<00:03:53.950> on<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.370> way<00:03:54.489> up<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:58.600> why<00:03:59.019> are<00:03:59.410> we

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
so they're on the way up so why are we

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.410 
so they're on the way up so why are we
doing<00:03:59.739> so<00:03:59.980> many<00:04:00.130> root<00:04:00.340> canals<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:00.970> think<00:04:01.180> may<00:04:01.360> be

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
doing so many root canals I think may be

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:12.030 
doing so many root canals I think may be
a<00:04:01.540> good<00:04:01.900> term<00:04:02.380> for<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.769> would<00:04:03.010> be<00:04:03.220> quota
