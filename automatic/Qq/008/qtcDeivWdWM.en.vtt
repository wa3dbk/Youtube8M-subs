but<00:01:59.880> he<00:02:00.840> started<00:02:01.140> off<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.409> 68<00:02:01.979> overall<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.759> now

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
but he started off at 68 overall and now

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.050 
but he started off at 68 overall and now
at<00:02:03.659> 26<00:02:04.259> he's<00:02:04.500> also<00:02:04.710> 10<00:02:05.159> years<00:02:05.430> into<00:02:05.700> school

at 26 he's also 10 years into school

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.670 
at 26 he's also 10 years into school
nine<00:02:06.270> years<00:02:06.509> into<00:02:06.719> his<00:02:06.869> career<00:02:07.110> he's<00:02:07.380> only<00:02:07.560> a

nine years into his career he's only a
75<00:02:08.520> overall<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> would<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.390> expect<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.810> lot

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
75 overall I would have expect a lot

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.770 
75 overall I would have expect a lot
better<00:02:10.229> growth

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
better growth

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.240 
better growth
so<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.110> wouldn't<00:02:12.410> really<00:02:12.560> recommend<00:02:12.650> picking

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
so I wouldn't really recommend picking

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.350 
so I wouldn't really recommend picking
up<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:13.580> guy<00:02:13.819> he's<00:02:14.600> too<00:02:14.810> bad<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:16.000> no<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.030> wasn't

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950

that's awesome
I<00:02:32.270> definitely<00:02:32.840> recommend<00:02:33.260> picking<00:02:33.470> him<00:02:33.800> up

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980

was<00:02:37.190> playing<00:02:37.400> for<00:02:37.610> Barcelona<00:02:37.790> B<00:02:38.569> when<00:02:38.870> I

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
was playing for Barcelona B when I

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.040 
was playing for Barcelona B when I
picked<00:02:39.170> him<00:02:39.290> up<00:02:39.440> at<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.700> 67<00:02:40.700> overall<00:02:41.180> 16<00:02:41.840> years

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
picked him up at a 67 overall 16 years

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.860 
picked him up at a 67 overall 16 years
old<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.290> think<00:02:42.350> also<00:02:42.709> 17<00:02:43.310> years<00:02:43.520> old<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.450> he<00:02:44.720> has

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
old I think also 17 years old and he has

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.740 
old I think also 17 years old and he has
grown<00:02:45.110> all<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.650> way<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.890> an<00:02:46.190> 82<00:02:46.730> rate<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.510> fire

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
grown all the way to an 82 rate of fire

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.530 
grown all the way to an 82 rate of fire
which<00:02:47.989> is<00:02:48.019> very<00:02:48.500> very<00:02:48.680> nice<00:02:48.950> he's<00:02:49.910> gone<00:02:50.239> up

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
which is very very nice he's gone up

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.440 
which is very very nice he's gone up
about<00:02:50.840> 15<00:02:51.410> overall<00:02:52.010> if<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.430> am<00:02:52.580> correct<00:02:52.880> my<00:02:53.300> math

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
about 15 overall if I am correct my math

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.720 
about 15 overall if I am correct my math
isn't<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.870> greatest<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.220> picked<00:02:55.430> me<00:02:55.610> off

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
isn't the greatest but I picked me off

City the Portuguese fella now who we did
bring<00:05:34.050> in<00:05:34.229> he<00:05:34.409> started<00:05:34.830> off<00:05:34.979> at<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.400> 65<00:05:36.180> overall

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
bring in he started off at a 65 overall

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.899 
bring in he started off at a 65 overall
and<00:05:37.050> has<00:05:37.440> grown<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.800> an<00:05:37.919> 80<00:05:38.159> overall<00:05:38.610> but<00:05:38.760> there

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
and has grown to an 80 overall but there

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.939 
and has grown to an 80 overall but there
is<00:05:39.030> certainly<00:05:39.510> a<00:05:39.630> lot<00:05:39.780> more<00:05:40.050> potential<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.770> be

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
is certainly a lot more potential to be

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.040 
is certainly a lot more potential to be
had<00:05:41.099> from<00:05:41.280> him<00:05:41.490> we<00:05:41.610> didn't<00:05:41.820> play<00:05:42.030> him<00:05:42.300> every

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
had from him we didn't play him every

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.570 
had from him we didn't play him every
game<00:05:43.260> so<00:05:43.500> I'm<00:05:43.680> sure<00:05:43.889> he<00:05:44.039> could<00:05:44.190> get<00:05:44.370> up<00:05:44.460> to

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
game so I'm sure he could get up to

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.700 
game so I'm sure he could get up to
about<00:05:44.760> an<00:05:44.880> 86<00:05:45.539> rated<00:05:46.260> if<00:05:46.380> he<00:05:46.470> would<00:05:46.590> have

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
about an 86 rated if he would have

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.399 
about an 86 rated if he would have
played<00:05:46.889> every<00:05:47.280> game<00:05:47.310> I<00:05:47.760> think<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:48.930> is<00:05:49.050> how<00:05:49.229> it

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
played every game I think that is how it

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.050 
played every game I think that is how it
is<00:05:49.530> those<00:05:49.889> are<00:05:49.919> just<00:05:50.159> a<00:05:50.310> few<00:05:50.340> players<00:05:50.729> that<00:05:50.880> I

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060
