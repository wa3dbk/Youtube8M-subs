00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.690
 this time we will check a 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.120
 power supply mostly for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.400
 know if the computer does not start because 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.670
 they have problems on the motherboard and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.110
 wants another part of the hardware or 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.870
 because the source has stopped working 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.910
 in fact this source that those in 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.440
 other videos we have seen 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.120
 plugged into the current a very thing 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.190
 important at home you do not need to open it 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.050
 to do this is on the contrary not the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.850
 open leave it closed because because here 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.630
 here inside right now is circulating 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.150
 apart from 220 tickets also here 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.730
 according to good is under are variants here 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.890
 it is still more voltage not with which 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.790
 can give us some joy for the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.790
 body if we do not kill them 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.360
 where we are best still this I think 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 what to do is to do this check with 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.920
 the closed source the new benzene 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.100
 plugging the current to the source it 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.329
 is open is very dangerous good not 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.710
 it varies the first thing we're going to see is 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:12.510
 if the power supply means 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 as we know and understand if it is not 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.440
 connected to a computer that we have 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.940
 here a lot of cable 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.020
 these are the cables that go to the board 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.219
 base 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.219
 yes the normal pc 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.079
 so let's say the pc box the button 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.720
 On the motherboard and the plate 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:35.100
 basis for here specifically to the cable 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.179
 green and the black wire those two crimes 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.189
 we have to identify what they are then 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.780
 over here verbal we have to see here 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.450
 procedural and good for justly 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.970
 front including two rows of 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.010
 connectors one up and one down 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.480
 corresponds to those who have in 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.880
 concrete what will we run here is 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.890
 the green the green this stays here 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.380
 the source turns on you have to provoke 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.180
 a short between the two as here all the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.350
 hungry a click or anything here not 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.350
 it's just 5 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.039
 the fountain 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.120
 and I withdraw for example the short 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.060
 here so they can see at home like 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.730
 until you hear 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.860
 then that's the first thing to be able to 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.860
 try life in the cadista Cable 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.810
 do not stop 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.810
 all right 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.680
 would be multimeter multimeter voltmeter and 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.380
 meter 70 for volts poly meters would be 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.820
 when several things we are going to see this 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.130
 we have to look for a red one and black 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.930
 then we see that it has two terminals 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.550
 that what we are going to use to measure the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.970
 tension and those cables connect here 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.380
 and there is a wheel here we have to look 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.810
 to the one that indicates the volts we see that 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.810
 here is a DC 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.960
 by the electrical network if we are continued 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.030
 we give the one that you put and turns it is going to be a 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.560
 hairline of a few dots to say it is 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.050
 continues in the other for example you see 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.660
 which is with an approximate symbol 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.610
 key with a vitalism a blanket 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.370
 then we go to this one we choose now 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.930
 the voltage range I do not know how we know 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.660
 that the power supply with a maximum 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.570
 12 volt delivery with the top 20 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.280
 the reading is exceeded and perfect for that reason 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.960
 there are not all the clear values ​​that 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.960
 would be going to measure by another for example 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.300
 up to 2 volts up to 20 up to 200 and 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.700
 until that which as we go as much 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:59.300
 2 we plugged in but in some 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.300
 special place 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.010
 we have 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.019
 the common that in the center that is let 's say 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.640
 the indicated would be the mass and now that 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.760
 let's measure voltage here we see that 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.140
 here you can measure voltage in return 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.060
 as long as there are sentences and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.290
 milliamps and on the other that could be 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.700
 measure up day amps that we're going to 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.600
 measure voltage 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.550
 perfect we can that black is the 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.550
 black always go well is very good 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.320
 well let's see now we take the 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.370
 two extremes we also commented 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.370
 to make the source start 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.319
 turned on and now the black we can 

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:44.819
 place in any black polo 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:48.349
 any of the blacks are neutral are 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.349
 let's say they are poles 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.880
 8 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.940
 the orange must measure the vision and 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.610
 reading 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.930
 well I see everything goes and in 2003 three and 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.930
 average 3,534 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.130
 41 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.760
 turn cable 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.430
 we use a black cable with 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.800
 at least for example this 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.970
 and here we can measure the yellow the 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.970
 Yellow must be 12 volts 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:37.400
 exactly the red that is down here 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.169
 fair 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.409
 reside just 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.409
 is liberal 5 at least the red yes colts 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.670
 but it means that in an easy way 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.350
 we have verified that the source works 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.410
 but that really means that it's 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.570
 well you can not really give yourself voltage 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.849
 but not so stable then if the 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.399
 source does not give a stable voltage 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:07.129
 he does not understand anything in any case and that 

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:11.289
 we know it seeing the gray cable 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:14.080
 this gray cable if it is the power wood 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.159
 that is, it only delivers 5 volts if 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.319
 the source considers that it is 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.389
 stabilized well we already know that the 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.499
 source offers the voltages 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.839
 corresponding apparently fine 

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:24.219
 but everything is not yet said because 

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:26.260
 you have to check with samaría that the 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.300
 source is stable 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.490
 actually as I mentioned before 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.900
 sources has sensors that indicate whether 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.010
 can be stabilized and the 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.360
 voltages is delivering with 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.140
 restaurants and is above or by 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.780
 below and when that is correct this 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.380
 cable that is the gray that calls the power 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.510
 wood 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.030
 delivery 5 volts if it does not deliver 5 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.370
 volts this is giving voltages but not 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.410
 regularly effectively better than 5 is 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.200
 giving 6 the voltage delivery source but 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.120
 more accurate is to know if the source 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.280
 is correct if you check this cable 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.120
 that should give 5 volts as checked 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:06.030
 equally the black the black 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.030
 the other pole to gray and really 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:14.590
 5 volts and say that is delivering 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:18.250
 voltage and stably if there was not 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:21.860
 does not work the pce would still not turn on 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.990
 because it's not getting good I think that 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.300
 it's pretty clear again to remember 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.430
 that this has been done with the source 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.140
 open do not do it to start it is 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.480
 necessary we want to open all the 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.010
 sources so they can see the content with 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.540
 which you close your sources are 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.020
 they have open the chuzo in their cable 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:43.130
 current they make their bridge they have already seen 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:45.080
 where they use their multimeter and 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.490
 introduce the pinchitos of the cables 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.020
 opportune that we have indicated and that 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.759
 they will also be seen graphically 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.440
 and this question we have a guarantee that 

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:54.180
 the source works with which if 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.650
 our species does not start 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.770
 we will have to keep looking at what is the 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.770
 problem
