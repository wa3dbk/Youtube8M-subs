00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.969
 with a first semester it's not very very well spent cutting a 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.440
 success is to operate especially on the dual-screen ps less that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.859
 was a real real success on the first semester actually we evolve 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.669
 and we are changing the category of the dual screen with the mv800 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:27.130
 and a screen totally that is 180 degrees 180 degrees 180 degrees 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.960
 very easy and very easy to use but especially the most 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.289
 striking being produced 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.350
 so the mv800 she was stopped a product that actually is very 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.199
 playful with m to a number of applications that can be found at 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.940
 the inside directly integrated into the camera 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 you can easily navigate gardens with the touch screen 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.460
 who walks around easily with just the finger 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.850
 and then the applications of the small people 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.330
 afani buttocks the application of the picture in picture type of applications mnj 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.960
 drags that I'm drunk has sought to develop to really be able to 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.660
 work on his picture make it live and not just do he added and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.039
 then have a picture 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:06.350
 and that's behind you 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.830
 the mv800 will be somewhere else a product that may be important for a 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.890
 support concert 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.409
 the agent by its originality and its innovation 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.520
 but above all it will be supported in terms of communication at the time will be 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.690
 implanted visions 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.460
 in a very offensive way on will alternate semester so that 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.730
 it marks the finesse of the product and then especially see all the aesthetics that 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.369
 I voted 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.299
 and so to make known the product and all the possibilities of 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.110
 happen 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.460
 one on the French market 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.450
 in the second half of the year, with a view to maintaining its share of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.700
 market per cent in volume but especially with this type of product there 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.130
 it is also to make use in europe our usual customers 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.550
 shed to work on products on which we have a quality cage 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.880
 much more important on which are subjected to tests in 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.780
 generating it's strongly% to work in recent months to 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.680
 able to provide precisely a product that is a quality rate 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.330
 and that can allow us to be able to show value share amounts 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.820
 market value
