first<00:05:29.880> put<00:05:30.150> it<00:05:30.300> on<00:05:30.450> but<00:05:30.870> then<00:05:31.110> before<00:05:31.290> I

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
first put it on but then before I

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.190 
first put it on but then before I
started<00:05:32.250> feeling<00:05:32.430> I<00:05:32.669> curled<00:05:32.970> my<00:05:33.030> lashes<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:33.960> it

started feeling I curled my lashes so it

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.340 
started feeling I curled my lashes so it
was<00:05:34.320> amazing<00:05:35.070> this<00:05:35.370> gives<00:05:35.669> great<00:05:36.270> volume<00:05:36.990> and

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
was amazing this gives great volume and

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.260 
was amazing this gives great volume and
length<00:05:37.890> it<00:05:38.190> really<00:05:38.400> reminds<00:05:38.760> me<00:05:38.940> of<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.090> lash

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
length it really reminds me of the lash

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.020 
length it really reminds me of the lash
blast<00:05:39.600> but<00:05:40.050> better<00:05:40.470> better<00:05:41.160> than<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.520> benefit

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
blast but better better than the benefit

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.240 
blast but better better than the benefit
better<00:05:42.330> than<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.690> orange<00:05:43.380> tube<00:05:43.680> lash<00:05:43.919> blast

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
better than the orange tube lash blast

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.780 
better than the orange tube lash blast
gives<00:05:45.000> more<00:05:45.270> volume<00:05:45.720> more<00:05:45.780> length<00:05:46.290> I<00:05:46.770> love<00:05:47.640> it

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
gives more volume more length I love it

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.050 
gives more volume more length I love it
it<00:05:47.970> doesn't<00:05:48.540> flake<00:05:48.960> on<00:05:49.260> me<00:05:49.490> it's<00:05:50.490> really<00:05:50.729> black

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
it doesn't flake on me it's really black

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.880 
it doesn't flake on me it's really black
I<00:05:51.240> think<00:05:51.300> it<00:05:51.510> only<00:05:51.630> comes<00:05:51.930> in<00:05:52.169> three<00:05:52.470> shades

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890

I think it only comes in three shades
and<00:05:53.280> I<00:05:53.370> didn't<00:05:53.850> see<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.030> waterproof<00:05:54.720> but<00:05:54.960> I
