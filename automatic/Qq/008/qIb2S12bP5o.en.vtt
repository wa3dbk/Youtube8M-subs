00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.010 
starts turning those wrapped up credits
into<00:02:25.990> extra<00:02:26.990> lives<00:02:27.260> which<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.340> very<00:02:28.610> helpful

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
into extra lives which is very helpful

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.690 
into extra lives which is very helpful
when<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.140> pick<00:02:30.350> up<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.620> weapon<00:02:30.830> you'll<00:02:31.280> hold<00:02:31.490> on

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
when you pick up a weapon you'll hold on

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.330 
when you pick up a weapon you'll hold on
to<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.060> weapon<00:02:32.540> until<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.410> run<00:02:34.130> out<00:02:34.190> of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
to that weapon until you run out of

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.699 
to that weapon until you run out of
lives<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.209> have<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.660> put<00:02:35.810> in<00:02:35.930> another<00:02:36.170> credit

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
lives and have to put in another credit

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.979 
lives and have to put in another credit
so<00:02:36.890> if<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.100> have<00:02:37.190> ninety<00:02:37.670> nine<00:02:37.850> lives<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.810> get

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
so if you have ninety nine lives you get

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.770 
so if you have ninety nine lives you get
to<00:02:39.110> hold<00:02:39.290> on<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.310> flamethrower<00:02:41.120> or

accidentally walking into enemies most
of<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:08.930> time<00:04:09.109> and<00:04:09.350> that's<00:04:10.010> no<00:04:10.370> good<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:10.940> boss

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
of the time and that's no good the boss

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.920

four<00:04:14.930> boss<00:04:15.230> fights<00:04:15.620> I<00:04:15.769> believe<00:04:16.010> there<00:04:16.220> may<00:04:16.340> be

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370

four boss fights I believe there may be
more<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:17.030> think<00:04:17.269> there's<00:04:17.840> there<00:04:18.229> may<00:04:18.380> be

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
more I think there's there may be

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.529 
more I think there's there may be
multiple<00:04:18.769> paths<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:19.789> looks<00:04:20.000> like<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.150> game<00:04:20.390> they

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539

multiple paths it looks like a game they
might<00:04:20.690> have<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.870> few

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
might have a few

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.320 
might have a few
