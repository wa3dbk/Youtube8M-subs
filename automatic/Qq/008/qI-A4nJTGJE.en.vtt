00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.650
 and now all robert and welcome to 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.170
 first white gameplay we are all from 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.820
 my channel so excited I'm for god 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.800
 we already have blackout the zombies all or 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.020
 most already we have already left and 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.160
 well I'm already very excited the truth and 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.989
 well before I start I want to say is 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.090
 a couple of things this game sent us 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:31.129
 This is my first game but it's not in 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.660
 I live the reason is that it was recorded at 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:34.820
 3 in the morning 1 in the morning then 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.590
 I did not have that time I could not tell them and 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.550
 I would comment would be whispering and not that 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.739
 they earn their reals 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.750
 then I preferred to record and comment to the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.370
 part and good where to start I wanted 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.200
 also tell them that this game in a 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.720
 first game is going to explain to you 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.910
 what is not my first game my first 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.320
 game before I start I want to tell you 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.180
 that I'm playing a pc so that 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.890
 understand everyone I'm playing on pc 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.180
 white all for the moment that right now 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.340
 let's also to this are several things 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.110
 I wanted to tell you I'm playing a pc 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.329
 and with good as you can see it comes out 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.309
 keep x and all that that of the xbox with 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.810
 those buttons is because I'm playing with 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.090
 an xbox control that I bought for 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.979
 play black to all the problem is this 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.130
 that when I buy it like everything else 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.409
 new sensitivity well done well to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.579
 the minimum well in accessibility and this 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.650
 game was not the exception came what 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.590
 minimum all 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.090
 you said sensitivity or vision of 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.710
 mouse then I look if the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.690
 sensitivity of the green the mouse is the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.910
 same as the control and I put it the maximum 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.720
 same I felt very stiff for and what is 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.570
 What there is 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.550
 Bulgarians and then comes to round 5 leave 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.930
 dark read if I was killed entering a 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.550
 Fail well fail to later 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.990
 I put that video at the end of this are the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.020
 I put it so that they see it and they laugh a while 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.790
 of me and well then I said already said that 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.350
 click because I keep feeling 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.000
 I assumed payments of I went to where I said that 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.010
 imparted and was the sensitivity that 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.050
 had to climb an idiot and then do not 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.880
 I put that game is if it was my first 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.369
 heading off already well with good sensitivity and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.619
 with control then I hope that the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.790
 enjoy is I think a little bit 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.410
 then he will put them in fast camera 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.180
 but before I shut up because I do not have 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.420
 I want to tell you so much just 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.790
 I want to play now and well I want to tell you 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.350
 that light is the console because I have your 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.729
 for PC and not for console 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.690
 you are remember remember me 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.430
 I had said that I wanted to get the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.260
 cause before because he calls them and sends a 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.380
 mail and all that because if it was like that and I 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.910
 It arrived before I arrived but I stupid 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.200
 they had sent me a bill they had 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.170
 put an internet bill that I 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.520
 I had to raise the pain just 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.140
 will send an email 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.660
 idiot and I forgot to never upload the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.310
 invoice then I got here the game 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.950
 and I could not take it back then 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.870
 I went up tomorrow morning, referred tomorrow 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.610
 Wednesday or Thursday I'll have them 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.750
 already going to have blackout for console and 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.730
 I 'm going to make the comments live 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.530
 at this time I comment live 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.900
 no gameplay because sometimes I have the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.520
 fifth I do not like that in fact in these 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.410
 game is recorded at night has nothing 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.380
 which I do not know why good then 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.330
 right now, right now, just have 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.280
 in console and play your videos with other 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.470
 people and this is going to be very sexy already 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.180
 this game I love this game is 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.520
 different is not not exactly what 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.680
 I thought the same is very sexy but it is very 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.690
 different than what I thought is much more 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.690
 difficult than what the original zombies 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.120
 why because one has a special weapon and 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.590
 neither is flop then flow but 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.210
 we were not served a lot for when 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.770
 we are stuck of some some 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.840
 corner or something to be able to shoot and get out of 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.850
 there but without flop you are a pain of ball 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.530
 leave some corner and without arms 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.420
 specials even more ball pain get 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.800
 to a high round in fact right now 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.810
 first reach the high round in a 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.850
 map they will see it if I achieve it more 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.200
 go ahead and see it is quite accurate 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.980
 again I liked quite change the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.629
 thematic 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.190
 way of playing are vicious and changed it 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.709
 enough but he changed it for well I think 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.060
 I already want to leave the site 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.830
 several things I have never played in 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.349
 zombies and this robot that is doing 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.090
 this standard level to good I have not played 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.680
 never zombies because for pc I do not have it 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.420
 and he's not going to buy me strangely 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.489
 I know why but I barely have enough 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.959
 console my first game and that yes what 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.970
 I want to play I'm really excited for 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.690
 play it good I'm well excited for 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.730
 play black to all the truth 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.170
 multiplayer is something different very 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.459
 different than what I expected but it is 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.500
 well that they make a change the truth already 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.360
 who has been doing the same thing all the time 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.250
 I have to get used to everything understood 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.170
 very well to how it works besides I played 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.730
 Around 4 in the morning I was really tired 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.650
 I have to get used to seeing how 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.390
 that works how multiplayer works and 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.489
 all that but this game is very sexy 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.620
 I have to have good grip on the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.970
 just touch that you have it for console and 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.789
 well I think it would be all my name 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.930
 roberto see you in depth or goodbye 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.130
 by the way he forgets about following that 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.050
 just have white you all for 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.789
 vice console and I'm going to record my first 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.560
 departure in transit live and it will not 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.699
 be like I'm good now I say goodbye 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.699
 until the next goodbye 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:48.400
 no weddings without memories without problems
