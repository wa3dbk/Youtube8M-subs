let<00:01:05.970> me<00:01:06.180> show<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.510> looks<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:07.340> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
let me show you what that looks like you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.010 
let me show you what that looks like you
see<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.790> looks<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.299> more<00:01:09.510> traditional

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
see this looks like more traditional

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.679 
see this looks like more traditional
Windows<00:01:10.290> XP<00:01:10.590> or<00:01:10.770> Windows<00:01:11.310> Vista<00:01:11.510> but<00:01:12.510> then

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
Windows XP or Windows Vista but then

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.140 
Windows XP or Windows Vista but then
when<00:01:13.320> let's<00:01:13.979> say<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.280> open<00:01:14.400> two<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:14.880> three<00:01:15.030> more

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
when let's say we open two or three more

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
when let's say we open two or three more
windows<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> combine<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:17.130> items

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
windows it's going to combine like items

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.770 
windows it's going to combine like items
so<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:19.770> open<00:01:20.009> up<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.310> two<00:01:20.850> three<00:01:23.780> let's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so if I see open up one two three let's

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.249 
so if I see open up one two three let's
open<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.439> more<00:01:29.659> we'll<00:01:30.659> start<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.990> see<00:01:31.020> it

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
open up one more we'll start to see it

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.120 
open up one more we'll start to see it
combining<00:01:31.770> them<00:01:37.280> alternatively<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.600> can

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
combining them alternatively you can

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.210 
combining them alternatively you can
never<00:01:41.130> combine<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:43.159> always<00:01:44.159> combine<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:47.070> when

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
never combine or always combine and when

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.340 
never combine or always combine and when
you<00:01:47.280> hit<00:01:47.399> always<00:01:47.640> combine<00:01:48.030> you'll<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.479> all<00:01:49.049> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you hit always combine you'll see all of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.780 
you hit always combine you'll see all of
my<00:01:49.439> word<00:01:49.590> documents<00:01:50.040> will<00:01:50.159> be<00:01:50.189> grouped<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.640> we

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
my word documents will be grouped and we

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.380 
my word documents will be grouped and we
can<00:01:50.970> close<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> windows<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:52.020> once<00:01:52.259> I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
can close all the windows at once I

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.550 
can close all the windows at once I
prefer<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.630> leave<00:01:54.750> my<00:01:54.899> never<00:01:55.140> combined

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
prefer to leave my never combined

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.889 
prefer to leave my never combined
because<00:01:55.799> they<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.130> easily<00:01:56.689> jump<00:01:57.689> through

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
because they like to easily jump through

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.240
