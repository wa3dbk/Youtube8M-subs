my left hand look at the angle just

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.410 
my left hand look at the angle just
right<00:00:13.070> okay<00:00:14.070> see<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.429> ridging<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.000> my<00:00:15.120> hand

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
right okay see that ridging on my hand

right okay see that ridging on my hand
that<00:00:15.960> skin<00:00:16.500> that's<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:16.920> very<00:00:17.160> elastic<00:00:19.670> that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that skin that's not very elastic that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.060 
that skin that's not very elastic that
bulge<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.210> when<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> bring<00:00:22.199> my<00:00:22.320> fingers<00:00:22.710> up<00:00:22.890> as

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
bulge is when I bring my fingers up as

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.390 
bulge is when I bring my fingers up as
close<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.609> can<00:00:24.800> now<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.859> want<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.130> show<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.460> my

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
close as I can now I want to show you my

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.170 
close as I can now I want to show you my
right<00:00:29.400> head<00:00:29.689> like<00:00:30.689> get<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> picture

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
right head like get it in to the picture

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:43.350 
right head like get it in to the picture
in<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.829> right<00:00:34.829> way

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:52.310 

it's<00:00:44.360> difficult

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:05.770 

and<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> now

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.790 

ah

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
ah

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.970 
ah
ok

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
ok

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.360 
ok
no<00:01:10.580> ridges<00:01:11.890> okay<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:14.330> reason<00:01:14.540> is<00:01:15.370> is

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
no ridges okay and the reason is is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.710 
no ridges okay and the reason is is
because<00:01:18.370> I've<00:01:19.370> been<00:01:19.430> tippling<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.540> right

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
because I've been tippling to the right

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.660 
because I've been tippling to the right
hand<00:01:21.080> into<00:01:21.950> some<00:01:22.160> algae<00:01:22.580> water<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:26.650> it's

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
hand into some algae water and it's

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.520 
hand into some algae water and it's
increased<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.940> amount<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.390> elasticity<00:01:30.050> in<00:01:30.380> my

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
increased the amount of elasticity in my

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.440 
increased the amount of elasticity in my
hand<00:01:30.830> I've<00:01:31.430> been<00:01:31.550> doing<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:31.880> about<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.150> month

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
hand I've been doing this about a month

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.650 
hand I've been doing this about a month
but<00:01:33.080> last<00:01:33.320> week<00:01:33.650> I<00:01:33.830> noticed<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.430> because<00:01:35.360> I

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
but last week I noticed it because I

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.790 
but last week I noticed it because I
noticed<00:01:35.960> my<00:01:36.020> hands<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.810> think<00:01:39.620> it's

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
noticed my hands and the I think it's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.690 
noticed my hands and the I think it's
because<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.340> algae<00:01:40.790> which<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.240> microscopic

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
because the algae which is microscopic

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.810 
because the algae which is microscopic
when<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.820> put<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.120> on<00:01:44.210> your<00:01:44.360> hand<00:01:47.380> the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
when you put it on your hand the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.450 
when you put it on your hand the
proteins<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.540> mitochondria<00:01:51.410> and<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.920> DNA

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
proteins and mitochondria and the DNA

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.880 
proteins and mitochondria and the DNA
that's<00:01:52.730> there<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:55.280> cells<00:01:55.940> take<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.450> and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
that's there the cells take it and

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.340 
that's there the cells take it and
deconstruct<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.960> build<00:01:59.960> new<00:02:00.080> cells

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
deconstruct it and build new cells

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.690 
deconstruct it and build new cells
anyway<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:03.380> thought<00:02:03.770> you'd<00:02:03.980> like<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.310> see<00:02:04.490> this

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
anyway I thought you'd like to see this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.260 
anyway I thought you'd like to see this
if<00:02:05.300> you<00:02:06.020> have<00:02:06.170> any<00:02:06.350> questions<00:02:06.890> about<00:02:07.010> it<00:02:07.220> or<00:02:07.490> if

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
if you have any questions about it or if

if you have any questions about it or if
you<00:02:08.390> know<00:02:08.540> anything<00:02:08.899> about<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.320> anybody

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
you know anything about this anybody

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.030 
you know anything about this anybody
that's<00:02:10.160> been<00:02:10.310> doing<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.330> for<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.630> while<00:02:12.040> let

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that's been doing this for a while let

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.750 
that's been doing this for a while let
