know<00:01:32.100> got<00:01:32.369> my<00:01:32.490> streak<00:01:32.759> over<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> over<00:01:33.240> again

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
know got my streak over and over again

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.289 
know got my streak over and over again
to<00:01:34.290> continually<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.400> basically<00:01:35.970> once

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
to continually you know basically once

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.460 
to continually you know basically once
you<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.509> set<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.869> streets<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.229> pretty

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you get one set of streets it's pretty

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.380 
you get one set of streets it's pretty
easy<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.770> keep<00:01:38.610> those<00:01:38.790> streaks<00:01:39.060> rolling

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
easy to keep those streaks rolling

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.429 
easy to keep those streaks rolling
because<00:01:39.479> those<00:01:39.689> streets<00:01:39.990> let<00:01:40.170> me<00:01:40.259> get<00:01:40.350> your

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
because those streets let me get your

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
because those streets let me get your
next<00:01:40.650> streaks<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> need<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.390> as

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
next streaks and all you need to get as

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.780 
next streaks and all you need to get as
a<00:01:42.540> few<00:01:42.780> kills<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> great<00:01:44.460> gameplay

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
a few kills so it is a great gameplay

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
a few kills so it is a great gameplay
but<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> didn't<00:01:45.570> want<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.780> talk<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.110> bit

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
but I didn't want to talk a little bit

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.929 
but I didn't want to talk a little bit
about<00:01:46.409> nuclear's<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.220> stuff<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
about nuclear's and stuff like that and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.760 
about nuclear's and stuff like that and
what<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.649> next

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
what I think is going to be in the next

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.240 
what I think is going to be in the next
call<00:01:49.979> duty<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:51.380> black<00:01:52.380> ops<00:01:52.590> 2<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.890> like

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
call duty because in black ops 2 I like

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.160 
call duty because in black ops 2 I like
to<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.880> nuclear<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.390> equivalent

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
to think that the nuclear is equivalent

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.380 
to think that the nuclear is equivalent
to<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.350> kem<00:01:55.619> strike<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.130> ammo<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.820> new<00:01:57.030> come<00:01:57.299> on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
to a kem strike or ammo or a new come on

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.350 
to a kem strike or ammo or a new come on
over<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:57.869> anything<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:59.360> it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
over to or anything like that but it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.149 
over to or anything like that but it
kind<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.659> sucks<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.740> can't<00:02:02.009> do

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
kind of sucks because you can't do

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.380 
kind of sucks because you can't do
anything<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.090> yeah

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
anything with it you know it's like yeah

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.999 
anything with it you know it's like yeah
the<00:02:03.600> nuclear<00:02:03.930> popped<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.409> screen<00:02:04.740> like

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
the nuclear popped up on my screen like

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.800 
the nuclear popped up on my screen like
yay<00:02:05.250> awesome<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> don't<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.509> can't

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
yay awesome like you don't you can't

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.270 
yay awesome like you don't you can't
call<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.350> doesn't<00:02:07.680> kill<00:02:07.860> anyone<00:02:07.890> doesn't

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
call it in doesn't kill anyone doesn't

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.760 
call it in doesn't kill anyone doesn't
do<00:02:08.580> anything<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.509> basically<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.140> waste<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.649> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
do anything it's basically a waste of a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.770 
do anything it's basically a waste of a
thing<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.849> know<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> don't<00:02:12.090> want<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.390> nuclear

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
thing so you know I don't want a nuclear

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.640 
thing so you know I don't want a nuclear
doesn't<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.379> any

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
doesn't do any

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.229 
doesn't do any
thing<00:02:13.829> and<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.760> hope<00:02:14.970> that

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
thing and I really hope that

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.059 
thing and I really hope that
sledgehammer<00:02:15.930> put<00:02:16.409> something<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.739> game<00:02:16.920> that

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
sledgehammer put something the game that

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.979 
sledgehammer put something the game that
does<00:02:17.340> something<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.819> hope<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.810> not

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
does something I hope that it's not

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.410 
does something I hope that it's not
necessarily<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> killstreak<00:02:20.430> ender<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.269> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
necessarily a killstreak ender like the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.640 
necessarily a killstreak ender like the
new<00:02:21.569> coolest<00:02:21.870> or<00:02:22.019> not<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.200> kills<00:02:22.349> forget<00:02:22.560> about

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
new coolest or not it kills forget about

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.179 
new coolest or not it kills forget about
a<00:02:22.769> game<00:02:22.980> ender<00:02:23.250> like<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.549> nuke<00:02:23.700> was<00:02:24.140> or<00:02:25.189> you

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
a game ender like the nuke was or you

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.970 
a game ender like the nuke was or you
know<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.340> map<00:02:27.120> destroying<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.769> kem

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
know just map destroying like the kem

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.619 
know just map destroying like the kem
strike<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.400> i<00:02:29.519> really<00:02:29.760> think<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.060> moab<00:02:30.450> they

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
strike is i really think the moab they

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.899 
strike is i really think the moab they
got<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.900> exactly<00:02:31.079> right<00:02:31.439> it<00:02:31.650> was<00:02:32.010> 25<00:02:32.340> kills<00:02:32.760> it

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
got it exactly right it was 25 kills it

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.429 
got it exactly right it was 25 kills it
wasn't<00:02:33.209> too<00:02:33.359> difficult<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.810> get<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.349> it

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
wasn't too difficult to get but it

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.710 
wasn't too difficult to get but it
wasn't<00:02:34.560> easy<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:35.040> get<00:02:35.189> and<00:02:35.450> basically<00:02:36.450> just

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
wasn't easy to get and basically just

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.449 
wasn't easy to get and basically just
killed<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.109> entire<00:02:37.170> enemy<00:02:37.560> team<00:02:37.739> map<00:02:38.220> was

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
killed the entire enemy team map was

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.729 
killed the entire enemy team map was
completely<00:02:38.879> playable<00:02:39.180> afterwards<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
completely playable afterwards and

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.559 
completely playable afterwards and
everything<00:02:41.250> was<00:02:41.489> everything<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.299> brightened

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
everything was everything was brightened

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.750 
everything was everything was brightened
Danny<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.079> hopefully<00:02:43.519> sledgehammer<00:02:44.519> does

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
Danny so I hopefully sledgehammer does

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.879

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
nuke a nuclear you can't do anything

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.330 
nuke a nuclear you can't do anything
with<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.500> i'm<00:02:55.709> going<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.889> take<00:02:56.069> something

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
with it i'm going to take something

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.670 
with it i'm going to take something
because<00:02:56.639> somethings<00:02:57.060> better<00:02:57.209> than<00:02:57.359> nothing

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
because somethings better than nothing

because somethings better than nothing
of<00:02:58.680> course<00:02:59.069> because<00:02:59.310> i<00:02:59.400> just<00:02:59.579> don't<00:02:59.730> want<00:02:59.849> to
