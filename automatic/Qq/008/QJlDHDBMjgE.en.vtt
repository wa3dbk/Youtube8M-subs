and now you might want to do a little
bit<00:00:42.250> right<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.780> you<00:00:43.840> take<00:00:44.170> this<00:00:44.320> Greenpeace<00:00:44.770> me

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
bit right so you take this Greenpeace me

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.150 
bit right so you take this Greenpeace me
flip<00:00:46.120> it<00:00:46.240> into<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.840> should<00:00:47.830> have<00:00:47.950> something

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
flip it into it should have something

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.860 
flip it into it should have something
like<00:00:48.310> this<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:51.880> I'm<00:00:52.120> talking<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:52.780> you

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
tap those two problems in and now you

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.440 
tap those two problems in and now you
should<00:00:56.739> have<00:00:56.770> something<00:00:57.070> that<00:00:57.760> Connor<00:00:58.090> looks

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.190 

but<00:01:43.840> we<00:01:44.020> offer

but we offer

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.050 
but we offer
ah

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
ah

00:01:47.060 --> 00:02:06.550 
ah
ah

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.230 

speak<00:02:07.430> English

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.199 

and<00:02:14.240> now<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:15.260> should<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:16.730> should<00:02:16.790> have

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
and now it should it should have

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.970 
and now it should it should have
resistor<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.620> will<00:02:19.040> resist<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.819> little<00:02:20.150> bit

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
resistor it it will resist a little bit

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.839 
resistor it it will resist a little bit
once<00:02:21.980> you're<00:02:22.099> done<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.459> should<00:02:22.489> have

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
once you're done you should have

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.970 
once you're done you should have
something<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.450> looks<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:23.930> this<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.830> may

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
something that looks like this you may

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.490 
something that looks like this you may
be<00:02:25.040> wondering<00:02:25.130> Noah<00:02:26.120> why<00:02:26.840> does<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.200> look<00:02:27.230> like

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
be wondering Noah why does it look like

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.809 
be wondering Noah why does it look like
its<00:02:27.739> circle<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:28.700> not<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:28.850> star<00:02:29.290> well<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:31.100> I'm

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
its circle and not a star well that I'm

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:39.720 
its circle and not a star well that I'm
going<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.270> explain<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:32.959> actually<00:02:33.890> slides

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:48.340 

will<00:02:40.730> keep<00:02:40.910> sliding<00:02:42.430> slide

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.370 

it<00:02:48.860> mines<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.460> little<00:02:49.760> tight<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.660> might<00:02:51.170> be<00:02:51.350> a

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
it mines a little tight so it might be a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.520 
it mines a little tight so it might be a
little<00:02:51.650> bit<00:02:51.860> hard<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.490> transform<00:02:53.270> for<00:02:53.810> me<00:02:53.960> but

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
little bit hard to transform for me but

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.309 
little bit hard to transform for me but
your<00:02:54.710> should<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.280> easier

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.880 

then<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.760> should<00:03:00.230> something<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.709> looks

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
then you should something that looks

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.830 
then you should something that looks
like<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:03.090> out<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.450> stock<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.629> my

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
like this and out to stock and that my

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.170 
like this and out to stock and that my
friends<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.290> how<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.530> make<00:03:07.889> another<00:03:08.310> make<00:03:08.430> an

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
friends is how you make another make an

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.089 
friends is how you make another make an
origami<00:03:09.560> Sun<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.769> Moon<00:03:11.659> and<00:03:12.659> now<00:03:12.900> if<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.829> want

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
origami Sun and Moon and now if you want

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.270 
origami Sun and Moon and now if you want
to<00:03:14.870> change<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:15.989> back<00:03:16.139> I'm<00:03:16.560> just<00:03:16.709> just<00:03:16.980> pulling

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
to change it back I'm just just pulling

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.809 
to change it back I'm just just pulling
it<00:03:17.430> into<00:03:17.639> a<00:03:17.879> son<00:03:18.150> orange<00:03:18.900> will<00:03:19.109> move
