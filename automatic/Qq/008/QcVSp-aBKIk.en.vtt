What sup Guys,

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.721
Today I want show a comparison review of the
all new Canon EOS M3 with last years Sony

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:11.070
a6000. Both camera's target the professional
amateurs with quick and easy to use hardware

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.120
and software, and they almost look exactly
the same.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.290
Like I said, last year I reviewed the Sony
a6000 and gave it my pro's and con's. You

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.010
can check out that video in the description
below. Also, I'll be doing a lot more video's

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.269
like this on my channel so subscribe if you
don't want to miss that.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.080
Enough talking, let's compare the M3 with
the a6000.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.710
So this is the all new Canon EOS M3. Only
available in Europe and Japan, so not in the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.740
US. You can buy the EOS from 750 euro's and
the a6000 from 650 euro's.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.860
When you put both camera's next to each other
you can see that they are almost the same.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.880
The canon has a white design and the sony
is black. But both camera's are available

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.880
in both black or white.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.970
The dimensions of the body are also pretty
much the same. The sony is just a little bit

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.300
wider but the canon is a little bit thicker.
Once you hold them both in your hands, you'll

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.080
notice that the canon is a lot heavier. It
weighs around 100 grams heavier than the a6000.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.040
That's with the lens included.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.480
Talking about the lens we find the first big
difference. Both lenses have the same specs.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.130
They are 18-55 mm focal length with aperture
3.5 to 6.5. The difference is that the sony

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.640
camera has a motorised zoom handle on the
barrel of the lens and the Canon has a manual

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.640
zoom.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.350
One thing they both do very well is taking
beautiful 24 megapixels photo's. But if you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.470
don't know the best feature of the a6000 yet,
well,...Check this out....

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.990
That is the Continues Auto Focus mode taking
11 photo's per second. Now let's compare that

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.700
with the M3.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.870
Yeah.. that's only 4.2 foto's per second...
Big win here for Sony.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.050
But of course you also need to be able to
take pictures in low light. So a high ISO

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.580
can be useful. Both camera's go up to 25600
and show basically the same result.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.989
To review your compositions you can use the
OLED TruFinder on the a6000. It comes with

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.510
an eyecap for more comfort. The canon doesn't
have a on board view finder. Instead it has

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.700
a 12% bigger LCD display. If you do want a
view finder you can buy that separately for

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.770
another 240 euro's. That's insane. But on
the upside, you can use the viewfinder from

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.520
different angels.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.800
Taking really sharp photo's also requires
the software to find focus points so you don't

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.680
end up with objects out of focus. The a6000
has 179 focus point and uses continues autofocus.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.470
This is specifically great while recording
video. The M3 only has 49 focus points.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.520
Another downside to the M3 is the batterylife.
The M3 can take 250 photo's on a single charge

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.170
where the a6000 can get you 420 photo's. The
battery compartments are almost the same but

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.800
the M3 is way harder to open. Inside you'll
find the small battery and the SD card slot.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.560
Now let's give the canon some more upsides.
An upside compared to the a6000 is the ability

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.670
to use an external microphone. This isn't
possible on the a6000 and is a big downside.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.700
Also the M3 not only has a bigger LCD display,
it's also touchscreen.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.850
The interface is a lot easier to use and looks
more consumer friendly.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.210
But more importantly, the LCD display can
be tilted to 180 degrees where the a6000 only

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.080
goes to 90 degrees. That means you have a
great selfie camera with the M3.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.410
So overall the a6000 seems to win on price,
speed, and battery life. But the Canon has

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.681
a better LCD display with selfie mode and
is able to connect with an external mic. One

00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:51.210
big downside to the M3 is the lack of an onboard
viewfinder. One big plus side to the a6000

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.390
is that it shoots 11 frames per second.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.910
So with the a6000 you'll take perfect photo's
in for example sport. And with the M3 is more

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.230
user friendly and has a nicer LCD display
with touchscreen and selfie mode.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.860
That was my comparison. I hope you liked it.
If you did please give a thumbs up.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.989
Make sure to subscribe for more reviews and
quality test video's. I post new video's every

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.750
Sunday and i'll see you guys in the next one!

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.299
Peace!
