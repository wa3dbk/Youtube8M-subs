00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.270
 hi pesya i will say about daffodils 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.150
 how this cost them this spring and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.870
 the thing is, you know, what about 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.500
 daffodils sometimes such a fuss they need 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.210
 wait wait for dry 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.680
 leaves after flowering and then they 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.320
 I'm lost for example here 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.330
 water watchdog sweat marigold well or 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.890
 I'll sow 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.050
 that sick so they closed the attacks 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.380
 drying up daffodils and then somehow here 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.719
 I don’t know them . 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.420
 you will not find me here got out as if for 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.660
 limit flower garden and what I did here they 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.440
 I got out in the spring here see here 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.239
 in general , all 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 before the fat faded daffodils in my 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.309
 the first of the northern country ended up here 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.579
 happens at this time of year at now mark 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.930
 today what price is march 21 so here they are 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.010
 I was besides getting out later 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.750
 they plunged me back 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.539
 too and I decided them somehow you still 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.880
 transplanted what i was doing i was looking for them 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.770
 empty dug here was very deep and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.869
 get out just know dug 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.510
 bulbous plant can be digging 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.520
 principle, any time transplanted is simply not 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.320
 very much I saved in the bulb 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.920
 I decided to look like this here 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 landed here is a container than but 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 I don’t freeze out here in winter so 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.659
 it is possible of course where is colder 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.820
 winter can not be left in the container and 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.430
 and well there is another container in general 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.960
 In short, the artist can 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.110
 sit down any time here they are with you 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.100
 got out in the spring and most convenient of them here 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.659
 to seat 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.960
 yulechka waited 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.909
 if you want to at all I touch them a little 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.770
 honestly i just like them were 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.469
 they ate even the world did not share the onions 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.479
 besides why I still decided them 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.189
 transplanted because they left me very 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.299
 deep as I said underground where 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:07.259
 then centimeters 20 25 and therefore how would 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.289
 already bloomed too late and here 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.720
 it gets hot fast now they 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.819
 only fade and become hot here 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.769
 so I took up this and that is 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.299
 what i want to tell you in all there 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.849
 different such circumstance 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.459
 but I want to say that often daffodils 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.989
 get lost and experience them 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.230
 transplant even gum 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:32.090
 that's about it you came out the video visited 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.090
 all the best for now
