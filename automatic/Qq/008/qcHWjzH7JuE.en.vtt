sometimes they're a little bit hard to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.979 
sometimes they're a little bit hard to
work<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.239> because<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.570> have<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.810> watch

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:31.369 
together a little bit because I've had

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:33.609 
together a little bit because I've had
this<00:05:31.519> in<00:05:31.669> the<00:05:31.699> refrigerator<00:05:31.849> today<00:05:32.559> for<00:05:33.559> a

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:33.619 
this in the refrigerator today for a

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:38.850 
this in the refrigerator today for a
couple<00:05:33.860> hours<00:05:33.999> the<00:05:34.999> oil<00:05:35.209> will<00:05:35.509> get<00:05:36.229> it<00:05:36.349> unstuck

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.579 

and<00:05:39.860> if<00:05:39.979> you<00:05:40.129> want<00:05:40.369> it<00:05:40.519> to<00:05:40.729> before<00:05:41.629> you<00:05:41.779> cook

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
and if you want it to before you cook

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.129 
and if you want it to before you cook
this<00:05:42.830> to<00:05:43.729> break<00:05:43.999> it<00:05:44.149> up<00:05:44.269> into<00:05:44.479> smaller<00:05:44.839> pieces

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
this to break it up into smaller pieces

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.959 
this to break it up into smaller pieces
you<00:05:45.559> could<00:05:45.709> certainly<00:05:45.889> do<00:05:46.159> that<00:05:46.189> so<00:05:46.699> it<00:05:46.789> makes

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
you could certainly do that so it makes

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:55.989 
you could certainly do that so it makes
it<00:05:47.119> easier<00:05:47.479> to<00:05:47.509> serve<00:05:47.899> or<00:05:48.610> eat<00:05:54.399> and<00:05:55.399> the<00:05:55.610> dish<00:05:55.819> I

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:55.999 
it easier to serve or eat and the dish I

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:00.149 
it easier to serve or eat and the dish I
made<00:05:56.029> before<00:05:56.330> I<00:05:56.689> did<00:05:57.139> cut<00:05:57.409> some<00:05:57.649> of<00:05:57.769> this<00:05:57.800> up
