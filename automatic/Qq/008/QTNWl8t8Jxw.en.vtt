out of the way before my senior season
just<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.509> less<00:01:15.689> thing<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.900> I'd<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
just one less thing that I'd have to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.289 
just one less thing that I'd have to

it I think that's what's actually the
best<00:01:20.759> part<00:01:21.030> about<00:01:21.090> our<00:01:21.330> offense<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.930> could

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
best part about our offense we could

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.359

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
throw the ball we can run the ball we

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.649

could<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> lot<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> different<00:01:23.909> things<00:01:24.180> we

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
could do a lot of different things we

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240
