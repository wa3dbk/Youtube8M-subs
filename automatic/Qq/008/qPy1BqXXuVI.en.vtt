00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
working together not just having one

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.590 
working together not just having one
person<00:02:44.790> doing<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:46.050> or<00:02:47.060> experiencer<00:02:48.060> kinda

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
person doing it or experiencer kinda

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.080 
person doing it or experiencer kinda
makes<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.170> lot<00:02:49.500> harder<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.100> longer<00:02:50.400> winded

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
but i don't know if it in the end we

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.440 
but i don't know if it in the end we
might

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
