holes<00:05:54.550> kind<00:05:54.849> of<00:05:54.969> digging<00:05:55.300> in<00:05:55.449> a<00:05:55.479> little<00:05:55.599> bit

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
holes kind of digging in a little bit

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.990 
holes kind of digging in a little bit
already<00:05:56.229> they're<00:05:56.949> a<00:05:56.979> little<00:05:57.279> far<00:05:57.639> forward<00:05:58.210> and

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
already they're a little far forward and

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.649 
already they're a little far forward and
they're<00:06:01.000> there

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
they're there

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.369 
they're there
there's<00:06:02.169> very<00:06:03.389> skinny<00:06:04.389> and<00:06:05.080> for<00:06:05.229> whatever

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
there's very skinny and for whatever

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.230 
there's very skinny and for whatever
reason<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:05.860> padding<00:06:06.250> just<00:06:06.699> kind<00:06:06.939> of<00:06:06.969> sits

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
reason the padding just kind of sits

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.170 
reason the padding just kind of sits
weird<00:06:07.479> on<00:06:07.659> my<00:06:07.779> head<00:06:08.099> the<00:06:09.099> biggest<00:06:09.639> thing<00:06:09.879> and

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
weird on my head the biggest thing and

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.969 
weird on my head the biggest thing and
the<00:06:10.599> reason<00:06:10.930> that<00:06:10.960> I<00:06:11.110> didn't<00:06:11.500> choose<00:06:11.710> this

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
the reason that I didn't choose this

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.029 
the reason that I didn't choose this
headgear<00:06:12.219> ultimately<00:06:12.879> is<00:06:13.240> that<00:06:13.300> this<00:06:14.199> pad<00:06:14.620> on

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
headgear ultimately is that this pad on

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:20.309 
headgear ultimately is that this pad on
the<00:06:15.250> inside<00:06:15.699> is<00:06:16.000> really<00:06:16.210> flat<00:06:17.020> and<00:06:18.750> my<00:06:19.750> head<00:06:20.020> is

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.339 
the inside is really flat and my head is
really<00:06:20.979> not<00:06:21.219> flat<00:06:21.520> it's<00:06:21.849> kind<00:06:22.089> of<00:06:22.150> I<00:06:22.449> got

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:23.349 
really not flat it's kind of I got

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.829 
really not flat it's kind of I got
somewhat<00:06:23.710> of<00:06:23.830> a<00:06:23.919> narrow<00:06:24.159> pointed<00:06:24.550> head<00:06:24.699> okay

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:25.839 
somewhat of a narrow pointed head okay

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.019 
somewhat of a narrow pointed head okay
now<00:06:26.469> when<00:06:26.800> I<00:06:26.830> put<00:06:27.099> it<00:06:27.189> on<00:06:27.310> I<00:06:27.339> said<00:06:27.699> hey<00:06:27.879> this

now when I put it on I said hey this
fits<00:06:28.270> great<00:06:28.449> I<00:06:28.810> just<00:06:29.620> left<00:06:29.770> it<00:06:29.919> on<00:06:30.009> for<00:06:30.310> a

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
fits great I just left it on for a

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.970 
fits great I just left it on for a
couple<00:06:30.399> minutes<00:06:30.759> and

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
couple minutes and

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.980 
couple minutes and
reducing<00:06:33.250> the<00:06:33.400> pressure<00:06:33.820> in<00:06:34.180> the<00:06:34.360> front<00:06:34.780> of<00:06:34.870> my

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
reducing the pressure in the front of my

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.600 
reducing the pressure in the front of my
head<00:06:36.000> was<00:06:37.260> pretty<00:06:38.260> irritating<00:06:38.920> and<00:06:38.980> I<00:06:39.040> knew<00:06:39.280> if

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
head was pretty irritating and I knew if

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.430 
head was pretty irritating and I knew if
I<00:06:39.790> was<00:06:39.970> in<00:06:40.090> there<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.870> I<00:06:41.080> was<00:06:41.170> trying<00:06:41.410> to

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
I was in there and I was trying to

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.720 
I was in there and I was trying to
concentrate<00:06:41.890> on<00:06:42.010> what<00:06:42.160> needed<00:06:42.370> to<00:06:42.430> be<00:06:42.490> done

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
concentrate on what needed to be done

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.000 
concentrate on what needed to be done
and<00:06:42.970> all<00:06:43.090> I<00:06:43.270> could<00:06:43.480> think<00:06:43.810> about<00:06:44.710> was

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
and all I could think about was

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.940 
and all I could think about was
relieving<00:06:45.940> the<00:06:46.240> pressure<00:06:46.420> on<00:06:46.750> the<00:06:46.840> front<00:06:47.050> this

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
relieving the pressure on the front this

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.440 
relieving the pressure on the front this
is<00:06:48.130> not<00:06:48.340> gonna<00:06:48.490> work<00:06:49.650> um<00:06:51.060> for<00:06:52.060> those<00:06:52.180> of<00:06:52.240> you

here<00:07:29.920> was<00:07:30.280> the<00:07:30.310> deal<00:07:30.640> breaker<00:07:30.700> for<00:07:31.030> me<00:07:31.240> I

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:31.330 
here was the deal breaker for me I

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.260 
here was the deal breaker for me I
couldn't<00:07:31.960> go<00:07:32.080> with<00:07:32.290> it<00:07:32.440> because<00:07:32.620> it's<00:07:33.270> it's

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:34.270 
couldn't go with it because it's it's

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.970 
couldn't go with it because it's it's
just<00:07:34.510> too<00:07:34.630> much<00:07:34.960> pressure<00:07:35.320> right<00:07:35.440> now<00:07:35.710> even

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:35.980 
just too much pressure right now even

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:42.090 
just too much pressure right now even
with<00:07:36.130> the<00:07:36.280> back<00:07:37.770> this<00:07:38.770> back<00:07:39.040> area<00:07:40.710> it<00:07:41.710> didn't

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.100 
with the back this back area it didn't

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.880 
with the back this back area it didn't
leave<00:07:42.550> enough<00:07:42.970> of<00:07:43.120> it<00:07:43.300> it's<00:07:43.510> too<00:07:43.780> flat<00:07:44.080> so<00:07:44.560> for

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:44.890 
leave enough of it it's too flat so for

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.130 
leave enough of it it's too flat so for
me<00:07:45.070> that's<00:07:45.550> that<00:07:45.940> was<00:07:46.510> the<00:07:46.600> biggest<00:07:46.990> reason

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.140 
me that's that was the biggest reason

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.230 
me that's that was the biggest reason
why<00:07:47.380> this<00:07:47.440> one<00:07:47.740> wasn't<00:07:48.040> gonna<00:07:48.130> work<00:07:48.310> I<00:07:48.580> could

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 
why this one wasn't gonna work I could

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.550 
why this one wasn't gonna work I could
deal<00:07:49.450> with<00:07:49.480> the<00:07:49.690> chin<00:07:49.900> strap<00:07:49.990> all<00:07:50.350> the<00:07:50.440> way

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 
deal with the chin strap all the way
