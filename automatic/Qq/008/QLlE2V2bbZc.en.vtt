00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
a seam on the bottom so what I do is

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.219 
a seam on the bottom so what I do is
just<00:01:59.219> scrunch<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.790> together<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.450> give<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
just scrunch that together and give it a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.260 
just scrunch that together and give it a
good<00:02:01.380> jump<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> counter<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.030> gets

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
good jump on the counter and that gets

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.459 
good jump on the counter and that gets
rid<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> theme<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.320> your
