 image stabilization system and 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.649

 fooling pundits have developed 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.890
 technology allow to record 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.450
 everyone is to blame for hard workers 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.170
 in the modern form of direct render 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.759
 information carries the soul 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.920
 Azer also plays on the surface 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.280
 risky assets by new technology 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.840
 instead of grooves on the surface of the disk 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.870

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.479
 joke in the use of rays 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.750

 many use social networks like 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.020
 vkontakte for temporary storage 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.890
 your photo video files and as shown 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.650
 research in vain 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.040
 many social services continue 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.140
 store images even if you them 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.020

 in seven cases photos by 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.650

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.529
 of destruction 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.599

 higher data security 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.139
 negative attitude towards him from the spot was 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.560
 hardware related problems 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.099
 software compatibility and with 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.670
 increased iron requirements 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.099
 over time, the problem was solved first 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.739
 the second is democracy bothers you 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.969

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.649
 in the pentagon with iron everything went very 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.889
 OK 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.360

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.479
 place the cost of one megabyte under 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.010
 ten kopecks and no subscription 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.929
 satellite provider fees ceasing 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:03.929
 And office office address at the meeting 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.249
 according to preliminary data from the new 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:10.680
 blanks go circulation 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.559
 if only 2025 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.609
 ohrenet how soon 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.009
