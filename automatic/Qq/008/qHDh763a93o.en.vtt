00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.440
 derbyzeit is travel time so many fans 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.290
 like never before in the season support 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.450
 her team in the foreign 401 lion fans in the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.549
 crimmitschauer cream park and stefan 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.859
 Augustin is one of them 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.410
 For about ten years he almost missed 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.910
 no home game service is his 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.070
 to the obligatory program 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.869
 but the current altitude flight of dresdner 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.800
 gets hot even hits the only one 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.910
 Candidates for the relegation round 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.930
 I should be trading now I would be running 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.059
 Just say it fits in the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.219
 team that you notice the guys have 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.719
 have fun playing now too 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.070
 easy to run in the crucial 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.469
 moments but just that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.960
 happiness what else sometimes 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.090
 was missing 3000 spectators great 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.100
 mood and both teams give full throttle 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.469
 crimmitschau wants to go home 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.809
 afflicted plagued fans what the first 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.480
 opportunities associated Eispiraten much to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.270
 sorry for ice lions noble fan stefan 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.609
 augustin after ten minutes of play though 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.920
 may also cheer the racing bike member 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.950
 dresden in powerplay and the first series 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.799
 makes the gate gold helmet tommy can 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.580
 brings the ice lions into leadership 1 0 and 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.580
 stuck Augustin 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.440
 but also crimmitschau has a strong 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.480
 first block also in the powerplay 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.240
 same as the pirates from max campell 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.900
 with the 11 now the others are allowed 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.790
 rejoice break breathe third analysis 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.130
 this is a very intense game 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.490
 currently the crimmitschauer are 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.380
 uncomfortable and what i find great in it 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.400
 really pray for that as well as us 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.229
 have the injured time so often 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.530
 that one right and fought derbys 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.410
 to have 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.630
 today we have really cool the 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.610
 big fight on the ice is also in the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.759
 second third and more 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.950
 the ice lions set the first scent mark 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.130
 again this time it is marius 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.830
 garden of 1 2 to 1 dresden prefers 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.229
 and the fans are out of bounds and tied 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.509
 the derby support first class 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.369
 but the question remains why one 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.830
 such mood in the domestic hall 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.420
 If the fans are missing we need a unit 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.520
 So would the currently lacking between 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.380
 you can see that there too 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.760
 There are actually several camps 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.250
 should not be something complete 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.620
 nonsense is because the boys are important 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.150
 on ice you should support that because 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.140
 what we accommodate comes after all 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.420
 back and we have to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.830
 Work in any case it has to be better 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.230
 we will have to be colorful organism 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.970
 Unfortunately, the racy Saxon derby 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.280
 two equivalent teams 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.980
 in powerplay, both teams are great 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.709
 harrison ried must miss this time 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.060
 Allocation to the Ice Lions 2 to 2 everything 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.530
 open or not going on section 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.780
 two crimmitschauer on the criminal bank 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.120
 that does not bode well 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.580
 the disc runs patiently is being maintained 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.680
 and then slammed freezing cold 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.200
 sami kaartinen with the renewed 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.200
 leadership for dresden 3 to 2 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.580
 if there is a proof of the ice lions 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.739
 then you need self-confidence 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.670
 Please defend these scenes defenders 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.170
 felix thum 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.599
 it goes with the productive in the opponent 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.450
 third offender first and still makes 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.760
 hit 4 to 2 10 minutes before 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.940
 set playing the EislÃ¶wen the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.360
 lockout the eleventh victory in a row and what 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.360
 for one 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.010
 So nobody has any 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.650
 remember that he plays so much 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.959
 won the ice lions words the 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.160
 Cream Park and a song is so slow 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.160
 to live instead 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.050
 it's great to play here before that 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.970
 many traveled fans such a 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.360
 mood we could always use 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.490
 also at home games fans and 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.800
 player joins in the joyful rush the 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.080
 Madness series of the ice lions continues 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.060
 use sheet 2 the dresdner 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.980
 skis and the next away 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.250
 highlight is imminent 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.860
 on the 28th of december we will go with the special train 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.540
