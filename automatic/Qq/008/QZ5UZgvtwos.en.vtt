more hearts now originally they would

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.170 
more hearts now originally they would
look<00:03:29.470> like<00:03:29.860> little<00:03:30.400> rectangles<00:03:31.120> like<00:03:31.360> this

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.729 

okay<00:03:37.180> then<00:03:37.390> I'm<00:03:37.510> going<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.810> arrange<00:03:38.439> them<00:03:38.650> on

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
okay then I'm going to arrange them on

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.490 
okay then I'm going to arrange them on
my<00:03:38.950> cooling<00:03:39.760> rack<00:03:40.030> just<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.840> let<00:03:40.989> them<00:03:41.170> set<00:03:41.470> a

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
my cooling rack just to let them set a

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.380 
my cooling rack just to let them set a
little<00:03:41.739> bit<00:03:41.890> more<00:03:42.189> and<00:03:42.400> cool<00:03:42.609> down<00:03:42.819> before<00:03:43.030> I'm

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
little bit more and cool down before I'm

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.839 
little bit more and cool down before I'm
going<00:03:43.629> to<00:03:43.840> be<00:03:43.989> dipping<00:03:44.950> them<00:03:45.099> in<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.519> melted

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
going to be dipping them in the melted

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.330 
going to be dipping them in the melted
chocolate<00:03:46.090> now<00:03:46.840> because<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.739> caramels<00:03:48.159> are

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
chocolate now because the caramels are

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.920 
chocolate now because the caramels are
pretty<00:03:48.609> sweet<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.030> would<00:03:49.359> suggest<00:03:49.599> the

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
pretty sweet I would suggest the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.550 
pretty sweet I would suggest the
bittersweet<00:03:50.260> chocolate<00:03:50.609> but<00:03:51.609> with<00:03:51.879> my<00:03:52.000> kids

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
bittersweet chocolate but with my kids

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.660 
bittersweet chocolate but with my kids
bittersweet<00:03:53.560> chocolate<00:03:53.590> doesn't<00:03:54.190> go<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:54.639> I

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
bittersweet chocolate doesn't go so I

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.520 
bittersweet chocolate doesn't go so I
actually<00:03:55.000> had<00:03:55.389> a<00:03:55.420> milk<00:03:55.690> chocolate<00:03:55.900> here<00:03:56.349> which

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
actually had a milk chocolate here which

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.190 
actually had a milk chocolate here which
I<00:03:56.680> melted<00:03:57.040> in<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.280> microwave<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:58.000> popped<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:59.079> in

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
I melted in the microwave I popped it in

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.319 
I melted in the microwave I popped it in
the<00:03:59.290> microwave<00:03:59.620> two<00:04:00.010> times<00:04:00.280> for<00:04:00.549> 30<00:04:00.700> seconds

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
the microwave two times for 30 seconds

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.309 
the microwave two times for 30 seconds
and<00:04:01.480> that's<00:04:02.079> how<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.439> looked<00:04:02.680> like<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:04.319> then

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
and that's how it looked like and then

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.470 
and that's how it looked like and then
using<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.799> toothpick<00:04:06.069> I'm<00:04:06.459> going<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:07.030> poke<00:04:07.299> it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
using a toothpick I'm going to poke it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.390 
using a toothpick I'm going to poke it
into<00:04:07.659> my<00:04:07.870> caramels<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.500> then<00:04:08.739> dip<00:04:09.010> them<00:04:09.250> in

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
into my caramels and then dip them in

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.759 
into my caramels and then dip them in
the<00:04:09.519> chocolate<00:04:09.549> tap<00:04:10.299> it<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.750> get<00:04:11.200> rid<00:04:11.409> of<00:04:11.439> any

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
the chocolate tap it to get rid of any
