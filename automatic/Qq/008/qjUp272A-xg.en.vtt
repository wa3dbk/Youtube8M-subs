gameplay that you're watching is a fifty

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.930 
gameplay that you're watching is a fifty
to<00:00:45.510> one<00:00:45.750> game<00:00:46.410> play<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> map<00:00:47.100> hijack<00:00:47.520> Kill

to one game play on a map hijack Kill

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.150 
to one game play on a map hijack Kill
Confirmed<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.660> wasn't<00:00:49.530> even<00:00:49.620> really<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:50.039> for

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
Confirmed I wasn't even really going for

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.740 
Confirmed I wasn't even really going for
game<00:00:50.340> play<00:00:50.460> when<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> got<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.420> actually

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
game play when I got this and I actually

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.270 
game play when I got this and I actually
nearly<00:00:51.989> got<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> nuclear<00:00:52.680> which<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.980> thirty

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
nearly got a nuclear which is thirty

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.090 
nearly got a nuclear which is thirty
which<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> thirty<00:00:54.000> kill<00:00:54.300> streak<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.100> think

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
which is a thirty kill streak so I think

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.010 
which is a thirty kill streak so I think
this<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> pretty<00:00:56.579> good<00:00:56.910> gameplay<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> having

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
this is a pretty good gameplay to having

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
move on to some tips now in this video

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.770 
move on to some tips now in this video
you're<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.360> able<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> see

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
you're not going to be able to see

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.440 
you're not going to be able to see
everything<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> described<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.729> could<00:01:09.330> have

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
everything that I described I could have

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480 
everything that I described I could have
put<00:01:10.200> together<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.530> whole<00:01:10.680> load<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> clips<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.430> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
put together a whole load of clips but I

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.460 
put together a whole load of clips but I
think<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:12.869> watching<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.290> whole

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
think that actually watching a whole

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.950 
think that actually watching a whole
game<00:01:13.680> play<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.299> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.360> teach<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> lot

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
game play is going to teach you a lot

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.420 
game play is going to teach you a lot
more<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.350> pay<00:01:16.590> attention<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> gameplay

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
more so pay attention to the gameplay

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.120 
more so pay attention to the gameplay
and<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.759> watch<00:01:17.939> how<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.330> kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.900> avoid<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and just watch how I kind of avoid the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.820 
and just watch how I kind of avoid the
areas<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.930> really<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.140> high<00:01:22.409> enemy

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
areas of really really high enemy

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.310 
areas of really really high enemy
activity<00:01:23.310> unless<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.330> am<00:01:24.450> absolutely<00:01:24.960> sure

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
activity unless I am absolutely sure

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.039 
activity unless I am absolutely sure
that<00:01:25.979> I'm<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.520> able<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.049> eliminate

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
that I'm going to be able to eliminate

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.870 
that I'm going to be able to eliminate
those<00:01:28.470> targets<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.280> without<00:01:29.579> dying

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
those targets and get out without dying

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
those targets and get out without dying
and<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.990> way<00:01:31.110> you're<00:01:31.259> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.740> is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and the way you're going to do that is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
and the way you're going to do that is
by<00:01:31.979> getting<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.280> VSAT<00:01:32.670> which<00:01:33.110> obviously

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
by getting a VSAT which obviously

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.200 
by getting a VSAT which obviously
getting<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.590> visa<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.100> quite<00:01:35.430> difficult<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
getting a visa is quite difficult but it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539 
getting a visa is quite difficult but it
is<00:01:36.329> probably<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> best<00:01:37.140> kill<00:01:37.439> streak<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.340> have

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
is probably the best kill streak to have

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.450 
is probably the best kill streak to have
on<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.299> you're<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.829> high<00:01:41.220> amount<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
on if you're going for a high amount of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.210 
on if you're going for a high amount of
kills<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.970> low<00:01:42.150> amount<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.540> deaths<00:01:42.869> which

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
kills and a low amount of deaths which

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.350 
kills and a low amount of deaths which
is<00:01:44.220> pretty<00:01:44.369> much<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.700> every<00:01:44.880> Call<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> Duty

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
is pretty much what every Call of Duty

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.539 
is pretty much what every Call of Duty
player<00:01:45.540> wants<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:47.040> V<00:01:47.220> set<00:01:47.430> is

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
player wants right so the V set is

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
player wants right so the V set is
probably<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> best<00:01:48.180> kill<00:01:48.390> streak<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.840> you

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
probably the best kill streak if you

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.170 
probably the best kill streak if you
don't<00:01:50.009> think<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.610> VSAT<00:01:51.030> then

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
don't think you can get VSAT then

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.880 
don't think you can get VSAT then
definitely<00:01:51.420> put<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> UAV<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.409> perhaps<00:01:52.590> even

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
definitely put the UAV on perhaps even

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.319 
definitely put the UAV on perhaps even
the<00:01:53.040> counter<00:01:53.340> UAV<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> counter<00:01:54.240> UAV

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the counter UAV because the counter UAV

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.030 
the counter UAV because the counter UAV
is<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> keep<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.110> off<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.229> radar<00:01:55.439> if

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
is going to keep you off the radar if

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.030 
is going to keep you off the radar if
you're<00:01:56.430> not<00:01:56.729> using<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.210> silenced<00:01:57.659> weapon<00:01:58.040> which

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you're not using a silenced weapon which

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.889 
you're not using a silenced weapon which
I<00:01:59.159> wasn't<00:01:59.490> actually<00:01:59.610> to<00:02:00.390> start<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.840> this

red dots on the map and let's be honest

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.410 
red dots on the map and let's be honest
a<00:02:25.110> lot<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.350> new<00:02:25.650> players<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.790> kind<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.060> run<00:02:27.300> at

swamped by a load of noobs one of them

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.200

just map knowledge guys now you'll see
especially<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.520> start<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:44.940> gameplay<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.300> was

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
especially the start this gameplay I was

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.910 
especially the start this gameplay I was
playing<00:02:45.750> incredibly<00:02:46.350> aggressively<00:02:46.890> I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
playing incredibly aggressively I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.890 
playing incredibly aggressively I
basically<00:02:47.280> ran<00:02:47.610> straight<00:02:48.150> into<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.660> enemy

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
basically ran straight into the enemy

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.630 
basically ran straight into the enemy
spawn<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.860> that's<00:02:49.980> because<00:02:50.220> I'm<00:02:50.340> very<00:02:50.520> very

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
spawn but that's because I'm very very

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.010 
spawn but that's because I'm very very
comfortable<00:02:51.210> with<00:02:51.270> highjacked<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.900> was

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
comfortable with highjacked I was

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.320 
comfortable with highjacked I was
playing<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> couple<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:53.010> friends<00:02:53.300> one<00:02:54.300> of

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
me and him kind of have a strategy that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.050 
me and him kind of have a strategy that
we<00:02:58.830> like<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.010> run<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.490> this<00:02:59.610> map<00:02:59.820> for

how<00:03:26.280> many<00:03:26.340> kills<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.760> could<00:03:26.910> really<00:03:27.090> get<00:03:27.270> and

just see how well I could do but if
you're<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.209> bit<00:03:30.510> less<00:03:30.690> confident<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.500> you

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you're a bit less confident and you

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.650 
you're a bit less confident and you
don't<00:03:32.190> know<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> map<00:03:32.610> as<00:03:32.790> well<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.510> will

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
don't know the map as well that will

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.300 
don't know the map as well that will
come<00:03:33.840> with<00:03:33.959> time<00:03:34.140> trust<00:03:34.530> me<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.890> don't<00:03:35.040> really

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
come with time trust me you don't really

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.590

need<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.490> do<00:03:35.580> anything<00:03:35.760> specific<00:03:36.000> just

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
need to do anything specific just

need to do anything specific just
playing<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.050> game<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.350> practicing<00:03:37.830> will

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
playing the game and practicing will

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.430 
playing the game and practicing will
help<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.790> out<00:03:38.820> in<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.180> regard<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:40.320> you'll

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
help you out in that regard and you'll

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.660 
help you out in that regard and you'll
get<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.740> point<00:03:40.890> where<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.160> have<00:03:41.340> kind<00:03:41.580> of

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
get to the point where you have kind of

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.160 
get to the point where you have kind of
set<00:03:41.970> routes<00:03:42.240> that<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.570> like<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.810> run<00:03:42.990> at<00:03:43.080> the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
set routes that you like to run at the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.690 
set routes that you like to run at the
start<00:03:43.410> of<00:03:43.500> matches<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.950> try<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.310> get<00:03:44.580> your

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
start of matches to try and get your

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.960 
start of matches to try and get your
kill<00:03:44.940> streak<00:03:45.150> going<00:03:45.420> as<00:03:45.930> quickly<00:03:46.290> as<00:03:46.470> possible

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
kill streak going as quickly as possible

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.640 
kill streak going as quickly as possible
but<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.630> you're<00:03:48.870> at<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.050> stage<00:03:49.290> now<00:03:49.320> where

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
but if you're at that stage now where

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.810 
but if you're at that stage now where
you're<00:03:49.740> quite<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.950> new<00:03:50.160> player<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.640> don't

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
you're quite a new player and you don't

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.220 
you're quite a new player and you don't
really<00:03:50.970> have<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> lot<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:51.360> map<00:03:51.540> knowledge<00:03:51.720> then

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
really have a lot of map knowledge then

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.780 
really have a lot of map knowledge then
play<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> bit<00:03:52.740> more<00:03:52.890> defensively<00:03:53.340> than<00:03:53.550> I<00:03:53.640> am

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
play a bit more defensively than I am

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.180 
play a bit more defensively than I am
right<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:55.320> could<00:03:55.500> consider<00:03:55.860> what<00:03:56.070> I'm

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
right now you could consider what I'm

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.949 
right now you could consider what I'm
doing<00:03:56.520> here<00:03:56.790> defensive<00:03:57.360> play<00:03:57.540> because<00:03:57.840> I'm

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
doing here defensive play because I'm

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.470 
doing here defensive play because I'm
not<00:03:58.230> really<00:03:58.500> running<00:03:59.010> out<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.250> where<00:03:59.580> I<00:03:59.670> am<00:03:59.730> but

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
not really running out of where I am but

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.699 
not really running out of where I am but
I<00:04:00.510> wouldn't<00:04:00.750> say<00:04:00.900> I'm<00:04:00.959> camping<00:04:01.470> either

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
I wouldn't say I'm camping either

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.280 
I wouldn't say I'm camping either
there's<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.250> definite<00:04:02.930> distinction<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.260> think

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
there's a definite distinction I think

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.600 
there's a definite distinction I think
that<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> lot<00:04:04.800> of<00:04:04.860> people<00:04:05.160> fail<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.400> make

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
that a lot of people fail to make

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.900 
that a lot of people fail to make
between<00:04:06.000> camping<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:06.990> holding<00:04:07.980> down<00:04:08.010> an<00:04:08.370> area

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
between camping and holding down an area

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.660 
between camping and holding down an area
camping<00:04:09.570> is<00:04:09.750> what<00:04:10.080> people<00:04:11.010> would<00:04:11.160> kind<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.459> if

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
camping is what people would kind of if

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.050 
camping is what people would kind of if
someone<00:04:12.270> was<00:04:12.480> sitting<00:04:12.510> in<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.989> corner<00:04:13.970> then<00:04:14.970> I

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
someone was sitting in a corner then I

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.120 
someone was sitting in a corner then I
think<00:04:15.540> that's<00:04:15.780> what<00:04:16.020> camping<00:04:16.470> really<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.859> and

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
think that's what camping really is and

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.229 
think that's what camping really is and
sitting<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.549> corner<00:04:17.790> honestly<00:04:18.060> it's

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
sitting in a corner honestly it's

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.570 
sitting in a corner honestly it's
actually<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.540> very<00:04:18.810> bad<00:04:19.109> idea<00:04:19.140> if<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:20.190> want<00:04:20.370> to

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
actually a very bad idea if you want to

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.310 
actually a very bad idea if you want to
get<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.850> good<00:04:21.030> KD<00:04:21.270> ratio<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.840> if<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.020> want<00:04:22.169> to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
get a good KD ratio and if you want to

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.159 
get a good KD ratio and if you want to
die<00:04:22.530> less<00:04:22.740> because<00:04:23.540> after<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.570> couple<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.930> kills

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
die less because after a couple of kills

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.960 
die less because after a couple of kills
on<00:04:25.410> one<00:04:25.680> guy<00:04:25.890> they<00:04:26.400> will<00:04:26.580> keep

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
on one guy they will keep

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.810 
on one guy they will keep
coming<00:04:27.120> back<00:04:27.270> for<00:04:27.480> you<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.610> sooner<00:04:29.610> or<00:04:29.700> later

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
coming back for you and sooner or later

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
here I'm actually realizing I might even

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.260 
here I'm actually realizing I might even
get<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.980> nuclear<00:05:17.160> which<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:18.000> haven't<00:05:18.180> actually

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
get the nuclear which I haven't actually

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.909 
get the nuclear which I haven't actually
got<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.540> nuclear<00:05:18.900> yet<00:05:19.080> because<00:05:19.350> I've<00:05:19.740> just<00:05:19.770> been

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
got a nuclear yet because I've just been

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.260 
got a nuclear yet because I've just been
going<00:05:20.070> for<00:05:20.220> challenges<00:05:20.640> and<00:05:20.760> not<00:05:20.850> really<00:05:21.120> high

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
going for challenges and not really high

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.180

scoring game plays yet on black ops 2
and<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:24.050> think<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.080> was<00:05:25.140> on<00:05:25.200> like<00:05:25.350> a<00:05:25.410> twenty<00:05:25.710> seven

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
and I think I was on like a twenty seven

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.350 
and I think I was on like a twenty seven
kill<00:05:26.220> streak<00:05:26.460> here<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:26.790> get<00:05:26.970> taken<00:05:27.120> out

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
kill streak here and I get taken out

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.810 
kill streak here and I get taken out
which<00:05:27.510> is<00:05:27.660> really<00:05:27.990> really<00:05:28.140> annoying<00:05:28.350> but<00:05:28.820> so

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
which is really really annoying but so

really see much of it in this gameplay
but<00:06:00.270> on<00:06:00.390> big<00:06:00.660> maps<00:06:00.930> such<00:06:01.830> as<00:06:02.720> turbine<00:06:03.720> you<00:06:03.930> do

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
but on big maps such as turbine you do

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.240 
but on big maps such as turbine you do
not<00:06:04.169> want<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.380> be<00:06:04.440> running<00:06:04.650> right<00:06:04.770> down<00:06:04.979> the

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
not want to be running right down the

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.680 
not want to be running right down the
middle<00:06:05.280> where<00:06:05.940> there<00:06:06.060> are<00:06:06.150> snipers<00:06:06.360> and

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
middle where there are snipers and

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.150 
middle where there are snipers and
everything<00:06:07.020> constantly<00:06:07.710> looking<00:06:07.950> there

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
everything constantly looking there

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.770 
everything constantly looking there
because<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:08.760> will<00:06:08.940> get<00:06:09.120> taken<00:06:09.300> out<00:06:09.540> and<00:06:09.720> it

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
because you will get taken out and it

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.360 
because you will get taken out and it
might<00:06:09.960> kind<00:06:10.470> of<00:06:10.500> take<00:06:10.680> you<00:06:10.800> out<00:06:10.950> one<00:06:11.190> off<00:06:11.280> a

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
might kind of take you out one off a

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.670 
might kind of take you out one off a
kill<00:06:11.550> streak<00:06:11.669> or<00:06:12.000> just<00:06:12.390> it<00:06:13.200> might<00:06:13.410> be<00:06:13.530> one<00:06:13.620> of

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
kill streak or just it might be one of

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.500 
kill streak or just it might be one of
the<00:06:13.770> reasons<00:06:13.890> why<00:06:14.160> you're<00:06:14.310> dying<00:06:14.490> so<00:06:14.729> much<00:06:14.940> but

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
the reasons why you're dying so much but

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.900 
the reasons why you're dying so much but
stay<00:06:15.720> to<00:06:15.780> the<00:06:15.960> edges<00:06:16.229> be<00:06:16.440> clever<00:06:16.770> be<00:06:17.370> crafty

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
stay to the edges be clever be crafty

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.550 
stay to the edges be clever be crafty
and<00:06:18.060> like<00:06:18.630> I<00:06:18.720> said<00:06:18.780> if<00:06:18.960> you're<00:06:19.080> new<00:06:19.290> to<00:06:19.440> the

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
and like I said if you're new to the

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.620 
and like I said if you're new to the
game<00:06:19.590> and<00:06:19.950> you're<00:06:20.040> not<00:06:20.160> as<00:06:20.250> confident<00:06:20.640> then

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
game and you're not as confident then

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.190 
game and you're not as confident then
play<00:06:22.320> defensively<00:06:23.180> find<00:06:24.180> an<00:06:24.300> area<00:06:24.510> where

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
play defensively find an area where

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.600 
play defensively find an area where
there's<00:06:25.500> a<00:06:25.560> reasonable<00:06:26.100> amount<00:06:26.220> of<00:06:26.310> enemy

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
there's a reasonable amount of enemy

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.219 
there's a reasonable amount of enemy

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
area where there's no enemies you just

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.390 
area where there's no enemies you just
won't<00:06:29.700> get<00:06:29.820> any<00:06:30.000> kills<00:06:30.240> but<00:06:31.229> find<00:06:32.160> an<00:06:32.250> area

traffic<00:06:33.870> near<00:06:34.200> their<00:06:34.380> spawn<00:06:34.650> perhaps<00:06:35.180> lock<00:06:36.180> it

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
traffic near their spawn perhaps lock it

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.140 
traffic near their spawn perhaps lock it
down<00:06:36.539> and<00:06:36.810> that's<00:06:37.740> basically<00:06:38.130> the<00:06:38.490> best<00:06:38.669> the

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
down and that's basically the best the

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.809 
down and that's basically the best the
best<00:06:39.360> possible<00:06:39.720> advice<00:06:39.960> I<00:06:40.169> can<00:06:40.229> give<00:06:40.470> you<00:06:40.500> guys

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:40.819 
best possible advice I can give you guys

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:42.950 
best possible advice I can give you guys
there<00:06:41.819> are<00:06:41.970> a<00:06:42.000> whole<00:06:42.330> load<00:06:42.509> of<00:06:42.539> other<00:06:42.690> ways

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
there are a whole load of other ways

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.050 
there are a whole load of other ways
that<00:06:43.620> you<00:06:43.680> can<00:06:43.949> improve<00:06:44.250> your<00:06:44.400> playstyle<00:06:44.849> to

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
that you can improve your playstyle to

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.300 
that you can improve your playstyle to
die<00:06:45.270> less<00:06:45.539> but<00:06:46.289> they<00:06:46.560> all<00:06:46.710> probably<00:06:47.069> come

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
die less but they all probably come

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.740 
die less but they all probably come
under<00:06:47.610> a<00:06:47.639> different<00:06:47.879> category<00:06:48.210> of<00:06:48.539> video

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
under a different category of video

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.570 
under a different category of video
these<00:06:49.319> are<00:06:49.379> probably<00:06:49.740> the<00:06:49.800> best<00:06:50.009> ones<00:06:50.159> that

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
these are probably the best ones that

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.730 
these are probably the best ones that
you<00:06:51.180> can<00:06:51.419> kind<00:06:51.750> of<00:06:51.780> do<00:06:51.990> straight<00:06:52.379> out<00:06:52.500> the<00:06:52.620> box

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
you can kind of do straight out the box

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.189 
you can kind of do straight out the box
if<00:06:52.979> you<00:06:53.039> see<00:06:53.190> what<00:06:53.310> I<00:06:53.370> mean<00:06:53.520> you<00:06:53.669> can<00:06:53.990> do<00:06:54.990> this
