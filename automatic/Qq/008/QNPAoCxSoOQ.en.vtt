 I put needle number 14 for the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 Mayan culture says flavia entered and switched 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.370
 normal needle for the nickname of dodo 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.469
 It was very cool that morning.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.410
 to sew the catar 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.879
