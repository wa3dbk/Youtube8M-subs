00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
were going to cross in front of the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.279 
were going to cross in front of the
others<00:00:47.090> there's<00:00:48.090> no<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.660> necessarily

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
others there's no really necessarily

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.900 
others there's no really necessarily
right<00:00:49.590> way<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.280> pick<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
right way to do that you just pick the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.000 
right way to do that you just pick the
certain<00:00:51.719> wines<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.230> want<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.530> front<00:00:52.800> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and then we get to this e we are going

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.039 
and then we get to this e we are going
to<00:01:10.170> connect<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.039> end<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.520> e<00:01:11.780> into<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
to connect the end of the e into the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.679 
to connect the end of the e into the
heart<00:01:13.289> like<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:15.679> and<00:01:17.329> that's<00:01:18.329> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.569> go

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
heart like this and that's going to go

heart like this and that's going to go
all<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.530> way<00:01:19.560> around<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.880> not<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
all the way around and it's not going to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.779 
all the way around and it's not going to
connect<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.719> the<00:01:21.840> L<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.380> side<00:01:22.649> but<00:01:23.189> it's

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
connect to the L on that side but it's

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.139 
connect to the L on that side but it's
going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> connect<00:01:24.359> on<00:01:24.569> the<00:01:24.659> other<00:01:24.780> side<00:01:26.149> right

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
going to connect on the other side right

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:42.590 
going to connect on the other side right
there<00:01:30.020> almost<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.109> one<00:01:31.409> continuing<00:01:32.689> strand

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
