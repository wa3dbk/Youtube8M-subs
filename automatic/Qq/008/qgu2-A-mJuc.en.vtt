 Well, what I'm doing now is 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.089
 prepared as you can see on the 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.070
 trays all proportions for 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.080
 make the recipes 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.200
 and then we do everything in duplicate actually 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.830
 one and yes it's the videos it's 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.370

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.810
 example while damien is in the process 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.660
 in the oven that way it helps 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.110
 shorten shooting times while 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.630
 simply 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 and then and suddenly we can immediately 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.000
 to predict and that's the cake coming out 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.000
