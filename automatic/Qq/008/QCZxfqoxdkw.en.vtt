round<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.990> believe<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.710> round<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.039> go<00:00:17.160> 32<00:00:17.940> 21

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.359 
round I believe in this round I go 32 21
I<00:00:18.869> think<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.350> 32<00:00:19.710> kills<00:00:19.949> you're<00:00:20.039> gonna<00:00:20.130> see

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
I think so 32 kills you're gonna see

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.120 
I think so 32 kills you're gonna see
with<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> SMR<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:22.650> kind<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.859> started

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
with the SMR and I just kind of started

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.679 
with the SMR and I just kind of started
using<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.460> gun<00:00:23.640> every<00:00:24.300> once<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> while

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
using this gun every once in a while

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.240 
using this gun every once in a while
it's<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.990> pretty<00:00:25.199> cool<00:00:25.439> gun<00:00:25.619> I'm<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:25.920> gonna<00:00:26.039> lie

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
it's a pretty cool gun I'm not gonna lie

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.700 
it's a pretty cool gun I'm not gonna lie
i<00:00:26.490> actually<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.990> more<00:00:28.170> than<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.470> thought

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
i actually like it more than I thought

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.230 
i actually like it more than I thought
that<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.039> would<00:00:29.310> because<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> figured<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.119> was

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that I would because I figured it was

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.600 
that I would because I figured it was
just<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.480> crappy<00:00:31.140> version<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.859> FAL<00:00:32.369> but

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
just a crappy version of the FAL but

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.130 
just a crappy version of the FAL but
then<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> figured<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.750> actually<00:00:33.870> not

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
then I figured out it's actually not

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.560 
then I figured out it's actually not
half<00:00:34.380> bad<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.920> anyways<00:00:35.700> enjoy<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.390> gameplay

was<00:03:10.620> variety<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.490> maps<00:03:12.110> mmm<00:03:13.110> let's<00:03:13.620> go

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
was variety to the maps mmm let's go

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.940 
was variety to the maps mmm let's go
with<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.550> did<00:03:14.940> not<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:15.360> mw2<00:03:15.800> at<00:03:16.800> all

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
with this one I did not like mw2 at all

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.820 
with this one I did not like mw2 at all
but<00:03:17.280> high-rise<00:03:18.150> was<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.050> good<00:03:19.170> map<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.530> think

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
but high-rise was it a good map I think

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.020

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.140 
disadvantage because these new maps are
geared<00:04:34.360> specifically<00:04:34.900> for<00:04:35.290> SMG<00:04:36.190> users<00:04:36.820> that's

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
geared specifically for SMG users that's

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.580 
geared specifically for SMG users that's
just<00:04:37.330> how<00:04:37.450> does<00:04:37.630> they<00:04:37.780> want<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.020> make<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.230> maps

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
just how does they want to make the maps

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.440 
just how does they want to make the maps
faster<00:04:39.340> pace<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.700> stuff<00:04:39.880> but<00:04:40.000> what<00:04:40.180> they

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
faster pace and stuff but what they

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.180 
faster pace and stuff but what they
don't<00:04:40.660> realize<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:41.230> that<00:04:41.440> that<00:04:41.620> gets<00:04:41.800> rid<00:04:42.130> of

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
don't realize is that that gets rid of

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.000 
don't realize is that that gets rid of
the<00:04:42.540> variety<00:04:43.540> of<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.720> maps<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:44.050> Get<00:04:44.170> Rid<00:04:44.200> you

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
the variety of the maps of Get Rid you

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.740 
the variety of the maps of Get Rid you
know<00:04:45.130> there's<00:04:45.310> no<00:04:45.640> longer<00:04:45.970> really<00:04:46.300> large<00:04:46.510> maps

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
know there's no longer really large maps

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.770 
know there's no longer really large maps
and<00:04:46.990> smaller<00:04:47.590> maps<00:04:47.830> now<00:04:48.040> it's<00:04:48.280> all<00:04:48.490> small<00:04:49.330> to

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
and smaller maps now it's all small to

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.210 
and smaller maps now it's all small to
medium<00:04:50.080> maps<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.410> medium<00:04:50.680> maps<00:04:50.860> now<00:04:51.040> are

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
medium maps the medium maps now are

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.610 
medium maps the medium maps now are
considered<00:04:51.640> large<00:04:51.880> maps<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.420> to<00:04:52.840> me<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.440> can

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
considered large maps and to me that can

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.680 
considered large maps and to me that can
make<00:04:53.770> or<00:04:53.980> break<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.430> game<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:54.970> what<00:04:55.390> I'm<00:04:55.480> hoping

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
make or break a game and what I'm hoping

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.770 
make or break a game and what I'm hoping
in<00:04:55.960> cod<00:04:56.140> ghosts<00:04:56.530> is<00:04:56.650> is<00:04:57.100> that<00:04:57.400> they<00:04:57.580> change<00:04:57.970> the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
in cod ghosts is is that they change the

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.720 
in cod ghosts is is that they change the
map<00:04:59.050> variety<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.040> they<00:05:00.190> make<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.490> so<00:05:00.640> that

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
map variety and they make it so that

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.550 
map variety and they make it so that
sometimes<00:05:01.150> we<00:05:01.240> get<00:05:01.360> big<00:05:01.540> maps<00:05:01.720> sometimes<00:05:02.440> we

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
sometimes we get big maps sometimes we

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.050 
sometimes we get big maps sometimes we
get<00:05:02.680> small<00:05:02.920> maps<00:05:03.130> that's<00:05:03.610> what<00:05:03.790> I'm<00:05:03.880> hoping

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
get small maps that's what I'm hoping

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.300 
get small maps that's what I'm hoping
for<00:05:04.240> in<00:05:04.690> this<00:05:05.020> next<00:05:05.230> call<00:05:05.440> of<00:05:05.470> duty<00:05:05.590> do<00:05:06.220> you

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
agree with me that maps can make or

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.300 
agree with me that maps can make or
break<00:05:07.870> a<00:05:08.110> game<00:05:08.350> and<00:05:08.590> what<00:05:08.740> do<00:05:08.800> you<00:05:08.890> think<00:05:09.190> of

the maps in this game and what what game

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.230 
the maps in this game and what what game
do<00:05:11.980> you<00:05:12.040> think<00:05:12.190> have<00:05:12.280> the<00:05:12.310> best<00:05:12.610> maps<00:05:12.820> actually

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
do you think have the best maps actually
