 Oh ooh ooh ooh –oh (x2) What is it for? What am I doing? This laboratory is full of stills 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.090
 Now I try, I want to invent, I look for an idea 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.090
 that can inspire me. Everything can be done with my group,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.000

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:53.500
 collaborate: what you invent is useful and special if you can donate it to everyone. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:58.000
