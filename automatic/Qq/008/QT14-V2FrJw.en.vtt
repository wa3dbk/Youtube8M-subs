00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.910
 brands do not bring these applications 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:04:01.880
 that I think it is essential that 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:04.730

 process you can not verify 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.519
 now you do not have a 3g connection or a 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.579
 wifi access you may already be coming back 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.799

 you may be exploring your files 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.280
 so put your memory card 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.710
 you can already see which files 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.440
 have 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.240
 then this is at a minimum 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.270
 the basic 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.949
 Here we are, we have the children's mode here. 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.250
 because it did not appear that the mode 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.250
 childlike 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.870

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.660

 haddock with the basic applications of 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.300
 the folder only with the help of the 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.610
 Google 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.650

 prominence in cell phones there 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.430
