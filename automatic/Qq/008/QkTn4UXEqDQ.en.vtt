00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.369 
first it wants to just line up and shoot
down<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.530> tie<00:02:37.709> your<00:02:37.889> turret<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.370> made<00:02:39.379> might

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
down and tie your turret I made might

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.199 
down and tie your turret I made might
show<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.650> how<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.889> make<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.280> rotate<00:02:41.549> 360

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
show you how to make it rotate 360

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.750 
show you how to make it rotate 360
degrees<00:02:44.359> pretty<00:02:45.359> nice

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
degrees pretty nice

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.319 
degrees pretty nice
satellite<00:02:48.590> there<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:50.220> really<00:02:50.700> held<00:02:50.909> on<00:02:51.060> it's

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
satellite there I really held on it's

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.470 
satellite there I really held on it's
just<00:02:51.389> it<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.840> there<00:02:52.019> like<00:02:52.859> that

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
just it in there like that

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.670 
just it in there like that
and<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.599> come<00:02:54.870> down<00:02:54.900> here<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:57.439> let<00:02:58.439> me<00:02:58.530> get

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and we come down here and let me get

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.259 
and we come down here and let me get
these<00:02:58.799> random<00:02:59.189> pieces<00:02:59.370> out<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.700> here<00:02:59.819> I'd<00:03:00.000> like

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
these random pieces out of here I'd like

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.809 
these random pieces out of here I'd like
just<00:03:00.540> finished<00:03:00.840> building<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:02.459> let<00:03:02.730> me

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
just finished building this so let me

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.800 
just finished building this so let me
get<00:03:02.969> those<00:03:03.120> out<00:03:03.329> uh<00:03:04.280> yeah<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.909> the<00:03:06.120> down

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
get those out uh yeah this is the down

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.949 
get those out uh yeah this is the down
under<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.419> the<00:03:09.950> clone<00:03:10.950> just<00:03:11.189> working<00:03:11.459> out

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
under this is the clone just working out

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.960 
under this is the clone just working out
chef's<00:03:12.959> table<00:03:14.569> chef<00:03:16.370> four<00:03:17.370> columns<00:03:17.790> just

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
chef's table chef four columns just

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.219 
chef's table chef four columns just
right<00:03:18.150> there<00:03:18.389> in<00:03:18.989> Tinley<00:03:19.199> a<00:03:20.090> gun<00:03:21.090> rack<00:03:21.269> that's

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
right there in Tinley a gun rack that's

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:26.229 
right there in Tinley a gun rack that's
uh<00:03:22.470> twelve<00:03:23.430> guns<00:03:23.609> right<00:03:23.790> there<00:03:24.590> trash<00:03:25.590> can

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
uh twelve guns right there trash can

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.960 
uh twelve guns right there trash can
back<00:03:27.239> there<00:03:27.540> you've<00:03:28.079> got<00:03:28.109> your<00:03:28.970> conference

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
back there you've got your conference

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.909 
back there you've got your conference
table<00:03:30.419> type<00:03:30.870> thing<00:03:31.139> whatever<00:03:31.439> you<00:03:31.680> want<00:03:31.859> to

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
table type thing whatever you want to

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.039 
table type thing whatever you want to
call<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.220> then<00:03:32.669> back<00:03:32.909> there<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.599> can<00:03:33.780> it's

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
call it then back there you can it's

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.020 
call it then back there you can it's
really<00:03:34.590> hard<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.919> see<00:03:35.069> because<00:03:35.159> it's<00:03:35.430> way<00:03:35.669> back

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
really hard to see because it's way back

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.420 
really hard to see because it's way back
there<00:03:36.090> but<00:03:36.629> that's<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.199> clone<00:03:37.829> working<00:03:38.310> on

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
there but that's a clone working on

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.610 
there but that's a clone working on
three<00:03:38.759> panels<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.299> those<00:03:39.479> like<00:03:39.659> radar<00:03:40.079> control

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
three panels of those like radar control

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.929 
three panels of those like radar control
type<00:03:40.889> things<00:03:41.159> and<00:03:41.449> then<00:03:43.189> yeah<00:03:44.220> clone<00:03:44.579> Walker

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
type things and then yeah clone Walker

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.670 
type things and then yeah clone Walker
can<00:03:45.659> easily<00:03:46.530> fit<00:03:46.859> in<00:03:47.009> here<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:48.239> can<00:03:48.419> see<00:03:48.689> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
can easily fit in here you can see the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.469 
can easily fit in here you can see the
Rufus<00:03:50.069> I<00:03:50.220> enough<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.639> that<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.909> Walker<00:03:51.150> can

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
Rufus I enough so that the Walker can

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.780 
Rufus I enough so that the Walker can
easily<00:03:51.840> slide<00:03:52.079> around<00:03:52.199> and<00:03:52.609> even<00:03:53.609> with<00:03:53.759> a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
easily slide around and even with a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.530 
easily slide around and even with a
clone<00:03:54.359> in<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.659> top<00:03:54.900> little<00:03:55.439> seat<00:03:55.650> thing

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
clone in the top little seat thing

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
clone in the top little seat thing
that's<00:03:57.540> some<00:03:58.109> stairs<00:03:58.500> up<00:03:58.919> to<00:03:59.720> that<00:04:00.720> spot<00:04:01.139> that

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
that's some stairs up to that spot that

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.289 
that's some stairs up to that spot that
door<00:04:01.799> that<00:04:02.009> I<00:04:02.040> showed<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.669> beautiful

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
door that I showed you the beautiful

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.119 
door that I showed you the beautiful
door<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:05.030> catwalk<00:04:06.030> all<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.689> way<00:04:06.780> across

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
door a catwalk all the way across

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.610 
door a catwalk all the way across
speeder<00:04:08.129> bike<00:04:08.370> way<00:04:08.579> back<00:04:08.849> there<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.590> then<00:04:10.590> a

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
speeder bike way back there and then a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.370 
speeder bike way back there and then a
ladder<00:04:11.009> up<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.909> roof<00:04:13.669> so<00:04:14.669> I<00:04:14.959> think<00:04:15.959> that's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
ladder up to the roof so I think that's

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.909 
ladder up to the roof so I think that's
it

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
it

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.599 
it
oh<00:04:16.949> right<00:04:17.870> there<00:04:18.870> mine<00:04:19.049> uh<00:04:19.310> controls<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.489> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
oh right there mine uh controls to the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.620 
oh right there mine uh controls to the
door

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
door

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.880 
door
a<00:04:22.890> little<00:04:23.890> brac<00:04:24.460> just<00:04:24.910> randomly<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.720> then<00:04:26.290> his

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
a little brac just randomly and then his

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.260 
a little brac just randomly and then his
motor<00:04:27.160> for<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.490> door<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:29.170> now<00:04:29.770> that's<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.430> hmm

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
motor for the door and now that's it hmm

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:38.730 
motor for the door and now that's it hmm
so<00:04:31.510> yeah<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:34.540> has<00:04:34.930> been<00:04:36.000> my<00:04:37.350> final<00:04:38.350> entry
