 what we have all experienced ourselves 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.069
 the museeum for anatomy and pathology 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.229
 takes you on a journey through time 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.440
 it starts the second development of people in the bank 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.430
 You see different stages of the embryonic and fund development 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.430
 with the growth of the organs and tissues 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.190
 at the time of the birth of man and this sometimes far enough 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.730
 developed to enter the world 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.880
 the museum shows a certain muscle of

 a godfather of the hand then even the smallest muscles for the fine 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.420
 motor skills of the fingers 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 the blood vessels and nerves of the hand are also clearly visible 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.420
 these are just a few of the unique specimens but the museum is one of them 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.420
 the only one in the world 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.870
 here we see him preparing to log the deployment 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.450
 the corrosion preparation taken wholeheartedly to the blood vessels and respiratory tract 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.079
 visible 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.839
 this is how a healthy heart is affected 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.649
 m this is a hard with a serious condition 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.449
 but for a heart transplant would be needed to keep the patient alive 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.419
 to hold 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.379

 Nowadays the transplantation technique is very advanced 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.359
 here, kidneys that are no longer functioning will easily replace perspective 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.359
 can be donated by the healthy kidney 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.689
 transplantation of highs is of great importance to the sick person again 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.909
 give good life expectancy 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.889
 the museeum especially the omnium pathology make people aware of the necessity 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.069
 for organ donation 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.829
 having a donor codicil for everyone 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.180

 from people 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:18.169
 who gave their bodies to medical science after their death 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.709
 for education and research 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.569
 for this body chair 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.439
 relatives 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.819
 is know that the monument is placed in gratitude muzeeum 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.519
 the museum of anatomy and pathology also has a lot of value in preserving 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.909
 cultural heritage 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.979
 andreas vesalius de bie highly the in 15 48 the first fully-fledged anatomical atlas 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.159
 from the human 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.849
 in 17 47 the Leiden professor Bernard Albinus published his atlas 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.519
 of the human body 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.519
 but from the anatomical museum to the original one 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.049
 because this also acts as a bridge between science and cultural heritage 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.680
 three months of specimens in a museum are real works of art 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:11.019
 prepared and exhibited ethically in a test 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.310
 The relationship of anatomy with art is to kilos 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.639
 and is also emphasized in the anatomical museum 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.169
 because the museeum has fully focused on the development and construction of
