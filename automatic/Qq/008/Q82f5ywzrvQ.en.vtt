by a Kenny doram and I think it it's one
of<00:00:54.480> those<00:00:54.539> tunes<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.899> everybody<00:00:55.410> learns

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.850 

sounds<00:01:39.509> pretty<00:01:39.630> cool<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.590> were<00:01:40.650> good

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
sounds pretty cool and they were good

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.780 
sounds pretty cool and they were good
too<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> key<00:01:41.159> change

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.180 

and<00:01:46.330> then<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:46.630> totally<00:01:47.080> dramatically<00:01:47.710> changes

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
and then it totally dramatically changes

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.570 
and then it totally dramatically changes
keys<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:49.240> if<00:01:49.360> we're<00:01:49.510> still<00:01:49.690> going<00:01:53.430> why<00:01:54.430> don't

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
keys and if we're still going why don't

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.220 
keys and if we're still going why don't
I<00:01:54.640> sound<00:01:54.760> like<00:01:54.940> crap<00:01:55.180> right<00:01:55.420> there<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> it

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
I sound like crap right there so it

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.140 
I sound like crap right there so it
really<00:01:59.500> just<00:01:59.740> changes<00:02:00.100> keys<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:00.850> then

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
really just changes keys and then

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.510 
really just changes keys and then
there's<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.390> couple<00:02:01.660> of<00:02:01.750> things<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.170> can<00:02:02.200> do

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
there's a couple of things you can do

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:18.759 
there's a couple of things you can do
first<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.730> all<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.390> know<00:02:04.540> it's<00:02:04.690> C<00:02:04.990> minor

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:42.220 

and<00:02:19.769> then<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> key<00:02:20.159> changes<00:02:20.489> minor<00:02:21.390> 7<00:02:24.560> 2<00:02:40.310> and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
and then the key changes minor 7 2 and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.750 
and then the key changes minor 7 2 and
so<00:02:43.230> those<00:02:43.530> are<00:02:43.560> that's<00:02:44.129> kind<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.400> what's<00:02:44.609> going

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.140 
C natural minor which is a pretty
standard<00:03:07.980> kind<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.400> thing<00:03:08.579> so<00:03:08.730> I'm<00:03:08.819> using<00:03:08.970> the

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
could get those key points and also a

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.050 
could get those key points and also a
good<00:05:23.650> thing<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.950> do<00:05:24.070> is<00:05:24.190> work<00:05:24.460> out<00:05:24.610> every
