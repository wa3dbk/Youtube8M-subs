00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the packaging other than the mount

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.950

way<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.440> i<00:00:37.980> mentioned<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> white<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
way as i mentioned this is the white and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
way as i mentioned this is the white and
gold<00:00:39.690> version<00:00:39.989> which<00:00:40.320> matches<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.920> really

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
gold version which matches up really

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.510 
gold version which matches up really
nicely<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> white<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.450> gold<00:00:42.890> iphone<00:00:43.890> 5s

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
nicely with the white and gold iphone 5s

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.190 
nicely with the white and gold iphone 5s
but<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.969> will<00:00:45.180> work<00:00:45.360> with<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> wide<00:00:45.899> variety

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
but this will work with a wide variety

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.279 
but this will work with a wide variety
of<00:00:46.620> phones<00:00:46.950> both<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> case<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.930> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
somewhere you can take it off and rinse

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.270 
somewhere you can take it off and rinse
this<00:01:03.030> adhesive<00:01:03.239> off<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.960> reactivate<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> in

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
this adhesive off to reactivate it in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
this adhesive off to reactivate it in
addition<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> adhesive<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> has<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
addition to the adhesive it has a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.500 
addition to the adhesive it has a
suction<00:01:07.229> cup<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:07.920> clamps<00:01:08.909> down<00:01:08.970> quite

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
suction cup which clamps down quite

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
suction cup which clamps down quite
tightly<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> put<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.010> down<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
tightly and see I put it down on the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.609 
tightly and see I put it down on the
surface<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:12.030> clamps<00:01:12.720> down<00:01:12.840> quite<00:01:13.290> tightly

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
surface there clamps down quite tightly

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.609 
surface there clamps down quite tightly
so<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.689> creates<00:01:15.990> an<00:01:16.080> incredible

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so that it just creates an incredible

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.249 
so that it just creates an incredible
seal<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:18.090> adjustment<00:01:18.689> point<00:01:19.080> in

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
seal there is one adjustment point in

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.960 
seal there is one adjustment point in
the<00:01:19.380> back<00:01:19.590> hair<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.280> done<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the back hair and that's done with this

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
the back hair and that's done with this
knob<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.500> which<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.130> have

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
knob that's right here which I have

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.810 
knob that's right here which I have
really<00:01:23.820> tight<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.189> loosen<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.759> up

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
really tight so you can loosen this up

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.960 
really tight so you can loosen this up
and<00:01:27.270> then<00:01:27.330> move<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.650> swivel<00:01:29.369> head<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and then move the swivel head to

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.819 
and then move the swivel head to
whatever<00:01:30.240> position<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.650> going

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
whatever position you want that's going

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.380 
whatever position you want that's going
to<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.100> depend<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.579> how<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> place<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
to really depend on how you place the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.929 
to really depend on how you place the
mount<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.020> place<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> dashboard

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
mount if you place it on a dashboard

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
mount if you place it on a dashboard
like<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.420> you're<00:01:37.200> probably<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> swivel

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
like so you're probably going to swivel

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.460 
like so you're probably going to swivel
this<00:01:38.220> into<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> position<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.320> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
this into the position like that so that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
this into the position like that so that
the<00:01:40.560> gold<00:01:40.799> parts<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> bottom<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the gold parts on the bottom and the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.450 
the gold parts on the bottom and the
mount<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.140> facing<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.189> also

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
mount is kind of facing you you can also

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.149 
mount is kind of facing you you can also
swivel<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> another<00:01:45.780> way<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.560> may<00:01:46.829> as

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
swivel it another way because you may as

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
swivel it another way because you may as
I<00:01:47.850> might<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.329> places<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.140> your<00:01:49.259> windshield

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
I might do places on your windshield

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.130 
I might do places on your windshield
this<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.430> which<00:01:51.090> case<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.509> might<00:01:51.659> swivel

friction of your phone again I'm going

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.920 
friction of your phone again I'm going
to<00:02:35.400> hold<00:02:35.580> them<00:02:35.790> out<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.450> were<00:02:36.540> mounted

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
to hold them out as if it were mounted

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.650 
to hold them out as if it were mounted
you<00:02:37.350> press<00:02:37.740> up<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.520> clamp<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.120> release<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you press up on the clamp to release it

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.050 
you press up on the clamp to release it
and<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:40.290> lay<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.710> into<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.160> inner<00:02:41.310> one<00:02:41.700> like

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and then lay it into the inner one like

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.150 
and then lay it into the inner one like
so<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:42.870> once<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.830> have<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.070> adjusted

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
so and then once you have it adjusted

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.850 
so and then once you have it adjusted
just<00:02:44.580> let<00:02:44.970> go<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:45.900> quite<00:02:46.080> easy<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.440> put<00:02:46.710> it

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
just let go so it's quite easy to put it

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.610 
just let go so it's quite easy to put it
in<00:02:46.980> one<00:02:47.190> handed<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.330> course<00:02:48.720> rotate

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
in one handed you can of course rotate

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.860 
in one handed you can of course rotate
this<00:02:49.830> around<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.000> loosen<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.480> it'll<00:02:51.750> go

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
this around if you loosen this it'll go

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.960 
this around if you loosen this it'll go
a<00:02:51.900> little<00:02:52.080> bit<00:02:52.260> easier<00:02:52.410> but<00:02:53.250> most<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.760> time

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
a little bit easier but most of the time

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.010 
a little bit easier but most of the time
I<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:54.150> you're<00:02:54.390> probably<00:02:54.510> going<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> keep

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
I think you're probably going to keep

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.500 
I think you're probably going to keep
this<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.770> horizontal<00:02:56.580> position<00:02:57.300> like<00:02:57.480> so

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
this in the horizontal position like so

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.050 
this in the horizontal position like so
you<00:02:58.320> can<00:02:58.440> also<00:02:58.590> remove<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.220> with<00:02:59.430> one<00:02:59.610> hand<00:02:59.640> as

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
you can also remove it with one hand as

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
you can also remove it with one hand as
you<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.300> see<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:00.960> that<00:03:01.020> comes<00:03:01.860> out

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
you can see just like that comes out

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.890 
you can see just like that comes out
quite<00:03:02.280> easily<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.670> when<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.510> comes<00:03:03.630> time<00:03:03.780> to

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
quite easily so when it comes time to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.660 
quite easily so when it comes time to
place<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.620> out<00:03:04.680> again<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.160> just<00:03:05.190> push

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
place it in and out again you just push

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.390 
place it in and out again you just push
up<00:03:05.940> on<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.240> clamp<00:03:06.660> like<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:08.040> align

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
up on the clamp like so and then align

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.670 
up on the clamp like so and then align
it<00:03:08.580> together<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.150> you're<00:03:09.690> good<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.050> go<00:03:10.170> and

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
it together and you're good to go and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.980 
it together and you're good to go and
the<00:03:11.160> same<00:03:11.340> thing<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.610> remove<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.240> one-handed

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
the same thing to remove it one-handed

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.780 
the same thing to remove it one-handed
it<00:03:13.290> does<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.650> these<00:03:13.830> rubberized<00:03:14.340> grips

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
it does have these rubberized grips

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.790 
it does have these rubberized grips
inside<00:03:15.240> which<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.630> can<00:03:15.780> see<00:03:15.810> right<00:03:16.020> here<00:03:16.620> that

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
inside which you can see right here that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.949 
inside which you can see right here that
will<00:03:17.340> protect<00:03:17.520> your<00:03:17.880> phone<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.450> don't<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:18.930> a

case on this particular iphone 5 but
this<00:03:20.940> will<00:03:21.150> work<00:03:21.300> fine<00:03:21.570> with<00:03:21.750> cases<00:03:22.230> it'll

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
this will work fine with cases it'll

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.620 
this will work fine with cases it'll
also<00:03:23.010> work<00:03:23.340> with<00:03:23.490> larger<00:03:23.850> phones<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.420> the
