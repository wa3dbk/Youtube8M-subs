00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
change direction quickly not quite as

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.790 
change direction quickly not quite as
fast<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.050> other<00:01:20.170> one<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:20.560> when<00:01:20.710> you

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
fast and the other one is when you

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800 
fast and the other one is when you
really<00:01:20.950> town<00:01:21.310> with<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:21.940> outside<00:01:22.479> edge<00:01:22.659> of

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
really town with the outside edge of

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.570 
really town with the outside edge of
this<00:01:22.900> in<00:01:23.080> as<00:01:23.229> this<00:01:23.560> back<00:01:23.770> foot<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.220> want<00:01:24.520> to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
this in as this back foot you want to

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.690 
this in as this back foot you want to
change<00:01:24.729> directions<00:01:25.030> really<00:01:25.330> quickly<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:27.670> of

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
change directions really quickly one of

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.039 
change directions really quickly one of
the<00:01:27.760> main<00:01:27.909> problems<00:01:28.299> that<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.450> see<00:01:28.479> with<00:01:28.840> newer

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
the main problems that I see with newer

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.719 
the main problems that I see with newer
hockey<00:01:29.320> players<00:01:29.650> is<00:01:29.920> what<00:01:30.070> I<00:01:30.100> call<00:01:30.310> spinning

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
hockey players is what I call spinning

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.550 
hockey players is what I call spinning
your<00:01:30.850> tires<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.990> always<00:01:32.229> see<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.470> when

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
your tires you always see it when

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.810 
your tires you always see it when
they're<00:01:32.680> trying<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:32.890> accelerate<00:01:33.340> their<00:01:33.640> feet

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
they're trying to accelerate their feet

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.219 
they're trying to accelerate their feet
are<00:01:33.970> going<00:01:34.090> really<00:01:34.299> fast<00:01:34.600> but<00:01:35.049> they're<00:01:35.170> not

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
are going really fast but they're not

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.690 
are going really fast but they're not
actually<00:01:35.380> going<00:01:35.650> anywhere<00:01:36.040> so<00:01:36.370> if<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.520> take<00:01:36.670> a

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
actually going anywhere so if you take a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.250 
actually going anywhere so if you take a
look<00:01:36.850> at<00:01:37.000> my<00:01:37.060> skates<00:01:37.390> show<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.049> what<00:01:38.200> I'm

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
look at my skates show you what I'm

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.880 
look at my skates show you what I'm
talking<00:01:38.560> about

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
talking about

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.649 
talking about
basically<00:01:39.640> you're<00:01:39.909> not<00:01:39.940> using<00:01:40.210> your<00:01:40.420> edges

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
basically you're not using your edges

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.330 
basically you're not using your edges
you're<00:01:40.930> trying<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.229> skate<00:01:41.530> you're<00:01:42.100> basically

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
you're trying to skate you're basically

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.399 
you're trying to skate you're basically
running<00:01:42.580> on<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.360> ice<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:44.049> in<00:01:44.110> this<00:01:44.200> situation

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
running on the ice so in this situation

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.080 
running on the ice so in this situation
your<00:01:44.890> feet<00:01:45.070> are<00:01:45.159> moving<00:01:45.400> fast<00:01:45.640> but<00:01:45.909> you're<00:01:46.000> not

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
your feet are moving fast but you're not

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.210 
your feet are moving fast but you're not
using<00:01:46.270> edges<00:01:46.750> what<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.229> want<00:01:47.409> to<00:01:47.470> do<00:01:47.590> turn

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
using edges what you want to do turn

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.859 
using edges what you want to do turn
your<00:01:48.400> feet<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:48.880> can<00:01:49.030> dig<00:01:49.240> in<00:01:49.360> those<00:01:49.510> edges

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
your feet so you can dig in those edges

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.210 
your feet so you can dig in those edges
and<00:01:49.900> use<00:01:50.140> them<00:01:50.290> to<00:01:50.380> help<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.590> accelerate<00:01:50.890> now

and use them to help you accelerate now

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.890 
and use them to help you accelerate now
one<00:01:51.670> push<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.240> going<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.420> get<00:01:52.570> me<00:01:52.720> going

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
one push is going to get me going

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.500 
one push is going to get me going
alright<00:01:53.619> now<00:01:54.220> as<00:01:54.400> I<00:01:54.580> keep<00:01:54.729> going<00:01:54.939> I'm<00:01:55.270> going<00:01:55.450> to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
alright now as I keep going I'm going to

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.450 
alright now as I keep going I'm going to
push<00:01:55.659> behind<00:01:56.049> me<00:01:56.260> and<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.950> want<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.159> keep<00:01:57.310> on

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
push behind me and you want to keep on

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.130 
push behind me and you want to keep on
always<00:01:57.729> using<00:01:58.150> your<00:01:58.180> edges<00:01:58.540> as<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:58.720> get<00:01:58.960> more

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
always using your edges as you get more

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.510 
always using your edges as you get more
speed<00:01:59.439> you're<00:01:59.680> going<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.860> push<00:02:00.010> up<00:02:00.159> more<00:02:00.430> to

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
speed you're going to push up more to

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.219 
speed you're going to push up more to
the<00:02:00.610> sides<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.299> can<00:02:01.630> think<00:02:01.750> about<00:02:01.840> using<00:02:02.049> your

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
the sides you can think about using your

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.810 
the sides you can think about using your
edges<00:02:02.530> when<00:02:02.680> you're<00:02:02.770> accelerating<00:02:02.979> as<00:02:03.460> kind

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
edges when you're accelerating as kind

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.219 
edges when you're accelerating as kind
of<00:02:03.850> like<00:02:04.000> gears<00:02:04.210> on<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.420> bicycle<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:05.140> you're

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
of like gears on a bicycle so you're

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.600 
of like gears on a bicycle so you're
going<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.380> start<00:02:05.650> by<00:02:05.680> pushing<00:02:06.130> more<00:02:06.280> behind

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
going to start by pushing more behind

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.249 
going to start by pushing more behind
you<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.970> want<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.210> turn<00:02:07.330> your<00:02:07.450> feet<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:07.869> as

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
you you want to turn your feet and as

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.869 
you you want to turn your feet and as
you<00:02:08.470> get<00:02:08.619> more<00:02:08.649> speed<00:02:09.099> you're<00:02:09.459> pushing<00:02:09.700> more

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
you get more speed you're pushing more

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.550 
you get more speed you're pushing more
and<00:02:10.119> more<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.689> the<00:02:10.780> side<00:02:10.989> when<00:02:11.200> you're<00:02:11.290> at<00:02:11.379> full

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
and more to the side when you're at full

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.559 
and more to the side when you're at full
speed<00:02:11.830> you're<00:02:12.189> almost<00:02:12.310> pushing<00:02:12.610> directly<00:02:13.239> to

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
speed you're almost pushing directly to

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.970 
speed you're almost pushing directly to
the<00:02:13.689> side<00:02:13.930> that's<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.439> to<00:02:14.560> keep<00:02:14.739> you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
the side that's going to keep you

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.399 
the side that's going to keep you
increasing<00:02:15.760> in<00:02:15.879> speed<00:02:16.000> as<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:16.299> go<00:02:16.480> another

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
increasing in speed as you go another

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.659 
increasing in speed as you go another
problem<00:02:17.769> some<00:02:17.919> hockey<00:02:18.129> players<00:02:18.340> might<00:02:18.489> have

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:18.669 
problem some hockey players might have

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:19.769 
problem some hockey players might have
when<00:02:18.819> they're<00:02:18.939> skating<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.389> your<00:02:19.510> edges

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:19.779 
when they're skating is your edges

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.119 
when they're skating is your edges
working<00:02:20.109> against<00:02:20.409> them<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:20.950> when<00:02:21.040> you're

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
working against them so when you're

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.370 
working against them so when you're
skating<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.579> have<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.969> glide<00:02:22.389> leg<00:02:22.629> and<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.900> push

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
skating you have a glide leg and a push

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.840 
skating you have a glide leg and a push
so<00:02:23.770> this<00:02:23.890> push<00:02:24.100> leg<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.490> should<00:02:24.520> be<00:02:24.670> using

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
so this push leg you should be using

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.670 
so this push leg you should be using
your<00:02:24.970> edges<00:02:25.360> but<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.840> should<00:02:26.050> not<00:02:26.230> be<00:02:26.380> using

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
your edges but you should not be using

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.140 
your edges but you should not be using
your<00:02:26.770> edges<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.160> your<00:02:27.400> glide<00:02:27.610> leg<00:02:27.820> I'll<00:02:28.000> show

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
your edges on your glide leg I'll show

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.240 
your edges on your glide leg I'll show
you<00:02:28.210> what<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.360> mean<00:02:28.540> if<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.050> push<00:02:29.320> here<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.040> want

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
you what I mean if I push here you want

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.730 
you what I mean if I push here you want
this<00:02:30.460> foot<00:02:30.700> pointed<00:02:31.300> directly<00:02:31.480> forwards<00:02:32.380> so

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
this foot pointed directly forwards so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.410 
this foot pointed directly forwards so
that<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:32.980> can<00:02:33.100> get<00:02:33.220> maximum<00:02:33.670> glide<00:02:34.000> off<00:02:34.210> it

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
that you can get maximum glide off it

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.420 
that you can get maximum glide off it
then<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.840> recover<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.680> push<00:02:35.890> with<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.220> leg

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
then I recover and I push with this leg

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.550 
then I recover and I push with this leg
and<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.210> one<00:02:37.420> pointing<00:02:37.780> forward<00:02:38.110> but

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
and have this one pointing forward but

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.250 
and have this one pointing forward but
some<00:02:38.770> skaters<00:02:39.190> push<00:02:39.970> here<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.810> leg<00:02:41.050> goes

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
some skaters push here and this leg goes

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.990 
some skaters push here and this leg goes
at<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.560> side<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.070> they<00:02:42.340> push<00:02:42.550> here<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:42.910> this

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
at the side and they push here and this

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.030 
at the side and they push here and this
leg<00:02:43.180> goes<00:02:43.390> out<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.750> side<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.530> their<00:02:44.680> edges

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
leg goes out to the side so their edges

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.070 
leg goes out to the side so their edges
are<00:02:45.160> actually<00:02:45.280> working<00:02:45.880> against<00:02:46.450> them<00:02:46.600> when

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
are actually working against them when

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.960 
are actually working against them when
they're<00:02:47.260> pushing<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.950> they're<00:02:48.430> not<00:02:48.520> going<00:02:48.790> in

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
they're pushing and they're not going in

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.640 
they're pushing and they're not going in
a<00:02:49.030> perfectly<00:02:49.360> straight<00:02:49.480> line<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.230> work<00:02:50.440> on

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
a perfectly straight line so work on

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.860 
a perfectly straight line so work on
always<00:02:51.010> having<00:02:51.460> this<00:02:51.850> foot<00:02:52.150> your<00:02:52.450> glide<00:02:52.660> leg

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
always having this foot your glide leg

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.480 
always having this foot your glide leg
pointing<00:02:53.200> straight<00:02:53.470> forwards<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:53.980> not<00:02:54.310> off

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
pointing straight forwards and not off

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.010 
pointing straight forwards and not off
to<00:02:54.520> an<00:02:54.760> angle<00:02:55.060> others<00:02:55.450> are<00:02:55.570> doing<00:02:55.630> more<00:02:55.900> work

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
to an angle others are doing more work

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.690 
to an angle others are doing more work
than<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.620> now<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:57.100> guys<00:02:57.310> know<00:02:57.490> more

than you have to now you guys know more
about<00:02:57.790> your<00:02:58.060> edges<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.390> how<00:02:58.540> you're<00:02:58.660> going<00:02:58.750> to

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
about your edges and how you're going to

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.940 
about your edges and how you're going to
be<00:02:58.930> using<00:02:59.080> them<00:02:59.350> I'm<00:02:59.560> going<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.740> give<00:02:59.830> you<00:02:59.890> a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
few drills that you can use to help

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.210 
few drills that you can use to help
improve<00:03:01.720> your<00:03:01.810> control<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.560> your<00:03:02.650> edges<00:03:02.950> first

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
improve your control of your edges first

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.070 
improve your control of your edges first
drill<00:03:03.490> is<00:03:03.520> a<00:03:03.640> figure<00:03:03.970> 8<00:03:04.090> drills<00:03:04.360> this<00:03:04.600> is<00:03:04.810> good

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
drill is a figure 8 drills this is good

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.480 
drill is a figure 8 drills this is good
to<00:03:05.200> use<00:03:05.350> if<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.560> only<00:03:05.710> have<00:03:05.830> a<00:03:05.890> small<00:03:06.010> portion

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
to use if you only have a small portion

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.590 
to use if you only have a small portion
of<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.610> ice<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.030> want<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.240> work<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.450> your

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
of the ice and you want to work on your

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.420 
of the ice and you want to work on your
edges<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.410> what<00:03:08.530> you're<00:03:08.620> doing<00:03:08.770> is<00:03:08.890> only<00:03:09.040> using

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
edges so what you're doing is only using

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.160 
edges so what you're doing is only using
one<00:03:09.610> skate<00:03:10.000> at<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.210> time<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.660> only<00:03:10.900> using

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
one skate at a time and only using

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.140 
one skate at a time and only using
inside<00:03:11.650> edge<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.190> skate<00:03:12.550> so<00:03:13.030> you're

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
inside edge of that skate so you're

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.450 
inside edge of that skate so you're
leaning<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.690> inside<00:03:14.280> holding<00:03:15.280> that

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
leaning to the inside holding that

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.580 
leaning to the inside holding that
inside<00:03:16.030> edge<00:03:16.300> of<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.720> skate<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.200> then<00:03:17.380> once

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
inside edge of that skate and then once

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.650 
inside edge of that skate and then once
you<00:03:17.800> complete<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.310> loop<00:03:18.580> then<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:18.910> push<00:03:19.210> and<00:03:19.480> go

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
you complete a loop then you push and go

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.210 
you complete a loop then you push and go
in<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.380> other<00:03:20.470> direction<00:03:20.620> doing<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.070> figure

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
in the other direction doing a figure

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.800 
in the other direction doing a figure
eight<00:03:21.400> there's<00:03:21.940> another<00:03:22.180> figure<00:03:22.510> eight<00:03:22.630> drill

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
eight there's another figure eight drill

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.360 
eight there's another figure eight drill
except<00:03:23.080> you're<00:03:23.200> only<00:03:23.290> using<00:03:23.410> outside<00:03:24.130> edge

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
except you're only using outside edge

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.830 
except you're only using outside edge
you<00:03:24.610> can<00:03:24.700> see<00:03:24.790> I'm<00:03:24.940> leaning<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.300> my<00:03:25.390> outside

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
you can see I'm leaning to my outside

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.770 
you can see I'm leaning to my outside
and<00:03:26.080> this<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.160> more<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.460> crossover<00:03:28.210> so<00:03:28.390> try

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
and this is more of a crossover so try

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.330 
and this is more of a crossover so try
to<00:03:28.810> keep<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.260> good<00:03:29.500> knee<00:03:29.650> bend<00:03:29.680> in<00:03:29.980> both<00:03:30.130> of

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
to keep a good knee bend in both of

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.160 
to keep a good knee bend in both of
these<00:03:30.460> just<00:03:31.300> at<00:03:31.450> least<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.750> little<00:03:31.840> bit<00:03:31.990> of<00:03:32.110> a

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
these just at least a little bit of a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.110 
these just at least a little bit of a
knee<00:03:32.290> bend<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.830> get<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.130> power<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.700> continue

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
knee bend to get that power and continue

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.000 
knee bend to get that power and continue
that<00:03:34.240> motion<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.810> momentum<00:03:35.590> as<00:03:35.740> you<00:03:35.800> go

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
that motion and momentum as you go

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.040 
that motion and momentum as you go
around<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.400> figure<00:03:36.670> eight<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:37.810> one

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
around in the figure eight so this one

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.720 
around in the figure eight so this one
is<00:03:38.290> similar<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.130> figure<00:03:39.370> eight<00:03:39.460> except

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
is similar to the figure eight except

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.520 
is similar to the figure eight except
you're<00:03:39.820> going<00:03:40.000> down<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.420> ice<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:41.050> in<00:03:41.170> this<00:03:41.260> one

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
you're going down the ice so in this one

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.250 
you're going down the ice so in this one
I'm<00:03:41.800> only<00:03:41.860> using<00:03:42.340> one<00:03:42.670> leg<00:03:42.810> keeping<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:44.050> good

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
I'm only using one leg keeping a good

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.410 
I'm only using one leg keeping a good
knee<00:03:44.410> bend<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.250> can<00:03:45.400> get<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.550> push<00:03:45.880> each<00:03:46.120> time

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
knee bend so I can get a push each time

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.960 
knee bend so I can get a push each time
and<00:03:46.690> only<00:03:47.590> using<00:03:47.860> my<00:03:47.950> inside<00:03:48.460> edge<00:03:48.670> and

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
and only using my inside edge and

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.670 
and only using my inside edge and
eventually<00:03:49.750> we<00:03:49.810> want<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.050> be<00:03:50.110> able<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.260> do<00:03:50.410> is

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
eventually we want to be able to do is

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.650 
eventually we want to be able to do is
push<00:03:51.370> hold<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.820> edge<00:03:51.910> until<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.300> see<00:03:52.450> one

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
push hold the edge until you see one

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.270 
push hold the edge until you see one
side<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:52.990> board's<00:03:53.290> then<00:03:53.470> push<00:03:53.710> hold<00:03:54.160> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
side of the board's then push hold the
