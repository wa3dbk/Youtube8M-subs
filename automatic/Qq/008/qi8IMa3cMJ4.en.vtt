00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 for today for how do we do 

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.500
 how to make mini pizzas hands 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.420
 then be reduced to your tomatoes just to 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.889
 get a little soft dough 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.539
 it's the tomato cream it's really 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.880
 income to make mini pizzas 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.410
 it's very simple take some dough 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.480
 puff that you buy in 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.150
 trade you do yourself lying down 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.619
 the finely enough then with a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.189
 cookie cutter me I use them a 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.809
 little glass so that's really 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.030
 mini infopath it's things of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.399
 big otherwise it's called more destitute and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.780
 cut pieces so obviously 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.770
 when we left the dough we 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.590
 lets rest a little bit for 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.039
 avoid that when we cut small 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.910
 the little circles that they shrink 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.460
 for laying on a sheet next to 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.370
 so I make you a little 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.160
 dozens story to make you see 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:05.300
 how do I do I have after the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.300
 principle is the same each time 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.750
 we discover the little sailboats at that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.310
 done according to a bit like it was a 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.119
 host for those going to Mass 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.619
 we will see it is not very thick but 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.970
 like those of the flipping then 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.220
 obviously you can do that too 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.229
 with tears the bread dough then I 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.659
 like that so we can see better 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.939
 I do not like that I will put my father 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.009
 here for that dough 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.250
 all I like we can see that 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.490
 I'm doing it beforehand you 'll have 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.170
 cook your tomatoes then for the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.840
 tomato you can buy from 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.270
 tomato meat especially from the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.220
 tomato sauce already made commercially 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.720
 obviously it's better to do it yourself 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.479
 even to you have your tomatoes cut down 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.239
 you take off the skin and here you are 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.160
 get a tomato cream like that me 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.510
 I have salt and pepper lady starting I 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.860
 will not add any of our dishes to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.830
 the mini pizzas is useless it's 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.550
 really what you really SONATUR 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.530
 so 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.810
 with a spoon a spoon 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.250
 a little spoon as you want on 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.959
 just put a little tomatoes 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.680
 no need to put a lot 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.560
 Forgot wear mini if you put 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:48.500
 it's okay it's a risk of sinking 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:51.580
 after that it's really there is 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.580
 really nothing simpler 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.140
 we try to put in the middle so that 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.720
 the puffiness looks a little like the weaponry 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.100
 not too much and that it does something 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.050
 of generous here and then thereafter 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:21.290
 so that's me but you're not 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:25.750
 I have to add four seeds of thyme 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:29.320
 dried a little bit solid on the top 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.320
 story of giving taste 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.650
 and a small bowl is also if you 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.330
 want to put something else 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.800
 free to you you can very well 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.630
 master of the kind others without me I have 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.550
 afraid because hbo I consider that 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.720
 it's not pizzas so typical case everything 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.410
 the world does not like that so there at least 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.790
 there is that tomato some herbs on 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:03.150
 is sure everyone will appreciate 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:03.660
 here and at the finish that we finish but 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.140
 cheese 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:12.650
 I 'm going skull I had the greenhouses more 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.650
 away then grated cheese to the classic 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.150
 and art comes from supposed 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:28.890
 quietly smoking a front bang 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:34.020
 leave a lot either here is there will be 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:37.970
 more than a veto in the oven at 200 Â° seven-eight 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:42.540
 when the cheese is melted 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:45.660
 almost a little bit a brilliant guy a 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.280
 little golden you can never go out 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.830
 few minutes it's really very 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.740
 very inconvenient so I have crazy mother and 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.330
 I show you the result 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.740
 so you can to feel it's 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.740
 really easy to do 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.600
 And here's the result 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:09.030
 once cooked as you can 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.229
 see it's fine enough it's eaten 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.570
 butcher rice and I guarantee you this is 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:19.880
 delicious soon on how do we do 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.880
 and especially good appetite
