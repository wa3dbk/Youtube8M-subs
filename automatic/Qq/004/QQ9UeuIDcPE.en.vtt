00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.320
 Rock climbers are very mobile people. 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.560
 We claim the right 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.400
 to get in the car every weekend and drive to the mountains. 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 And certainly here, in the Dolomites, when you drive over the mountain passes ... 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.360
 Safety is of vital importance. 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.040
 Aesthetics is very important to me. It adds something to me. 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.400
 See the Drei Phrases, those rugged rocks, 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.480
 when the clouds drift slowly over the mountains as the sun sets ... 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.840
 Those are moments that really touch you, deep in your soul. 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.680
 Precision in the planning phase ... 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.440
 ... is crucial, I would say. 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.840
 You can make all kinds of mistakes in the planning phase, 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.640
 which you will regret later. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.400
 You can forget things. Such as special equipment. 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.760
 It is certainly possible that a company will fail. 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.800
 The project can therefore only be as good as the planning. 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.480
 During such heavy expeditions 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.320
 sometimes you get to a point where you have to continue, 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760
 because otherwise you won't come home. 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.400
 And then your strength and will are 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.680
 to really persevere. 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.760
 I have been climbing for more than 35 years 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.040
 and then just let your body climb. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.920
 You don't have to think anymore 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.960
 about every step and every grip. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.480
 You climb in a flow. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.080
 It becomes one smooth movement, 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.120
 only interrupted if you hang the rope in the fuses. 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.760
 Shit! 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.360
 You often miss out. 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.920
 In the beginning, at an altitude of 500 or 600 meters 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.800
 then breathe. 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.200
 But after a few days you get used to it. 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.440
 If you fall then you know that nothing can happen to you. 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.400
 The rope is mega strong, the hooks are stuck, 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.720
 you can't touch anything, so what do you worry about? 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.880
 As soon as I can get out and on the way, 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.040
 I feel enormously happy and privileged that I 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.880
 experience such moments. 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.040
 In fact, we pursue these kinds of moments. 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.120
 That is an enrichment of life.
