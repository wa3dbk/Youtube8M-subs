00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.810 

and<00:00:16.150> then<00:00:16.689> the<00:00:17.529> small<00:00:17.830> clip<00:00:18.189> here<00:00:18.430> on<00:00:18.580> the<00:00:18.669> end

and then the small clip here on the end

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.550 
and then the small clip here on the end
of<00:00:18.939> the<00:00:19.029> roller<00:00:19.240> arm<00:00:19.540> needs<00:00:19.779> to<00:00:19.990> be<00:00:20.110> reversed

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
of the roller arm needs to be reversed

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.200 
of the roller arm needs to be reversed
because<00:00:20.919> it<00:00:21.250> would<00:00:21.400> be<00:00:21.580> in<00:00:21.730> the<00:00:21.849> ingoing

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
because it would be in the ingoing

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.509 
because it would be in the ingoing
position<00:00:22.810> when<00:00:22.960> you<00:00:23.050> left<00:00:23.260> it<00:00:23.439> there<00:00:23.519> that

position when you left it there that

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:38.910 
position when you left it there that
allows<00:00:24.820> us<00:00:24.850> now<00:00:25.590> pull<00:00:26.590> it<00:00:26.619> out<00:00:26.859> slightly<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
allows us now pull it out slightly and

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:58.990 
allows us now pull it out slightly and
then<00:00:39.100> proceed<00:00:39.520> to<00:00:39.550> pull<00:00:39.850> down<00:00:39.969> running<00:00:40.239> out

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.050

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
left it in that position but it would

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.850 
left it in that position but it would
have<00:02:54.480> meant<00:02:54.629> there<00:02:54.870> was<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.019> arm<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> way<00:02:55.800> so
