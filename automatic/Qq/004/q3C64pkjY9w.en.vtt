00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.430 
uses about two dollars two dollars and
change<00:03:08.730> for<00:03:09.090> electricity<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.200> crock-pot

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
change for electricity in the crock-pot

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.280 
change for electricity in the crock-pot
not<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> big<00:03:11.640> deal<00:03:11.820> especially<00:03:12.030> if<00:03:12.630> it's<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.080> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
not a big deal especially if it's in the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:22.660 
not a big deal especially if it's in the
winter<00:03:13.650> where<00:03:14.220> you're<00:03:14.459> already<00:03:14.700> warming<00:03:15.420> up

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.100 

they<00:03:23.670> came<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.850> little<00:03:24.180> moist<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.780> wonder<00:03:25.020> if

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
they came a little moist I wonder if

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.350 
they came a little moist I wonder if
they're<00:03:25.260> going<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.440> dry<00:03:25.710> out<00:03:25.820> maybe<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.030> idea

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
they're going to dry out maybe the idea

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.820 
they're going to dry out maybe the idea
of<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.750> better<00:03:27.900> idea<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:31.380> put<00:03:31.590> them<00:03:31.740> in

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
of the better idea is to to put them in

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.360 
of the better idea is to to put them in
the<00:03:31.920> crock-pot<00:03:32.270> without<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.480> nylon<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:35.100> have

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the crock-pot without the nylon and have

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.890 
the crock-pot without the nylon and have
them<00:03:35.610> dry<00:03:35.910> out<00:03:38.150> but<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.270> reason<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.690> actually

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
them dry out but the reason I actually

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.260 
them dry out but the reason I actually
put<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.410> nylon<00:03:41.960> was<00:03:42.960> so<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.940> doesn't

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
put the nylon was so that it doesn't

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.790 
put the nylon was so that it doesn't
stick<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.630> my<00:03:45.810> house<00:03:45.990> because<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.770> really

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
stick on my house because it really

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.400 
stick on my house because it really
visit<00:03:49.800> this<00:03:50.670> thing<00:03:50.910> really<00:03:51.330> really<00:03:51.570> started

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
visit this thing really really started

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.580 
visit this thing really really started
smelling<00:03:52.710> at<00:03:53.010> some<00:03:53.220> point<00:03:54.050> but<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.110> think<00:03:55.290> I'm

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
smelling at some point but I think I'm

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.550 
smelling at some point but I think I'm
going<00:03:55.710> to<00:03:55.800> let<00:03:55.980> them<00:03:56.160> dry<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.550> little<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:58.290> yeah

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
going to let them dry a little but yeah

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.420 
going to let them dry a little but yeah
this<00:03:58.830> does<00:03:59.220> taste<00:03:59.580> like<00:04:00.950> black<00:04:01.950> garlic<00:04:04.400> but<00:04:05.400> I

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
this does taste like black garlic but I

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.120 
this does taste like black garlic but I
think<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.550> reason<00:04:08.730> it's<00:04:09.240> also<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:10.650> liquidy

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
think the reason it's also this liquidy

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.840 
think the reason it's also this liquidy
is<00:04:11.220> because<00:04:11.550> it's<00:04:11.700> warm<00:04:12.860> alright<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.250> let's

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
is because it's warm alright so let's

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.500 
is because it's warm alright so let's
try<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.180> again<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:16.530> basically<00:04:17.489> took<00:04:18.209> another

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
try it again I I basically took another

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.680 
try it again I I basically took another
clove<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:21.049> decided<00:04:22.049> also<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:23.040> have<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:24.390> wipe

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
clove and I decided also to have to wipe

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.800 
clove and I decided also to have to wipe
the<00:04:25.040> condensation<00:04:26.040> that<00:04:26.990> comes<00:04:27.990> off<00:04:28.260> the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
the condensation that comes off the

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.620 
the condensation that comes off the
crock-pot<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.320> then<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:32.550> bulb<00:04:32.910> has<00:04:33.180> been

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
crock-pot and then this bulb has been

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.500 
crock-pot and then this bulb has been
sitting<00:04:33.870> in<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.230> fridge<00:04:34.470> for<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.860> past<00:04:35.510> 24

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
sitting in the fridge for the past 24

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.200 
sitting in the fridge for the past 24
hours<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:37.380> I'm<00:04:37.470> hoping<00:04:38.040> that<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.430> kind<00:04:38.760> of<00:04:38.880> got

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
hours so I'm hoping that it kind of got

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.780 
hours so I'm hoping that it kind of got
a<00:04:39.480> little<00:04:39.870> harder<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:40.860> not<00:04:41.040> mushy<00:04:41.250> so<00:04:41.610> let's

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
a little harder and not mushy so let's

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:52.730 
a little harder and not mushy so let's
let's<00:04:42.090> take<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.360> look

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.290 

look<00:04:53.740> at<00:04:53.889> this<00:04:54.840> this<00:04:55.840> looks<00:04:56.050> way<00:04:56.500> way<00:04:57.010> way<00:04:57.580> less

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
look at this this looks way way way less

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:12.450 
look at this this looks way way way less
mushy<00:04:58.780> than<00:04:59.169> what<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.830> other<00:05:00.130> one

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:22.750 

so<00:05:13.460> here<00:05:13.729> we<00:05:13.880> have<00:05:15.040> one<00:05:19.900> garlic<00:05:20.900> clove<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.860> I

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
so here we have one garlic clove that I

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:34.510 
so here we have one garlic clove that I
was<00:05:23.090> able<00:05:23.419> to<00:05:23.630> peel<00:05:28.870> and<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:32.750> is<00:05:33.020> in<00:05:33.199> fact<00:05:33.520> gooey

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
was able to peel and it is in fact gooey

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.320 
was able to peel and it is in fact gooey
just<00:05:35.419> like<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:36.020> one<00:05:36.169> I<00:05:36.199> bought<00:05:38.740> yes<00:05:39.740> so<00:05:40.490> that's

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
just like the one I bought yes so that's

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.060 
just like the one I bought yes so that's
the<00:05:41.570> trick<00:05:41.810> if<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.050> want<00:05:42.789> the<00:05:45.039> consistency<00:05:46.039> of

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
the trick if you want the consistency of

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.820 
the trick if you want the consistency of
the<00:05:46.910> bought<00:05:47.120> stuff<00:05:47.539> basically<00:05:48.320> have<00:05:48.650> to

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
the bought stuff basically have to

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.430 
the bought stuff basically have to
dehydrate<00:05:49.490> them<00:05:49.699> a<00:05:49.760> little<00:05:50.240> and<00:05:50.449> also<00:05:51.020> put

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
dehydrate them a little and also put

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.969 
dehydrate them a little and also put
them<00:05:51.620> in<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.830> fridge<00:05:52.010> refrigerator<00:05:55.449> well

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
them in the fridge refrigerator well

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:03.000 
them in the fridge refrigerator well
yeah

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.280 

this<00:06:03.550> is<00:06:03.700> exactly<00:06:04.510> like<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.900> ones<00:06:05.080> I<00:06:05.260> bought

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
this is exactly like the ones I bought

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.630 
this is exactly like the ones I bought
yeah<00:06:05.890> so<00:06:06.370> this<00:06:06.580> was<00:06:06.790> my<00:06:07.090> video<00:06:07.390> I<00:06:07.750> have<00:06:09.900> my

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
yeah so this was my video I have my

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.750 
yeah so this was my video I have my
black<00:06:12.640> art<00:06:12.910> garlic<00:06:13.630> making<00:06:14.110> machine

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
black art garlic making machine

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.660 
black art garlic making machine
concoction<00:06:15.760> and<00:06:16.620> I'm<00:06:17.620> going<00:06:17.860> to<00:06:17.890> post<00:06:18.100> down<00:06:18.370> in

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
concoction and I'm going to post down in

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.020 
concoction and I'm going to post down in
the<00:06:19.020> description<00:06:20.020> what<00:06:21.010> the<00:06:21.160> model<00:06:21.490> number<00:06:21.820> is

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
the description what the model number is

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.170 
the description what the model number is
of<00:06:22.390> the<00:06:23.260> thermostat<00:06:23.920> and<00:06:24.190> as<00:06:24.700> you<00:06:24.820> can<00:06:24.970> see

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
of the thermostat and as you can see

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.900 
of the thermostat and as you can see
when<00:06:25.360> the<00:06:25.480> temperature<00:06:25.960> drops<00:06:26.460> it<00:06:27.460> starts

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
when the temperature drops it starts

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.780 
when the temperature drops it starts
working<00:06:28.330> again<00:06:28.450> so<00:06:28.870> it<00:06:29.080> basically<00:06:29.790> fluctuates

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
working again so it basically fluctuates

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.690 
working again so it basically fluctuates
the<00:06:31.090> temperature<00:06:31.750> of<00:06:31.960> the<00:06:32.080> crock<00:06:32.290> pot<00:06:32.320> due<00:06:33.310> to

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
the temperature of the crock pot due to

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.130 
the temperature of the crock pot due to
stay<00:06:33.880> at<00:06:34.030> about<00:06:34.710> 140<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:35.850> 146<00:06:36.850> degrees<00:06:37.140> right

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
stay at about 140 to 146 degrees right

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.320 
stay at about 140 to 146 degrees right
now<00:06:38.320> it's<00:06:38.650> it<00:06:39.040> dipped<00:06:39.670> a<00:06:39.820> little<00:06:39.850> below

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
now it's it dipped a little below

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.260 
now it's it dipped a little below
because<00:06:40.600> I<00:06:40.810> took<00:06:40.990> it<00:06:41.200> out<00:06:41.410> of<00:06:41.470> the<00:06:42.270> electricity

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
because I took it out of the electricity

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.850 
because I took it out of the electricity
so<00:06:44.170> it<00:06:44.200> doesn't<00:06:44.680> have<00:06:44.830> the<00:06:45.930> history<00:06:46.930> of<00:06:47.410> how

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
so it doesn't have the history of how

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.490 
so it doesn't have the history of how
much<00:06:49.050> undershoot<00:06:50.050> and<00:06:50.080> overshoot<00:06:51.900> this<00:06:52.900> type

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
much undershoot and overshoot this type

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.700 
much undershoot and overshoot this type
of<00:06:53.680> heating<00:06:54.130> element<00:06:54.580> has<00:06:55.110> at<00:06:56.110> some<00:06:56.350> point<00:06:56.560> it

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
of heating element has at some point it

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.240 
of heating element has at some point it
will<00:06:56.940> stabilize<00:06:57.940> at<00:06:58.570> a<00:06:58.600> more<00:06:58.930> accurate

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
will stabilize at a more accurate

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.060 
will stabilize at a more accurate
temperature<00:07:00.870> all<00:07:01.870> right<00:07:01.990> so<00:07:02.410> what<00:07:02.710> if<00:07:02.890> you

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
temperature all right so what if you

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.640 
temperature all right so what if you
