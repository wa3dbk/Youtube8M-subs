00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.520
 good to all orgasmic guys we are 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.220
 here with the first blogghino of mine 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.480
 channel the first time I make videos 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.470
 with the video camera about sean canon 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.289
 550d and for whom we mean a little 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.710
 photography and nothing I decided to do 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.680
 this 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.199
 this blogghino because for the simple 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.150
 reason that there is something new in my channel 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.590
 that I will now make you show you to tell 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.739
 also something about the minutes of 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.610
 point of my channel what you 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.110
 I wanted to say first of all is the fact that 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.700
 unfortunately in this period 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 as I said I mentioned in 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.110
 some previous videos a little time euro 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.719
 to record videos because unfortunately 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.090
 with a little study now anyway in 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.550
 university time of partial for skins 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.910
 also exams shortly and above all 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.550
 because I just got a dog then 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.890
 I have to stand behind him a little and dry up 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.130
 let's say in the time that I used before 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.869
 to make videos and therefore they will come out 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.270
 definitely less video though now 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.000
 however we are entering towards December 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.369
 and in January there is still a stop 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.430
 I will have a break some time instead 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.659
 to make videos so don't worry 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:30.079
 another very important thing to say is 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:33.079
 now I'll show you right away 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.079
 the attack 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.880
 we mean a fantastic thing goes by 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.579
 pam pam pam 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.420
 this is the playstation 4 I found 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.549
 magically all ipercoop 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.460
 here you do not see for a case though 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.319
 anyway hd pvr 2 gaming edition I have 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.780
 taken from ebay 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:04.610
 the problem is what the problem is 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.670
 the problem is simply a non-oil one 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.840
 I saw that to record from ps 4 with 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.319
 the hd pvr is necessary the fundamentals 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.670
 an hdmi splitter you need for you not 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.140
 I still got it right though 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.720
 anyway, to register, I need this 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.910
 little object here that I don't have 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.160
 meanwhile, what I was scared I even got scared 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:37.180
 14 pearl play however we come back in 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:37.180
 Room obvious I told you that 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:49.700
 so let's continue the playstation 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:52.280
 here if any of you know ps4 and know how 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.319
 register or can advise you 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.440
 some gadget what ever happens 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:02.000
 split to record makes me great 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.709
 please because I need it precisely 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.150
 know how to register also 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.560
 I wanted to say something else but with a 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.410
 moron I forgot to 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.000
 sign up the lineup and I don't 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.519
 never 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.970
 and one thing I wanted to say is the channel 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:23.239
 how it will be structured from now on 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:26.870
 I don't think I will do that sometimes I will make videos 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.370
 with the fisker because we are there 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.480
 we have reached almost three thousand members 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.389
 facts 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.370
 I wanted to thank you for that too 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.430
 however, many are following me 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.959
 that is, many say and therefore in 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.480
 some videos maybe I will do as a face 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.420
 cannes 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.170
 I will not make videos with the festival for video 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.720
 which I will do in live commentaries as per 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.190
 example known poro to glory maybe if more 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.810
 come on let me tell you the live because 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.489
 however as you have seen the post 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.370
 he is not here in my room where he is 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.060
 computer of my crap but and in the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.379
 my father's room where she is everything 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.480
 so how will mine be structured? 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.690
 channel I will simply continue road to 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.970
 glory until a moment comes 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.209
 of nervous crisis that comes to me 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.750
 commit suicide because of various bullshit 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.870
 script of the game and then I will continue the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.250
 review the reviews as I did royce e 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.330
 now I'll go further I'll do 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.190
 probably that of totti iv as I was 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.610

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.789
 in the previous video in the review 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.510
 previous then I thought to do 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.789
 continue some scud builder and then of 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.080
 make a video that I won't tell you though 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:45.000
 however it will become very interesting 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:49.190
