 terms of quality each lot goes through 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.300
 inside the very garbage tests of this 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.980
 I think it's cool, but the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.079
 people are with a product the mother does not have 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.680
 dengue is happening for us to stop 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.619
 to think and not a daughter of five 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.060
 that the help comes as a tactic 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.759
 create a moment of milk that is the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.350
 that she was together with that 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.840

 And you're to be congratulated because when 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.729
 we do a survey we see 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.369
 that in brazil most of the people 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.380
 from childhood it is the adult phase 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.909
 city ​​in the area of milk that 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.840
 would need that milk is the main 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.909
 calcium source in nature we have 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.159
 several scientific studies showing the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.659
 importance of milk and today what is 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.520
 cool here in the market we think 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.219
 different types of milk for example 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.289
 taking the case of whole milk that 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.899
 my son is only sick since he is good 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.430
 We also have in the milk 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.440
 milk that has a reduction in 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.720
 fat and we also have the bass 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.150
 lactose for those people who have 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.370
 lactose intolerance and proportion of 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.220
 Chaos in all these is the same was 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.799
 chaos it does not change if they are in the 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.060
 We do not look at the people. 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.819
 trust the brand 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.380
 only that sometimes the fact on the label does 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.140
 with which we do not enjoy all the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.079
 13 of the product here in this packing people 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.390
 written here shake well and serve in the 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.420
 position indicated to the goal you've read 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.700
 This is what we put here because 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.950
 you act such a product you can 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.600
 make all the press in however 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.310
 We know you have three heavier and 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.470
 lighter then we have to type 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.950
 and shake a lot even so that people 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.420
 do on purpose forward 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.489
 we are bringing a slave 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.120
 multinational people imagine the products 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.370
 microsoft being four in the group not the people 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.440
 It's a big study to see. 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.599
 nutritional deficiency in Brazil this 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.690
 iron deficiency not only in 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.760
 children more in adult has a whole 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.709
 still provide the quantity 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.540
 for this child to have a 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.209
 development as possible and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.610
 accurate has changed its acute actually the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.160
 people give pitaco about why stay with 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.680
 shoes national super-important 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.849
 For me, we have added vitamins 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.940
 and vitaminized walk of faith because the 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.560
 iron it is important that the baby lived 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.049
 since Tuesday 14 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.209
 vitamin C is the important role for 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.579
 iron is absorbed better 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.739
 form the vitamin D it will help in the 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.980
 metabolism and vitamin is the 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.079
 main function is in the eyes of the 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.120
 hair and are nutrients that we 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.810
 sees that people do not consume the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.810
 adequate amount 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.490

 knowing already permanent in iron calcium and 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.650
 so we intended this more 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.560
 without forgetting such pain because wanting 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.299
 or not power is to bring the time of 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.640
 family the moment you have to find 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.250
 This is the moment that we care about. 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.500

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.690
 best taste you trust in the brand 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.400
 important but understood that this brand 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.140
 but even more important because people 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.140
 make the right choices 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.560
