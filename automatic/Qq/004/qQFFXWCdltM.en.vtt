00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
is a 65 inch display so a fairly nice

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.880 
is a 65 inch display so a fairly nice
size<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.090> go<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.600> awesome<00:00:37.110> resolution

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
size to go with that awesome resolution

size to go with that awesome resolution
but<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:38.910> bit<00:00:39.090> wider<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.629> box

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
but this is a little bit wider the box

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.750 
but this is a little bit wider the box
is<00:00:40.140> huge<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> reason<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
is huge and the reason for that is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.819 
is huge and the reason for that is
because<00:00:41.790> there<00:00:42.239> are<00:00:42.390> also<00:00:42.570> speakers<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.559> each

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
because there are also speakers on each

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.250 
because there are also speakers on each
side<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.730> display<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.480> these<00:00:46.050> speakers

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
side of the display and these speakers

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.660 
side of the display and these speakers
are<00:00:46.440> actually<00:00:46.739> pretty<00:00:46.920> good<00:00:47.219> you're<00:00:47.460> looking

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
are actually pretty good you're looking

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.000 
are actually pretty good you're looking
at<00:00:47.789> 65<00:00:48.539> watts<00:00:48.930> each<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.620> there's<00:00:49.739> even<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
at 65 watts each and there's even a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.590 
at 65 watts each and there's even a
little<00:00:50.160> sub<00:00:50.460> well<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.850> building<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.329> give<00:00:51.449> you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
little sub well for building to give you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.479 
little sub well for building to give you
a<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.899> bit<00:00:52.020> more<00:00:52.199> low<00:00:52.530> end<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:53.309> you'd

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
a little bit more low end then you'd

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.430 
a little bit more low end then you'd
expect<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.000> get<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.750> flat<00:00:55.020> panels

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
expect to get out of a flat panels

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.900 
expect to get out of a flat panels
built-in<00:00:55.949> audio<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
built-in audio so you can have that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
built-in audio so you can have that
minimal<00:00:57.449> look<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.410> thing<00:00:58.590> mounted<00:00:58.770> up

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
minimal look get this thing mounted up

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
minimal look get this thing mounted up
on<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.370> wall<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.609> not<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.510> such<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> need<00:01:01.230> to

on your wall and not have such a need to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.979 
on your wall and not have such a need to
go<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.609> aftermarket<00:01:03.420> audio

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
go out and get in aftermarket audio

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.420 
go out and get in aftermarket audio
solution<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.189> has<00:01:05.220> some

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
solution because this one has some

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.510 
solution because this one has some
decent<00:01:06.030> speakers<00:01:06.840> built<00:01:07.560> into<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.430> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
decent speakers built into it so as you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.670 
decent speakers built into it so as you
guys<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.790> tell<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> huge<00:01:10.020> box<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
guys can tell this is a huge box and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
guys can tell this is a huge box and
that<00:01:10.740> means<00:01:11.070> I've<00:01:11.549> got<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.030> slightly

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that means I've got into a slightly

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.359 
that means I've got into a slightly
different<00:01:12.720> style<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.439> unboxing<00:01:14.070> video<00:01:14.280> this

of<00:01:33.900> remotes<00:01:34.200> included<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> reason

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
of remotes included I think the reason

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
of remotes included I think the reason
for<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.689> little<00:01:36.840> bit

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
for that is one is just a little bit

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.210 
for that is one is just a little bit
more<00:01:37.140> minimal<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:37.979> bit<00:01:38.070> more

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
more minimal a little bit more

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
more minimal a little bit more
simplistic<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.180> smaller<00:01:39.600> whereas<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> other

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
simplistic and smaller whereas the other

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.740 
simplistic and smaller whereas the other
one<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:40.920> more<00:01:41.280> full-featured<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.479> something

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
one is more full-featured and something

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270

of<00:06:17.729> looked<00:06:17.969> maybe<00:06:18.330> even<00:06:18.569> a<00:06:18.689> little<00:06:18.839> bit<00:06:18.960> worse

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
of looked maybe even a little bit worse

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.800 
of looked maybe even a little bit worse
than<00:06:19.529> just<00:06:19.740> on<00:06:19.949> a<00:06:20.009> 1080p<00:06:20.729> display<00:06:21.300> probably

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
than just on a 1080p display probably

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.300 
than just on a 1080p display probably
because<00:06:22.080> of<00:06:22.110> all<00:06:22.349> that<00:06:22.379> conversion<00:06:22.979> that's

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
because of all that conversion that's

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.269 
because of all that conversion that's
happening<00:06:23.699> granted<00:06:24.629> we<00:06:24.810> are<00:06:25.199> sitting<00:06:25.680> only<00:06:26.250> a

happening granted we are sitting only a

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.339 
happening granted we are sitting only a

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
couple of feet from it so maybe I was

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:29.749 
couple of feet from it so maybe I was
being<00:06:28.379> you<00:06:28.919> know<00:06:29.039> a<00:06:29.069> little<00:06:29.250> bit<00:06:29.430> more

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
being you know a little bit more

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.879 
being you know a little bit more
critical<00:06:30.270> than<00:06:30.300> I<00:06:30.509> would<00:06:30.689> normally<00:06:30.719> be<00:06:31.319> but

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
critical than I would normally be but

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.800 
critical than I would normally be but
the<00:06:32.009> whole<00:06:32.159> intent<00:06:32.520> here<00:06:32.789> is<00:06:32.819> to<00:06:32.939> get<00:06:33.419> stuff

that's<00:06:34.020> going<00:06:34.259> to<00:06:34.379> eventually<00:06:34.740> support<00:06:35.189> 4k

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
that's going to eventually support 4k

that's going to eventually support 4k
resolution<00:06:37.110> and<00:06:37.289> then<00:06:37.469> you<00:06:37.649> can<00:06:37.830> really<00:06:38.250> start

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
resolution and then you can really start

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.879
