take<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> look<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> airlines<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.120> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
take a look all the airlines and the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
take a look all the airlines and the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
frame rails so they don't collect all

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810
