is changing colors is that the ends of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.910 
is changing colors is that the ends of
your<00:01:43.290> hair<00:01:43.740> whole<00:01:44.670> color<00:01:45.149> best<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.590> color

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
your hair whole color best if you color

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.639 
your hair whole color best if you color
your<00:01:47.040> hair<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.600> kind<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> hard<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.380> make

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
your hair so it's kind of hard to make

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.880 
your hair so it's kind of hard to make
senses<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.430> okay<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.119> don't<00:01:51.630> color<00:01:51.899> my<00:01:51.990> hair<00:01:52.200> but

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
senses in okay I don't color my hair but

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
senses in okay I don't color my hair but
the<00:01:53.040> ends<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.610> hair<00:01:53.640> look<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.390> little<00:01:54.509> bit

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the ends of my hair look a little bit

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.810 
the ends of my hair look a little bit
lighter<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.950> those<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.399> who<00:01:56.579> do

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
lighter and then for those of you who do

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.580 
lighter and then for those of you who do
color<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.390> hair<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:58.020> notice<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
color your hair you notice that the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.289 
color your hair you notice that the
color<00:01:58.799> seems<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.549> stay<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> ends<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.840> most

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
color seems to stay on the ends the most

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.750 
color seems to stay on the ends the most
the<00:02:01.659> reason<00:02:02.140> why<00:02:02.380> is<00:02:02.440> because<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.190> ends<00:02:03.549> of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
the reason why is because the ends of

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.750 
the reason why is because the ends of
your<00:02:03.790> hair<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.479> most<00:02:04.750> porous<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:06.100> if<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.580> are

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
your hair is most porous so if you are

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.370 
your hair is most porous so if you are
coloring<00:02:07.150> your<00:02:07.360> hair<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.780> will<00:02:07.900> notice<00:02:07.960> that

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
coloring your hair you will notice that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.350 
coloring your hair you will notice that
the<00:02:08.530> ends<00:02:08.950> always<00:02:09.100> take<00:02:09.670> best<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.119> color

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
the ends always take best to color

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.140 
the ends always take best to color
before<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:11.260> does<00:02:11.440> at<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.830> roots<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.760> reason

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
before it does at the roots the reason

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.660 
before it does at the roots the reason
why<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.360> because<00:02:13.630> as<00:02:14.380> your<00:02:14.680> hair<00:02:15.069> gets<00:02:15.310> older

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
why is because as your hair gets older

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.940 
why is because as your hair gets older
as<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.970> go<00:02:16.150> down<00:02:16.420> your<00:02:16.630> length<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.350> ends<00:02:17.800> are

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
as you go down your length the ends are

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.130 
as you go down your length the ends are
missing<00:02:18.370> some<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.730> its<00:02:18.880> scales<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.900> just

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
missing some of its scales this is just

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.800 
missing some of its scales this is just
natural<00:02:20.440> wear<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.130> tear<00:02:21.340> on<00:02:21.550> your<00:02:21.730> hair<00:02:22.030> over

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
natural wear and tear on your hair over

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.660 
natural wear and tear on your hair over
time<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.440> scales<00:02:23.739> on<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> outside<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:24.550> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
time the scales on the outside of the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.600 
time the scales on the outside of the
hair<00:02:24.880> will<00:02:25.120> either<00:02:25.270> break<00:02:25.660> off<00:02:25.870> or<00:02:26.260> not<00:02:26.890> be<00:02:27.280> as

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
hair will either break off or not be as

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.120 
hair will either break off or not be as
healthy<00:02:28.090> as<00:02:28.480> possible<00:02:28.630> because<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:30.010> an

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
healthy as possible because it's an

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.370 
healthy as possible because it's an
older<00:02:30.430> part<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.850> your<00:02:31.030> hair<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.989> when<00:02:32.230> you're

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
older part of your hair so when you're

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.410 
older part of your hair so when you're
coloring<00:02:32.620> your<00:02:33.010> hair<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.459> very<00:02:33.790> easy<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
coloring your hair is very easy to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.660 
coloring your hair is very easy to
deposit<00:02:34.720> color<00:02:35.200> into<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.680> because<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.550> don't

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
deposit color into it because you don't

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.280 
deposit color into it because you don't
have<00:02:36.880> these<00:02:37.030> scales<00:02:37.360> on<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.630> outside<00:02:38.019> of<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
have these scales on the outside of the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.410 
have these scales on the outside of the
hair<00:02:38.500> trapping<00:02:39.040> moisture<00:02:39.430> out<00:02:39.610> from<00:02:40.120> getting

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
hair trapping moisture out from getting

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.860 
hair trapping moisture out from getting
inside<00:02:40.769> also<00:02:41.769> if<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.850> don't<00:02:43.060> color<00:02:43.390> your<00:02:43.480> hair

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
inside also if you don't color your hair

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.050 
inside also if you don't color your hair
naturally<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.680> will<00:02:44.830> lose<00:02:45.100> color<00:02:45.489> because<00:02:45.910> it

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
naturally it will lose color because it

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.300 
naturally it will lose color because it
loses<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.510> pigment<00:02:47.110> as<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.410> hair<00:02:47.620> gets<00:02:47.830> older

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
loses the pigment as the hair gets older

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.880 
loses the pigment as the hair gets older
that's<00:02:48.910> why<00:02:49.120> as<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.600> even<00:02:49.840> get<00:02:49.989> older<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.590> age

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
that's why as you even get older in age

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.440 
that's why as you even get older in age
you<00:02:51.220> will<00:02:51.459> notice<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.880> your<00:02:52.000> hair<00:02:52.239> will<00:02:52.420> look

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
you will notice that your hair will look

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.320 
you will notice that your hair will look
white<00:02:52.989> or<00:02:53.410> black<00:02:53.680> or<00:02:54.010> even<00:02:54.430> shades<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.090> gray

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
white or black or even shades of gray

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.090 
white or black or even shades of gray
because<00:02:55.840> it's<00:02:56.200> starting<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.709> lose<00:02:56.890> that

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
because it's starting to lose that

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.030 
because it's starting to lose that
pigment<00:02:57.670> color<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:58.150> you've<00:02:58.330> always<00:02:58.600> had<00:02:59.290> so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
pigment color that you've always had so

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.740 
pigment color that you've always had so
that's<00:03:00.340> why<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.580> ends<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.060> your<00:03:01.090> hair<00:03:01.239> will

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
that's why the ends of your hair will

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.780 
that's why the ends of your hair will
naturally<00:03:02.050> look<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.620> different<00:03:02.800> color<00:03:03.220> because

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
naturally look a different color because

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.060 
naturally look a different color because
it's<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.450> oldest<00:03:04.750> part<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:05.019> your<00:03:05.080> hair<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.680> if

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
it's the oldest part of your hair and if

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.490 
it's the oldest part of your hair and if
you<00:03:06.220> color<00:03:06.519> your<00:03:06.760> hair<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.510> ends<00:03:07.930> hold<00:03:08.200> color

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
you color your hair the ends hold color

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.830 
you color your hair the ends hold color
best<00:03:08.920> rather<00:03:09.370> than<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.970> roots<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.480> your<00:03:10.540> hair

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
best rather than the roots of your hair

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.440 
best rather than the roots of your hair
the<00:03:11.709> third<00:03:12.010> reason<00:03:12.250> as<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.610> why<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.880> may<00:03:13.180> seem

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
the third reason as to why you may seem

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.569 
the third reason as to why you may seem
as<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:13.810> your<00:03:13.989> hair<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.410> changing<00:03:14.950> colors<00:03:15.310> is

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
as if your hair is changing colors is

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.600 
as if your hair is changing colors is
because<00:03:16.239> it's<00:03:16.480> just<00:03:16.660> pure<00:03:16.989> genetics

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
because it's just pure genetics

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.130 
because it's just pure genetics
sometimes<00:03:18.610> there's<00:03:19.269> things<00:03:19.480> with<00:03:19.750> my<00:03:19.900> hair

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
sometimes there's things with my hair

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.590 
sometimes there's things with my hair
that<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.500> don't<00:03:20.709> notice<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.340> think<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.030> was<00:03:22.239> maybe

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
that I don't notice I think it was maybe

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.140 
that I don't notice I think it was maybe

shades of colors when you were a kid
it's<00:03:43.989> kind<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.650> hard<00:03:44.859> to<00:03:44.950> find<00:03:45.280> someone<00:03:45.670> who

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
it's kind of hard to find someone who

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.180 
it's kind of hard to find someone who
has<00:03:46.090> all<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.630> their<00:03:46.810> hair<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.290> true<00:03:47.590> shade<00:03:47.950> of

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
has all of their hair the true shade of

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.340 
has all of their hair the true shade of
jet-black<00:03:48.570> but<00:03:49.570> you<00:03:49.720> will<00:03:49.870> see<00:03:50.109> different

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
jet-black but you will see different

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.560 
jet-black but you will see different
kind<00:03:50.829> of<00:03:50.920> shades<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.459> color<00:03:51.730> because<00:03:52.000> our<00:03:52.329> hair

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
kind of shades of color because our hair

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.210 
kind of shades of color because our hair
will<00:03:52.750> give<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:52.959> natural<00:03:53.470> highlight<00:03:53.769> and

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
will give a natural highlight and

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.030 
will give a natural highlight and
low-light<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:55.510> really<00:03:55.900> don't<00:03:56.230> worry<00:03:56.470> about<00:03:56.650> it

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
low-light so really don't worry about it

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.160 
low-light so really don't worry about it
if<00:03:57.190> this<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.609> why<00:03:57.790> because<00:03:58.239> it's<00:03:58.480> just<00:03:58.690> purely

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
if this is why because it's just purely

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.550 
if this is why because it's just purely
genetics<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.970> my<00:04:01.209> last<00:04:01.540> reason<00:04:01.870> as<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.230> why

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
genetics so my last reason as to why

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.380 
genetics so my last reason as to why
your<00:04:02.799> hair<00:04:03.040> may<00:04:03.070> be<00:04:03.280> naturally<00:04:03.910> changing

your hair may be naturally changing

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.560 
your hair may be naturally changing
colors<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:05.130> because<00:04:06.130> your<00:04:06.459> hair<00:04:06.730> has<00:04:07.090> went

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
colors is because your hair has went

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.170 
colors is because your hair has went
through<00:04:07.840> sun<00:04:08.230> damage<00:04:08.680> so<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.639> course<00:04:09.880> you<00:04:10.150> have
