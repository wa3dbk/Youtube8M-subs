exercise um

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.449 
exercise um
and<00:03:10.750> I'm<00:03:10.930> sure<00:03:11.079> that<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.290> will<00:03:11.799> it's<00:03:12.040> probably

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
and I'm sure that I will it's probably

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.100 
and I'm sure that I will it's probably
just<00:03:12.549> slowed<00:03:13.120> down<00:03:13.360> because<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:15.780> haven't<00:03:16.780> been

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
just slowed down because I haven't been

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.199 
just slowed down because I haven't been
consistent<00:03:17.980> with<00:03:18.340> exercising<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:21.209> surgery

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
soft foods yet they wanted me to be on

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.500 
soft foods yet they wanted me to be on
two<00:04:18.500> weeks<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.890> liquids<00:04:19.340> but<00:04:19.640> it's<00:04:20.360> been

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
two weeks of liquids but it's been

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.340 
two weeks of liquids but it's been
really<00:04:20.690> hard<00:04:20.930> for<00:04:21.050> me<00:04:21.460> because<00:04:23.110> with<00:04:24.110> all

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
really hard for me because with all

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.960 
really hard for me because with all
liquids<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:25.070> was<00:04:25.220> getting<00:04:25.520> really<00:04:25.670> like

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
liquids I was getting really like

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.210 
liquids I was getting really like
nauseous<00:04:26.480> from<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.960> protein<00:04:27.590> shakes<00:04:27.890> they

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
nauseous from the protein shakes they

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.820 
nauseous from the protein shakes they
were<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:28.580> really<00:04:28.880> disgusting<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.080> I

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
were just really disgusting and I

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.070 
were just really disgusting and I
figured<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.640> yogurt<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.240> cottage

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
figured that the yogurt and cottage

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.840 
figured that the yogurt and cottage
cheese<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.710> stuff<00:04:33.920> would<00:04:34.160> go<00:04:34.340> down<00:04:34.490> fine

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
cheese and stuff would go down fine

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.420 
cheese and stuff would go down fine
because<00:04:35.150> of<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.800> texture<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:36.980> as<00:04:37.100> long<00:04:37.280> as

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
because of the texture of it as long as

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.940 
because of the texture of it as long as
I<00:04:37.490> chewed<00:04:37.760> up<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:37.910> cheese<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:38.810> stuff<00:04:39.050> really

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
I chewed up the cheese and stuff really

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.490 
I chewed up the cheese and stuff really
well<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.510> worked<00:04:41.720> out<00:04:41.870> good<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.470> I

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
well and that worked out good so I

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.230 
well and that worked out good so I
didn't<00:04:42.860> have<00:04:42.950> any<00:04:43.010> problems<00:04:43.490> so<00:04:46.150> other<00:04:47.150> than

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
didn't have any problems so other than

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.200 
didn't have any problems so other than
that<00:04:47.510> I<00:04:47.660> think<00:04:48.380> that's<00:04:48.620> about<00:04:48.920> it<00:04:49.220> I'm<00:04:49.910> just

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
that I think that's about it I'm just

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.170 
that I think that's about it I'm just
trying<00:04:50.510> out<00:04:50.630> some<00:04:50.900> soft<00:04:51.170> foods<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:52.000> can't<00:04:53.000> wait

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
trying out some soft foods I can't wait

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.800 
trying out some soft foods I can't wait
to<00:04:53.360> be<00:04:53.480> back<00:04:53.660> on<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.960> full<00:04:55.180> regular<00:04:56.180> diet<00:04:56.450> again
