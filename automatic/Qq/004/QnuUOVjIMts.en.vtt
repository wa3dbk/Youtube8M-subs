the first album because they think that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.820

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
odd was pretty good no pun intended

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.090 
odd was pretty good no pun intended
I<00:01:04.580> loved<00:01:05.059> vices<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.660> virtues<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:06.290> now<00:01:06.920> we've

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
I loved vices and virtues and now we've

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.680 
I loved vices and virtues and now we've
got<00:01:07.250> too<00:01:07.430> weird<00:01:07.550> to<00:01:07.700> live<00:01:07.790> career<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.240> die<00:01:08.390> and

got too weird to live career to die and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.150 
got too weird to live career to die and
so<00:01:08.899> of<00:01:09.140> course<00:01:09.320> naturally<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:09.920> will<00:01:10.040> be

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
so of course naturally it will be

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.350 
so of course naturally it will be
compared<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.550> what<00:01:10.729> most<00:01:10.880> people<00:01:11.119> think<00:01:11.210> is

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.230 
started streaming it on YouTube a few
weeks<00:01:30.050> ago<00:01:30.140> -<00:01:30.649> right<00:01:30.680> now<00:01:31.100> I've<00:01:32.000> been

listening to it non-stop from start to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.670 
listening to it non-stop from start to
finish<00:01:34.070> it's<00:01:35.060> awesome<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.140> love<00:01:36.410> it<00:01:36.560> I

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
finish it's awesome I love it I

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.990 
finish it's awesome I love it I
absolutely<00:01:37.100> am<00:01:37.399> head<00:01:37.520> over<00:01:37.550> heels<00:01:37.700> in<00:01:37.970> love

absolutely am head over heels in love

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.030 
absolutely am head over heels in love
with<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:38.840> that's<00:01:39.289> what<00:01:39.590> matters<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:39.890> me

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
with it and so that's what matters to me

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.070 
with it and so that's what matters to me
I<00:01:40.310> really<00:01:40.850> think<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.540> album<00:01:41.780> is

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
I really think that this album is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.289 
I really think that this album is
interesting<00:01:42.530> because<00:01:42.680> vices<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.760> virtues<00:01:43.790> I

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
interesting because vices and virtues I

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.940 
interesting because vices and virtues I
would<00:01:44.420> say<00:01:44.570> obviously<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.680> one<00:01:45.830> to

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
would say obviously is the the one to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.710 
would say obviously is the the one to
compare<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.400> if<00:01:46.670> any<00:01:46.850> because<00:01:47.299> it's<00:01:47.570> the

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
compare it to if any because it's the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.630 
compare it to if any because it's the
first<00:01:47.930> album<00:01:48.290> they<00:01:48.380> had<00:01:48.560> since<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.280> departure

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
first album they had since the departure

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.550 
first album they had since the departure
of<00:01:49.820> Ryan<00:01:50.600> Ross<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:50.990> John<00:01:51.110> Walker

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
of Ryan Ross and John Walker

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.609 
of Ryan Ross and John Walker
so<00:01:52.130> those<00:01:53.000> comparisons<00:01:53.630> make<00:01:54.020> more<00:01:54.229> sense<00:01:54.439> to

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
so those comparisons make more sense to

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.899 
so those comparisons make more sense to
me<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.220> would<00:01:55.369> say<00:01:55.549> this<00:01:55.670> one<00:01:55.880> is

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
me and I would say this one is

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.600 
me and I would say this one is
considerably<00:01:56.630> darker<00:01:57.020> or<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:57.920> feels<00:01:58.159> darker

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
considerably darker or it feels darker

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
it's the fact that it kind of feels like

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.970 
it's the fact that it kind of feels like
a<00:02:10.610> bit<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:10.880> an<00:02:11.030> 80s<00:02:11.390> sort<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.900> thing<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.739> like

the fact that it really has that vibe of
Vegas<00:02:18.110> which<00:02:18.320> is<00:02:18.440> obviously<00:02:18.799> evidenced<00:02:19.250> by

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
Vegas which is obviously evidenced by

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.430 
Vegas which is obviously evidenced by
the<00:02:19.400> title<00:02:19.820> to<00:02:20.420> hear<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.660> live<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.019> rare<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.290> die

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
there from Vegas it is supposed to be

there from Vegas it is supposed to be
Vegas<00:02:23.600> ish<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.680> feels<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.190> but<00:02:25.730> in

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
Vegas ish and it feels like that but in

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.900 
Vegas ish and it feels like that but in
a<00:02:26.030> kind<00:02:26.299> of<00:02:26.420> seedy<00:02:27.079> underground<00:02:27.650> Vegas<00:02:28.250> way<00:02:28.549> if

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
although it's gonna be difficult because

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.440

like<00:02:39.530> it's<00:02:39.680> on<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.799> different<00:02:40.070> album<00:02:40.250> it

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
like it's on a different album it

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.860

doesn't feel the same as the other songs
in<00:02:41.989> my<00:02:42.140> opinion<00:02:42.500> not<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:43.310> I'm<00:02:43.370> saying<00:02:43.519> it's<00:02:43.700> a

in my opinion not that I'm saying it's a

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.070 
in my opinion not that I'm saying it's a
bad<00:02:43.850> song<00:02:44.120> or<00:02:44.239> anything<00:02:44.389> I<00:02:44.630> like<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:45.169> death

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
songs that I see myself potentially

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.390 
songs that I see myself potentially
skipping<00:03:34.230> over<00:03:34.320> in<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.620> future<00:03:34.920> not<00:03:35.070> that<00:03:35.370> I

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
skipping over in the future not that I

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.280 
skipping over in the future not that I
think<00:03:35.580> it's<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.910> bad<00:03:36.060> song<00:03:36.330> once<00:03:36.570> again<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.020> do

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
think it's a bad song once again I do

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.480 
think it's a bad song once again I do
think<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.709> all<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:38.010> songs<00:03:38.190> on<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.370> album

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
think that all the songs on this album

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.949 
think that all the songs on this album
are<00:03:38.700> great<00:03:38.880> but<00:03:39.240> this<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.480> one<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.690> them<00:03:39.810> that's

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
are great but this is one of them that's

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.230 
are great but this is one of them that's
a<00:03:40.140> little<00:03:40.410> bit<00:03:40.530> lesser<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.010> then<00:03:41.340> right<00:03:41.910> after

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
a little bit lesser and then right after

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.570 
a little bit lesser and then right after
that<00:03:42.380> possibly<00:03:43.380> my<00:03:43.620> number<00:03:44.130> one<00:03:44.250> favorite

I think it's kind of clever I think it

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.229 
I think it's kind of clever I think it
could<00:03:59.100> have<00:03:59.160> been<00:03:59.220> lame<00:03:59.489> but<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.030> think<00:04:00.150> it

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
could have been lame but I think it

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.090

favorites<00:04:41.910> on<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.150> album<00:04:42.479> but<00:04:42.630> next<00:04:42.930> is

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
favorites on the album but next is

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.719 
favorites on the album but next is
colorful<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.830> really<00:04:44.040> like<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.220> one<00:04:44.520> and

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
colorful and I really like that one and

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.610 
colorful and I really like that one and
finally<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.510> end<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:45.900> all<00:04:46.080> things

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
finally the end of all things

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.219 
finally the end of all things
this<00:04:47.130> song<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.669> fantastic<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.450> I<00:04:48.750> really<00:04:49.020> hope

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
this song is fantastic and I really hope

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.260 
this song is fantastic and I really hope
that<00:04:49.260> they'll<00:04:49.950> release<00:04:50.220> not<00:04:50.760> an<00:04:50.880> acoustic

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that they'll release not an acoustic

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.040 
that they'll release not an acoustic
version<00:04:51.390> of<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.750> but<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:51.870> guess<00:04:52.020> a

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
version of it but I guess a

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.600 
version of it but I guess a
stripped-down<00:04:52.470> version<00:04:52.950> because<00:04:53.160> I<00:04:53.340> know

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
stripped-down version because I know

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.860 
stripped-down version because I know
it's<00:04:53.850> very<00:04:53.940> stripped<00:04:54.300> down<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.450> begin<00:04:54.750> with

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
it's very stripped down to begin with

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.719 
it's very stripped down to begin with
but<00:04:55.020> it's<00:04:55.140> very<00:04:55.229> processed<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.010> digitized

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
but it's very processed and digitized

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:57.980 
but it's very processed and digitized
and<00:04:56.940> stuff<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.360> that's<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.600> point<00:04:57.810> suppose

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
and stuff and that's the point suppose

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.110 
and stuff and that's the point suppose
to<00:04:58.080> have<00:04:58.169> effects<00:04:58.440> on<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.680> but

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
to have effects on it but

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.400 
to have effects on it but
I<00:04:59.180> would<00:04:59.389> love<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.660> just<00:04:59.750> hear<00:04:59.930> a<00:04:59.990> version<00:05:00.199> of

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
I would love to just hear a version of

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.700 
I would love to just hear a version of
it<00:05:00.530> with<00:05:00.770> piano<00:05:01.720> vocals<00:05:02.720> and<00:05:02.990> that's<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.530> I

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
it with piano vocals and that's it I

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.260 
it with piano vocals and that's it I
think<00:05:04.160> it's<00:05:04.250> really<00:05:04.490> really<00:05:04.820> good<00:05:05.000> and

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
think it's really really good and

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.300 
think it's really really good and
honestly<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:06.500> whole<00:05:06.650> album<00:05:06.830> like<00:05:07.040> I<00:05:07.130> said

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
honestly the whole album like I said

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.409 
honestly the whole album like I said
even<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.639> ones<00:05:07.820> that<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.030> can<00:05:08.180> see<00:05:08.270> myself

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
even the ones that I can see myself

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.330 
even the ones that I can see myself
skipping<00:05:08.990> in<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.530> future<00:05:09.830> which<00:05:10.010> I'm<00:05:10.190> not

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
skipping in the future which I'm not

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.469 
skipping in the future which I'm not
there<00:05:10.550> yet<00:05:10.760> I<00:05:10.790> still<00:05:11.090> listen<00:05:11.180> to<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.360> whole

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
there yet I still listen to the whole

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:12.879 
there yet I still listen to the whole
thing<00:05:11.510> start<00:05:11.780> to<00:05:11.810> finish<00:05:11.870> they're<00:05:12.650> still

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
thing start to finish they're still

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.650 
thing start to finish they're still
really<00:05:13.040> good<00:05:13.220> songs<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:13.820> so<00:05:14.030> I<00:05:14.060> would<00:05:14.449> say

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
really good songs and so I would say

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.590 
really good songs and so I would say
that<00:05:14.870> you<00:05:15.680> know<00:05:15.800> if<00:05:16.010> you<00:05:16.220> want<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.729> compare<00:05:17.389> a

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
that you know if you want to compare a

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.760 
that you know if you want to compare a
fever<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:17.930> can't<00:05:17.990> sweat<00:05:18.139> out<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.470> this<00:05:18.560> one

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
fever you can't sweat out and this one

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.830 
fever you can't sweat out and this one
may<00:05:19.460> be<00:05:19.520> how<00:05:19.910> I<00:05:19.940> felt<00:05:20.270> about<00:05:20.389> a<00:05:20.510> fever<00:05:20.720> you

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
may be how I felt about a fever you

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.180 
may be how I felt about a fever you
can't<00:05:20.870> sweat<00:05:21.080> out<00:05:21.350> at<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.680> time<00:05:21.889> and<00:05:22.100> how<00:05:22.160> I

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
can't sweat out at the time and how I

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.159 
can't sweat out at the time and how I
feel<00:05:22.400> about<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:22.699> one<00:05:22.880> now<00:05:23.150> I<00:05:23.449> guess<00:05:23.990> this

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
feel about this one now I guess this

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.450 
feel about this one now I guess this
would<00:05:24.260> be<00:05:24.350> my<00:05:24.470> second<00:05:24.830> favorite<00:05:24.860> following

would be my second favorite following

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.450 
would be my second favorite following
fever<00:05:25.699> but<00:05:26.000> in<00:05:26.240> comparison<00:05:26.810> I<00:05:27.400> wouldn't<00:05:28.400> make

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
fever but in comparison I wouldn't make

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.730 
fever but in comparison I wouldn't make
