00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
little on the short side in my opinion

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.010 
little on the short side in my opinion
so<00:02:23.410> it'll<00:02:23.650> be<00:02:23.800> tough<00:02:24.390> Joe<00:02:25.390> eating<00:02:25.660> does<00:02:25.810> have<00:02:25.990> a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
so it'll be tough Joe eating does have a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.560 
so it'll be tough Joe eating does have a
lucid<00:02:26.830> pneus<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.430> Tracy<00:02:27.850> Porter<00:02:28.120> doesn't

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
lucid pneus that Tracy Porter doesn't

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.460 
lucid pneus that Tracy Porter doesn't
have<00:02:33.390> Tracy<00:02:34.390> Porter<00:02:34.600> also<00:02:34.959> if<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.170> picked<00:02:35.410> it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
have Tracy Porter also if you picked it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.750 
have Tracy Porter also if you picked it
off<00:02:35.590> you'll<00:02:35.830> be<00:02:35.950> able<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.220> take<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.430> back<00:02:36.700> a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
off you'll be able to take it back a

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.320 
off you'll be able to take it back a
little<00:02:37.000> bit<00:02:38.250> man<00:02:39.250> goes<00:02:39.459> down<00:02:39.640> but<00:02:39.910> zone<00:02:40.120> goes

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
little bit man goes down but zone goes

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.910 
little bit man goes down but zone goes
up<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.690> if<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.840> want<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.080> lot<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.260> zone<00:02:41.560> Tracy

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
up so if you want a lot of zone Tracy

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.550 
up so if you want a lot of zone Tracy
Porter<00:02:42.250> might<00:02:42.700> be<00:02:43.000> for<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.330> injury<00:02:44.080> goes<00:02:44.260> down

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
Porter might be for you injury goes down

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.020 
Porter might be for you injury goes down
I'm<00:02:44.770> not<00:02:44.920> sure<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.070> really<00:02:45.340> how<00:02:45.610> that's<00:02:45.820> going

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
I'm not sure I really how that's going

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.770 
I'm not sure I really how that's going
to<00:02:46.209> affect<00:02:46.720> this<00:02:47.620> card<00:02:48.100> I'm<00:02:48.850> not<00:02:49.030> they<00:02:49.600> don't

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
to affect this card I'm not they don't

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.870 
to affect this card I'm not they don't
get<00:02:49.870> injured<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.410> often<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.040> but<00:02:51.640> then<00:02:51.790> you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
get injured that often and but then you

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.190 
get injured that often and but then you
have<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:53.190> 73<00:02:54.190> spec<00:02:54.910> catch<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.450> 70<00:02:55.900> kids<00:02:56.080> in

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
have that 73 spec catch and 70 kids in

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.009 
have that 73 spec catch and 70 kids in
traffic<00:02:56.560> which<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.040> much<00:02:57.190> better<00:02:57.370> than

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
traffic which is so much better than

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.190 
traffic which is so much better than

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
donated 91 press a little bit lower hit

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.860 
donated 91 press a little bit lower hit
powers<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.590> lot<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:03.160> lot<00:03:03.730> lower<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.420> if<00:03:04.720> you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
powers a lot a lot lower but if you

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.530 
powers a lot a lot lower but if you
compared<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> normal<00:03:06.640> corner<00:03:07.209> let's<00:03:07.420> see

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
compared to a normal corner let's see

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.110 
compared to a normal corner let's see
Richard<00:03:07.900> Sherman<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.680> lot<00:03:08.980> lower<00:03:09.190> so<00:03:09.610> this

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
Richard Sherman is a lot lower so this

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.789 
Richard Sherman is a lot lower so this
is<00:03:10.269> all<00:03:10.390> good<00:03:10.690> but<00:03:11.790> uh<00:03:12.959> excuse<00:03:13.959> me<00:03:14.049> this<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.769> a

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
is all good but uh excuse me this is a

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.250 
is all good but uh excuse me this is a
good<00:03:15.220> corner<00:03:15.730> overall<00:03:16.329> in<00:03:16.570> my<00:03:16.600> opinion<00:03:16.750> I'm

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
good corner overall in my opinion I'm

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.199 
good corner overall in my opinion I'm
gonna<00:03:17.410> jump<00:03:17.709> on<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.950> auction<00:03:18.100> block<00:03:18.400> if<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:19.000> see

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
how much he's going for um but I think

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.810 
how much he's going for um but I think
this<00:03:23.170> might<00:03:23.230> have<00:03:23.470> been<00:03:23.620> worth<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.100> i<00:03:24.250> spent
