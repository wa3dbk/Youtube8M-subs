insiders<00:00:02.220> I'm<00:00:02.370> getting<00:00:02.550> ready<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.820> do<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.060> flex

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
insiders I'm getting ready to do a flex

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.550 
insiders I'm getting ready to do a flex
test<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.009> 2014<00:00:05.009> k2<00:00:05.879> happy<00:00:06.450> hour<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.529> a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
test on the 2014 k2 happy hour this is a

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.280 
test on the 2014 k2 happy hour this is a
154<00:00:08.370> centimeter<00:00:08.849> board<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.870> got<00:00:10.110> their

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
154 centimeter board it's got their

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.259 
154 centimeter board it's got their
lifted<00:00:10.800> camber<00:00:11.370> profile<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.120> it's

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
lifted camber profile so it's

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.870 
lifted camber profile so it's
essentially<00:00:12.840> flat<00:00:13.139> from<00:00:13.650> outside<00:00:14.280> insert<00:00:14.730> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
essentially flat from outside insert to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.840 
essentially flat from outside insert to
outside<00:00:15.269> insert<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.960> then<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> has<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.160> camber

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
outside insert and then it has a camber

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.760 
outside insert and then it has a camber
zone<00:00:18.060> right<00:00:18.330> before<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.779> gets<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.199> lifted

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
zone right before it gets to the lifted

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.670 
zone right before it gets to the lifted
part<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.160> tips<00:00:20.400> out<00:00:20.609> here<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.060> flat<00:00:21.779> camber

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
part of the tips out here so flat camber

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.179 
part of the tips out here so flat camber
zone<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.130> then<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.939> lifted<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.420> bent<00:00:24.630> up<00:00:24.810> tips

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
zone and then the lifted or bent up tips

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.980 
zone and then the lifted or bent up tips
this<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.150> favorite<00:00:27.570> boards<00:00:27.840> of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
this was one of my favorite boards of

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.919 
this was one of my favorite boards of
the<00:00:28.320> season<00:00:28.710> k2<00:00:29.609> happy<00:00:29.939> hour<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.359> gave<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the season k2 happy hour I gave it a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
the season k2 happy hour I gave it a
hundred<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.380> my<00:00:31.500> shred<00:00:31.769> cred<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> felt<00:00:32.399> like

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
hundred on my shred cred I felt like

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.830 
hundred on my shred cred I felt like
there<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:32.850> nothing<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.300> board<00:00:33.540> couldn't

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
there was nothing this board couldn't

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.229 
there was nothing this board couldn't
handle

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.910 

or<00:00:38.390> insiders<00:00:39.020> real<00:00:39.559> riders<00:00:40.010> real<00:00:40.610> reviews<00:00:41.920> all

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
or insiders real riders real reviews all

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.500 
or insiders real riders real reviews all
right<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:43.219> the<00:00:43.370> first<00:00:43.610> thing<00:00:43.790> I<00:00:43.910> like<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.120> do<00:00:44.360> is

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
right so the first thing I like to do is

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.450 
right so the first thing I like to do is
just<00:00:44.690> kind<00:00:44.899> of<00:00:45.050> let<00:00:45.530> my<00:00:45.680> weight<00:00:45.890> rock<00:00:46.190> back<00:00:46.430> and

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
just kind of let my weight rock back and

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.310 
just kind of let my weight rock back and
forth<00:00:46.760> not<00:00:47.030> really<00:00:47.360> muscle<00:00:47.750> it<00:00:47.840> into<00:00:48.079> it<00:00:48.170> and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
forth not really muscle it into it and

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.479 
forth not really muscle it into it and
just<00:00:48.350> seeing<00:00:48.710> where<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.920> board<00:00:49.129> wants<00:00:49.370> to

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
just seeing where the board wants to

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.509 
just seeing where the board wants to
bend<00:00:49.699> just<00:00:50.019> with<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.110> weight<00:00:51.260> of<00:00:51.410> my<00:00:51.500> body<00:00:51.680> and

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
bend just with the weight of my body and

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.759 
bend just with the weight of my body and
the<00:00:53.269> thing<00:00:53.480> I<00:00:53.629> love<00:00:53.870> about<00:00:53.899> this<00:00:54.290> board<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:54.739> can

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
the thing I love about this board I can

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.710 
the thing I love about this board I can
already<00:00:55.670> see<00:00:55.970> a<00:00:56.000> difference<00:00:56.449> in<00:00:56.570> all<00:00:56.690> the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
already see a difference in all the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.389 
already see a difference in all the
other<00:00:56.930> flex<00:00:57.290> tests<00:00:57.589> that<00:00:57.680> I've<00:00:57.769> done<00:00:57.980> is<00:00:58.190> I

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
other flex tests that I've done is I

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.450 
other flex tests that I've done is I
feel<00:00:59.030> like<00:00:59.269> this<00:00:59.510> whole<00:00:59.780> board<00:01:00.110> flexes<00:01:00.890> evenly

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
feel like this whole board flexes evenly

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.410 
feel like this whole board flexes evenly
throughout<00:01:01.729> the<00:01:01.820> whole<00:01:02.120> thing

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
throughout the whole thing

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.509 
throughout the whole thing
I<00:01:02.629> don't<00:01:03.559> feel<00:01:03.739> like<00:01:03.860> I'm<00:01:04.040> getting<00:01:04.159> any<00:01:04.399> more

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
I don't feel like I'm getting any more

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.670 
I don't feel like I'm getting any more
flex<00:01:04.850> here<00:01:05.149> here<00:01:05.540> here<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.050> feel<00:01:06.380> like<00:01:06.500> it's

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
flex here here here I feel like it's

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.889 
flex here here here I feel like it's
just<00:01:06.860> one<00:01:07.100> big<00:01:08.000> even<00:01:08.600> slow<00:01:09.290> flex<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:11.570> this<00:01:11.690> is

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
just one big even slow flex and this is

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
of you choose with this board if you

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.910 
of you choose with this board if you
want<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.000> flex<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.450> put<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.229> little<00:01:30.440> extra<00:01:30.679> leg

torsional<00:01:36.200> flex<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.649> this<00:01:36.800> board<00:01:37.069> is<00:01:37.220> just

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
torsional flex on this board is just

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.749 
torsional flex on this board is just
really<00:01:38.060> comfortable<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.780> can't<00:01:39.740> lift<00:01:39.979> my<00:01:40.250> edges

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
really comfortable I can't lift my edges
