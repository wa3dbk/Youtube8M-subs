00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this summer I like to study a lot of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.689 
this summer I like to study a lot of
math<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.210> physics<00:00:39.449> Lee<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> Bible<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
math and physics Lee in the Bible to to

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.070 
math and physics Lee in the Bible to to
me<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.090> show<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.660> there's<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.900> lot<00:00:43.050> more

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
me they all show that there's a lot more

things<00:00:43.559> than<00:00:43.650> we<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.660> here's<00:00:45.660> some<00:00:45.840> old

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
things than we see here's some old

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.660 
things than we see here's some old
school<00:00:46.379> chicks<00:00:46.739> makes<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.220> few<00:00:47.400> new<00:00:47.430> ideas

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
school chicks makes with a few new ideas

school chicks makes with a few new ideas
I<00:00:48.270> grew<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.140> doing<00:00:49.409> stuff<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.920> it's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
I grew up doing stuff like this it's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.060 
I grew up doing stuff like this it's
basically<00:00:50.790> my<00:00:51.000> reach<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.650> also<00:00:52.650> like<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
basically my reach I also like it

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
basically my reach I also like it
because<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.519> stuck<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.000> lot<00:00:54.150> of<00:00:54.239> times<00:00:54.449> let

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
because I get stuck a lot of times let

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.310 
because I get stuck a lot of times let
me<00:00:54.839> do<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.019> flat<00:00:55.350> ground<00:00:56.570> this<00:00:57.570> watch<00:00:57.839> this<00:00:58.019> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
me do a flat ground this watch this and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.899 
me do a flat ground this watch this and
I<00:00:58.409> play<00:00:58.650> point<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.460> scientists

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
I play point from one of the scientists

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.969 
I play point from one of the scientists
I<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.180> most<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:01.019> has<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.409> to<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.710> some

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
I like most it has a lot to do with some

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:09.140 
I like most it has a lot to do with some
of<00:01:02.100> things<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.489> read<00:01:02.699> about<00:01:06.950> if<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.850> only

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
of things I read about if there is only

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.800 
of things I read about if there is only
one<00:01:09.600> possible<00:01:09.930> unified<00:01:10.890> theory<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.450> just

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
one possible unified theory that is just

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
one possible unified theory that is just
a<00:01:12.990> set<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> rules<00:01:13.620> and<00:01:13.920> equations<00:01:16.040> what<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> said

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
a set of rules and equations what I said

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.450 
a set of rules and equations what I said
that<00:01:17.610> breathes<00:01:17.970> fire<00:01:18.330> into<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.810> equations

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
that breathes fire into the equations

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.640 
that breathes fire into the equations
and<00:01:20.460> makes<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.060> university<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and makes a university for them to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.190 
and makes a university for them to
describe<00:01:25.220> why<00:01:26.220> does<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> universe<00:01:26.750> go<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> all

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
describe why does the universe go to all

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.230 
describe why does the universe go to all
the<00:01:28.470> bother<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.920> existing<00:01:31.520> there's<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.700> unified

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the bother of existing there's a unified

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840 
the bother of existing there's a unified
theory<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.990> compelling<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.580> brings

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
theory so compelling that it brings

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.280 
theory so compelling that it brings
about<00:01:36.210> its<00:01:36.600> own<00:01:36.810> existence<00:01:38.690> or<00:01:39.690> does<00:01:40.050> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
about its own existence or does that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.700 
about its own existence or does that
need<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> creator<00:01:41.010> and<00:01:43.010> if<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:44.400> who<00:01:45.080> created<00:01:46.080> him

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.260 

I'll<00:01:49.710> look<00:01:49.800> back<00:01:49.980> at<00:01:50.190> my<00:01:50.280> old<00:01:50.310> videos<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.030> still

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
I'll look back at my old videos I still

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.820 
I'll look back at my old videos I still
kind<00:01:51.480> of<00:01:51.540> see<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> task<00:01:52.110> which<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.440> conveying

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
kind of see the task which is conveying

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.230 
kind of see the task which is conveying
some<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.190> hardest<00:01:53.460> moves<00:01:53.700> I've<00:01:53.850> ever<00:01:54.000> done

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
some of the hardest moves I've ever done

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.170 
some of the hardest moves I've ever done
most<00:01:55.040> of<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.160> footage<00:01:56.400> I<00:01:56.610> look<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:56.940> is<00:01:57.030> being

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
most of my footage I look at is being

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.110 
most of my footage I look at is being
transitioning<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.080> freestyle<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.650> street

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
transitioning for freestyle the street

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
transitioning for freestyle the street
I'm<00:02:00.120> still<00:02:00.450> kind<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> working<00:02:00.780> my<00:02:01.050> way<00:02:01.080> up

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:03:12.930 

ha
