00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:08.250
 first you put a third of curation a 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.730
 third of lemon a good since 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.530
 that we are at the end of a third day 80 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 but in an orchard maintenance or even 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.590
 by then it helps out the size of 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.640
 third and there it does not even depend in a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.840
 luckily we can put only three 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 shots in rest that me how did I 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:32.759
 to put four thirds of the weeks I 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:34.140
 me heaven madam now arises and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.690
 Finally, I can not miss his body 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.809
 ana we have seen previously 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.719
 finalize abstraction do you do that 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.980
 I have a problem that is comparison 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.260
 when I was at 85 maybe that annoys me 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.980
 not because it's a vision 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.360
 today on a killer on this 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.460
 universal history that's the look that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.149
 I'm wearing this story it's with 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.359
 actors young people today who 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.589
 are completely identifiable for 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.740
 poor for their generation 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.490
 it's not it's not comparable 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.409
 this is the crisis which it does not prevent 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.780
 I have a lot of admiration for 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
 first and that and 2 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.490
 Here and respect all that stuff is 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.290
 that having done mine is actually 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.240
 favored me what interested me 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.280
 it was the 7th and these young people 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.180
 were this love story this 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.680
 destiny this boy who had this dream 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.670
 would be huge like that and who was going 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.210
 sacrifice his life that of fanny and 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.460
 everybody 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.729
 the story of a guy who misses his life 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:53.820
 it's worth what its sad yes yes it 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:55.380
 for sure yes yes yes yes I understand 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.149
 I understand you like them from the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.020
 departure if you want in the adaptation 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.600
 all that is number that after all 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.140
 all the numbers that for that pagnol has 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.290
 writes to rhenus for them to play for 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.280
 that they stay there I was not 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.240
 and all the numbers that are not 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.830
 useful to history and 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.890
 and who will be checked which story 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.150
 I removed them so I did not try 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.150
 to be in imitation 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.130
 I am patient but not 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.530
 unpleasant 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.240

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:49.470
 good under the dent I'm not bad 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:53.420

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.420
 better but its phase where time 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.530
