there just ain't a lot of room and you
got<00:00:24.140> to<00:00:24.259> figure<00:00:24.410> it<00:00:24.529> out<00:00:24.710> right<00:00:25.009> and<00:00:25.520> looking

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
got to figure it out right and looking

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.569 
got to figure it out right and looking
at<00:00:26.119> your<00:00:26.270> car<00:00:26.540> here<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:27.529> figured<00:00:27.829> it<00:00:27.980> out<00:00:28.070> yes

at your car here you figured it out yes
I<00:00:28.880> seen<00:00:29.809> it<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:30.020> other<00:00:30.140> day<00:00:30.790> and<00:00:31.790> it<00:00:31.969> was<00:00:32.000> good

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
I seen it the other day and it was good

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.670 
I seen it the other day and it was good
engineering<00:00:32.660> I<00:00:32.780> you<00:00:33.079> know<00:00:33.140> I<00:00:33.170> can't<00:00:33.320> look<00:00:33.620> past

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
engineering I you know I can't look past

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.920 
engineering I you know I can't look past
the<00:00:34.010> car<00:00:34.190> I<00:00:34.219> went<00:00:34.370> right<00:00:34.580> to<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.630> then<00:00:35.870> I

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
the car I went right to that and then I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.090 
the car I went right to that and then I
find<00:00:36.170> out<00:00:36.290> just<00:00:36.530> yesterday<00:00:36.680> you're<00:00:37.040> an

engineer on four Cessna is that right

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.080 
engineer on four Cessna is that right
that's<00:00:39.410> correct<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:39.890> that<00:00:39.920> explains<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.910> lot<00:00:41.030> of

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
that's correct so that explains a lot of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.330 
that's correct so that explains a lot of
really<00:00:41.450> awesome<00:00:41.510> engineering<00:00:42.350> here<00:00:42.530> this<00:00:43.100> car

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
really awesome engineering here this car

really awesome engineering here this car
is<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:43.820> unique<00:00:44.180> it's<00:00:44.900> got<00:00:45.110> its<00:00:45.260> own<00:00:45.350> flavor

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
is so unique it's got its own flavor

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.990 
is so unique it's got its own flavor
because<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.340> engineering<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:46.880> what

the clutch pedal in to make it work and
when<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.650> ordered<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.040> kit<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.430> ordered<00:01:40.700> us<00:01:40.850> an

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
when I ordered the kit I ordered us an

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.690 
when I ordered the kit I ordered us an
extra<00:01:41.720> brake<00:01:42.170> pedal<00:01:42.560> mm-hmm<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.040> noticed<00:01:43.580> that

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
extra brake pedal mm-hmm I noticed that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.950 
extra brake pedal mm-hmm I noticed that
it<00:01:43.820> was<00:01:43.850> two<00:01:44.030> brake<00:01:44.240> pedals<00:01:44.600> but<00:01:44.720> they're<00:01:44.869> just

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
it was two brake pedals but they're just

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.690 
it was two brake pedals but they're just
not<00:01:45.110> quite<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.560> same<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.510> cut<00:01:48.080> off<00:01:48.110> the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
not quite the same and I cut off the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.010 
not quite the same and I cut off the
shortened<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.820> stud<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.299> was<00:01:50.479> welded<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:50.990> a

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
shortened the stud that was welded to a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.969 
shortened the stud that was welded to a
frame<00:01:51.380> right<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.720> built<00:01:53.720> some<00:01:54.020> additional

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
frame right and built some additional

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.520 
frame right and built some additional
linkage<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.119> spacers<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.960> go<00:01:57.080> in<00:01:57.200> there<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:57.380> I

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
linkage and spacers to go in there so I

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.800 
linkage and spacers to go in there so I
could<00:01:57.710> put<00:01:57.860> both<00:01:58.040> pedals<00:01:58.430> in<00:01:58.580> uh-huh<00:01:59.060> side<00:01:59.630> by

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
could put both pedals in uh-huh side by

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.719 
could put both pedals in uh-huh side by
side<00:01:59.840> side<00:02:00.290> by<00:02:00.500> side<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.220> worked<00:02:01.400> out<00:02:01.520> really

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
side side by side that worked out really

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.810 
side side by side that worked out really
why<00:02:01.939> I<00:02:01.970> didn't<00:02:02.240> even<00:02:02.360> think<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.979> but<00:02:03.979> and

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
why I didn't even think of that but and

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.630 
why I didn't even think of that but and
then<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.119> built<00:02:05.619> three<00:02:06.619> separate<00:02:07.040> braces<00:02:07.490> to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
then I built three separate braces to

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.050 
then I built three separate braces to
tile<00:02:07.909> that<00:02:08.269> back<00:02:08.509> into<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.869> frame

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
tile that back into the frame

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.610 
tile that back into the frame
and<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:12.540> linkage<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:13.750> runs<00:02:14.020> directly

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
and the the linkage then runs directly

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.680 
and the the linkage then runs directly
from<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.160> brake<00:02:15.430> pedal<00:02:15.819> or<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.270> clutch<00:02:16.450> pedal

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
from the brake pedal or the clutch pedal

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.410 
from the brake pedal or the clutch pedal
right<00:02:16.990> up<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.760> throw<00:02:18.760> out<00:02:18.880> arm<00:02:19.120> on<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
right up to the throw out arm on the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.870 
right up to the throw out arm on the
bell<00:02:19.540> housing<00:02:19.720> mm-hmm<00:02:20.410> which<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.740> out<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.310> 47

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
bell housing mm-hmm which is out of a 47

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.220 
bell housing mm-hmm which is out of a 47
Chevrolet<00:02:22.270> oh<00:02:22.540> really<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.750> noticed<00:02:26.080> on<00:02:26.170> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
Chevrolet oh really and I noticed on the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.080 
Chevrolet oh really and I noticed on the
brake<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.040> you've<00:02:27.610> got<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.790> little<00:02:27.940> bit

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
brake to the you've got a little bit

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.240 
brake to the you've got a little bit
different<00:02:28.480> setup<00:02:28.750> than<00:02:28.780> we<00:02:29.050> then<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:29.830> sent<00:02:30.100> you

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
different setup than we then we sent you

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.220 
different setup than we then we sent you
that's<00:02:30.489> for<00:02:30.640> sure<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:31.030> was<00:02:31.810> having<00:02:32.080> trouble

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
that's for sure I was having trouble

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.640 
that's for sure I was having trouble
stopping<00:02:32.739> this<00:02:33.040> car<00:02:33.310> at<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.900> took<00:02:35.470> an<00:02:35.560> awful

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
stopping this car at it took an awful

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.860 
stopping this car at it took an awful
lot<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:35.980> pedal<00:02:36.310> pressure<00:02:36.550> well<00:02:36.970> see<00:02:37.180> we<00:02:37.510> forget

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
lot of pedal pressure well see we forget

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.780 
lot of pedal pressure well see we forget
what<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.080> was<00:02:38.110> like<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.530> have<00:02:38.680> no<00:02:39.250> power<00:02:39.489> we're

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
what it was like to have no power we're

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.030 
what it was like to have no power we're
in<00:02:39.880> her<00:02:40.000> world<00:02:40.450> all<00:02:40.720> right<00:02:40.750> man<00:02:41.680> yeah<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:41.920> was

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
in her world all right man yeah it was

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.680 
in her world all right man yeah it was
awful<00:02:42.160> hard<00:02:42.430> stock<00:02:42.700> particularly<00:02:43.269> with<00:02:43.390> front

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
awful hard stock particularly with front

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.780 
awful hard stock particularly with front
discs<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.610> tried<00:02:46.090> moving<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.550> pivot<00:02:48.550> point

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
discs so I tried moving the pivot point

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.550 
discs so I tried moving the pivot point
on<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.120> brake<00:02:49.269> pedal<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.930> linkage<00:02:50.320> and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
on the brake pedal for the linkage and

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.500 
on the brake pedal for the linkage and
it<00:02:51.430> would<00:02:51.580> have<00:02:51.670> worked<00:02:51.790> fine<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.360> way

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
it would have worked fine that way

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.030 
it would have worked fine that way
except<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.080> kept<00:02:53.290> running<00:02:53.410> into<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.860> clutch

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
except I kept running into the clutch

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.380 
except I kept running into the clutch
language<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.660> added<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.440> bracket<00:02:57.310> behind<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
language so I added a bracket behind the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.500 
language so I added a bracket behind the
pedal<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.590> ran<00:03:00.100> an<00:03:00.340> intermediate<00:03:00.850> shaft<00:03:00.880> from

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
pedal and ran an intermediate shaft from

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.320 
pedal and ran an intermediate shaft from
the<00:03:01.660> brake<00:03:01.840> pedal<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:02.500> bill<00:03:03.100> crank<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
the brake pedal to this bill crank and a

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.490 
the brake pedal to this bill crank and a
second<00:03:04.660> shaft<00:03:04.870> from<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.230> bell<00:03:05.470> crank<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:06.459> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
second shaft from the bell crank to the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.660 
second shaft from the bell crank to the
master<00:03:08.500> cylinder<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:08.890> doubled<00:03:09.430> my

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
master cylinder and doubled my

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.000 
master cylinder and doubled my
mechanical<00:03:10.480> advantage<00:03:10.900> on<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> pedal<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.739> it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
mechanical advantage on the pedal is it

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.380 
mechanical advantage on the pedal is it
there's<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.370> what<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.610> did<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.880> doubled<00:03:13.209> your

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
there's that what it did it doubled your

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.720 
there's that what it did it doubled your
yes<00:03:13.720> your<00:03:14.049> leverage<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.920> stops<00:03:15.190> very<00:03:15.519> well

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
yes your leverage and it stops very well

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.150 
yes your leverage and it stops very well
mm-hmm<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.049> lot<00:03:17.230> less<00:03:17.410> pressure<00:03:17.650> we've

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
mm-hmm so a lot less pressure we've

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.650 
mm-hmm so a lot less pressure we've
we've<00:03:18.370> added<00:03:18.579> power<00:03:18.910> brakes<00:03:19.239> here<00:03:19.420> recently

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
we've added power brakes here recently

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.870 
we've added power brakes here recently
and<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.709> makes<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:21.040> big<00:03:21.190> difference<00:03:21.579> when<00:03:21.790> you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
and it makes a big difference when you

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.390 
and it makes a big difference when you
you<00:03:22.180> know<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.329> pushed<00:03:22.630> very<00:03:22.720> hard<00:03:23.250> well<00:03:24.250> what

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
you know I pushed very hard well what

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.120 
you know I pushed very hard well what
kind<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.760> stall<00:03:25.000> then<00:03:25.299> do<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.510> have<00:03:25.690> and

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
kind of a stall then do you have and

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.530 
kind of a stall then do you have and
that<00:03:27.130> helps<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.459> on<00:03:27.700> your<00:03:27.850> braking<00:03:28.239> on<00:03:28.390> the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
that helps to on your braking on the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.210 
that helps to on your braking on the
torque<00:03:28.780> converter<00:03:28.870> not<00:03:29.560> no<00:03:29.680> torque<00:03:29.920> converter

got<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.769> ER<00:03:35.860> transmissions<00:03:36.549> yes<00:03:36.910> everything

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
got and ER transmissions yes everything

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.660

you think you're gonna be the only one
with<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.140> standard<00:03:41.829> transmission<00:03:42.130> at<00:03:42.970> this

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
with the standard transmission at this

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.300 
with the standard transmission at this
point<00:03:43.390> yes<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:46.019> would<00:03:47.019> say<00:03:47.230> not<00:03:47.590> two<00:03:47.829> percent<00:03:48.220> of

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
point yes I would say not two percent of

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.509 
point yes I would say not two percent of
the<00:03:48.370> cars<00:03:48.640> because<00:03:49.120> it's<00:03:49.299> such<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.510> difficult

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
the cars because it's such a difficult

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.160 
the cars because it's such a difficult
engineering<00:03:51.519> feat<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.970> make<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.239> all<00:03:52.359> fit<00:03:52.600> and

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
engineering feat to make it all fit and

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.039 
engineering feat to make it all fit and
then<00:03:53.910> when<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.000> look<00:03:55.120> inside<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.690> got<00:03:55.810> room

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
then when you look inside you got room

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.199 
then when you look inside you got room
you<00:03:56.440> got<00:03:56.590> room<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.799> mount<00:03:57.250> your<00:03:57.489> pedals<00:03:57.820> one<00:03:58.090> of

you got room to mount your pedals one of
the<00:03:58.299> nice<00:03:58.450> things<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.829> spirit<00:04:00.160> kits

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
the nice things is that the spirit kits

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.330 
the nice things is that the spirit kits
have<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.670> fairly<00:04:01.359> flat<00:04:01.510> floor<00:04:02.190> some<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.280> the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
have a fairly flat floor some of the

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.740 
have a fairly flat floor some of the
others<00:04:03.640> they<00:04:03.880> wouldn't<00:04:04.150> have<00:04:04.239> not<00:04:04.510> have<00:04:04.630> been

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
others they wouldn't have not have been

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.960 
others they wouldn't have not have been
possible<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.350> get<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.650> pedals<00:04:05.769> in<00:04:06.280> there<00:04:06.519> I

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
possible to get the pedals in there I

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.690 
possible to get the pedals in there I
was<00:04:07.840> able<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.380> make<00:04:08.829> a<00:04:08.859> couple<00:04:09.130> of<00:04:09.340> angle

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
was able to make a couple of angle

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.229 
was able to make a couple of angle
brackets<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:10.269> tie<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.900> pedal<00:04:11.200> rods<00:04:11.410> and

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
brackets to tie on to the pedal rods and

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.349 
brackets to tie on to the pedal rods and
put<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.269> couple<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.750> Ford<00:04:14.079> truck<00:04:15.030> brake<00:04:16.030> pedal

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
put a couple of Ford truck brake pedal

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.289 
put a couple of Ford truck brake pedal
pads<00:04:16.539> on

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
pads on

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.499 
pads on
and<00:04:17.389> that<00:04:17.569> worked<00:04:18.349> out<00:04:18.470> very<00:04:18.530> well<00:04:19.180> it's<00:04:20.180> easy

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509 
and that worked out very well it's easy

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.450 
and that worked out very well it's easy
to<00:04:20.720> use<00:04:20.870> convenient<00:04:21.590> they<00:04:21.769> don't<00:04:21.949> the<00:04:22.160> pedals

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
to use convenient they don't the pedals

to use convenient they don't the pedals
don't<00:04:22.639> get<00:04:22.819> in<00:04:22.940> each<00:04:23.060> other's<00:04:23.210> way<00:04:24.250> at<00:04:25.250> least

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
don't get in each other's way at least

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.240 
don't get in each other's way at least
