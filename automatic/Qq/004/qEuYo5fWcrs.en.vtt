00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:01:24.910 

you

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:53.470 

straight<00:01:25.920> pipe<00:01:26.190> exhaust

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.550 

that's<00:01:54.480> pretty<00:01:54.690> loud<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.900> probably<00:01:55.200> started

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
that's pretty loud I probably started

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:10.120 
that's pretty loud I probably started
the<00:01:55.770> camera

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.410 

all<00:02:11.130> right<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.760> we're<00:02:11.880> gonna

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
all right so we're gonna

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.480 
all right so we're gonna
well<00:02:13.990> this<00:02:14.260> exhaust<00:02:14.710> on<00:02:14.980> here

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.860 

hopefully<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.240> going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.450> work<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.750> we're

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
hopefully it's going to work and we're

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.360 
hopefully it's going to work and we're
not<00:02:18.990> going<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> blow<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> hole<00:02:19.920> through<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
not going to blow a hole through the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.750 
not going to blow a hole through the
original<00:02:21.240> exhaust<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.340> that's<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.490> going<00:02:23.640> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
original exhaust and that's not going to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:03:29.199 
original exhaust and that's not going to
reach

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.589 

good<00:03:29.780> more<00:03:29.989> let's<00:03:30.230> do<00:03:30.409> it

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:04:23.680 

touch<00:03:33.170> more<00:03:33.439> on<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:33.739> side

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.120 

all<00:04:24.260> right

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.350 

okay<00:04:28.130> now<00:04:28.310> we're<00:04:28.430> going<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.610> fire<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:28.880> up<00:04:29.090> with

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
okay now we're going to fire it up with

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.000 
okay now we're going to fire it up with
the<00:04:29.540> open<00:04:30.020> RS<00:04:30.770> 3<00:04:31.300> exhaust<00:04:32.300> off<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.900> sv<00:04:33.199> 1000s

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
the open RS 3 exhaust off the sv 1000s

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.939 
the open RS 3 exhaust off the sv 1000s
and<00:04:35.110> then<00:04:36.110> we're<00:04:36.290> going<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.470> throw<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:36.919> a

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
and then we're going to throw in a

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.980 
and then we're going to throw in a
little<00:04:37.460> silencer<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.240> comes<00:04:38.600> with<00:04:38.810> those

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
little silencer that comes with those

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.110 
little silencer that comes with those
exhaust<00:04:39.410> pipes<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:39.919> see<00:04:40.130> if<00:04:40.190> there's<00:04:40.370> any<00:04:40.850> big

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
exhaust pipes and see if there's any big

00:04:41.120 --> 00:05:19.360 
exhaust pipes and see if there's any big
difference<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:41.990> sound

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.010 

there's<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.490> silencer<00:05:21.000> portion<00:05:21.420> that<00:05:21.570> fits<00:05:21.840> in

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
there's a silencer portion that fits in

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.420 
there's a silencer portion that fits in
it's<00:05:22.260> just<00:05:22.470> a<00:05:22.650> couple<00:05:23.100> of<00:05:23.250> screws<00:05:23.720> and

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
it's just a couple of screws and

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.900 
it's just a couple of screws and
hopefully<00:05:27.710> fits<00:05:28.710> in<00:05:28.950> here<00:05:29.160> without<00:05:29.340> any<00:05:29.700> kind

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
hopefully fits in here without any kind

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.750 
hopefully fits in here without any kind
of<00:05:30.060> major<00:05:30.750> issues<00:05:31.190> never<00:05:32.190> fit<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.580> one<00:05:32.670> of

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
of major issues never fit of one of

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.990 
of major issues never fit of one of
these<00:05:32.850> before<00:05:33.240> so<00:05:35.180> it<00:05:36.180> turns<00:05:36.390> out<00:05:36.570> that<00:05:36.930> these

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
these before so it turns out that these

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.390 
these before so it turns out that these
silencer<00:05:39.000> pieces<00:05:39.420> don't<00:05:39.780> fit<00:05:39.990> in<00:05:40.560> my<00:05:41.190> old

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
silencer pieces don't fit in my old

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.120 
silencer pieces don't fit in my old
exhaust<00:05:42.060> they<00:05:42.330> fit<00:05:42.540> in<00:05:42.660> physically<00:05:43.230> but<00:05:43.500> the

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
exhaust they fit in physically but the

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.280 
exhaust they fit in physically but the
bottom<00:05:44.970> and<00:05:45.150> top<00:05:45.270> holes<00:05:45.660> that<00:05:45.900> are<00:05:45.960> supposed

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
bottom and top holes that are supposed

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.680 
bottom and top holes that are supposed
to<00:05:46.380> be<00:05:46.470> there<00:05:46.650> for<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.920> screws<00:05:47.330> aren't<00:05:48.330> there

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
to be there for the screws aren't there

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.260 
to be there for the screws aren't there
I<00:05:48.720> guess<00:05:49.140> the<00:05:49.560> fit<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.520> newer<00:05:50.670> pipes<00:05:51.030> that<00:05:51.240> I

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
I guess the fit the newer pipes that I

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.920 
I guess the fit the newer pipes that I
have<00:05:51.450> now<00:05:52.430> so<00:05:53.430> or<00:05:53.610> obviously<00:05:54.120> not<00:05:54.360> going<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:54.870> be

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
have now so or obviously not going to be

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.490 
have now so or obviously not going to be
able<00:05:55.020> to<00:05:55.200> use<00:05:55.350> these

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
able to use these

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:19.429 
able to use these
sounds<00:05:58.190> good<00:05:58.310> anyway

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.230
