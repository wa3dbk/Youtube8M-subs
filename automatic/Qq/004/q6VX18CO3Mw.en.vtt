I<00:00:02.699> got<00:00:03.699> bored<00:00:05.610> so<00:00:06.610> this<00:00:06.940> is<00:00:07.030> my<00:00:07.150> poor<00:00:07.360> elegant

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
I got bored so this is my poor elegant

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.810 
I got bored so this is my poor elegant
script<00:00:07.810> that<00:00:08.499> I<00:00:08.530> made<00:00:08.860> because<00:00:09.249> I<00:00:10.059> got<00:00:10.839> bored

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
script that I made because I got bored

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.240 
script that I made because I got bored
really<00:00:12.820> bored

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.820 

yeah<00:00:16.250> it<00:00:16.490> works<00:00:17.060> obviously<00:00:17.960> not<00:00:18.140> as<00:00:18.230> not<00:00:18.710> as

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
yeah it works obviously not as not as

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.370 
yeah it works obviously not as not as
fancy<00:00:19.070> as<00:00:19.449> real<00:00:20.449> portal<00:00:20.779> you<00:00:20.869> can't<00:00:21.080> do<00:00:21.230> the

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
fancy as real portal you can't do the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.380 
fancy as real portal you can't do the
camera<00:00:21.949> thing<00:00:22.039> where<00:00:22.880> you<00:00:22.939> can<00:00:23.060> see<00:00:23.270> through

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
camera thing where you can see through

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.970 
camera thing where you can see through
the<00:00:23.480> portals<00:00:23.840> just<00:00:24.169> because<00:00:24.380> Claude<00:00:24.650> doesn't

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
the portals just because Claude doesn't

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.390 
the portals just because Claude doesn't
do<00:00:25.430> that<00:00:25.610> but<00:00:26.029> as<00:00:26.990> far<00:00:27.349> as<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:27.619> know<00:00:27.680> but<00:00:28.189> the

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
do that but as far as I know but the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.720 
do that but as far as I know but the
physics<00:00:29.020> works<00:00:30.020> pretty<00:00:30.619> well

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.900 

I<00:00:38.020> you<00:00:39.020> can<00:00:39.230> fall<00:00:39.680> from<00:00:40.160> portals<00:00:40.579> like<00:00:40.760> the

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
I you can fall from portals like the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.280 
I you can fall from portals like the
infinite<00:00:41.450> following<00:00:41.750> but<00:00:41.930> there's<00:00:42.170> no

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
infinite following but there's no

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.069 
infinite following but there's no
there's<00:00:42.800> no<00:00:42.860> places<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.400> do<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:43.970> here<00:00:47.079> you

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
there's no places to do that here you

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.190 
there's no places to do that here you
can<00:00:48.320> walk<00:00:48.559> through<00:00:48.590> portals<00:00:49.040> like<00:00:49.129> this

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
can walk through portals like this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.020 
can walk through portals like this
it<00:00:51.710> counts<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.160> rotations<00:00:52.580> by<00:00:52.730> walking

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
it counts the rotations by walking

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.850 
it counts the rotations by walking
backwards<00:00:53.450> I<00:00:53.600> come<00:00:53.780> out<00:00:53.930> back<00:00:54.440> over<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.740> their

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
backwards I come out back over to their

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.810 
backwards I come out back over to their
side

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.330 

nice<00:01:00.450> for<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> way<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.950> that<00:01:02.100> there<00:01:02.310> are

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
nice for the way here that there are

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.960 
nice for the way here that there are
sounds<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> reach<00:01:04.730> just<00:01:05.730> like<00:01:05.850> right

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
sounds do for the reach just like right

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.440 
sounds do for the reach just like right
there<00:01:06.060> portable<00:01:06.800> also<00:01:07.800> there<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.190> bad<00:01:09.120> place

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
there portable also there are bad place

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
there portable also there are bad place
effects<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.350> whenever<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.710> place<00:01:10.980> it<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.190> an

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
effects for whenever you place it on an

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.060 
effects for whenever you place it on an
on<00:01:11.460> flat<00:01:11.910> surface<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> blue<00:01:14.550> portal<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
on flat surface for the blue portal and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.990 
on flat surface for the blue portal and
for<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.160> orange<00:01:17.370> world

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.610 

and<00:01:23.470> finally<00:01:24.470> there's<00:01:24.940> velocity<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:26.930> works<00:01:27.170> -

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
and finally there's velocity it works -

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.160 
and finally there's velocity it works -
so<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:28.360> pull<00:01:29.360> up<00:01:29.390> here<00:01:29.840> -<00:01:31.570> if<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:32.720> pull<00:01:32.900> up<00:01:32.930> there

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
so I pull up here - if I pull up there

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.370 
so I pull up here - if I pull up there
and<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:33.950> go<00:01:34.160> through<00:01:35.620> slowly<00:01:36.620> I<00:01:37.300> just<00:01:38.300> fall<00:01:38.480> down

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.860 

but<00:01:42.380> if<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:42.620> go<00:01:42.800> through<00:01:43.130> with<00:01:43.790> velocity<00:01:44.780> like

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
but if I go through with velocity like

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.010 
but if I go through with velocity like
hey<00:01:44.990> I'm<00:01:45.230> a<00:01:45.290> jump<00:01:45.500> from<00:01:45.620> up<00:01:45.680> here<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:46.870> go<00:01:47.870> much

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
hey I'm a jump from up here I go much

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.560 
hey I'm a jump from up here I go much
farther

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.170 

and<00:01:54.100> finally<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:55.130> guess<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:55.430> can<00:01:55.549> come<00:01:56.000> play

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
and finally I guess you can come play

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.410 
and finally I guess you can come play
some<00:01:56.240> scientist<00:01:56.930> surfaces<00:01:57.289> too

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.179 

Lag

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.719 

just<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.969> expect<00:02:06.179> I<00:02:06.749> with<00:02:07.409> velocity<00:02:08.190> FX<00:02:08.459> -

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
just so you expect I with velocity FX -

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.089 
just so you expect I with velocity FX -
so<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.360> there's<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.259> enough<00:02:10.410> philosophy<00:02:10.590> or

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
so if I there's not enough philosophy or

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.940 
so if I there's not enough philosophy or
map<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.550> launch<00:02:11.730> me<00:02:11.910> up<00:02:12.000> here<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.870> if<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.290> yeah<00:02:13.920> I

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
map to launch me up here but if I yeah I

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.149 
map to launch me up here but if I yeah I
can<00:02:14.190> still<00:02:14.370> get<00:02:14.459> lunched

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.319 

the<00:02:21.159> velocity<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.579> little<00:02:21.819> messed<00:02:21.969> up<00:02:22.060> just

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
the velocity is a little messed up just

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.660 
the velocity is a little messed up just
cuz<00:02:22.480> Todd<00:02:23.049> is<00:02:23.200> weird<00:02:23.409> but<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:24.370> works<00:02:24.459> pretty

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
cuz Todd is weird but it works pretty

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.470 
cuz Todd is weird but it works pretty
well<00:02:24.790> most<00:02:25.060> time<00:02:25.299> I<00:02:25.540> jump<00:02:26.439> over<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.709> world<00:02:27.480> you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
well most time I jump over the world you

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:37.170 
well most time I jump over the world you
saw<00:02:28.629> their<00:02:32.189> place<00:02:33.189> here<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.920> says<00:02:36.519> hey<00:02:36.670> as<00:02:36.939> I'm

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
saw their place here and says hey as I'm

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.570 
saw their place here and says hey as I'm
falling<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:40.180> can<00:02:40.239> see<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.659> philosophy

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.660 

so<00:02:45.150> yeah<00:02:45.270> that's<00:02:45.810> pretty<00:02:46.310> much<00:02:47.310> it

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
so yeah that's pretty much it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.800 
so yeah that's pretty much it
I'm<00:02:49.090> rushing<00:02:49.480> oh<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.150> threat<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.569> mention

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
I'm rushing oh and a threat to mention

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.980 
I'm rushing oh and a threat to mention
all<00:02:52.990> this<00:02:53.380> worse<00:02:53.620> for<00:02:54.180> then<00:02:55.180> everything<00:02:55.870> all
