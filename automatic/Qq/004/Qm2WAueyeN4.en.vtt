00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello today we are going to do another craft to 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.580
 our baby pelÃ³n doll although this 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.650
 craft can serve you for 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.529
 Any doll that you have already 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.929
 you know we have a favorite and also 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.349
 we know that many of you follow us and you do 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.939
 our crafts a very big kiss 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.039
 from here to lucia who is in the Canary Islands 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.079
 today we are going to see today how we do this 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.550
 bathtub and at the end of the video I'm going to 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.019
 put different photos of the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.030
 crafts that we have already done for 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.520
 if you have missed any we are going to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.950
 start good to do it let's go to 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.140
 recycle fix a container of detergent 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.620
 it's a big container we also use rubber 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.080
 eva expensive glue also a box is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.780
 Optional and also optional jumping clay 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.670
 or modeling mass well then let's 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.670
 start we take this container that as I already 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.040
 we have said it is huge is xl to fix it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.050
 with a tip of our scissors we make 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.960
 a hole from that hole we're going 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.450
 cutting all around once cut 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.400
 what we do is cut again from 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.590
 way we remove all those little ones 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.810
 chips that remain when cutting as a 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.509
 chunks 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.820
 and we look man for what we want what 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.610
 we want smaller you see how this 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.799
 size and we would use a bathtub 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.570
 can even be fixed, but if the 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.220
 you want to make more elegant what 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.530
 we have to do is put it inside 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.840
 a box in that case is better than 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.210
 you would have cut the height to the height of 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.640
 high of the box, well, only 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.979
 we have to make a hole of it 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.840
 size than our container and once 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.289
 that we have the hole made there 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.299
 we will put our container now the 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.880
 Bath is cool because around 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.909
 the same we can put little things you see 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.409
 we would invent the good doll then let's go 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.240
 to form this box that is also 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.429
 recycled we will cover it with eva rubber 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.920
 for that I start by covering 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.929
 side when we made the stroller 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.539
 dolls and we lined a box then 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.770
 I do not entertain myself much but you see in 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.590
 this case I have to make one with the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.799
 center written eva rubber and now 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.110
 I do diagonally short the corners the 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.950
 he turned inside and I already have lined 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.950
 also the hole 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.770
 once I have lined the hole already 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.200
 I can put in the center of the container 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.180
 and the ideal is that it but it's a bit in 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.690
 the corners with a little bit of cola 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.690
 hot 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.130
 now we are going to make a pad 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.590
 normal eva rubber so they put on the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.450
 bathtub more comfortable then what 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.010
 we do is cut a rubber rectangle 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.319
 eva in this case we have made it white 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.209
 so that it changes a little we put 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.300
 glue on one end and 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.930
 we close we put now on the side and 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.329
 we close also 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.250
 and the interior we will fill it with 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.200
 pieces of plastic bag because it is 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.599
 a way also to recycle bags of 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.760
 we cut them into pieces and the 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.970
 we use stuffing 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.530
 fill tight squeezing because we have 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.180
 that push a lot a lot for when 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.220
 we have on the other side already then 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.650
 we hold the pad a little 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.720
 We also close with hot glue and do not 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.530
 we have more to put at one end 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.530
 from our bathtub 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.470
 now with the jumping clay or the mass is 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.140
 moldable is very soft what we are going to 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.690
 to do is a duckling then it is modeled 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.270
 just like the plasticine we modeled a 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.800
 duckling and seen the seen at the end of 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.900
 video I say do your head more 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.300
 little girl and the biggest body for 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.770
 that stays in that position I say seen 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.350
 seen it because we put him to swim and 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.660
 boom falls to one side 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.120
 Well, look, I put my doll in 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.130
 the bathtub I put the towel and his duck 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.470
 you want to see other crafts that we have 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.080
 made for the bald, look, we have 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.360
 also made a bed if you remember it 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.940
 With eva rubber we have also made a 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.770
 armchair with a bottle of coke a 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.050
 stroller ride we have also 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.170
 made clothes with a sock and we made 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.180
 these three clothes or this monkey 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.490
 or we even see designs a pattern that 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.950
 you have on our website to make a 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.600
 Santa costume or a costume is 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.230
 easy but with the same pattern you can 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.470
 make any dress 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.420
 Well, what did you think about it ? 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.280
 we have done the basics of the bathtub but 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.280
 that we have put a pillow so that 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.350
 bathe comfortably and we have put 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.090
 many little details now because from where 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.920
 are you remember the big box that 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.110
 come or street us as we have taken 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.770
 some false and we have put them in 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.950
 his bathtub we have also made a soap 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.840
 that as very easy you just have to go to 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.820
 our parents or yourselves when 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.800
 go to a hotel, take a 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.240
 little pill of those that come and the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.910
 covered in the small data for 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.220
 your dolls the only penalty has been 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.050
 our little duckling I thought that with this 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.270
 plasticine that was like little gum 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.200
 set yourself to vote boots if you had made a 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.440
 ball could vote water aquatic not 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.440
 is 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.339
 note once the mention of water 

00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:21.929
 distinguishes a little something that you expect 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.839
 be a little more times just take a 

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:27.089
 What we can do also is a 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:29.339
 village to put all your 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:31.769
 things the next day we will do our best 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:35.249
 prevent cris to make the furniture os 

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:36.719
 So it seems a video that comes not the 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:38.729

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.129

 your little things by the way in this video 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:48.689

 hyper here in the area for one euro 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:58.189
