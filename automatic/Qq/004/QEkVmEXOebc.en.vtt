this<00:00:16.500> way<00:00:16.740> better<00:00:16.770> because<00:00:17.900> my<00:00:18.900> smaller<00:00:19.350> child

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
this way better because my smaller child

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.759 
this way better because my smaller child
is<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> leaner<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.210> if<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.930> try<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.170> put<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> back

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
went on well it's already on will

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.689 
went on well it's already on will
basically<00:00:26.880> almost<00:00:27.119> fall<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.519> this<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
basically almost fall out so this is a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.350 
basically almost fall out so this is a
size<00:00:29.970> 6<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:32.009> actually<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.759> probably

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
size 6 you can actually do this probably

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.569 
size 6 you can actually do this probably
with<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.510> size<00:00:33.719> five<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:34.829> my<00:00:35.010> size<00:00:35.250> or

it's<00:06:42.740> really<00:06:43.040> there<00:06:43.250> so<00:06:43.460> I<00:06:43.520> would<00:06:43.730> think<00:06:43.940> this

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
it's really there so I would think this

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.810 
it's really there so I would think this
one<00:06:45.110> going<00:06:45.410> up<00:06:45.680> over<00:06:45.920> my<00:06:46.160> shoulder<00:06:46.490> this<00:06:46.640> way
