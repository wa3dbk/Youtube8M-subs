00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
saying that this new s3 is very similar

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.770 
saying that this new s3 is very similar
to<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.800> s7<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.759> released<00:00:32.969> yet<00:00:33.239> last

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
to the s7 that was released yet last

to the s7 that was released yet last
year<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.140> appearance<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.510> reason

as a 1080p resolution of course 1080p is
a<00:00:44.399> norm<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.879> Mike<00:00:45.809> remember<00:00:46.200> 10<00:00:46.379> 1080p<00:00:47.070> was

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
a norm now Mike remember 10 1080p was

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.049 
a norm now Mike remember 10 1080p was
just<00:00:47.430> brand<00:00:47.670> new<00:00:47.960> as<00:00:48.960> well<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.320> 720p<00:00:49.980> um<00:00:50.760> so

about<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:41.009> i<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.310> my<00:01:41.430> chance<00:01:41.990> another

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
about it now i get my chance another

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
about it now i get my chance another
similar<00:01:43.380> feature<00:01:43.590> between<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> s3<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
similar feature between the s3 and the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.660 
similar feature between the s3 and the
s7<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.470> s3<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.399> able<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
s7 is that the s3 is going to be able to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.230 
s7 is that the s3 is going to be able to
bend<00:01:47.990> 180<00:01:48.990> degrees<00:01:49.380> backwards<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> s7

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
bend 180 degrees backwards like the s7

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020 
bend 180 degrees backwards like the s7
from<00:01:51.540> last<00:01:51.750> year<00:01:52.049> also<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> s7<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
from last year also the s7 have the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.539 
from last year also the s7 have the
gorilla<00:01:54.299> glass<00:01:54.600> backing<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.649> s3<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.130> actually

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
gorilla glass backing the s3 is actually

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.880 
gorilla glass backing the s3 is actually
going<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:56.969> aluminum<00:01:57.420> backing<00:01:57.770> also<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
going to have aluminum backing also the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.410 
going to have aluminum backing also the
note<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.280> some<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.670> models<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> s3

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
note that some of the models on the s3

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.929 
note that some of the models on the s3
may<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> new<00:02:01.860> Haswell<00:02:02.280> processor

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
may not have the new Haswell processor

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.209 
may not have the new Haswell processor
so<00:02:03.570> i<00:02:03.600> do<00:02:03.810> hope<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.200> you're<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> lucky<00:02:05.040> few

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
so i do hope that you're the lucky few

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.190 
so i do hope that you're the lucky few
