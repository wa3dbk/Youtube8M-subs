description<00:00:09.710> and<00:00:11.690> here<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.719> go<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.960> first<00:00:13.940> so

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
description and here we go in first so

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.390 
description and here we go in first so
as<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.450> may<00:00:16.260> or<00:00:16.350> may<00:00:16.470> not<00:00:16.500> know<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.920> always<00:00:17.220> do

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
as you may or may not know I always do

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.150 
as you may or may not know I always do
orange<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:18.960> case<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.800> orange

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
orange and in this case to do orange

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.650 
orange and in this case to do orange
cross<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.609> would<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.000> piece<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.539> this

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
cross it would do this piece and this

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.460 
cross it would do this piece and this
piece<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:22.230> would<00:00:22.920> solve<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:24.109> this<00:00:25.109> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
piece I would solve it like this and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.210 
piece I would solve it like this and
this<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.890> can

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
this and this one and this one I can

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.790 
this and this one and this one I can
just<00:00:29.400> go<00:00:30.529> here<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.739> now<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
just go here and here like that now the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.590 
just go here and here like that now the
first<00:00:34.980> thing<00:00:35.130> i<00:00:35.250> sees<00:00:35.430> these<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.180> i<00:00:36.210> hate

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
first thing i sees these but i hate

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440 
first thing i sees these but i hate
doing<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.320> i<00:00:37.350> look<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.430> harder<00:00:39.120> i

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
doing this so i look a little harder i

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.380 
doing this so i look a little harder i
see<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.770> again<00:00:41.070> another<00:00:41.340> crappy<00:00:41.700> case<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.360> i

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
see this again another crappy case but i

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.030 
see this again another crappy case but i
also<00:00:42.629> saw<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.440> i'll<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.710> ahead<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.890> do

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
also saw this so i'll go ahead and do

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.250 
also saw this so i'll go ahead and do
this<00:00:44.190> pair<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:47.840> i<00:00:48.840> also<00:00:48.989> noticed

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this pair like that and i also noticed

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.770 
this pair like that and i also noticed
this<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.449> so<00:00:51.449> i'm<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> go

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
this and this now so i'm going to go

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
this and this now so i'm going to go
solve<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.739> i<00:00:53.219> also<00:00:53.250> notice<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.760> pair

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
solve this and i also notice this pair

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.270 
solve this and i also notice this pair
being<00:00:54.239> formed<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.469> i'll<00:00:55.530> try<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> preserve<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
being formed so i'll try to preserve it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700 
being formed so i'll try to preserve it
until<00:00:56.670> i<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.820> insert<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.360> I've<00:00:57.510> got<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.469> now

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
until i can insert it I've got this now

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.360 
until i can insert it I've got this now
so<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> insert<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:01.370> this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
so I'm going to insert this and this

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.860 
so I'm going to insert this and this
last<00:01:02.609> pair<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.329> insert<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
last pair can insert it with a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
last pair can insert it with a
sledgehammer<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.769> better<00:01:04.949> edge

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
sledgehammer to get better edge

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:15.679 
sledgehammer to get better edge
orientation<00:01:06.049> now<00:01:07.049> although<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:09.710> PLO<00:01:14.689> like

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
orientation now although and PLO like

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.960 
orientation now although and PLO like
that

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:31.039 

ok<00:01:23.970> now<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:29.840> probably<00:01:30.840> solve

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
ok now for this one I probably solve

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.160 
ok now for this one I probably solve
this<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.440> here<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> yellow<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this one here and then the yellow and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.219 
this one here and then the yellow and
then<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.040> would<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.899> can<00:01:36.960> solve

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
then I would do this so you can solve

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.120 
then I would do this so you can solve
the<00:01:37.409> blue<00:01:38.810> like<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.530> i<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.710> first<00:01:40.920> thing

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the blue like that and i was first thing

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.590 
the blue like that and i was first thing
the<00:01:41.280> first<00:01:41.310> thing<00:01:41.580> I<00:01:41.729> notice<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.270> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the first thing I notice is this and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.779 
the first thing I notice is this and
this<00:01:42.659> said<00:01:43.649> go<00:01:43.799> ahead<00:01:43.860> solve<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
this said go ahead solve that and it

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.880 
this said go ahead solve that and it
also<00:01:44.970> noticed<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> take<00:01:46.799> off

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
also noticed this so when I take off

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.240 
also noticed this so when I take off
this<00:01:47.009> pair<00:01:47.070> it'll<00:01:47.940> make<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.299> pair<00:01:49.190> so<00:01:50.190> I'm

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this pair it'll make this pair so I'm

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.620 
this pair it'll make this pair so I'm
going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.430> go<00:01:50.520> ahead<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.729> insert<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.330> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
going to go ahead and insert that and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.990 
going to go ahead and insert that and
also<00:01:52.320> notice<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.610> I'm<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
also notice this so I'm going to get a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.200 
also notice this so I'm going to get a
three<00:01:54.240> move<00:01:54.360> insert<00:01:55.130> like<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:57.000> quite

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
three move insert like that just quite

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.660 
three move insert like that just quite
awesome<00:01:57.830> now<00:01:58.830> for<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> last<00:01:59.190> pair<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
awesome now for the last pair and you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.550 
awesome now for the last pair and you
can<00:01:59.759> do<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.659> orient<00:02:01.140> all<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> edges<00:02:02.210> um

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
can do this to orient all the edges um

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.490 
can do this to orient all the edges um
now<00:02:04.560> I've<00:02:04.649> got<00:02:04.830> soon<00:02:05.990> there's<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.050> better<00:02:07.229> bar

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
now I've got soon there's a better bar

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
now I've got soon there's a better bar
here<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.860> i'll<00:02:07.950> go<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.910> can

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
here so i'll go like this so that it can

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.479 
here so i'll go like this so that it can
get<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.269> J<00:02:09.720> Brand<00:02:09.869> more<00:02:10.019> summer<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:11.370> got

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
get like a J Brand more summer and I got

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.960 
get like a J Brand more summer and I got
a<00:02:11.519> beeper<00:02:11.730> okay<00:02:12.480> well<00:02:12.799> they<00:02:13.799> did<00:02:13.980> have<00:02:14.130> um

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
a beeper okay well they did have um

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.420 
a beeper okay well they did have um
diagonal<00:02:15.840> swap<00:02:16.260> corners<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.130> should<00:02:17.340> have

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
diagonal swap corners so I should have

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:29.700 
diagonal swap corners so I should have
figured<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.670> out<00:02:25.010> okay

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.770 

oh<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:30.460> is<00:02:30.550> pretty<00:02:30.670> good<00:02:30.880> one<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.450> what<00:02:31.750> I

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
oh this is pretty good one so what I

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.150 
oh this is pretty good one so what I
would<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.230> would<00:02:32.350> bring<00:02:32.590> these<00:02:32.830> two<00:02:32.980> down

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
would do is I would bring these two down

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.610 
would do is I would bring these two down
so<00:02:33.910> they<00:02:34.060> match<00:02:34.210> up<00:02:34.270> with<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.020> blue<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.440> green

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
so they match up with the blue and green

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
so they match up with the blue and green
I<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:36.400> be<00:02:36.520> like<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.870> FB<00:02:37.870> move<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.550> bring<00:02:39.550> it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
I can be like a FB move of that bring it

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.750 
I can be like a FB move of that bring it
down<00:02:39.760> like<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.080> um<00:02:41.580> now<00:02:42.580> I've<00:02:42.670> got

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
down like that like that um now I've got

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.970 
down like that like that um now I've got
two<00:02:42.910> things<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.270> see<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.200> I'll<00:02:44.620> do

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
two things I see this and this I'll do

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.370 
two things I see this and this I'll do
this<00:02:45.100> one<00:02:45.160> first<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.760> that'll<00:02:46.720> go<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.170> do<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
this one first and that'll go and do the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.410 
this one first and that'll go and do the
other<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.680> after<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.370> insert<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.090> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
other and after so I insert this and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.150 
other and after so I insert this and
also<00:02:49.870> notice<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.710> I'm<00:02:50.770> going<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:50.950> do<00:02:51.040> that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
also notice this so I'm going to do that

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.680 
also notice this so I'm going to do that
one<00:02:51.220> after<00:02:51.550> this<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:56.290> corner<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.120> edge<00:02:58.120> here

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
one after this but corner and edge here

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.870 
one after this but corner and edge here
and<00:02:58.890> now<00:02:59.890> if<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.070> do<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.280> pair<00:03:00.490> i'm<00:03:00.670> going<00:03:00.820> to

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
and now if you do this pair i'm going to

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.340 
and now if you do this pair i'm going to
take<00:03:01.270> out<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.510> edge<00:03:01.600> like<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.260> it

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
take out the edge like this so that it

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.590 
take out the edge like this so that it
can<00:03:02.440> orient<00:03:02.770> all<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.010> edges<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.150> basically

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
can orient all the edges so basically

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.860 
can orient all the edges so basically
replace<00:03:05.760> both<00:03:06.760> an<00:03:07.030> oriented<00:03:07.420> edges<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:08.410> that

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
replace both an oriented edges like that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.210 
replace both an oriented edges like that
now<00:03:11.100> this<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.580> would<00:03:13.420> do<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.600> CLL<00:03:14.410> but<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.010> don't

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
now this I would do the CLL but I don't

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.250 
now this I would do the CLL but I don't
really<00:03:15.370> do<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.610> often<00:03:15.880> for<00:03:16.210> to<00:03:16.990> land<00:03:17.140> at

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
really do it often for to land at

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.840 
really do it often for to land at
solving<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.740> they<00:03:18.280> notice<00:03:18.550> that<00:03:18.900> um<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.850> will

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
solving and they notice that um I will

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.950 
solving and they notice that um I will
probably<00:03:22.270> get<00:03:22.360> an<00:03:22.480> apron<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:23.050> do<00:03:23.230> this<00:03:23.440> out<00:03:23.620> so

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
probably get an apron I do this out so

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.370 
probably get an apron I do this out so
I'll<00:03:25.960> do<00:03:26.110> this<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:27.340> got<00:03:27.490> an<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:27.670> perm<00:03:27.880> so<00:03:28.380> ATMs

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
I'll do this and I got an a perm so ATMs

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:44.660 
I'll do this and I got an a perm so ATMs
are<00:03:29.500> pretty<00:03:29.710> good<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:31.630> that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.250 

okay<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.820> is<00:03:45.940> pretty<00:03:46.090> good<00:03:46.180> as<00:03:46.330> well<00:03:46.390> so

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
okay this is pretty good as well so

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.450 
okay this is pretty good as well so
would<00:03:47.530> go<00:03:48.460> and<00:03:48.610> solve<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.180> piece<00:03:50.430> like<00:03:51.430> that

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
would go and solve this piece like that

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.580 
would go and solve this piece like that
with<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.450> B<00:03:52.630> move<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.080> then<00:03:53.200> I'll<00:03:53.290> bring<00:03:53.410> this

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
with the B move and then I'll bring this

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.750 
with the B move and then I'll bring this
up<00:03:53.830> I'm<00:03:54.550> gonna<00:03:54.760> bring<00:03:55.000> solve<00:03:55.750> this<00:03:55.990> one<00:03:56.760> like

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
up I'm gonna bring solve this one like

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.000 
up I'm gonna bring solve this one like
that<00:03:59.280> now<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.310> see<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.640> blue<00:04:00.880> here<00:04:01.570> I<00:04:02.500> could

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
that now I see the blue here I could

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.310 
that now I see the blue here I could
just<00:04:03.160> do<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:03.940> instead<00:04:04.300> i'll<00:04:04.480> go<00:04:04.690> like

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
just do this but instead i'll go like

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.720 
just do this but instead i'll go like
this<00:04:05.560> so<00:04:06.070> that<00:04:06.220> i<00:04:06.250> can<00:04:06.840> or<00:04:07.840> at<00:04:07.990> this<00:04:08.140> edge<00:04:10.320> and

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
this so that i can or at this edge and

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.130 
this so that i can or at this edge and
next<00:04:12.730> thing<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:12.940> see<00:04:13.120> is<00:04:13.180> this<00:04:13.360> corner<00:04:13.900> in<00:04:14.050> this

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
next thing I see is this corner in this

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.100 
next thing I see is this corner in this
edge<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:17.850> now<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:18.910> see<00:04:19.090> this<00:04:19.270> and<00:04:19.570> this<00:04:19.810> so

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
edge and now I see this and this so

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:35.790 
edge and now I see this and this so
solve<00:04:20.980> this<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:26.550> hola<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:31.860> F<00:04:32.860> time<00:04:34.800> now

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
solve this and this hola and F time now

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:48.800 
solve this and this hola and F time now
for<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.190> final<00:04:36.760> soul

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:56.820 

ok<00:04:49.810> so<00:04:50.410> for<00:04:50.590> this<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:51.009> would<00:04:51.340> do<00:04:51.610> I<00:04:55.440> would<00:04:56.440> do

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
ok so for this I would do I would do

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.930 
ok so for this I would do I would do
this<00:04:56.979> to<00:04:57.280> move<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:58.090> one<00:04:58.330> in<00:04:58.539> here<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.199> go<00:05:00.069> solve

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
this to move this one in here I go solve

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.869 
this to move this one in here I go solve
this<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.449> this<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.250> then<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.280> would<00:05:03.460> do<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.580> d

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:03.879 
this and this and then I would do a d

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.899 
this and this and then I would do a d
move<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.389> solve<00:05:05.199> this<00:05:05.379> piece<00:05:05.879> meanwhile<00:05:06.879> i

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
move and solve this piece meanwhile i

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.420 
move and solve this piece meanwhile i
see<00:05:07.180> this<00:05:07.300> pair<00:05:07.569> so<00:05:07.930> i'm<00:05:08.020> going<00:05:08.169> to<00:05:08.430> notice

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
see this pair so i'm going to notice

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.589 
see this pair so i'm going to notice
solve<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.879> right<00:05:10.060> after<00:05:11.050> here<00:05:11.650> and<00:05:12.449> i<00:05:13.449> also

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
solve it right after here and i also

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.059 
solve it right after here and i also
noticed<00:05:13.870> this<00:05:14.169> i'm<00:05:14.560> going<00:05:14.620> to<00:05:14.770> get<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:14.889> three

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
noticed this i'm going to get a three

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:19.920 
noticed this i'm going to get a three
move<00:05:15.220> insert<00:05:15.490> here<00:05:15.789> and<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.940> thing<00:05:19.330> on<00:05:19.569> the

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
move insert here and this thing on the

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.350 
move insert here and this thing on the
back<00:05:20.050> this<00:05:20.289> edge<00:05:20.560> is<00:05:20.590> solved<00:05:21.280> so<00:05:22.120> i'm<00:05:22.180> going<00:05:22.270> to

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
back this edge is solved so i'm going to

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.809 
back this edge is solved so i'm going to
flow<00:05:22.599> like<00:05:22.630> this<00:05:23.069> keyhole<00:05:24.069> insert<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.789> here

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
flow like this keyhole insert it here

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.339 
flow like this keyhole insert it here
and<00:05:25.289> then<00:05:26.289> I'm<00:05:26.349> going<00:05:26.470> to<00:05:26.500> get<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.770> pretty<00:05:27.759> easy

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
and then I'm going to get a pretty easy

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:35.010 
and then I'm going to get a pretty easy
blasts<00:05:29.349> lon<00:05:30.840> like<00:05:31.840> this<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:32.979> this<00:05:33.759> oh<00:05:34.030> wait<00:05:34.870> no

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
blasts lon like this and this oh wait no

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.029 
blasts lon like this and this oh wait no
just<00:05:35.800> anti<00:05:36.099> soon<00:05:36.280> and<00:05:37.050> G<00:05:38.050> prime<00:05:38.319> it's<00:05:38.650> all<00:05:38.740> one

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
just anti soon and G prime it's all one

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.010 
just anti soon and G prime it's all one
block<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.610> take<00:05:40.030> out<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.180> pair<00:05:41.759> like<00:05:42.759> that<00:05:43.020> so

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
block and take out the pair like that so

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.360 
block and take out the pair like that so
that's<00:05:44.199> it<00:05:44.319> for<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:44.500> video<00:05:44.710> thanks<00:05:45.219> for
