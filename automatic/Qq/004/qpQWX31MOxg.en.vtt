00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
the win Oh F such a good move it was a

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.740 
the win Oh F such a good move it was a
free<00:02:32.709> plea<00:02:33.010> move<00:02:33.219> but<00:02:33.459> reminds<00:02:34.180> me<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
free plea move but reminds me of the the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.599 
free plea move but reminds me of the the
starship<00:02:35.140> pain<00:02:35.349> a<00:02:35.379> little<00:02:35.590> bit<00:02:35.829> yeah<00:02:36.129> I<00:02:36.159> think

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
starship pain a little bit yeah I think

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.309 
starship pain a little bit yeah I think
that's<00:02:36.879> her<00:02:37.269> move<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.629> even<00:02:37.810> more<00:02:37.930> effective

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
that's her move is even more effective

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.929 
that's her move is even more effective
than<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:38.560> because<00:02:38.769> she<00:02:39.370> doesn't<00:02:39.519> spin<00:02:39.849> her

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
than that because she doesn't spin her

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.750 
than that because she doesn't spin her
out<00:02:40.090> or<00:02:40.239> anything<00:02:40.420> no<00:02:41.159> all<00:02:42.159> right<00:02:42.280> moved<00:02:42.609> on<00:02:42.700> to

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
keep viewing until payback or maybe

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.710
