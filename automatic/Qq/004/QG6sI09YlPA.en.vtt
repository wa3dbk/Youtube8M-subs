00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.190
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.370
 I have to give you that outdoor 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.559
 Test toys and he wanted me too 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.170
 thanks again at hallimasch and at 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.059
 amigo game and leisure that i have this 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.420
 play for you was allowed to test 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.100
 and then we start right there 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.720
 I could be the game 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.060
 not at all though is a very 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.550
 so popular game with stefan raab 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 I could not beat the raab 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.859
 and it's more like a bowling game 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.649
 remember that as much as possible comes in 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.160
 a wooden box with 12 00 to one 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.559
 buchholz down number pad and that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.809
 Of course I showed all of them to me 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.730
 I filmed the whole thing with you and have 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.649
 found two volunteers and mine 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.070
 siblings thanks again to you the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.449
 have tested the game and the whole 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 Let's get together right away 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.870
 look at 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.750
 let's get to the game preparation and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.559
 the wood cone be just like me 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.500
 the just presenter wood on wood 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.229
 juxtaposed also numbered so 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.090
 how I am doing that and that yes 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.920
 Whole is best on grass or sand 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.470
 played up we have the endurance test 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.080
 made and have the whole on asphalt 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.650
 tried and the result will be 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.650
 you will see soon 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.409
 Let's go with the game and after we 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.470
 we have made the wooden birds 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.170
 12 area and four steps that we 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.100
 approximately between 3 and 4 meters apart 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.900
 do you have the bowling in the first passage 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.729
 will be the order of the players 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.040
 drawn in the following passes 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.740
 the sequence results from the 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.840
 scored points with the players 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.660
 least points starts and one 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.570
 Germany ended with the best 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.729
 the previous passage there my brother 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.680
 Sam scored the least score 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.619
 He was allowed to start and as you can see 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.410
 he can do it just right and that 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.630
 he puts the wooden chain exactly the same or 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.729
 put them back exactly like them 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.110
 have fallen 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.230
 Now I show you the whole of the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.989
 another perspective and explain yourself 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.390
 gameplay continues through the throw 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.890
 a single wood cone overturned 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.890
 the player receives the number of the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.050
 two points are saluted as points 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.880
 or several cones overturned 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.790
 it was with my brother now 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.130
 this is how the player gets the number 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.989
 The overturned the cone as a score 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.010
 do not write down the sum of the 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.660
 printed numbers on the whole record 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.540
 Of course we are in the enclosed 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.370
 and then you see another ten 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.709
 Points 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.930
 The throw wood may only from below 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.280
 not in broken up 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.010
 shoulder height or upside down player 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.480
 Two hands knocked over five cones 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.180
 and that's why she has one now 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.100
 score of 5, she would only have one 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.709
 we would have the number overturned 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.910
 to calculate the level but in 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.160
 the event there are just as 505 woods 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.690
 but overturned during the games are 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.400
 we started from 6 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.989
 Unfortunately, we can not do that now 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.959
 you change the more they're simply more 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.790
 again agreed 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.920
 and because everyone is just a throw before 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.410
 Passage is again player number 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.630
 1 turn and we can see it is one 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.160
 null round he has no wooden ball 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.590
 overturned and that's why 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.310
 either zero or make one 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.310
 dashed there 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.880
 Now it's time for us again 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.160
 that is also a zero round 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.290
 So we make another stroke 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.840
 since the level has not fallen over games 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.400
 1 is back and you see Amy has 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.230
 his second zero round player is two 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.880
 and hens has three cones 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.780
 because of that she has one 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.780
 score of 3 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.739
 is written down a 3 thats the three 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.049
 consecutively without points remained 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.049
 He will be the new protocol leader 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.470
 nunez hens and hens again 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.509
 throw a cone and that means we 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.449
 do not count the number of cones now 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.690
 but the number on the lid 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.729
 is on it and that is the 10th 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.889
 and so the game continues and the 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.620
 two players fight each other from round to 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.310
 round on and the exciting thing is that 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.650
 At the end of the 50 to the 50 points 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.880
 can not exceed otherwise you fall 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.160
 canon has 25 points here 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.020
 a wood cone overturned with the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.840
 Number 8 becomes an eight 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.490
 now we are included 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.740
 round 9 without chemistry ag 10 disorderly 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.419
 a cone becomes the number 10 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.759
 written down and now it will 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.060
 exciting that he only gives me twelve 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:11.490
 Points are missing to crack the 50th 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.570
 Let's see who's going right now 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.570
 first bright redial 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:23.339
 canon now has 39 points and 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.779
 here eleven points would be missing for the victory 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.909
 Unfortunately, she now has a zero round 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.419
 and that's why it's me now 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.419
 turn it back on 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.820
 sandy are missing exactly twelve points and he 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.770
 has focused on the twelve and 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.920
 he really overturned him too 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.910
 has exactly 50 points and that's why he goes 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.480
 as the winner of this game and would have the 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:55.200
 but now more than 50 would have had 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.640
 dropped back to 25 points but that 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.330
 is not happening heartfelt 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.960
 congratulation 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.210
 my conclusion to the outdoor game possible 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.950
 I find it really very well done it 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.630
 can be great with his family now 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.750
 play or with his friends 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.720
 You can do it with kids from the fifth 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.520
 play year and I found it 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.680
 really fun although i only like 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.420
 Camerawoman served but mine 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.910
 siblings had a lot in every case 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.290
 have fun and that will not be 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.220
 Last time we play this game 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.840
 have played 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.300
 You are welcome in the comments 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.670
 write your game finds and whether 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.320
 he knew it before i did 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.250
 not even knew it even 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.510
 I give championships and tournaments 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.130
 I'm definitely looking forward to your 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.990
 comments and hope that you have the video 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.160
 has fallen and until another 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.160
 typical of me
