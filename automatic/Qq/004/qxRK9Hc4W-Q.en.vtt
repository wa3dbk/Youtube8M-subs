term<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.320> go<00:01:13.439> over<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.400> know<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
term you just go over there you know and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
just put the ball in her court situation

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
just put the ball in her court situation
to<00:01:17.340> probably<00:01:17.610> work<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:17.939> better<00:01:18.180> because<00:01:18.420> your

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
to probably work out better because your

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.940 
to probably work out better because your
instincts<00:01:18.990> told<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.530> should<00:01:19.799> do

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
instincts told you what you should do

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.560 
instincts told you what you should do
but<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.400> take<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.850> time<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.360> think

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
but if you take all that time to think

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.630 
but if you take all that time to think
about<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.200> him<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.590> hall<00:01:22.799> maybe<00:01:23.520> I

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
about it to him in hall maybe I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.800 
about it to him in hall maybe I
shouldn't<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.210> keep<00:01:24.390> second-guessing

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
shouldn't you keep second-guessing

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
shouldn't you keep second-guessing
yourself<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:26.070> end<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.430> messing<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
yourself you end up messing up the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.420 
yourself you end up messing up the
moment<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.869> end<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.159> into

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
moment and then you end up you get into

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
moment and then you end up you get into
your<00:01:29.579> head<00:01:29.729> too<00:01:30.030> much<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.479> got<00:01:30.750> talked<00:01:30.990> about

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
your head too much I got talked about

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.899

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
before when you push the energy outward

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.140 
before when you push the energy outward
using<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:34.380> bold<00:01:34.680> approach<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.820> push<00:01:36.030> the
