00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.089
 this program technique modems start 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.330
 in the eyes of Sakha graduate student in Moscow Physics 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.690
 technical institute yes tea 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.320
 who invented and at the same time projectors and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.670
 implemented his ideas and then usach 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.089
 Hello 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.509
 for an answer to don I immediately have a question about wood 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.980
 as the very same idea came up 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.849
 conducted by management 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.050
 whom they usually say 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.130
 that's something that is not enough life, people came up 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.349
 this innovation is like that why suddenly the projector 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.060
 where did it all come from 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.240
 well actually is not myself 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.430
 came up with a massive now 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.690
 team of 612 people of Novgorod 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.520
 coin issue came past four years 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.420
 backwards 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080
 until they can also be delivered 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.410
 it's hard for the fourth to finish the fight 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.280
 dad went to base percentage department 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.800
 we have the essence of the program as follows 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.740
 That way this year teaches that basic 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.200
 disciplines then three years yes attached 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.850
 what 3 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.210
 in the operating enterprise there 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.020
 are friends 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.270
 nbu ending that same job what 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.150
 reason for several years here and 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.290
 own home I base department there n 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.180
 in one of the laboratories group 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.390
 Yes, already created by earning 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.240
 laboratory sample right again 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.480
 pro-rectors who are scattered 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.340
 demonstrates image mode 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.890
 the only thing that was sales 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410
 devices which country there 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.240
 collapsed it could not be transferred 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.049
 to the next 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.259
 He then if u drove to the exhibition projects in 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.119
 country training later 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.780
 month and student after welding the truck crane was 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 by size 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.580
 so just a piece of paper had absolutely 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.940
 dark room but he was colored yes 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.080
 bronze 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.920
 and here that was when I came 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.030
 we were shown to develop 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.000
 the person who created it all sold 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.710
 percent 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.810
 dismantling dismissed and let's 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.700
 make big what is same big to you 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.100
 villages mass beautiful city yes 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.450
 and here is how to try to agree 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.410
 It turned out that he had four years in his 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:58.499
 the museum
