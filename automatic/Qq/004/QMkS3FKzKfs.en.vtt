00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
around the world on a 70 foot yacht we

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.240 
around the world on a 70 foot yacht we
had<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.360> our<00:00:48.539> sleeping<00:00:49.140> shifts<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.129> off

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
had for our sleeping shifts on and off

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
had for our sleeping shifts on and off
and<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:51.239> could<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.480> quite<00:00:51.780> tight<00:00:52.559> living

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and it could be quite tight living

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
and it could be quite tight living
quarters<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.879> very<00:00:54.059> different<00:00:54.329> than

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
quarters so it's very different than

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.680 
quarters so it's very different than
most<00:00:55.500> people<00:00:55.829> may<00:00:55.949> imagine<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> race<00:00:57.480> we

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
most people may imagine on the race we

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.479

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
race but we knew it from the first

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
race but we knew it from the first
moment<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.939> met<00:02:05.969> each<00:02:06.119> other<00:02:06.390> not<00:02:06.899> because<00:02:07.200> we

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
moment we met each other not because we

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.719

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
have the most skill not because we have

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.940 
have the most skill not because we have
the<00:02:08.789> most<00:02:08.940> manpower<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.560> wanted

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the most manpower but because we wanted

it badly

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.479 
it badly
enough<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.230> we<00:02:13.230> all<00:02:13.440> respected<00:02:14.069> each<00:02:14.220> other

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489
