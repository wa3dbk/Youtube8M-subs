thing<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:10.890> cremated<00:03:11.640> remains<00:03:11.790> are

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
thing is that cremated remains are

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.680 
thing is that cremated remains are
totally<00:03:13.080> inorganic<00:03:13.890> they're<00:03:14.550> bone<00:03:15.030> fragments

totally inorganic they're bone fragments
left<00:03:15.900> over<00:03:16.320> from<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.709> cremation<00:03:17.160> process

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
left over from the cremation process

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.400

where<00:03:17.910> all<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.269> organic<00:03:18.540> material<00:03:19.230> has

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
where all the organic material has

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.310 
where all the organic material has
burned<00:03:19.769> off<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.480> there<00:03:21.720> are<00:03:21.780> some<00:03:21.930> things<00:03:22.110> in

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
burned off so there are some things in

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.170 
burned off so there are some things in
them<00:03:22.530> like<00:03:22.799> phosphorus<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:23.730> instance<00:03:24.060> that

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
them like phosphorus for instance that

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.539 
them like phosphorus for instance that
that<00:03:24.570> might<00:03:24.840> be<00:03:25.049> helpful<00:03:25.290> but<00:03:26.100> for<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.400> most

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
that might be helpful but for the most

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.949 
that might be helpful but for the most
