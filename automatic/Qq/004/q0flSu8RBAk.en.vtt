 attach directly to the skin 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.479
 in a skin tone on the line but now 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.439
 it's a reddish shade from shadow 132 of 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.659
 kiko what we do that if we have something 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.170
 of warmth to the look so that it is not so 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.170
 cold 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.720
 we also blur it 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.950
 we apply an eyeliner this is the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.950
 eyeliner highlighter by h &amp; m 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.540
 we eliminate flush of the lashes by 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:07.940
 all the eye with the shadow 180 of kiko 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.940
 I'm going to intensify the eye socket 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.450
 to give a little more shape we apply 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.240
 a 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.690
 is a shadow the black stick for the 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.920
 water line and it blurs because for me 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.069
 I introduce a little between the tabs 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.120
 lower we apply the mask of 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.709
 tabs 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.240

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.140
 that you know is my favorite one that 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.940
 The lashes hold me in place 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.360
 this is the garnier caffeine role 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.390
 is what we do is clean and leave the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.210
 area as cleaner with a little bit of 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.890
 corrector 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:01.360
 it has fallen some shade 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.700
 or we have spotted something we ratify 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.930
 use as a blush the shadow doing 37 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.939
 and as an illuminator the a-139 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.819
 dare to use this kind of thing 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.159
 as shadows or sai as blushes 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.849

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.310
 love the result is very nice 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.730
 make more shades lightly reddish me 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.680
 it looks like super 20 remains we illuminate the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.250
 cupid's arch cheekbone and 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.310
 center your nose 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.310
 I will apply the test mac lip 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.830
 this is the liner 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.780
 sea ​​flower 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.140
 of waterproof eyeliners for 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.140
 lips 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.000
 I can not say exactly but I tone 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.810
 I 'll find it and I'll put it in the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.030
 information box 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.739
 we get that line and apart stuffing 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.110
 all the lip with the pencil so that if 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.440
 it hurts a lot more are some pencils 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.710
 that do not move at all 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.660
 it is new organ point there are many shades 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.910
 which is easy to locate is a tone of 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.430
 burgundy a bit to match what we 're going 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.060
 to make this look asks me for a few lips 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.060
 powerful 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.940
 and I tell you with a base like this is not 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.940
 they move lipsticks all day 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.240
 we apply a red lip with a tone 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.889
 purple 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.389
 this is the slick cake then applied 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.389
 the revel tone above 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.120
 to darken a bit leaving the 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.310
 inside just the center of the lip 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.840
 lower in the same red that we had 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.300
 Market Stall 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.760
 this is the market purple that is 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.860
 similar or similar to the sea cyber that 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.350
 it's also from mac I put it in the 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.240
 corners in what are the corners and 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.280
 by the edge so we're going to create 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.040
 a gradient of color that of the center and 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.260
 from the corners or from the outside 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.080
 and from the corners to the center 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.720
 every time you see it clearer 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.899
 the tone but always the same line to the 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.279
 same range of tones 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:27.800
 we perfect the edges with a 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:31.599
 flat brochita and a little base 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.599
 make-up the same we wear 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.310
 and this is the look 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.280
 the single because it carries few tones of 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.260
 shadow as you see is a gray tone a tone 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.350
 very cold at the same time is very nice 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.020
 the clear eyes stand out 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.070
 the touch is sophisticated about the lips 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.070
 I hope you like it 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.160
 I hope you liked it to serve you 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.289
 of help for some look some day 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.259
 special and good you can always lower 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.150
 the tone of the lip including the tone of the 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.940
 the intensity of the shadows in the eyes 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.310
 If this look is too little for me 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.259
 he was crying out for such a strong tone in the 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.699
 lips a reveal more mixed with that 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.280
 dark tone or doing a bit of 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.350
 pleased that he gives us a mouth we give ourselves 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.630
 he saw it as more voluminous without having to 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.729
 resort to a blogs an extreme gloss 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:34.120
 although that is the one liked with lips 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:37.030
 I would recommend you avoid it 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.650
 a little bit and nothing else I leave you as 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.020
