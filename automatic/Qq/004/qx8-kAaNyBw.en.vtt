00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
monk the bunk is an interesting

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.999 
monk the bunk is an interesting
character<00:00:03.659> because<00:00:03.689> it's<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.140> melee<00:00:04.440> class<00:00:04.680> but

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
character because it's a melee class but

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.680 
character because it's a melee class but
he<00:00:05.040> has<00:00:05.190> very<00:00:05.370> little<00:00:05.580> armor<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.299> therefore

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
he has very little armor and therefore

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.530 
he has very little armor and therefore
must<00:00:06.839> rely<00:00:07.140> on<00:00:07.170> his<00:00:07.470> speed<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.069> strength<00:00:08.540> as

must rely on his speed and strength as

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.850 
must rely on his speed and strength as
you<00:00:09.599> can<00:00:09.870> see<00:00:10.050> he's<00:00:10.170> not<00:00:10.200> wearing<00:00:10.469> much<00:00:10.650> to

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.520 
you can see he's not wearing much to
start<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.250> game<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.870> the<00:00:12.870> armor<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.349> do

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
gain as you level up offers very little

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.269 
gain as you level up offers very little
upgrade<00:00:17.690> chest<00:00:18.690> armor<00:00:19.020> offers<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:20.160> to

upgrade chest armor offers a one just to
sort<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> three<00:00:20.910> here<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.449> start<00:00:21.779> and

sort of three here just to start and
while<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.980> comparably<00:00:23.880> will<00:00:24.090> increase<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.600> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
while it comparably will increase as you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.720 
while it comparably will increase as you
level<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.619> isn't<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.160> great<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.519> start

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730

has a lot of abilities that hit multiple
enemies<00:01:02.730> especially<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.809> row<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
enemies especially in a row which is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.179 
enemies especially in a row which is
very<00:01:04.530> useful<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:06.770> there's<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:07.979> large

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
very useful so there's a very large

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.469 
very useful so there's a very large
group<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> enemies<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.090> able<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> pick

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
group of enemies but I was able to pick

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.320 
group of enemies but I was able to pick
them<00:01:09.630> off<00:01:09.720> from<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> outside<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:12.119> start

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
them off from the outside and start

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.929 
them off from the outside and start
taking<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.659> mouth<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.260> time<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.820> he

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
taking the mouth one at a time and he

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.700 
taking the mouth one at a time and he
kills<00:01:15.210> enemies<00:01:15.390> almost<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.110> quickly<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
kills enemies almost as quickly as a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.370 
kills enemies almost as quickly as a
barbarian<00:01:17.159> does<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.810> without<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> heavy

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
barbarian does but without the heavy

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.370 
barbarian does but without the heavy
level<00:01:19.770> defense<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.689> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:21.930> quite<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> bit

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
level defense so you can do quite a bit

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.740 
level defense so you can do quite a bit
with<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.530> monk<00:01:26.150> around<00:01:27.150> level<00:01:27.420> 4<00:01:27.630> you're

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
with the monk around level 4 you're

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
with the monk around level 4 you're
gonna<00:01:27.869> gain<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> ability<00:01:28.259> blinding<00:01:28.950> flash

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
gonna gain the ability blinding flash

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
gonna gain the ability blinding flash
and<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.150> will<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> starter<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> use<00:01:31.200> in

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and this will be the starter you use in

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.429 
and this will be the starter you use in
most<00:01:31.590> fights<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:33.630> ensure<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.079> enemies

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
most fights to ensure your enemies

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.950 
most fights to ensure your enemies
cannot<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:36.210> slowed<00:01:36.509> from

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
cannot see you and are slowed from

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.960 
cannot see you and are slowed from
attacking<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:37.860> important<00:01:38.310> because

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.280 

it<00:01:44.970> will<00:01:45.090> reduce<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.630> amount<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.899> damage<00:01:46.259> you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
it will reduce the amount of damage you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.510 
it will reduce the amount of damage you
take<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.799> away<00:01:46.829> early<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.430> battle

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
take right away early in the battle

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.690 
take right away early in the battle
it'll<00:01:47.820> keep<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> alive<00:01:48.299> longer<00:01:52.460> as<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> can

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it'll keep you alive longer as you can

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.010 
it'll keep you alive longer as you can
see<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> much<00:01:54.180> larger<00:01:54.329> group<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.720> enemies

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
see this is much larger group of enemies

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.179 
see this is much larger group of enemies
so<00:01:55.170> we're<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> try<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.799> take<00:01:56.040> them

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
so we're not going to try to take them

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.929 
so we're not going to try to take them
all<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.399> at<00:01:56.549> once<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:58.460> when<00:01:59.460> they<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.610> start<00:01:59.880> to
