00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:07.820 
all right well I went through about a

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.240 
all right well I went through about a
third<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.510> five<00:00:09.840> gallon<00:00:10.260> bucket<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.769> had<00:00:11.010> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
third of this five gallon bucket I had a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.220 
third of this five gallon bucket I had a
bunch<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.759> black<00:00:12.030> sand<00:00:12.950> from<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.099> coastal<00:00:15.230> claim

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
bunch of black sand from a coastal claim

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.910 
bunch of black sand from a coastal claim
that<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.910> think<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.210> finally

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
that I have and I think I'm finally

that I have and I think I'm finally
starting<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> hang<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.910> word<00:00:21.180> to

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
starting to get the hang of this word to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.880 
starting to get the hang of this word to
dig<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.670> whatnot<00:00:23.670> now<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.910> panned<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.960> sorry<00:00:25.680> I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.310 
dig and whatnot now I panned out sorry I
I<00:00:28.039> ran<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.279> through<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:30.000> sluice<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.720> I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
I ran that through this sluice and I

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.220 
I ran that through this sluice and I
have<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> bit<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.189> modified<00:00:35.719> bottom<00:00:36.719> section

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
have a bit of a modified bottom section

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.340 
have a bit of a modified bottom section
there<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> took<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.360> standard<00:00:39.360> carpet<00:00:40.230> that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
there I took the standard carpet that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.410 
there I took the standard carpet that
came<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.420> wasn't

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
came with it out it was just wasn't

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.410 
came with it out it was just wasn't
working<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.750> me<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.309> put<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
working for me I just put this this is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.450 
working for me I just put this this is
just<00:00:45.570> standard<00:00:46.110> rubber<00:00:46.950> matting

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
just standard rubber matting

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.840 
just standard rubber matting
I<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> backside<00:00:48.800> just<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:50.340> sticky

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
I like the backside just more sticky

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.930 
I like the backside just more sticky
there<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> put<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.820> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
there and and then I put this this is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.400 
there and and then I put this this is
just<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.570> no<00:00:55.110> stick<00:00:55.440> shelving

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
just some of that no stick shelving

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.080 
just some of that no stick shelving
stuff<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> top<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.850> layer

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
stuff so I put that on top of it I layer

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.160 
stuff so I put that on top of it I layer
that<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.399> clean<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.850> down<00:01:03.329> so

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that and then I clean up that down so

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
that and then I clean up that down so
basically<00:01:04.530> I've<00:01:04.680> got<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.250> standard<00:01:05.700> ribbing

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
basically I've got the standard ribbing

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.490 
basically I've got the standard ribbing
that<00:01:06.180> comes<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.729> followed<00:01:08.729> by<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.390> rest<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
that comes in it followed by the rest of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.859 
that comes in it followed by the rest of
it<00:01:10.619> being<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> little<00:01:12.540> flakes

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it being like that and the little flakes

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.050 
it being like that and the little flakes
I<00:01:13.229> believe<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.860> getting<00:01:14.100> trapped<00:01:14.400> mostly

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
I believe are getting trapped mostly

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.520 
I believe are getting trapped mostly
down<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.420> because<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.659> haven't<00:01:15.869> seen<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.439> up

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
down here because I haven't seen them up

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520 
down here because I haven't seen them up
here<00:01:16.830> which<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.130> kind<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.400> odd<00:01:18.380> I've<00:01:19.380> been

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
here which is kind of odd I've been

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.380 
here which is kind of odd I've been
experimenting<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> speed<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> flow

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
experimenting with the speed of the flow

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.390 
experimenting with the speed of the flow
and<00:01:21.630> whatnot<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.500> not<00:01:22.979> seeing<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and whatnot but I'm not seeing the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300 
and whatnot but I'm not seeing the
flakes<00:01:23.670> sitting<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.479> too<00:01:24.720> much<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
flakes sitting in here too much so I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.710 
flakes sitting in here too much so I
believe<00:01:26.610> they're<00:01:26.820> being<00:01:26.970> trapped<00:01:27.330> down<00:01:27.659> here

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
believe they're being trapped down here

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.819 
believe they're being trapped down here
which<00:01:28.470> kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.979> goes<00:01:29.579> against<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> lot<00:01:30.570> of

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
which kind of goes against what a lot of

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.200 
which kind of goes against what a lot of
videos<00:01:31.829> are<00:01:32.070> saying<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> gold

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
videos are saying that you know the gold

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
videos are saying that you know the gold
gets<00:01:33.450> trapped<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.310> almost<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.850> time

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
gets trapped up here almost all the time

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.050 
gets trapped up here almost all the time
so<00:01:36.479> anyway<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.530> interesting<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.670> I'll<00:01:38.880> show

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
so anyway it's interesting and I'll show

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.460 
so anyway it's interesting and I'll show
you<00:01:39.150> what<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.329> got<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.020> said<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.380> just

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you what I got and like I said it's just

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.980 
you what I got and like I said it's just
a<00:01:42.710> 1/3<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.579> 5-gallon<00:01:45.149> bucket<00:01:45.570> I'll<00:01:45.720> put<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
a 1/3 of a 5-gallon bucket I'll put it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.340 
a 1/3 of a 5-gallon bucket I'll put it
under<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.259> magnifying<00:01:46.439> glass<00:01:46.740> first<00:01:47.220> without

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
under the magnifying glass first without

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.600 
under the magnifying glass first without
you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:50.030> there's<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.149> flick<00:01:52.460> there's<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
you can see there's a flick there's a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.380 
you can see there's a flick there's a
Fleck<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:55.159> there's<00:01:56.159> probably<00:01:56.399> close<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.329> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
Fleck and there's probably close to a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.990 
Fleck and there's probably close to a
dozen<00:01:58.189> flakes<00:01:59.189> there<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.700> gonna<00:01:59.790> put

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
dozen flakes there so I'm gonna put

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.370 
dozen flakes there so I'm gonna put
under<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> magnifying<00:02:00.479> glass<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.320> can

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
under the magnifying glass and you can

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.190 
under the magnifying glass and you can
see<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.670> better<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.329> there's<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.899> flex

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
see a lot better so there's some flex

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.240 
see a lot better so there's some flex
all<00:02:04.409> around<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.189> side<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.030> there

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
all around that side and then there

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.919 
all around that side and then there
a<00:02:06.360> pretty<00:02:07.360> good<00:02:07.660> concentration<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:09.929> small

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
a pretty good concentration of small

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.450 
a pretty good concentration of small
flecks<00:02:11.260> there<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.740> I'm<00:02:11.860> going<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.070> put<00:02:12.250> those

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
flecks there so I'm going to put those

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.780 
flecks there so I'm going to put those
in<00:02:13.360> my<00:02:14.280> little<00:02:15.690> vial<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:18.460> one<00:02:18.610> there's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
in my little vial and that one there's

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.630 
in my little vial and that one there's
pretty<00:02:19.090> good<00:02:19.240> actually<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:21.370> went<00:02:21.550> up

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
pretty good actually that that went up

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.890 
pretty good actually that that went up
against<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.030> edge<00:02:22.150> there's<00:02:22.480> nothing<00:02:22.780> wrong

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
against the edge there's nothing wrong

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.280 
against the edge there's nothing wrong
with<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:25.450> way<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.600> like<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.020> do<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.230> I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
with that so the way I like to do it I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.870 
with that so the way I like to do it I
know<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.500> can<00:02:26.620> do<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.950> with<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.070> sniper<00:02:27.340> bottle

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
know you can do it with a sniper bottle

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.150 
know you can do it with a sniper bottle
real<00:02:28.090> easy<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:29.080> I'm<00:02:29.170> still<00:02:29.440> finding<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.890> can't

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160

nut for bottle so what I do is take my

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.290 
nut for bottle so what I do is take my
little<00:02:39.310> vial<00:02:40.350> which<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.530> here<00:02:41.920> I've<00:02:42.280> got<00:02:42.459> got<00:02:43.270> a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
little vial which is here I've got got a

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.870 
little vial which is here I've got got a
pretty<00:02:43.600> decent<00:02:43.950> collection<00:02:44.950> going<00:02:45.580> in<00:02:45.730> there

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
pretty decent collection going in there

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.470 
pretty decent collection going in there
so<00:02:46.150> far<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:49.230> unscrew<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.350> tap<00:02:51.390> see<00:02:52.390> if

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
so far and I just unscrew the tap see if

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.630 
so far and I just unscrew the tap see if
I<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.660> do<00:02:52.750> this<00:02:52.930> while<00:02:53.230> we're<00:02:55.260> here<00:02:56.459> your<00:02:57.459> son

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
I can do this while we're here your son

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.050 
I can do this while we're here your son
screwing<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.060> tap<00:02:59.190> I'm<00:03:00.190> gonna<00:03:00.310> set<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.850> down

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
screwing the tap I'm gonna set it down

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:10.740 
screwing the tap I'm gonna set it down
carefully<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.959> then<00:03:05.410> what<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.680> do<00:03:05.860> is<00:03:09.540> find<00:03:10.540> the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
that on the eye camera here try anyway
anyway<00:03:31.390> maybe<00:03:31.750> it's<00:03:31.900> better<00:03:32.080> without<00:03:34.410> let's

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
anyway maybe it's better without let's

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.110 
anyway maybe it's better without let's
see<00:03:35.799> here<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:39.220> have<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.430> take<00:03:39.519> my<00:03:39.640> word<00:03:39.760> for<00:03:39.820> it

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
see here you have to take my word for it

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.680 
see here you have to take my word for it
the<00:03:40.329> flake<00:03:40.570> is<00:03:40.840> on<00:03:41.019> my<00:03:41.200> finger<00:03:41.410> New<00:03:41.680> York<00:03:41.860> cut

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
the flake is on my finger New York cut

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.170 
the flake is on my finger New York cut
and<00:03:43.690> then<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.200> take<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:46.860> put<00:03:47.860> my<00:03:48.730> finger

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
and then I just take this put my finger

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.500 
and then I just take this put my finger
right<00:03:49.209> over<00:03:49.780> top<00:03:50.579> so<00:03:51.579> that<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.820> flake<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.329> in

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
right over top so that the flake is in

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.620 
right over top so that the flake is in
there<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:53.530> like<00:03:53.680> this<00:03:53.980> give<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:55.000> shake<00:03:55.269> and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.760 

that<00:03:58.630> flake

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.020 

just<00:04:05.770> didn't<00:04:05.980> get<00:04:06.069> it<00:04:06.190> wet<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:09.340> flake<00:04:09.640> is<00:04:09.819> now

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
just didn't get it wet the flake is now

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.470 
just didn't get it wet the flake is now
gone<00:04:10.360> off<00:04:10.630> my<00:04:10.840> finger<00:04:11.370> because<00:04:12.370> it's<00:04:12.760> gold

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
gone off my finger because it's gold

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.660 
gone off my finger because it's gold
it's<00:04:13.750> heavier<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.890> has<00:04:15.040> fallen<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.640> the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
it's heavier and it has fallen to the

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.970 
it's heavier and it has fallen to the
bottom<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.380> just<00:04:17.530> need<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.799> make<00:04:17.919> sure

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
bottom so you just need to make sure

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.830 
bottom so you just need to make sure
that<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.489> doesn't<00:04:18.880> run<00:04:19.150> down<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.570> side<00:04:19.810> of

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
that it doesn't run down the side of

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.050 
that it doesn't run down the side of
your<00:04:19.959> finger<00:04:20.280> sometimes<00:04:21.280> just<00:04:21.609> see<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.730> flake

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
your finger sometimes just see a flake

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.750 
your finger sometimes just see a flake
laying<00:04:22.389> down<00:04:22.600> down<00:04:23.169> side<00:04:23.470> your<00:04:23.680> finger<00:04:24.010> I'm

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
laying down down side your finger I'm

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.000

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
gonna get that one along with a few

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.760 
gonna get that one along with a few
others<00:04:27.370> here<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.840> there<00:04:29.530> I've<00:04:29.740> got<00:04:31.590> see<00:04:32.590> if<00:04:32.680> I

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
others here and there I've got see if I

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.010 
others here and there I've got see if I
can<00:04:32.889> get<00:04:33.010> that<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.310> focus<00:04:33.790> good<00:04:34.150> three

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
can get that in focus good three

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.909 
can get that in focus good three
different<00:04:35.410> flecks<00:04:37.020> again<00:04:38.020> I'll<00:04:38.590> put<00:04:38.770> them

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
different flecks again I'll put them

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.360 
different flecks again I'll put them
right<00:04:38.979> over<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.610> jar<00:04:43.770> shake<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:45.010> around<00:04:45.040> a

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
right over the jar shake that around a

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.600 
right over the jar shake that around a
little<00:04:45.400> bit<00:04:49.650> when<00:04:50.650> they're<00:04:50.830> gone<00:04:50.950> so<00:04:51.400> they're

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
little bit when they're gone so they're

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.100 
little bit when they're gone so they're
in<00:04:51.729> there<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.090> think<00:04:52.840> when<00:04:52.960> you're<00:04:53.080> dealing

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
in there I think when you're dealing

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.260 
in there I think when you're dealing
with<00:04:53.410> a<00:04:53.530> lot<00:04:53.740> of<00:04:53.770> small<00:04:54.220> flecks<00:04:54.610> like<00:04:55.000> this

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
with a lot of small flecks like this

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.170 
with a lot of small flecks like this
that<00:04:55.660> is<00:04:55.930> probably<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:57.070> best<00:04:57.669> way<00:04:57.880> to<00:04:57.910> go<00:04:58.150> so

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
that is probably the best way to go so

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.490 
that is probably the best way to go so
I'm<00:04:58.419> gonna<00:04:58.540> do<00:04:58.660> that<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.050> rest<00:04:59.229> of<00:04:59.410> these

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
I'm gonna do that to the rest of these

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.030 
I'm gonna do that to the rest of these
put<00:04:59.860> them<00:04:59.979> in<00:05:00.070> my<00:05:00.190> jar<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:02.680> was<00:05:02.800> pretty

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
put them in my jar and that was pretty

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.000
