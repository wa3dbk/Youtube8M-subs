behind it's got decent long shot on him
his<00:01:36.180> curve<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.229> his<00:01:37.350> finish<00:01:37.619> shots<00:01:37.829> are

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
his curve you know his finish shots are

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
his curve you know his finish shots are
pretty<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.729> good<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.810> can't<00:01:40.049> believe

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
pretty pretty good and I can't believe

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.660 
pretty pretty good and I can't believe
he's<00:01:40.290> only<00:01:40.409> got<00:01:40.560> 59<00:01:40.920> finishing<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
he's only got 59 finishing like I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
he's only got 59 finishing like I
thought<00:01:41.909> he<00:01:41.970> did<00:01:42.450> finish<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> quite<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> lot<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
thought he did finish it quite a lot and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.770 
thought he did finish it quite a lot and
then<00:01:44.009> he<00:01:44.130> did<00:01:44.310> grab<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.729> goals<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.119> me<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
then he did grab some goals for me and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.030 
then he did grab some goals for me and
of<00:01:45.899> course<00:01:45.930> when<00:01:46.259> you're<00:01:46.350> comparing<00:01:46.710> him<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
of course when you're comparing him to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.700 
of course when you're comparing him to
inform<00:01:47.549> Tofte<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> whole<00:01:48.720> lot<00:01:48.930> faster<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
inform Tofte it's a whole lot faster and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.580 
inform Tofte it's a whole lot faster and
that<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.130> great<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.780> he's<00:01:51.780> actually<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.470> know

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
that is great and he's actually you know

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
that is great and he's actually you know
a<00:01:52.740> troublesome<00:01:53.310> player<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.180> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
a troublesome player to have on that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.080 
a troublesome player to have on that
left<00:01:54.600> left<00:01:54.990> hand<00:01:55.200> side<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.740> dribblings<00:01:56.579> decent

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
left left hand side is dribblings decent

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.580 
left left hand side is dribblings decent
as<00:01:57.240> well<00:01:57.390> he's<00:01:57.600> got<00:01:57.750> four<00:01:57.990> stars<00:01:58.229> skill<00:01:58.530> moves

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
as well he's got four stars skill moves

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.120 
as well he's got four stars skill moves
and<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.729> had<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> high<00:02:00.750> ball<00:02:01.170> control<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.799> 80s

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
and I had a high ball control in the 80s

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.910 
and I had a high ball control in the 80s
and<00:02:02.340> his<00:02:02.570> dribbling<00:02:03.570> was<00:02:03.689> 86<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:04.380> well<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.710> game

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and his dribbling was 86 as well in game

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.010 
and his dribbling was 86 as well in game
so<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> really<00:02:05.880> did<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.149> his<00:02:06.329> dribbling<00:02:06.689> as

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so I really did like his dribbling as

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.169 
so I really did like his dribbling as
you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.500> he<00:02:07.680> weaves<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.129> out<00:02:08.250> he's

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you can see he weaves in and out he's

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.630 
you can see he weaves in and out he's
difficult<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:10.050> defenders<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:11.069> tackle<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
difficult for defenders to tackle and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.790 
difficult for defenders to tackle and
dies<00:02:12.629> or<00:02:12.959> awesome

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
dies or awesome

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.770 
dies or awesome
one<00:02:14.160> thing<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.670> didn't<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.000> about<00:02:15.120> him<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.540> his

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
one thing I didn't like about him is his

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.300 
one thing I didn't like about him is his
strength<00:02:16.110> as<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.680> guess<00:02:16.920> put<00:02:17.130> off

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
strength as you can see guess put off

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.720 
strength as you can see guess put off
balance<00:02:17.670> very<00:02:17.970> easily<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.830> he<00:02:19.830> does<00:02:20.280> kind<00:02:20.700> of

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
balance very easily and he does kind of

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.100 
balance very easily and he does kind of
get<00:02:20.850> bullied<00:02:21.060> off<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> ball<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.720> well<00:02:21.750> that's

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
get bullied off the ball as well that's

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.140 
get bullied off the ball as well that's
67<00:02:22.530> strength<00:02:22.950> doesn't<00:02:23.460> help<00:02:23.730> out<00:02:23.880> another

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
67 strength doesn't help out another

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.060 
67 strength doesn't help out another
clip<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.380> about<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.620> shoot<00:02:25.860> he

just gets bundled over and that that at

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.130 
just gets bundled over and that that at
times<00:02:29.190> was<00:02:29.460> bit<00:02:29.670> annoying<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.660> see<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.930> again

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140

decent<00:03:08.400> passing<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.000> him<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.630> know<00:03:09.660> he's

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
decent passing on him so you know he's

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.620 
decent passing on him so you know he's
not<00:03:10.200> just<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.650> guy<00:03:10.770> who<00:03:10.830> scores<00:03:11.280> goals<00:03:11.580> ikki<00:03:12.420> he

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
not just a guy who scores goals ikki he

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.060 
not just a guy who scores goals ikki he
can<00:03:12.810> pass<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> ball<00:03:13.320> in<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.620> left<00:03:13.890> wing

left wing that's where you can get the
best<00:03:17.280> out<00:03:17.520> of<00:03:17.550> him
