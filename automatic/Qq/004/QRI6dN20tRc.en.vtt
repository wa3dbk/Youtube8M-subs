00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.669
 these heroes nasty monsters this is an action roleplaying game 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.869
 to be precise, that is Arcania Gothic 4 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.900
 Do not wonder about the four in the name the first three parts appeared 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.039
 exclusively for the PC 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.579
 with some references to its predecessors but a new one 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.699
 Arcania now also comes to console teams for the development team 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.699
 Uhlig a not particularly glorious emerged 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.500
 the backstory of Arcania tells pretty quickly 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.700
 that we are the physical nameless hero 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.990
 fight for the count against the ruler Mubarak 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.850
 here is possible with the evil in the covenant 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 and must therefore be forcibly dethroned 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.660
 until then, of course, it's a long way to go with many fighting quests around 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.140
 surprises 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.140
 Benedict 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.450
 it will be one of the first stops on 30 of it 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.030
 is the city of Gescher 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.320
 Here he not only meets as the characters come to them like the fighters or the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.680
 elegant movements 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.120
 but also deal with the corrupt ruler of the city 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.540
 in talks the track everything will be in disputes or if you want 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.310
 the dialogues run very linearly there is no way they take in 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.800
 To influence direction 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 no comparison with much entertainment he about in Mass Effect 2 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.540
 fans 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.720
 similarly problematic for the quests 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.120
 if there are many additional tasks at the beginning, the coletti gets lost 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.770
 End to the linear carved and ds4 action as a role-playing density 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.890
 Infrastructure by hand in the dungeon 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.330
 Generally it is not all 3 4 with classic RPG elements 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.660
 For example, the many in PCs are just staffage 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.080
 World can not even attack them thus causing uproar 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.640
 they do not react to our actions at all 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.190
 For example, wine merchant IFA will simply have a box behind the counter and 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.680
 steal everything out 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.560
 that does not seem to bother the good man 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
 he started right after that, so we would have been nothing 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.510
 also one of the highlights of Arcania in the Bar's Ministry of Commerce 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.990
 the operation 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.629
 the menus are tidier and more elaborate 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.849
 Bischoff that with them big and also to read if you go a little further 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.379
 sitting by the window 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 only owners of Roland big should get problems 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:18.290
 either way 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.800
 the missing one when behind a lot of politically given 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.450
 But we do not want to buy anything 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.489
 because usually are the equipment conquered by opponents 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.080
 much better than what the dealer offers 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.080
 a tree house weak point 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.389
 Speaking of equipment 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.460
 the inventory is quite clear 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.259
 the equipment of the hero works smoothly 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.259
 Lever restrictions are just as little as a weight limit 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.709
 in the opponents, the developers have based on the processes 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.739
 you meet meat bugs plus lie and he is in Germany expiration 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.389
 Bird's eye view 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.129
 Generally, there are quite a few enemy types 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.909
 If you look at this video here, you have seen almost all opponents of the game 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:06.689
 the combat system is okay, we use sword bow or spell 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.729
 to keep the schedule 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.889
 who is not enough and blog he has no chance to fight later 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.079
 an old problem in action roleplaying 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.379
 for clean are actually pointless own shares degenerate too 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.489
 Entertainer easiest goal 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.939
 the grandparents as pretty empty the game world is full of plants and 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:24.739
 mushrooms 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.620
 along with that of many Irishmen in the meat and other raw materials Kauder 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.799
 Hold a craft lesson 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.980
 in a somewhat simple crafting media cook without meat agro- and healing potions 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.729
 But also new swords and armor 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.729
 RAA 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.909
 because 80 francs possible that for example even in dark caves the 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.359
 To see through 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.199
 because logical 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.709
 Of course, a role play also includes these quarrels and then jeans 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.939
 These are usually made by Risen moles Skeleton or the followers of the 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.469
 sinister via Cultus populated 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.769
 you can hardly get lost in the caves they are quite linear 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.079
 After all, you can find iron ore there for many items needed 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.079
 becomes 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:14.369
 no roleplaying game without level up immortality points 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.839
 The character system in Arcadia kept it deliberately simple 

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.939
 Reality trees do not exist 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:24.189
 He is in higher levels, one can advise in the 3 inches of advocacy and 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.960
 Full of investing but a Â«I've said fighting them easier anyway 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.650
 a word about Arcania's technique 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.080
 Although there are pretty lighting effects but he buys the game with gruesome 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.349
 Give Glory 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.970
 which arise in detail in the levels and high opponents 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.970
 even the title just barely past and playability over 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.219
 the credit account endgames we plead better years ago 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.999
 our conclusion 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:53.549
 who does not give much on great technique gets a solid with Arcania 

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:55.090
 action-roleplaying 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.620
 however, the focus is clearly on which 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.379
 and they would have to stage pretty
