going to walk the trail so we want to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.820 
going to walk the trail so we want to
mark<00:00:14.519> where<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:14.940> are<00:00:15.089> right<00:00:15.269> now<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.740> that

mark where we are right now and for that

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.050 
mark where we are right now and for that
we<00:00:17.279> hit<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> mark<00:00:18.690> waypoint<00:00:19.350> button<00:00:20.060> right

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
we hit on the mark waypoint button right

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.720 
we hit on the mark waypoint button right
here<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.859> will<00:00:23.039> save<00:00:23.340> us<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> waypoint

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
here and that will save us a waypoint

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.990 
here and that will save us a waypoint
now<00:00:24.320> from<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.560> you'll<00:00:25.769> start<00:00:26.460> numbering<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
now from here you'll start numbering the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240 
now from here you'll start numbering the
waypoints<00:00:27.590> sequentially<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.099> can

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
waypoints sequentially but what you can

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.720 
waypoints sequentially but what you can
do<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.970> go<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.779> edit<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.730> start

purposes<00:00:48.079> we<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.320> need<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.649> save<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:51.379> we<00:00:52.379> can

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
purposes we just need to save and we can

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.040 
purposes we just need to save and we can
start<00:00:52.710> walking<00:00:53.300> all<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.719> we

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
start walking all right so now that we

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.590 
start walking all right so now that we
showed<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.129> how<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.460> create<00:00:56.760> waypoints<00:00:57.449> here

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
showed you how to create waypoints here

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.970 
showed you how to create waypoints here
we're<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> second

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
we're going to actually do the second

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
we're going to actually do the second
part<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.760> navigate<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
part which is actually navigate to the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.189 
part which is actually navigate to the
Waypoint<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.160> are<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.699> park<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
Waypoint so here we are at the park and

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.390 
Waypoint so here we are at the park and
we're<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.350> navigate<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
we're going to navigate to one the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
we're going to navigate to one the
waypoints<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.090> we've<00:01:06.240> created<00:01:06.479> before<00:01:07.439> or

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
waypoints that we've created before or

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
waypoints that we've created before or
load<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> computer<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.390> any

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
load it up from the computer or any

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
load it up from the computer or any
other<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.979> easy<00:01:11.220> way<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.970> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
other way so easy way to do that is to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.200 
other way so easy way to do that is to
tap<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> whereto<00:01:13.049> icon<00:01:13.760> from<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.090> see

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
tap on the whereto icon from here we see

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.179 
tap on the whereto icon from here we see
all<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> different<00:01:15.659> categories<00:01:16.070> type<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
all the different categories type of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.830 
all the different categories type of
category<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> waypoint<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.570> we'll<00:01:18.720> select

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
category is a waypoint so we'll select

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200 
category is a waypoint so we'll select
that<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.770> list<00:01:19.979> our<00:01:20.189> waypoints<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that that will list our waypoints and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.719 
that that will list our waypoints and
there<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.080> here

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
there it is right here

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.280 
there it is right here
just<00:01:23.729> tap<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.330> will<00:01:24.720> show<00:01:24.930> us<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.200> map

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
just tap on it will show us on the map

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.950 
just tap on it will show us on the map
where<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.360> now<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.420> had<00:01:27.689> additional

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
where it is now we had additional

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.810 
where it is now we had additional
descriptions<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> notes<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.400> view<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
descriptions and notes we can view it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.819 
descriptions and notes we can view it
that<00:01:30.030> way<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:31.049> once<00:01:31.320> we're<00:01:31.500> ready<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that way but once we're ready to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.090 
that way but once we're ready to
navigate<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.490> tap<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.060> go<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.770> now<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.829> are

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
navigate we can tap on go and now we are

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.039 
navigate we can tap on go and now we are
ready<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:35.610> we're<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> map<00:01:36.659> screen

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
ready to go now we're on the map screen

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.460 
ready to go now we're on the map screen
here<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.130> using<00:01:38.939> recreational<00:01:39.470> profile

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
here so and using recreational profile

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.249 
here so and using recreational profile
so<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.450> switch<00:01:42.960> over<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
so what we can do here is switch over to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.730 
so what we can do here is switch over to
the<00:01:43.470> compass<00:01:43.890> screen<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:46.560> were

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the compass screen and we see here were

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.830 
the compass screen and we see here were
32<00:01:47.159> meters<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.700> our<00:01:47.820> destination<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
32 meters to our destination and the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.889 
32 meters to our destination and the
arrow<00:01:49.020> point<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> pointing<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.340> way<00:01:50.579> so

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
arrow point is pointing that way so

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.600 
arrow point is pointing that way so
let's<00:01:51.899> start<00:01:52.200> walking<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.720> calibrated<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
let's start walking so we calibrated the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.399 
let's start walking so we calibrated the
electronic<00:01:56.610> compass<00:01:57.000> here<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:58.259> will<00:01:58.380> show

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
electronic compass here so it will show

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.039 
electronic compass here so it will show
us<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.070> point<00:01:59.610> or<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.210> direction<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.780> travel

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
us the point or the direction of travel

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.639 
us the point or the direction of travel
pretty<00:02:01.920> quick<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.399> normally<00:02:03.290> if<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.439> don't

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
pretty quick but normally if you don't

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.590 
pretty quick but normally if you don't
have<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.920> enabled<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:06.149> might<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.509> to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
have that enabled you might have to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.789 
have that enabled you might have to
start<00:02:06.810> walking<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.290> actually<00:02:07.560> get<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
start walking to actually get the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.919 
start walking to actually get the
compass<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.310> change<00:02:09.000> direction<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.629> our<00:02:09.720> goal

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
compass to change direction and our goal

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.150 
compass to change direction and our goal
here<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.440> get<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.709> close<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.129> zero<00:02:11.430> as

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
here is just to get as close to zero as

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:24.020 
here is just to get as close to zero as
go<00:02:14.690> are<00:02:15.690> alert<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:22.100> there<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.190> go<00:02:23.340> we're<00:02:23.760> at

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
go are alert and there we go we're at

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.690 
go are alert and there we go we're at
our<00:02:24.060> destination<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.280> other<00:02:26.430> thing<00:02:26.670> that

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
our destination so the other thing that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.670 
our destination so the other thing that
you<00:02:26.880> can<00:02:27.000> do<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.930> compass<00:02:28.230> page<00:02:28.440> while

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
you can do with the compass page while

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.320 
you can do with the compass page while
you're<00:02:28.860> navigating<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:29.880> customize

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
you're navigating is you can customize

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.310 
you're navigating is you can customize
it<00:02:30.890> if<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.100> tap<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.520> drawer<00:02:32.790> icon<00:02:33.510> here<00:02:33.840> we

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
it if you tap on the drawer icon here we

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.860 
it if you tap on the drawer icon here we
can<00:02:34.500> change<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.890> dashboard<00:02:35.490> by<00:02:35.870> choosing

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
can change the dashboard by choosing

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.730 
can change the dashboard by choosing
another<00:02:37.820> pre-selected<00:02:38.820> dashboard<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.560> can

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
another pre-selected dashboard so we can

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.850 
another pre-selected dashboard so we can
do<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.130> or<00:02:41.520> if<00:02:41.720> we<00:02:42.720> really<00:02:42.990> wanted<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.320> we<00:02:43.680> can

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
do that or if we really wanted to we can

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.710 
do that or if we really wanted to we can
customize<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.550> data<00:02:44.730> field<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.300> here<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.570> have

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
customize the data field so here we have

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.280 
customize the data field so here we have
speed<00:02:46.140> distance<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.370> our<00:02:47.400> Waypoint<00:02:48.020> time<00:02:49.020> to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
speed distance to our Waypoint time to

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.500 
speed distance to our Waypoint time to
the<00:02:49.380> next<00:02:49.620> Waypoint<00:02:50.010> eta<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.760> destination

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the next Waypoint eta to destination

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.690 
the next Waypoint eta to destination
let's<00:02:52.200> just<00:02:52.410> change<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.160> here<00:02:53.400> time<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
let's just change this one here time to

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.820 
let's just change this one here time to
next<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.360> what<00:02:55.110> we<00:02:55.200> can<00:02:55.320> do<00:02:55.410> here<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:55.800> can

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
next and what we can do here is we can

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.970 
next and what we can do here is we can
just<00:02:55.950> change<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.790> one<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> many<00:02:57.300> fields

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
just change it to one of the many fields

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.470 
just change it to one of the many fields
we<00:02:58.980> have<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.430> but<00:02:59.610> we're<00:02:59.790> going<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.970> do<00:03:00.150> trip

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
we have here but we're going to do trip

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.070 
we have here but we're going to do trip
odometer<00:03:01.730> now<00:03:02.730> if<00:03:02.850> we<00:03:03.000> want<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.209> lock<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.780> we

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
odometer now if we want to lock this we

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.850 
odometer now if we want to lock this we
can<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.440> select<00:03:05.100> down<00:03:05.520> here<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.620> lock<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
can just select down here and lock the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.940 
can just select down here and lock the
data<00:03:08.070> fields<00:03:08.990> so<00:03:09.990> that<00:03:10.020> will<00:03:10.380> prevent<00:03:10.680> us<00:03:10.890> from

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
data fields so that will prevent us from

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.860 
data fields so that will prevent us from
changing<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.080> we<00:03:13.080> can<00:03:13.260> just<00:03:13.290> simply

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
changing it and we can just simply

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.000 
changing it and we can just simply
unlock<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:17.130> we<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.430> edit<00:03:17.550> them<00:03:17.820> again<00:03:18.860> now<00:03:19.860> if

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
unlock and we can edit them again now if

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.520 
unlock and we can edit them again now if
we<00:03:20.130> wanted<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:21.709> reset<00:03:23.840> we<00:03:24.840> simply<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.350> do

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
we wanted to reset we simply just do

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.040 
we wanted to reset we simply just do
restore<00:03:26.010> defaults<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.970> we're<00:03:27.450> back<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.810> time

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
restore defaults and we're back to time

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.440 
restore defaults and we're back to time
connects<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:29.519> for<00:03:29.670> example<00:03:30.030> we're<00:03:30.180> here<00:03:30.330> at

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
connects so for example we're here at

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.770 
connects so for example we're here at
the<00:03:30.780> at<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.080> boat<00:03:31.320> launch<00:03:31.610> by<00:03:32.610> lake<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.239> let's

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
the at a boat launch by lake and let's

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.470 
the at a boat launch by lake and let's
say<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.050> we<00:03:34.200> want<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.760> we're<00:03:35.760> told<00:03:35.970> at<00:03:36.300> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
say that we want to we're told at the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.790 
say that we want to we're told at the
launch<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.959> need<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.200> go<00:03:37.380> at<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> certain

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
launch we need to go at a certain

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.180 
launch we need to go at a certain
bearing<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.730> what<00:03:38.940> we<00:03:39.060> need<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.239> do<00:03:39.450> here<00:03:39.750> is

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
bearing so what we need to do here is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.140 
bearing so what we need to do here is
you<00:03:41.190> know<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.850> example<00:03:42.269> go<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.700> tell<00:03:44.700> us<00:03:44.820> so

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
you know for example go and tell us so

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.699 
you know for example go and tell us so
the<00:03:45.420> person<00:03:45.720> told<00:03:45.870> us<00:03:46.019> all<00:03:46.170> right<00:03:46.290> from<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
the person told us all right from the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.539 
the person told us all right from the
boat<00:03:46.860> launch<00:03:47.040> go<00:03:47.700> 231<00:03:48.690> degrees<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:50.190> we<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.459> do

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
boat launch go 231 degrees and we can do

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.039 
boat launch go 231 degrees and we can do
is<00:03:50.670> with<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:50.910> lock<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:53.720> set<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> course

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
is with a lock that and set the course

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.900 
is with a lock that and set the course
or<00:03:55.170> project<00:03:55.260> Waypoint<00:03:55.890> our<00:03:56.370> friend<00:03:56.670> said<00:03:56.880> oh

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
or project Waypoint our friend said oh

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.110 
or project Waypoint our friend said oh
you'll<00:03:57.209> need<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.600> paddle<00:03:57.840> 2<00:03:58.799> kilometers<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.000> we

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
you'll need to paddle 2 kilometers so we

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.479 
you'll need to paddle 2 kilometers so we
can<00:04:00.269> project<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:01.610> choose<00:04:02.610> kilometers<00:04:04.489> and

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
can project that choose kilometers and

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.820 
can project that choose kilometers and
we'll<00:04:06.209> select<00:04:06.570> 2

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
we'll select 2

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.310 
we'll select 2
so<00:04:09.700> there<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.030> go<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.270> now<00:04:10.600> we<00:04:10.660> have<00:04:10.960> a

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
so there you go so now we have a

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.390 
so there you go so now we have a
projective<00:04:12.160> Waypoint<00:04:13.710> two<00:04:14.710> kilometers<00:04:15.220> at

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
projective Waypoint two kilometers at

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.650 
projective Waypoint two kilometers at
234<00:04:16.239> degrees<00:04:16.530> we<00:04:17.530> hit<00:04:17.680> save<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.640> there<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.540> go

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
234 degrees we hit save and there you go

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.370 
234 degrees we hit save and there you go
now<00:04:19.870> we<00:04:19.900> can<00:04:21.060> paddle<00:04:22.060> across<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.780> lake<00:04:22.960> here

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
now we can paddle across the lake here

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.660 
now we can paddle across the lake here
to<00:04:24.040> to<00:04:25.030> our<00:04:25.060> location<00:04:25.560> right<00:04:26.560> there<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.400> once

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
to to our location right there so once

you've done navigating you can tap on

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.160 
you've done navigating you can tap on
stop<00:04:29.500> navigation<00:04:30.160> if<00:04:30.670> you<00:04:30.850> wanted<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.450> of
