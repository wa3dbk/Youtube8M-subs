00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.589
 Good day, dear 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.460
 subscribers with you in touch with them united 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.509
 forman and in this lesson we'll build 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.269
 three-dimensional part of the shaft and so let's 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.160
 open create a document 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.279
 compass detail here we launched 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.039
 a model tree opened before us where 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.170
 we will see all constructions as well 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.230
 A window has opened in which everyone will be 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.020
 go through the construction well and opened 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.780
 compact panel which has 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.850
 editing toolbar 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 parts with which we will 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.780
 create a three-dimensional model of the shaft in these 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.280
 before this start building here's right 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.649
 keys click here here here in the tree 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.340
 model by item icon and select 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.260
 properties in our properties panel 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.850
 of opened property details here in 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.390
 let's enter the name of the shaft 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:09.439
 instead of the word part shaft click here and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.170
 click create object and so shaft we 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.030
 created more correctly assigned the name of the shaft 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.909
 our our detail 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.299
 now let's open the start tab 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.860
 coordinates choose the zetex plane for 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.140
 to create a sketch on it 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.299
 which will determine the size of our 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.450
 shaft 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.939
 so let's go here to the tab all 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.579
 create a sketch 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.189
 Here we have to see a flat zetex 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.000
 became parallel to the screen 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.320
 toolbars right on 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.290
 compact panels appeared 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.360
 toolbar geometry 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.450
 dimensions and designations but we will 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.649
 build our three-dimensional shaft with 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.409
 command rotation operation and in front of it 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.090
 beginning we need to create an axis with you 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.110
 rotation about which will be 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.320
 rotate our sketch 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.950
 let's go to the dashboard 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.120
 designations 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:18.190
 in order to choose an axial command 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.959
 linni and let 's build it here 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.000
 build arbitrarily but length 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:29.069
 somewhere 150 200 and more from axial 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.440
 the line is ready now let's build 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.959
 sketch let's go toolbar 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.049
 geometry and use the command 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:42.480
 continuous from objects so we 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:47.500
 activated now a little bit increase and 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.910
 let's so here we arbitrarily build 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.910
 the contour of our shaft 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:06.940
 shoulder make a step here and here 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:10.030
 let's make and close the contour for 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.410
 so that we can be with you 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.190
 choose no thin wall of the element from 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.430
 thin wall 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.609
 But he is with us if now the sketch is not 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.100
 close here from we put it here 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:28.170
 at this point it would have in the forehead 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.170
 would create thin-walled automatically 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.430
 let's click stop and here we have created 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.489
 our sketch 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:45.519
 shaft and that is because we have held here 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:49.480
 axis will and it turns out that we have 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.510
 our sketch will rotate around the axial 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.000
 line thus describe the contour of the shaft 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.000
 Now let's get into the instrumental 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.900
 panel editing parts choose 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.569
 rotation operation we chose 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.450
 and you can immediately on your monitors 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.690
 watch as a phantom of our shaft already 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.360
 automatically appeared 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.660
 if your phantom does not appear then 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.330
 model tree, make sure to select the sketch 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:24.120
 number one without this building you are not 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:26.130
 will and so here is our shaft here see on 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.090
 panels choose a difficult direction 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.220
 rotation but we have principle he video 360 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.450
 degrees we turn things that is possible and 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.710
 do less for 180 m 90 ie you 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.970
 just no no no 300 degrees 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.980
 defecate for example if the device 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:50.790
 save then wax will be half 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:54.330
 shaft and now let's click on the panel 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:58.980
 specially the board create an object and 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:03.540
 so here is our our fuck three-dimensional model 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:07.350
 the shaft is ready now let us deliver 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.260
 the necessary chamfers and let's finish it 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.240
 our construction 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:16.740
 let's here on the instrumental 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:20.130
 detail edit panels select 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.160
 team chamfer form command create 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.350
 chamfer I activate it here we see 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:32.700
 chamfer length let's 5 basically a lot 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:39.780
 let's make two millimeters well and the angle 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:43.470
 here we leave 45 degrees to us now 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.080
 you need to bring our cursor to the edges and 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.780
 when the edge icon appears the same cursor 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.669
 click on it because I click and phantom 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:59.400
 chamfers appeared here chamfer with on 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:02.480
 this edge on this and on this now 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.080
 click to create an object and here are our chamfers 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.500
 ready 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.710
 in this way with the help of the command 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.169
 rotation operation we built with you 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.500
 three-dimensional shaft model 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:19.860
 that is, see how quickly would imagine 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.750
 if we built using an operation 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:28.530
 squeezing we would have to squeeze 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:31.650
 1 cylindrical surface 2 3 and 4 we 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.759
 it's all done in one action just 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.219
 built a sketch of our trees 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:41.969
 so on this our lesson went to 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:44.129
 I think the end is clear I explained and 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:46.080
 try to do something now 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:48.930
 similar in size 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:53.599
 no matter how you ask, so I wish you 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.599
 success see you soon
