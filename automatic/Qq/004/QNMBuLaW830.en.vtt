00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
that I could think of that are the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.450 
that I could think of that are the
highest<00:00:30.900> rated<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.619> retire<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> first

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
retire in the first season because they

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.130

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
mean that you can pick up their regions

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.240 
mean that you can pick up their regions
within<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.780> second<00:00:58.140> season<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.219> remember

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
within the second season but do remember

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.580 
within the second season but do remember
guys<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.180> applies<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.780> any<00:01:01.170> player<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
guys that this applies to any player in

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
guys that this applies to any player in
the<00:01:01.859> game<00:01:02.010> although<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.489> easier<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the game although it's easier to do it

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.479 
the game although it's easier to do it
with<00:01:03.390> our<00:01:03.840> rater<00:01:04.409> players<00:01:04.769> because<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.250> course

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
with our rater players because of course

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.550 
with our rater players because of course
when<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:05.850> get<00:01:06.030> regenerated<00:01:06.869> they<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
when they get regenerated they have a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.460 
when they get regenerated they have a
potential<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.670> their<00:01:08.850> overall<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.600> when

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
potential of what their overall was when

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.310 
potential of what their overall was when
the<00:01:10.619> game<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:11.159> started<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.840> example

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the game first started so for example

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 
the game first started so for example
Ferdinand<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:14.159> he<00:01:14.340> started<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> game

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
Ferdinand when he started in the game

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.499 
Ferdinand when he started in the game
his<00:01:16.229> overall<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.100> 83<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:17.880> his<00:01:18.090> potential

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
his overall was 83 so his potential

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.530 
his overall was 83 so his potential
would<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.710> showing<00:01:20.220> great<00:01:20.640> potential<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
would be a showing great potential and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.200 
would be a showing great potential and
it's<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> same<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.830> Lampard<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.460> also<00:01:23.939> for

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it's the same with Lampard and also for

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.300 
it's the same with Lampard and also for
y'all<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.600> first<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.380> we're<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> be

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
y'all but first of all we're going to be

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
y'all but first of all we're going to be
putting<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> search<00:01:27.180> filters<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.900> is

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
putting in the search filters this is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.590

look<00:04:02.970> at<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.269> span<00:04:03.660> tackle<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.200> slide

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
look at that span tackle and slide

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.979 
look at that span tackle and slide
tackle<00:04:04.919> one<00:04:05.609> stand<00:04:05.970> tack<00:04:06.239> on<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.569> slide

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
tackle one stand tack on to slide

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.599 
tackle one stand tack on to slide
tackles<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.560> he's<00:04:07.769> still<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.220> game

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
tackles so he's still in the game

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.759 
tackles so he's still in the game
so<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.030> can't<00:04:09.329> quite<00:04:09.569> pick<00:04:09.780> up<00:04:09.930> his<00:04:10.049> regen<00:04:10.530> yet

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
so you can't quite pick up his regen yet

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.129 
so you can't quite pick up his regen yet
but<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.069> course<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.730> only<00:04:11.910> applies<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.810> this

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
but of course this only applies to this

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.409 
but of course this only applies to this
career<00:04:13.500> mode<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:13.829> he<00:04:14.010> may<00:04:14.160> have<00:04:14.459> retired<00:04:15.239> in

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
career mode so he may have retired in

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.659 
career mode so he may have retired in
the<00:04:15.510> first<00:04:15.750> season<00:04:16.169> for<00:04:16.289> you<00:04:16.409> usually<00:04:17.070> he<00:04:17.459> does

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
the first season for you usually he does

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.440 
the first season for you usually he does
this<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:17.969> pretty

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
this is pretty

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.600 
this is pretty
to<00:04:19.110> see<00:04:19.290> this<00:04:19.470> happen<00:04:19.920> but<00:04:20.100> something<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.550> do

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.380 
had retired I did search up his name
didn't<00:04:29.190> come<00:04:29.340> up<00:04:29.370> with<00:04:29.580> anything<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.240> was

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
didn't come up with anything so I was

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.630 
didn't come up with anything so I was
looking<00:04:30.810> for<00:04:31.080> an<00:04:31.260> Italian<00:04:31.920> goalkeeper<00:04:32.400> in<00:04:32.520> the

Syria and all of these players were
actually<00:04:35.190> loan<00:04:35.400> listed<00:04:35.850> so<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.090> can't

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
actually loan listed so you can't

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.750 
actually loan listed so you can't
actually<00:04:36.750> see<00:04:37.080> their<00:04:37.470> potential<00:04:38.130> which<00:04:38.610> is

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
actually see their potential which is

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.670 
actually see their potential which is
very<00:04:39.000> frustrating<00:04:39.240> but<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.050> guess<00:04:40.320> you<00:04:40.500> could

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
very frustrating but I guess you could

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.980 
very frustrating but I guess you could
try<00:04:40.920> and<00:04:41.130> guess<00:04:41.340> which<00:04:42.210> player<00:04:42.570> is<00:04:42.840> it's

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990
