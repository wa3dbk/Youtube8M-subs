00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
day a little bit of water seems to be

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.200 
day a little bit of water seems to be
coming<00:00:19.140> out<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.410> radiator<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.119> you<00:00:21.119> can

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
coming out of the radiator and you can

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.620 
coming out of the radiator and you can
just<00:00:21.359> see<00:00:21.539> it's<00:00:21.689> slightly<00:00:22.020> wet<00:00:22.320> down<00:00:22.590> there<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
just see it's slightly wet down there a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.580 
just see it's slightly wet down there a
little<00:00:24.630> bit<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.019> dribble

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
little bit of a dribble

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.259 
little bit of a dribble
I<00:00:26.300> took<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.539> front<00:00:27.810> off<00:00:27.930> earlier<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.910> I<00:00:29.910> can

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I took the front off earlier and I can

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.389 
I took the front off earlier and I can
just<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.309> zoom<00:00:32.309> down<00:00:32.610> there<00:00:34.010> slight<00:00:35.010> water

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
just see a zoom down there slight water

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.330 
just see a zoom down there slight water
on<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> bottom<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> radiator<00:00:40.190> now<00:00:41.190> our

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
on the bottom of the radiator now our

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.740 
on the bottom of the radiator now our
first<00:00:41.550> thoughts<00:00:41.790> were<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.210> radiators

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
first thoughts were the radiators

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.889 
first thoughts were the radiators
knackered<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.760> roll<00:00:45.000> radiator<00:00:45.510> quite

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
knackered so if I roll radiator quite

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.090 
knackered so if I roll radiator quite
possibly<00:00:46.260> rusted<00:00:46.710> through<00:00:47.360> but<00:00:48.360> also<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
possibly rusted through but also a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.810 
possibly rusted through but also a
couple<00:00:50.100> other<00:00:50.250> things<00:00:50.579> I've<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.059> found<00:00:52.820> set

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
couple other things I've just found set

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.459 
couple other things I've just found set
the<00:00:53.910> radiator<00:00:54.270> top<00:00:54.570> over<00:00:55.050> cap<00:00:55.260> off<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:57.469> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
the radiator top over cap off and the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.520 
the radiator top over cap off and the
washer<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.920> completely<00:00:59.370> buggered<00:00:59.579> inside<00:01:00.530> so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
washer is completely buggered inside so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
washer is completely buggered inside so
that's<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.859> sealing<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.550> meant<00:01:02.789> some

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that's not sealing which meant some

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
that's not sealing which meant some
water<00:01:03.719> might<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.140> coming<00:01:04.470> down<00:01:04.500> from<00:01:05.400> here

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
water might be coming down from here

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.820 
water might be coming down from here
over<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> oven<00:01:06.330> flue<00:01:06.510> pipe<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.110> because

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
over the oven flue pipe there because

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.560 
over the oven flue pipe there because
there's<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> little<00:01:08.310> overflow<00:01:08.640> bit<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
there's a little overflow bit there that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.219 
there's a little overflow bit there that
neat<00:01:09.840> spike<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.619> I've<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:10.830> got<00:01:12.049> we<00:01:13.049> just

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
neat spike so I've actually got we just

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.910 
neat spike so I've actually got we just
put<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> camcorder<00:01:13.830> down<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:15.920> I've

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
put the camcorder down there I've

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.179 
put the camcorder down there I've
actually<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> new<00:01:17.729> radiator<00:01:18.090> cap<00:01:19.100> there<00:01:20.100> we

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
actually got a new radiator cap there we

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.219 
actually got a new radiator cap there we
go<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.670> fits<00:01:21.119> straight<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.750> off<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
go one fits straight in there off of the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.950 
go one fits straight in there off of the
internet<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:22.860> about<00:01:22.950> eight<00:01:23.220> quid<00:01:23.780> which<00:01:24.780> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
internet for about eight quid which is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
internet for about eight quid which is
nice<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:26.430> also<00:01:27.560> it's<00:01:28.560> missing<00:01:28.979> an<00:01:29.189> able<00:01:29.460> flow

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
nice but also it's missing an able flow

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370 
nice but also it's missing an able flow
pipe<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.270> should<00:01:30.509> come<00:01:30.720> off<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.020> radiator

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
pipe that should come off the radiator

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.810 
pipe that should come off the radiator
probably<00:01:31.860> can't<00:01:32.070> see<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.430> there<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.700> too

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
probably can't see in there it's too

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.340 
probably can't see in there it's too
dark

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
dark

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.710 
dark
you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.369> probably<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.790> make<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> little

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you can probably just make out a little

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.840 
you can probably just make out a little
pipe<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.409> there<00:01:38.369> should<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> little

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
pipe there there should be a little

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.160 
pipe there there should be a little
rubber<00:01:39.090> hose<00:01:39.360> off<00:01:39.600> they're<00:01:39.810> coming<00:01:40.079> down

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
rubber hose off they're coming down

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
rubber hose off they're coming down
inside<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> engine<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.950> stop<00:01:41.189> any<00:01:42.030> excess

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
inside the engine to stop any excess

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.999 
inside the engine to stop any excess
water<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.750> comes<00:01:43.020> out<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.409> radiator<00:01:43.710> cut

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
water that comes out of the radiator cut

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.130 
water that comes out of the radiator cut
from<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.670> straight<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.930> needs

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
from going straight on it so that needs

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.469 
from going straight on it so that needs
replacing<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> actually

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
replacing so what I'm going to actually

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.020 
replacing so what I'm going to actually
do<00:01:49.130> I'm<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> attempt<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> take<00:01:50.909> this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
do I'm going to attempt to take this

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.190 
do I'm going to attempt to take this
cover<00:01:51.329> off<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:53.600> because<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> need<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.960> really

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
cover off here because I need to really

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800 
cover off here because I need to really
see<00:01:55.380> what's<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.860> behind<00:01:56.009> there<00:01:56.810> see

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
see what's going on behind there see

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.359 
see what's going on behind there see
whether<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> radiator<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.009> got<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> hole

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
whether the radiator is it's got a hole

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.289 
whether the radiator is it's got a hole
in<00:01:59.399> it<00:02:00.049> or<00:02:01.049> whether<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.770> cap

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
in it or whether it is just that cap

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.830 
in it or whether it is just that cap
I've<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.509> done<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.810> before<00:02:05.360> in<00:02:06.360> theory<00:02:06.689> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
I've not done this before in theory it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.969 
I've not done this before in theory it
it's<00:02:06.990> quite<00:02:07.110> easy<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.530> there's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.799> couple

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it's quite easy because there's a couple

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.980 
it's quite easy because there's a couple
of<00:02:08.160> bolts<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.800> couple<00:02:10.800> here

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
of bolts on there a couple here

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.600 
of bolts on there a couple here
and<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.620> think<00:02:12.680> if<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:12.980> just<00:02:13.010> take<00:02:13.280> these<00:02:13.400> bits

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
and I think if I just take these bits

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.260 
and I think if I just take these bits
off<00:02:13.850> here<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.750> should<00:02:14.960> just<00:02:15.140> all<00:02:15.290> pull<00:02:15.950> up<00:02:16.270> and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
off here it should just all pull up and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.860 
off here it should just all pull up and
that's<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.570> theory<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.430> now<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.330> reality<00:02:20.540> is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
that's a theory and now the reality is

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.570 
that's a theory and now the reality is
that<00:02:20.990> see<00:02:21.290> what<00:02:21.410> happens<00:02:24.100> okay<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:25.370> I'm<00:02:25.550> just

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
that see what happens okay so I'm just

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.820 
that see what happens okay so I'm just
going<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.880> touch<00:02:26.060> start<00:02:26.390> by<00:02:26.540> taking<00:02:26.750> off<00:02:26.990> well

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
going to touch start by taking off well

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.920 
going to touch start by taking off well
let's<00:02:28.070> take<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.280> new<00:02:28.850> cap<00:02:29.120> off<00:02:29.360> slightly<00:02:29.750> in

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
let's take that new cap off slightly in

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.310 
let's take that new cap off slightly in
the<00:02:30.020> way<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.500> cover

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
the way of the cover

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.210 
the way of the cover
all<00:02:33.320> right<00:02:33.470> thing<00:02:33.710> okay

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.070 

leave<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.280> fuel<00:02:37.490> cap<00:02:37.640> off<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:38.390> air<00:02:38.630> vent<00:02:38.660> got

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
leave the fuel cap off this air vent got

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.860 
leave the fuel cap off this air vent got
to<00:02:39.170> come<00:02:39.350> off<00:02:39.500> as<00:02:39.680> well<00:02:40.600> because<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.750> won't

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
to come off as well because that won't

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.680 
to come off as well because that won't
go<00:02:42.110> past<00:02:42.350> there<00:02:42.880> but<00:02:43.880> looking<00:02:44.180> at<00:02:44.270> that<00:02:44.300> that's

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
go past there but looking at that that's

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.570 
go past there but looking at that that's
not<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.960> easiest<00:02:44.990> if<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.710> wedged<00:02:45.890> on<00:02:46.130> there<00:02:46.370> so

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
not the easiest if it wedged on there so

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.830 
not the easiest if it wedged on there so
I'm<00:02:46.670> not<00:02:46.700> quite<00:02:46.910> sure<00:02:47.030> how<00:02:47.270> well<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.630> come

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
I'm not quite sure how well that I come

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.690 
I'm not quite sure how well that I come
off

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:09.270 

oh<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.739> place<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.069> thought<00:03:01.220> would<00:03:01.340> be

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:20.820 

okay<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:10.340> we've<00:03:10.490> got<00:03:10.520> 13<00:03:11.360> mil<00:03:11.690> spanner<00:03:12.110> on<00:03:12.320> here

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.470 

Carter<00:03:21.830> these<00:03:21.980> are<00:03:22.130> bolts<00:03:25.090> bolts<00:03:26.090> are<00:03:26.300> coming

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
Carter these are bolts bolts are coming

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:43.630 
Carter these are bolts bolts are coming
undone<00:03:26.690> easy<00:03:26.900> enough<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:43.010> ones<00:03:43.220> go<00:03:43.400> ahead

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
undone easy enough that ones go ahead

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.330 
undone easy enough that ones go ahead
let's<00:03:43.820> go<00:03:43.970> around<00:03:44.590> again<00:03:45.590> on<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:45.890> spanner<00:03:46.190> on

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
let's go around again on a spanner on

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.710 
let's go around again on a spanner on
there<00:03:48.580> all<00:03:49.580> right<00:03:49.760> put<00:03:49.970> myself<00:03:50.270> a<00:03:50.330> socket<00:03:50.540> set

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
there all right put myself a socket set

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:07.990 
there all right put myself a socket set
now<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:06.800> good<00:04:06.920> thing<00:04:07.070> about<00:04:07.130> tracks<00:04:07.520> my<00:04:07.730> shoes

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
now the good thing about tracks my shoes

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.420 
now the good thing about tracks my shoes
it's<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.270> little<00:04:08.510> bit<00:04:08.630> like<00:04:08.780> Locarno<00:04:09.430> old

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
it's a little bit like Locarno old

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.350 
it's a little bit like Locarno old
technology

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
technology

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.430 
technology
70s<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:13.510> okay<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:14.750> having<00:04:15.200> all<00:04:15.320> the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
70s and okay so you having all the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.259 
70s and okay so you having all the
electronics<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.160> flashy<00:04:16.370> gadgets<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.209> stuff

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
electronics of flashy gadgets and stuff

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.909 
electronics of flashy gadgets and stuff
but<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.690> thing<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.959> if<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.290> want<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.530> work<00:04:18.680> on

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
but the thing is if you want to work on

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.080 
but the thing is if you want to work on
it<00:04:20.229> you<00:04:21.229> can<00:04:21.380> do<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.530> with<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.859> few<00:04:22.310> Spanish<00:04:22.610> now

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
it you can do it with a few Spanish now

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.900 
it you can do it with a few Spanish now
I'm<00:04:23.180> going<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.450> be<00:04:23.510> an<00:04:23.600> electronic<00:04:24.140> genius

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
I'm going to be an electronic genius

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.500 
I'm going to be an electronic genius
okay<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:25.970> that's<00:04:29.080> such<00:04:30.080> side<00:04:31.180> let's<00:04:32.180> go<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.419> do

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
okay so that's such side let's go and do

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:53.640 
okay so that's such side let's go and do
the<00:04:32.630> other<00:04:32.750> side

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.680 

of<00:04:54.650> course<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.010> bank<00:04:55.220> side<00:04:55.400> of<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:55.730> sort<00:04:56.630> of

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
of course the bank side of this sort of

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.380 
of course the bank side of this sort of
thing<00:04:56.930> is<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:58.310> all<00:04:58.460> takes<00:04:58.730> time<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.240> if<00:04:59.300> you're

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
thing is it all takes time and if you're

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.850 
thing is it all takes time and if you're
paying<00:04:59.660> mechanic's<00:05:00.140> to<00:05:00.260> do<00:05:00.410> this<00:05:00.560> it's

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
paying mechanic's to do this it's

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.490 
paying mechanic's to do this it's
costing<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.340> money<00:05:01.780> whereas<00:05:02.780> if<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.050> get<00:05:03.230> on

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
costing you money whereas if you get on

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.940 
costing you money whereas if you get on
the<00:05:03.730> someone<00:05:04.730> like<00:05:04.820> mcCormick

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
the someone like mcCormick

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.770 
the someone like mcCormick
you<00:05:06.950> can<00:05:07.100> just<00:05:07.280> lift<00:05:07.730> the<00:05:07.910> bonnet<00:05:08.270> access<00:05:08.630> the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
you can just lift the bonnet access the

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.930 
you can just lift the bonnet access the
engine<00:05:10.090> very<00:05:11.090> quickly

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
engine very quickly

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.520 
engine very quickly
and<00:05:13.940> I<00:05:14.390> mean<00:05:14.570> this<00:05:14.720> doesn't<00:05:14.930> cost<00:05:15.170> me<00:05:15.350> anything

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
and I mean this doesn't cost me anything

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.500 
and I mean this doesn't cost me anything
but<00:05:15.860> if<00:05:15.920> I<00:05:16.070> was<00:05:16.220> paying<00:05:16.460> someone<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:16.790> do<00:05:17.000> this

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
but if I was paying someone to do this

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.700 
but if I was paying someone to do this
just<00:05:18.470> undo<00:05:18.830> bolts<00:05:19.190> might<00:05:19.610> cost<00:05:19.850> me<00:05:20.620> 50<00:05:21.620> on

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
just undo bolts might cost me 50 on

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.290 
just undo bolts might cost me 50 on
paying<00:05:21.980> an<00:05:22.130> hour<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.520> get<00:05:22.700> someone<00:05:23.090> just

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
paying an hour to get someone just

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.370 
paying an hour to get someone just
stupid<00:05:23.840> this<00:05:25.540> which<00:05:26.540> is<00:05:26.660> dead<00:05:26.840> money<00:05:27.050> really

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
stupid this which is dead money really

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.400 
stupid this which is dead money really
as<00:05:27.440> you<00:05:27.830> can<00:05:28.070> see<00:05:28.600> it's<00:05:29.600> not<00:05:29.750> rocket<00:05:29.960> science

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
as you can see it's not rocket science

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:55.870 
as you can see it's not rocket science
it's<00:05:30.590> just<00:05:31.090> time
