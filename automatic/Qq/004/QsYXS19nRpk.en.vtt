00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.820
 how to conquer a man while each 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:10.120
 is different 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:14.170
 but we have to take into account a lot 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.620
 these next steps are not obvious 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.230
 to not be obvious it is necessary that 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.660
 be yourself trying to boost your 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.750
 resources and balancing them with others 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.670
 attitudes dress sexy but not something 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.960
 out of the ordinary according to your own 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.600
 eye personality being suggestive contributes 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.270
 a lot in this aspect but not too much 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.120
 because you could scare him 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.780
 point 2 eye contact during the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.270
 dialogue it is important that you feel 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.430
 attended and heard studies affirm 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.130
 that eye contact can encourage 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.500
 to that unconsciously the other person 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.460
 be attracted to you 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.040
 point 3 physical appearance men do not 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.339
 they always require you to be a model 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.979
 delgadita the high and wonderful 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.060
 coincidence in general in them is given 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.640
 in hatred of the excess makeup 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.910
 use of extremely striking garments 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.820
 women who are presumed too much 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.550
 can say that they are looking for a woman who 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.100
 arrange but without exaggeration refers to 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.009
 an extravagant style for example as 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.190
 I am wearing a very small clothes and 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.100
 with a hair is painted purple 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.850
 good for me personally and for me 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.990
 husband that looks totally ridiculous 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.390
 point 4 the moderation speaks to the extent 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.600
 of possible things that seem 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.080
 match agree not nodding to 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.040
 ideas that could result from 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.330
 contradictory or boring 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.830
 ie I am yourself shows you 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.220
 interested and attentive to your comments 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.460
 but not in excess the mystery of a 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:09.539
 word and it's important at this height 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.170
 point 5 body language smiles and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.330
 well communicate so you feel comfortable 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.300
 where and with whom are you besides 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.480
 show your acceptance and enthusiasm is 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.870
 a positive and contagious image and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.180
 you will receive much of it from him 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.750
 I'm totally female you can talk 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.790
 on topics that socially create 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.080
 male but they are never good 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.570
 excesses be careful with that does not exceed 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.540
 that he does not consider that it could be a 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:48.670
 co- worker or a friend more 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.189
 point 6 show yourself safe in 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.859
 your posture your obsessions form of 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:56.829
 Acting and managing is a good challenge 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:59.680
 for them trying to conquer a 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.379
 independent woman and do not take the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.290
 life with lightness you have to have 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:10.799
 Be careful in this position of not looking 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.799
 cold and show you that if you need love 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:19.100
 step 7 the compliments are good but 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.200
 as always we say without excesses the 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.670
 Ego of men as of every person 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.670
 it is always a good point of attack eye 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.580
 the lies are not good and in case of 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.550
 be used should not end up being a 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.130
 obvious falsehood carefully apply your 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.950
 praise so your man does not come back 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.590
 superb in this way you will achieve your 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.680
 objectives of how to conquer a man 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.390
 which steals your sleep and even the 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.110
 tranquility 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.350
 point 8 common themes as we said 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.530
 before you can tackle various 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.620
 topics but not leaving aside your 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.950
 femininity the details can also 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.530
 find interesting is not something that 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.140
 appreciate only women but also 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.500
 the men try to surprise him 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.400
 eye the kitsch to a smart world 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.620
 it scares him 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.590
 the point 9 be sortu be comprehensive 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.220
 we all need a little understanding 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.590
 although the man you are with may 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.610
 look strong and determined in some 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.460
 themes 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.460
 They may need tea they may need 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.830
 that you lend a little bit of 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:44.010
 attention and do well and stay away 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.430
 if they advise it based on what is best 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.760
 you create given the situation that they try 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.180
