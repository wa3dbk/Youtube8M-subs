 [Music] 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.879
 Hello everyone 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.120
 sega games she is today I'm going 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:27.150
 to show you how we do to have 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:34.290
 minecraft for free so so we 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:38.090
 this page which is in English so that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.760
 it's a pub 1 I'll put the nose 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.760
 in the description click on download 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.750
 so we have a kraft sp so I 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.350
 have already downloaded young told me on my 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.350
 registered office 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:08.070
 so in fact it's pretty fast but 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.010
 So now here and here we have 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.990
 more than just throwing it 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.880
 so we say executed like that 6 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.799
 to not give this image must be done 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:34.080
 right click open with I do not know where 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:36.380
 it is this there I see it well it's not 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.380
 serious 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.850
 let him open with and you 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.420
 choose via low the ideal is to have 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.810
 64-bit java game with so we do 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.810
 perform 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.649
 we enter the game and you 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.959
 at first it's a bit longer because 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.140
 that I already have the files they 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:10.049
 use the islands are already registered 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.400
 so it's not worth it it is 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.640
 not have to do it again but 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.330
 normally you have a download 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:23.390
 does that make you like that nancy click 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:29.600
 on enter games does that will make you 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:32.570
 run like that goes up that does it 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.109
 download it's nothing serious it's 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:40.140
 to show windows get that in 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:43.170
 download this little folder there this 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.769
 record who is everyone 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:51.000
 fake all all that minecraft 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:53.400
 actually uses and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.310
 it also allows to put a tie to 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.500
 day when when you're new 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:04.980
 version that came out so here is his 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.380
 charge and then that's all that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:16.410
 so it's still unchecked 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.910
 before opening it's faster and that 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:29.260
 also allows you to delete the modes 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:32.379
 good there I overflow a little of the subject no 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.159

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:39.810

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:43.629

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.120

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.260

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:57.519

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:03.069
