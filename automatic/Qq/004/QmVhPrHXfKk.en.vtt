00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
that with these foreign proteins

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.750 
that with these foreign proteins
basically<00:00:48.829> my<00:00:49.829> gym<00:00:50.070> had<00:00:50.250> loads<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> these

basically my gym had loads of these
right<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.110> what<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.710> are

the whole box so I did and the reason I
did<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.390> because<00:00:57.660> online<00:00:58.160> they're<00:00:59.160> about

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
did that is because online they're about

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
did that is because online they're about
double<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> price<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.840> you're<00:01:00.989> buying<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
gonna let you know the macros on these

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.590 
gonna let you know the macros on these
but<00:01:33.299> let<00:01:33.479> me<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.600> put<00:01:34.049> these<00:01:34.229> down<00:01:35.360> right<00:01:36.360> you

finish cumin and I got more right so
let's<00:01:43.740> get<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> macros<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.790> these<00:01:44.909> right

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
let's get to the macros of these right

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.260 
let's get to the macros of these right
basically<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.579> looks<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.909> as

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
basically this is what it looks like as

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.819 
basically this is what it looks like as
you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.899> looks<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.259> bottle<00:01:49.649> right

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
you can see it looks like a bottle right

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.069 
you can see it looks like a bottle right
