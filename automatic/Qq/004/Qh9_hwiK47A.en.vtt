00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:11.060
 [Music] 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.680
 and prepare a flying lobster 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.200
 accompany 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.110
 the most important thing is to open the lobster 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.230
 We go step by step to open the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.489
 lobster you have to cut the lobster and 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.489
 remove the tongs 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.690
 this lobster comes from from canada 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.130
 then it's a lobster lobster 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.410
 difference from the red lobster that 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.030
 we have in the Caribbean 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.719
 ok as you can see here would be the 2 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.910
 the two pincers of the lobster we are going to 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.530
 clean it because it is very important to know 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.410
 that in this part of here the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.660
 meat let's hit it on one side and the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.930
 another one and this lobster we're going to put 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.309
 cook directly on water and the the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.850
 We will cook the rest of the lobster 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.800
 the Angel 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.840
 on the grill then here we have the 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.280
 lobster and is ready 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:13.540
 [Music] 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.480
 it is very important to make sure 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.840
 and it was ready that it was left open and 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.829
 so 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.429
 we will finish removing excess 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.960
 the lobster is a male lobster like 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.270
 you know in all the animals that you use 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.549
 lobster female and lobster male 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.079
 Here we have the lobster ready as 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.990
 it's fresh we're going to cook it 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.469
 directly on the grill accompany me 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.469
 to the broiler 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.390
 [Music] 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.470
 let's accommodate the lobster 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.630
 so that you can directly save that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.630
 normally, it is not easy to see 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.960
 I'm going to put a touch of milk cream 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.670
 to help it evenly brown 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.130
 here you have the problem that you have near 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.890
 of 400 degrees we will finish it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.250
 brown I'm going to put some cream on 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.200
 little milk ready so he can leave 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.530
 browning and now we are going to finish the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.569
 lobster cooking on the grill is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.880
 find the fire that is uniform 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.880
 begins to fly all the lobster 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.440
 and in a couple of minutes get off the list 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.830
 even the light is ideal if we wanted 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.420
 accompany with a good tequila because I 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.550
 I recommend using both although they have 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.150
 the rocks the best two covered in 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.730
 ice a good tequila don julio 70 a 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.730
 lemon touch and delicious 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.730
 Y 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.440
 let's say is the lobster entails 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.390
 more emotion we are going to spend 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.880
 directly the lobster to our plate 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.650
 they realize the brain and everything and in exchange 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.780
 the consistency and color 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.060
 it's hot, let's go with it 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.159
 here with the hands with the pains of the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.230
 lobster that we put in liquid in water 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.940
 and let's put a little bit of 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.660
 clarified butter that we have here 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.180
 because not some cartoons to accompany 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.340
 the lobster is the ideal way to eat 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.590
 the lobster that you call the lobster 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.840
 cooked on the grill with their tongs 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.170
 hands or so we put about 20 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.530
 minutes let's finish delay 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.310
 now let's go with some facebook 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.310
 good profit 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.880
