going to wipe the teeth along with this
LED<00:02:15.790> lights<00:02:18.330> and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
LED lights and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.710 
LED lights and
the<00:02:21.060> final<00:02:21.420> thing<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.200> container<00:02:23.720> which

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the final thing is the container which

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.290 
the final thing is the container which
you<00:02:24.900> used<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.230> apply<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.010> gel<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.090> first

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
you used to apply the gel in the first

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.270 
you used to apply the gel in the first
thing<00:02:27.390> I'm<00:02:27.510> going<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.750> do<00:02:27.960> is<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.650> figure<00:02:29.010> out

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
thing I'm going to do is to figure out

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.000 
thing I'm going to do is to figure out
which<00:02:29.670> shade<00:02:29.940> my<00:02:30.090> teeth<00:02:30.300> are<00:02:30.800> using<00:02:31.800> this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
which shade my teeth are using this

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.630 
which shade my teeth are using this
shade<00:02:32.460> aisle<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:34.230> goes<00:02:34.470> from<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.490> most

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
shade aisle and it goes from the most

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.270 
shade aisle and it goes from the most
yellow<00:02:35.970> shade<00:02:36.360> which<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.630> number<00:02:37.020> 16<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.590> all

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
yellow shade which is number 16 and all

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.070 
yellow shade which is number 16 and all
the<00:02:38.430> way<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:39.150> widest<00:02:39.570> shade<00:02:39.780> which<00:02:40.050> is

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
the way to the widest shade which is

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.250 
the way to the widest shade which is
number<00:02:40.560> one<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:44.150> think<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.420> looks<00:02:45.600> like<00:02:45.810> my

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
number one I think it looks like my

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.050 
number one I think it looks like my
teeth<00:02:46.470> are<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:47.250> shade<00:02:47.490> eight<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:49.820> then<00:02:50.820> my

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
teeth are a shade eight and then my

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.990 
teeth are a shade eight and then my
bottom<00:02:51.360> teeth<00:02:51.570> are<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:52.320> bit<00:02:52.830> more<00:02:53.010> yellow<00:02:53.220> so

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
bottom teeth are a bit more yellow so

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.380 
bottom teeth are a bit more yellow so
let's<00:02:54.330> see<00:02:54.480> yeah<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.680> think<00:02:55.920> those<00:02:56.340> are<00:02:56.670> at<00:02:57.090> ten

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
let's see yeah I think those are at ten

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.270 
let's see yeah I think those are at ten
one<00:03:00.390> treatment<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:01.110> supposed<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.590> whiten<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
one treatment is supposed to whiten the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.780 
one treatment is supposed to whiten the
teeth<00:03:02.310> four<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.360> seven<00:03:03.630> shades<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.490> so<00:03:05.490> I

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
teeth four to seven shades and so I

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.150 
teeth four to seven shades and so I
guess<00:03:06.060> we'll<00:03:06.270> see<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.540> happens<00:03:07.100> now<00:03:08.100> I'm

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
guess we'll see if that happens now I'm

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.890 
guess we'll see if that happens now I'm
going<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.490> squeeze<00:03:08.760> some<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.300> gel<00:03:09.570> into

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
going to squeeze some of the gel into

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.370 
going to squeeze some of the gel into
the<00:03:10.530> container<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.690> kid<00:03:12.840> says<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.110> use

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
the container and the kid says to use

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.010 
the container and the kid says to use
one<00:03:13.650> point<00:03:13.920> five<00:03:14.190> milliliter<00:03:14.760> but<00:03:15.390> I've<00:03:15.750> seen

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
one point five milliliter but I've seen

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.690 
one point five milliliter but I've seen
some<00:03:16.230> reviews<00:03:16.590> where<00:03:16.920> they<00:03:17.100> say<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.610> that's

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
some reviews where they say that that's

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.910 
some reviews where they say that that's
too<00:03:18.030> much<00:03:18.240> especially<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.290> just<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.710> front

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
too much especially for just the front

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.100 
too much especially for just the front
teeth<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.850> I'm<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.270> going<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.660> use<00:03:21.780> one

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
teeth so I'm just going to use one

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.470 
teeth so I'm just going to use one
minute<00:03:22.410> later<00:03:22.590> instead<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.340> will<00:03:24.300> give

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
minute later instead and that will give

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.500 
minute later instead and that will give
you<00:03:24.720> five<00:03:25.380> treatments<00:03:26.100> instead<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.330> just

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
you five treatments instead of just

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.720 
you five treatments instead of just
three<00:03:27.930> which<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.560> kid<00:03:28.770> is<00:03:29.010> supposed<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.550> give
