00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
what I'm doing is I'm just creating a

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.360 
what I'm doing is I'm just creating a
little<00:03:28.000> frozen<00:03:28.209> disks<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.920> what<00:03:30.069> I<00:03:30.099> mean<00:03:30.220> by

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
little frozen disks and what I mean by

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.789 
little frozen disks and what I mean by
anti-griddle<00:03:30.879> is<00:03:31.470> actually<00:03:32.470> creating<00:03:32.739> a

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
anti-griddle is actually creating a

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.979 
anti-griddle is actually creating a
surface<00:03:33.030> that's<00:03:34.030> as<00:03:34.209> cold<00:03:34.450> as<00:03:34.599> its<00:03:34.750> liquid

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
surface that's as cold as its liquid

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.890 
surface that's as cold as its liquid
nitrogen<00:03:35.260> liquid<00:03:35.530> nitrogen<00:03:36.519> is<00:03:36.670> negative<00:03:37.000> 320

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
nitrogen liquid nitrogen is negative 320

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:50.349 
nitrogen liquid nitrogen is negative 320
degrees<00:03:39.420> Fahrenheit<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.540> is

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359
