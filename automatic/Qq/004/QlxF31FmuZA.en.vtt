00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.849
 which is the sony ps compression that this is 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 necessarily for the drivers I work 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.800

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.690
 this program and have it installed 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.120
 just as you remember are for the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.559
 drivers we leave it there and so good 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.750
 let's enter this folder that the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.340
 I leave you and we'll see what to do in these 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.590
 good files first thing you have to 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.890
 to do is to go abstention from the phone 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.649
 system settings up down we're going to 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.480
 developer absences we put the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.010
 arrow or button to the right or 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.930
 let's go the options of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.760
 developer and we're going to debug 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.039
 usb and we select it we leave a 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.660
 message and we accept 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.000
 this phone we leave it like that 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.040
 is learned but with debugging not 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.230
 is activated 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.900
 Now what we are going to do is call 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.610
 burning wing bat we open it and it will come out 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.350
 this window here we have to connect 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.400
 the phone remembers with debugging 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.110
 usb and we will see that it does not sound clip since 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.750
 is installing the drivers because it does not 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.190
 they had usb debugging once it came out 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.410
 this we wait for our mind to open 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.920
 from here and we come back here we give 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.890
 enter and it is waiting in the background of 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.110

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.670
