00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.620
 on 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.210
 hello dear friends of the vegetarian 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:29.059
 cookery to a new edition of 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.469
 save at tv today make who's who must 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:33.469
 lies on the ground 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:36.649
 ok humus must be right for what you take 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.050
 high in the arabic cuisine as 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.850
 side dish or just as an ingredient 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.070
 I know that, for example, at Ferlach 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.899
 that can be correct with that too 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.370
 make clean what ingredients tomorrow countries 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.290
 It's chickpeas 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.150
 Chickpeas must be here separately 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.680
 still the water caught by peas 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.850
 lemons we need schily's garlic 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.509
 It is sesame paste cubin 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.549
 curry salt and pepper under with the 

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:08.890
 lemons 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.890
 We first press out three pieces 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:25.360
 Meanwhile, I can already here us 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:32.830
 lay our four cloves of garlic ready 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.830
 ok 4 garlic cloves we pack now 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.550
 We take a dried chili peppers 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.710
 even more so I can just like that 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.980
 break small then we start now 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.500
 with that the chickpeas in 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:02:00.500
 the kitchen machine is given garlic and 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.930
 Chilies are also with the chilis 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.450
 Kernen in there because then yes still 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.869
 Neat reserve then worry 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.040
 we go there 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.040
 We take two tablespoons away 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.450
 at least two tablespoons also from the gum 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:34.849
 a tablespoon of curry three to four 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.849
 tablespoons olive oil 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:03:01.430
 Let's take a part of that 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:03:03.500
 Sure, peas water also salt and now 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.070
 the whole thing in the mixer is fine 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.070
 mashed 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.950
 the whole thing is too thick just always 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:23.310
 a little bit of the chickpeas 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:25.800
 liquid tuned then I'll take 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.480
 here, too, the lemon juice 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.860
 first specify a little bit and on 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.860
 body seasoning 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.470
 Consistency and taste then agree 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.090
 can do what and to serve 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.470
 I would suggest that we have one 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.200
 take a little paprika that's one 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.159
 good idea so spread over 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.750
 and maybe the dried ones 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.750
 chilis one or two years that costs 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.569
 very nice that you should now for 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.610
 at least two hours in the 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.709
 Freeze fridge before then 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.709
 enjoy and i wish you good appetite
