00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 after 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.790
 b 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:09.319
 birth 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:10.719
 why in this sense 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:11.560
 today 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.549
 that's great 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.949
 because viewing center 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.949
 there'll be 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.359
 I want to share his fears 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.429
 for example 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.970
 this is happening abroad 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.970
 to justify tonight franÃ§ois allaire 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.499
 it is he who fixes us 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.530
 tonight is that there was emotion because there were 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.160
 episodes of things around afp 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.410
 on request the least bit bit 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.650
 and then the turbo singers stars a rock critic we talked a lot about 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.440
 the job created by rock is an event that could stir up the pace 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.579
 the record by dancing on the theme comes back on all of 40 the prices 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.050
 another job that people are less familiar with it's critical I find that 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.780
 yet auschwitz skiable and america for us but more 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.359
 complicated 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.269
 everyone hassan critical gastro and jean-paul wade no longer want to give his 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.539
 rebellion leaves well and truly surrounded by his critics gastroenteritis 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.649
 that is to say they are going to give a little bit our games for all 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.140
 likes 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.159
 the signs that announce households are less destitute 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.470
 it's always for me to kill myself and tell myself that I played a role in 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 his movie the half-second bounty better than that 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.980

 pontiff for his relationship tasting to see himself working that people like 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.420
 to see work rather than work is that will have to work 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.880
 hence the success of the males hit the building 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.840

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.859

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.760

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.810
 regret not yet been baptized to say business behavior 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.790
