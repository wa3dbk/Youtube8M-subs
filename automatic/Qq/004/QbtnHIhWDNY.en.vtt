00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
I'm curious is it is it less than a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.050 
I'm curious is it is it less than a
handful<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.229> Americans<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.250> look<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.880> they

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
handful of Americans you look like they

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.760 
handful of Americans you look like they
might<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.510> able<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> jump<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:09.770> challenge

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
might be able to jump up in to challenge

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.510 
might be able to jump up in to challenge
your<00:01:10.860> status<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.049> I<00:01:13.049> don't<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:13.979> there's<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
your status and I don't think there's a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.060 
your status and I don't think there's a
new<00:01:15.119> American<00:01:15.780> wave<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:16.890> they

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
new American wave I just think they

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.310 
new American wave I just think they
eventually

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
American will step forward and because

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.640 
American will step forward and because
of<00:01:22.010> the<00:01:22.280> tradition<00:01:24.100> in<00:01:25.100> America<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.650> we'll

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
of the tradition in America and we'll
