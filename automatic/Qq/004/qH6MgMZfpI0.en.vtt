our minimalist journey and where we're

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.780 
our minimalist journey and where we're
at<00:00:08.099> at<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.460> moment<00:00:08.790> with<00:00:09.210> our<00:00:09.330> family<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:10.790> you

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.060 
might have seen our video on the kitchen
decluttering<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.210> purge<00:00:15.630> process<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.470> that

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
decluttering and purge process and that

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.000 
decluttering and purge process and that
whole<00:00:17.430> experience<00:00:18.359> has<00:00:18.510> been<00:00:18.690> fantastic<00:00:19.010> so

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
whole experience has been fantastic so

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.090 
whole experience has been fantastic so
we<00:00:20.699> did<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> bit<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.060> an<00:00:21.180> experiment<00:00:21.570> where<00:00:21.869> we

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
we did a bit of an experiment where we

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.769 
we did a bit of an experiment where we
packed<00:00:23.100> away<00:00:23.250> all<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> extra<00:00:24.300> plates<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
packed away all the extra plates and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.450 
packed away all the extra plates and
bowls<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.529> only<00:00:25.650> had<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:26.039> item<00:00:26.430> per

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
bowls and so we only had one item per

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700 
bowls and so we only had one item per
person<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.269> hid<00:00:27.900> away<00:00:28.019> everything<00:00:28.320> else<00:00:28.590> in

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
person and hid away everything else in

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.710 
person and hid away everything else in
our<00:00:28.800> wine<00:00:29.010> cabinet<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.670> that's<00:00:30.539> been

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
our wine cabinet and that's been

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
our wine cabinet and that's been
fantastic<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.470> really<00:00:32.040> helped<00:00:32.279> me<00:00:32.369> keep<00:00:32.550> on

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
fantastic it's really helped me keep on

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.030 
fantastic it's really helped me keep on
track<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.600> dishes<00:00:33.899> which<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.890> guess

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
track of all of the dishes which I guess

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.880 
track of all of the dishes which I guess
was<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> main<00:00:35.630> purpose<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.590> as

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
was the main purpose of it and it was as

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
was the main purpose of it and it was as
a<00:00:37.950> result<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.550> experiment<00:00:39.120> I've<00:00:39.510> now

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
a result of this experiment I've now

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.530 
a result of this experiment I've now
sold<00:00:40.320> some<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.190> items<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.700> I've<00:00:41.790> decided

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
sold some of the items that I've decided

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.420 
sold some of the items that I've decided
weren't<00:00:42.870> necessary<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.559> us<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.920> also<00:00:44.040> given

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
weren't necessary for us and also given

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.459 
weren't necessary for us and also given
away<00:00:44.579> some<00:00:44.760> things<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.149> charity<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.320> we'll

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
away some things for charity so we'll

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
away some things for charity so we'll
still<00:00:46.680> kick<00:00:46.890> our<00:00:47.129> extra<00:00:47.430> bowls<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.030> plates

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
still kick our extra bowls and plates

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.180 
still kick our extra bowls and plates
and<00:00:48.600> things<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.930> hidden<00:00:49.620> away<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.160> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and things like that hidden away so that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
and things like that hidden away so that
if<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.670> guests<00:00:50.969> come<00:00:51.149> over<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
if we have guests come over but I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.869 
if we have guests come over but I
realize<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> didn't<00:00:52.949> need<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.250> much<00:00:53.370> bakeware

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
realize it didn't need so much bakeware

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
realize it didn't need so much bakeware
in<00:00:54.000> particular<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.680> kitchen<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:55.980> just

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
in particular so the kitchen is just

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.590 
in particular so the kitchen is just
feeling<00:00:56.489> fantastic<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.180> we're<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
feeling fantastic and we're going to

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.560 
feeling fantastic and we're going to
continue<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.320> long-term<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.449> now<00:01:00.449> there

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
continue this on long-term now now there

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.000 
continue this on long-term now now there
were<00:01:00.660> some<00:01:00.840> other<00:01:00.960> areas<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.469> house<00:01:01.680> that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
were some other areas of the house that

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.830 
were some other areas of the house that
I've<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.430> been<00:01:02.640> through<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> minimized<00:01:03.570> what

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
I've now been through and minimized what

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
I've now been through and minimized what
we<00:01:03.960> owned<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.500> particular<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.760> went<00:01:06.060> through

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
we owned in particular I went through

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.380 
we owned in particular I went through
our<00:01:06.420> linen<00:01:06.689> cupboard<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:08.119> realized<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.240> had

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
our linen cupboard I realized we had

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
our linen cupboard I realized we had
more<00:01:09.630> sets<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.350> sheets<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.890> pillowcases<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
more sets of sheets and pillowcases and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.800 
more sets of sheets and pillowcases and
things<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.909> than<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.510> needed

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
things like that than we really needed

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
things like that than we really needed
so<00:01:13.439> at<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> moment<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.400> two<00:01:14.790> sets

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
so at the moment we just have two sets

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
so at the moment we just have two sets
of<00:01:15.180> sheets<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.750> our<00:01:15.869> bed<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.040> also

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
of sheets for our bed and then we also

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
of sheets for our bed and then we also
have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:18.119> spare<00:01:18.630> bed<00:01:18.840> which<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.290> different

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
have a spare bed which is a different

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.770 
have a spare bed which is a different
sizes<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.100> double<00:01:20.430> size<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.270> I've<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.420> kept

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
sizes of double size so I've just kept

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.530 
sizes of double size so I've just kept
one<00:01:22.020> sheet<00:01:22.950> set<00:01:23.220> for<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.580> because<00:01:24.060> that's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
one sheet set for that because that's

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.030 
one sheet set for that because that's
only<00:01:24.780> occasionally<00:01:25.439> use<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.920> have

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
only occasionally use when we have

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.600 
only occasionally use when we have
guests<00:01:26.280> staying<00:01:26.549> over<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:28.610> everything

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
guests staying over and then everything

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340 
guests staying over and then everything
else<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:30.390> pretty<00:01:30.600> good<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.840> didn't<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.200> too

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
else was pretty good we didn't have too

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
else was pretty good we didn't have too
many<00:01:31.439> towels<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:33.000> need<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.360> rid

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
many towels so I don't need to get rid

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
many towels so I don't need to get rid
of<00:01:33.570> any<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.840> them<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:34.860> much

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
of any of them but it's just so much

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.740 
of any of them but it's just so much
neater<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.939> an<00:01:36.210> idea<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.600> exactly

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
neater and now I have an idea of exactly

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450 
neater and now I have an idea of exactly
what's<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.350> there<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.130> bit<00:01:38.310> more

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
what's in there and it's all bit more

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
what's in there and it's all bit more
organized<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.210> also<00:01:39.990> went<00:01:40.290> through<00:01:40.590> our

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
organized I also went through our
