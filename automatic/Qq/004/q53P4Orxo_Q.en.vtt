00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 yes 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.280
 hello football time friends we're 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.230
 here at movie time and to make them 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.700
 a very special recommendation a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.550
 recommendation that has to do a lot 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.610
 with the passion that unites us around 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.990
 this site and what we talked about in this 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.300
 page of course I'm talking about 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.119
 football and the pretext is the premiere of the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.609
 john josé campanela's metegol movie 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.279
 the Argentine director responsible for the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.220
 Oscar winner the secret of her 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.100
 eyes' is about a movie that about 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.230
 everything is about entertaining and that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.129
 course not be exempt from wanting to send 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 a message through this plot of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.350
 this story would be worth clarifying 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.969
 so they could not leave with the feint of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.789
 that this is an animated film and that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.190
 is intentionally made only for a 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.429
 public child or youth and nothing else 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.930
 eye above all is a good 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.240
 movie 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.610
 football to tell a story for 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.060
 send a series of messages and that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.890
 uses the animation technique to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.050
 use a series of tools 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.630
 specific that allow campanela 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.520
 tell the story as he would want and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.680
 tell the story especially in the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.229
 sequence of soccer matches 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 a much more attractive way much more 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.540
 close as we would like to approach 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.770
 the intimacy of those moments within the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.500
 football on the field during those 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.259
 within those during that circumstance 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.270
 they are extraordinary moments of certain 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.460
 matches 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.500
 said this understanding that it is about 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.060
 of an animation that allows 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.939
 approaching a much wider audience 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.770
 this child or youth audience is a 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.159
 movie that can attract everyone by 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.140
 the same is about the history of matteo 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.659
 who suddenly gets involved in a 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.469
 confrontation with his rival from the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.479
 childhood and another the chama removed good in 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.759
 the foosball that has now become 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.759
 in his professional footballer and that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.150
 allows through this also to do 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.970
 certain critical reflections and looks at 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.709
 the current situation of football is about 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.739
 of a business this is an issue 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.319
 of fame in the characters that have 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.660
 become stars in this in this 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.970
 sports have lost contact with certain 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.330
 reality with his followers with his 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.030
 roots with passion 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.610
 real and deep that moved them to play 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.200
 this sport out there moves this 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.840
 question of the confrontation between a 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.210
 matte type or much more romantic much 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.090
 more willing to other things to certain 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.700
 sacrifices with an evil and a good 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.230
 collective before the staff and in 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.330
 those lands also move the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.340
 reflections of endeavor these portraits 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.680
 that allow us to see the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.930
 lessons without being moralistic of what 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.600
 it's about worrying about others before 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.880
 that one and soccer serves quite well 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.460
 of pretext taking these characters 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.620
 of all kinds that go from this already 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.730
 become a superstar diva 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.010
 footballer in the people of this 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.750
 professional soccer player the managers 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.240
 as it is a business and for the 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.150
 another side the footballers of this 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.060
 football player brass players 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.790
 of plastic that I know come to life 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.950
 that take life and that allow us to see 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.629
 the different personalities that we have 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.400
 seen that we have as reference in 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.430
 football teams or maybe we have 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.859
 shared in a field in a tournament 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.299
 local at school and others out there very 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.069
 interesting the portrait that is done in 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.439
 these different profiles through 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.319
 some of them like the typical goal scorer 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.629
 that feels outstanding that you know 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.670
 good and even always talks about him in 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.190
 third person as is the veto 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.049
 the crazy this football philosopher who 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.030
 delivery every reflection you have about 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.099
 the football in small kaiku are 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.049
 little thoughts that leave us 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.359
 pondering or the leader willing to 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.430
 make personal sacrifices for good 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.459
 collective out there is where they move 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.500
 the intentions of entertainment and 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.569
 reflection up to a certain level by 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.970
 of juan jose 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.430
 Campanella tell them to open the 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.150
 22 versions in our country those of the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.840
 original Argentine voices and those of the 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.910
 voices of the latin dubbing made in mexico 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.310
 with air 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.470
 and poncho herrera out there for example les 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.600
 could say that in the case of the madman the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.900
 Argentine dubbing allows this 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.480
 character a greater depth a greater 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.890
 rounding in the profile that is made of 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.690
 this kind of philosophical footballer 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.000
 introspective that gives away these little 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.300
 pearls of wisdom while in the 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.970
 Mexican version does not allow to operate 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.530
 very well so much to the drawing that was had 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.540
 set for this type of character 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.490
 but given those little ones of all 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.830
 detail about is primarily a 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.950
 movie that invites us to have fun and that 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.600
 leave these little reflections and these 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.210
 portraits about soccer on the 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.570
 society about the sacrifice without 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.100
 be very forced or moral 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.830
 allowing us to have so much fun 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.360
 a little bigger as the little ones 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.760

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.020

 mexico is classified in the world 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.909
 global and that continues 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.949
