hi<00:00:01.560> today<00:00:02.490> I'm<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.149> show<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.419> what

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hi today I'm going to show you what

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.110 
hi today I'm going to show you what
we're<00:00:04.200> going<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.380> be<00:00:04.529> doing<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:04.980> class<00:00:05.220> with

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
we're going to be doing in class with

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.350 
we're going to be doing in class with
sorting<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:06.810> classifying<00:00:07.550> so<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.880> have<00:00:09.150> some

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
sorting and classifying so I have some

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.799 
sorting and classifying so I have some
shapes<00:00:09.599> around<00:00:09.929> my<00:00:10.139> two<00:00:10.200> circles<00:00:10.769> here<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
shapes around my two circles here and

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.030 
shapes around my two circles here and
we're<00:00:12.809> going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.019> sort<00:00:13.290> them<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.710> three

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
we're going to sort them in three

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.550 
we're going to sort them in three
different<00:00:14.070> ways<00:00:14.630> one<00:00:15.630> way<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.289> sort

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
different ways one way that we can sort

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.220 
different ways one way that we can sort
the<00:00:16.740> shapes<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.310> by<00:00:17.640> color<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.930> what<00:00:19.050> two

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the shapes is by color so what two

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.550 
the shapes is by color so what two
colors<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.100> screen<00:00:21.410> with<00:00:22.410> two

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
colors do you see on the screen with two

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
colors do you see on the screen with two
shape<00:00:22.859> colors<00:00:25.010> we<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.189> blue<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.820> red<00:00:27.390> okay

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
shape colors we see blue and red okay

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.509 
shape colors we see blue and red okay
we're<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.619> sort<00:00:28.859> into<00:00:29.099> these<00:00:29.279> two

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
we're going to sort into these two

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.370 
we're going to sort into these two
circles<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.630> made<00:00:30.810> them<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:31.140> colors

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
circles and I made them different colors

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.659 
circles and I made them different colors
just<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> two<00:00:32.640> different

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
just so we can see the two different

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.869 
just so we can see the two different
colors<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.760> all<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.540> blue<00:00:36.750> ones<00:00:37.610> will<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.730> in

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
colors so all the blue ones will go in

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:50.040 
colors so all the blue ones will go in
one<00:00:39.030> circle

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.450 

and<00:00:51.050> all<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.380> red<00:00:51.560> ones<00:00:51.590> will<00:00:51.980> go<00:00:52.100> in<00:00:52.220> another

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
and all the red ones will go in another

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.050 
and all the red ones will go in another
circle<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:54.440> color<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.190> attribute<00:00:55.850> that

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
circle the color is the attribute that

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.270 
circle the color is the attribute that
we're<00:00:56.510> using<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.450> can<00:00:59.809> see<00:01:00.050> all<00:01:00.830> of<00:01:00.890> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
we're using so you can see all of the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.450 
we're using so you can see all of the
shapes<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.410> yellow<00:01:03.410> circle<00:01:03.950> are<00:01:04.160> blue

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
shapes and the yellow circle are blue

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.270 
shapes and the yellow circle are blue
all<00:01:05.150> of<00:01:05.570> these<00:01:05.780> shapes<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.740> pink<00:01:06.920> circle

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
all of these shapes and the pink circle

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.820 
all of these shapes and the pink circle
are<00:01:07.570> red<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.410> they're<00:01:09.590> sorted<00:01:10.130> by<00:01:10.970> color

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
are red so they're sorted by color

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.380 
are red so they're sorted by color
that's<00:01:12.830> one<00:01:13.100> way<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.280> sort<00:01:13.610> that's<00:01:14.180> one

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
that's one way to sort that's one

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.390 
that's one way to sort that's one
attribute<00:01:15.220> okay

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
attribute okay

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.980 
attribute okay
another<00:01:16.970> way<00:01:17.180> we<00:01:17.390> can<00:01:17.630> sort<00:01:18.619> our<00:01:19.330> shapes<00:01:20.330> is<00:01:20.630> by

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
another way we can sort our shapes is by

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.330 
another way we can sort our shapes is by
size<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:23.780> see<00:01:24.259> some<00:01:24.290> big<00:01:24.649> shapes<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.130> little

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
size so I see some big shapes and little

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.320 
size so I see some big shapes and little
shapes<00:01:26.710> so<00:01:27.710> I'm<00:01:28.070> going<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.340> put<00:01:28.610> these<00:01:28.940> shapes

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
shapes so I'm going to put these shapes

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.240 
shapes so I'm going to put these shapes
in<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:30.590> circle<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:36.170> put<00:01:36.470> these<00:01:36.649> shapes<00:01:36.950> in

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
in this circle and put these shapes in

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.510 
in this circle and put these shapes in
this<00:01:37.460> circle<00:01:38.229> can<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:39.350> tell<00:01:39.590> what<00:01:39.860> attribute

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
this circle can you tell what attribute

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.600 
this circle can you tell what attribute
I'm<00:01:40.670> sorting<00:01:41.300> I<00:01:41.509> already<00:01:42.020> told<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.410> size<00:01:42.680> but

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
I'm sorting I already told you size but

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.570 
I'm sorting I already told you size but
can<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.970> tell<00:01:44.180> me<00:01:44.240> what<00:01:44.899> these<00:01:45.140> shapes<00:01:45.580> have

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
can you tell me what these shapes have

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.050 
can you tell me what these shapes have
in<00:01:46.759> common<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.390> what<00:01:47.890> these<00:01:48.890> shapes<00:01:49.190> have<00:01:49.880> in

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
in common and what these shapes have in

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.559 
in common and what these shapes have in
common<00:01:50.270> right<00:01:53.950> these<00:01:54.950> shapes<00:01:55.280> are<00:01:55.550> all<00:01:55.789> small

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
common right these shapes are all small

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.669 
common right these shapes are all small
and<00:01:57.100> these<00:01:58.100> shapes<00:01:58.369> are<00:01:58.640> all<00:01:59.030> big

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
and these shapes are all big

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.040 
and these shapes are all big
so<00:02:00.679> we've<00:02:00.860> sorted<00:02:01.250> by<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.429> attribute<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:02.179> size

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.930 

the<00:02:06.050> last<00:02:06.289> way<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:06.560> can<00:02:06.920> sort<00:02:07.220> our<00:02:07.340> shapes<00:02:07.670> is

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
the last way we can sort our shapes is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.690 
the last way we can sort our shapes is
by<00:02:08.240> shape<00:02:08.800> so<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:09.830> have<00:02:10.069> two<00:02:10.190> different<00:02:10.340> shapes

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
by shape so I have two different shapes

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.770 
by shape so I have two different shapes
here<00:02:11.230> rectangles<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.440> triangles<00:02:13.240> so<00:02:14.240> I<00:02:14.510> can

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
here rectangles and triangles so I can

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.160 
here rectangles and triangles so I can
put<00:02:14.959> all<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.349> rectangles<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.490> shape<00:02:16.760> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
put all the rectangles in one shape and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.140 
put all the rectangles in one shape and
one<00:02:18.170> circle<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:21.310> all<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.459> triangles<00:02:22.819> in

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
one circle and all the triangles in

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.750 
one circle and all the triangles in
another<00:02:23.420> circle<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.650> attribute<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.310> use<00:02:25.520> to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
another circle so the attribute I use to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.480 
another circle so the attribute I use to
sort<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.540> time<00:02:26.870> was<00:02:27.410> shape

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.470 

so<00:02:34.490> there<00:02:34.640> are<00:02:34.760> three<00:02:34.970> different<00:02:35.150> attributes

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
so there are three different attributes

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.200 
so there are three different attributes
that<00:02:36.260> we're<00:02:36.470> going<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.710> sort<00:02:36.950> over<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.030> next

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
that we're going to sort over the next

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.910 
that we're going to sort over the next
couple<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.600> weeks<00:02:38.660> we're<00:02:39.500> going<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.680> sort<00:02:39.890> by

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
couple of weeks we're going to sort by

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.480 
couple of weeks we're going to sort by
color<00:02:40.220> shape<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.090> size<00:02:41.920> we<00:02:42.920> did<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.250> here

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
color shape and size we did that here

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.910 
color shape and size we did that here
today<00:02:43.790> we're<00:02:44.750> going<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.930> practice<00:02:45.110> with<00:02:45.650> some

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
today we're going to practice with some

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.580
