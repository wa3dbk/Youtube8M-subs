00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.220
 francky we just arrived at the station 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.780
 too much what is your feeling about 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.219
 Racetrack this is the first time that 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.900
 I'm coming here 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:15.160
 no I had the opportunity to come driver 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.090
 and once I had Kito du vivier 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.140
 mauroy is a track like the others 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.150
 a 1000 m is what it is after 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.410
 good cottage simply and the good 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.669
 horse I have the impression that you there this 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.580
 year 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.870
 in your opinion what are the choices beats I 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.630
 thought 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.520
 according to fabrice he told me that 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.910
 ch 1 I think it starts very 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 so fast 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.190
 before this fall can go ahead and 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.660
 then the recourse order it is not 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.860
 tired even despite his 11 years is 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.400
 always there and then I think they're going 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.040
 go there all the heaps the number 6 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.690
 that's it in the race 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.180
 for you it's a good number 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.100
 you're going ahead ah if I can go there 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.670
 I will try but I am for everything 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.260
 only to want to go there I believe 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.809
 after number if I would have preferred a 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.869
 number three to four of the worst but 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.740
 well we will do with 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.600
 now we're here to do half 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.600
 turn you trust in choosing the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.369
 heard coach bah yeah bah yes / 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.570
 not the Libyan show that normally 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.820
 they start well there are not too many 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.860
 problem spelled this must 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.970
 cross your fingers the last time to 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.369
 What did you think about that? 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.659
 cold now my last time 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.920
 let's say that opposite christophe 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.119
 will bring me tidy it made me strong 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.039
 it's a little bit I did without putting 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.929
 a little I did not put quickly but 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.220
 that's what cost me the victory 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.080
 the soil is well it's bankrupt and well 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.710
 nevertheless he still walked 11 and 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.450
 it was 1 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.830
 I think it's a track record 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.479
 so no it's very good cat 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.289
 Libyan good we find ourselves just now 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.830
 after the race 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.830
 I hope 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.750
 what it is 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.240
 if hockey
