00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
nails right now my first impression of

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.920 
nails right now my first impression of
this<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:31.650> pretty<00:02:32.650> good<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.580> went<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.600> pretty

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
this is pretty good it went on pretty

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.160 
this is pretty good it went on pretty
even<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.700> was<00:02:36.820> very<00:02:37.030> thick<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
even and it was very thick the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.800 
even and it was very thick the
application<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:40.060> really<00:02:40.330> only<00:02:40.480> needed

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
application you really only needed

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.140 
application you really only needed
probably<00:02:41.440> one<00:02:41.830> coat<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.640> um<00:02:43.470> but<00:02:44.470> just

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
probably one coat of it um but just

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.260 
probably one coat of it um but just
because<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.530> have<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:47.920> put<00:02:48.610> two<00:02:48.850> coats<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.480> and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
because I have to I put two coats on and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.140 
because I have to I put two coats on and
this<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.390> what<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.570> looks<00:02:52.870> like<00:02:53.670> notice<00:02:54.670> how<00:02:54.850> it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
this is what it looks like notice how it

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.390 
this is what it looks like notice how it
didn't<00:02:55.450> really<00:02:55.660> change<00:02:55.930> after<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:56.770> put<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.160> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
didn't really change after I put on the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.810 
didn't really change after I put on the
top<00:02:57.610> coat<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:59.250> probably<00:03:00.250> could<00:03:00.700> have<00:03:00.730> done

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
top coat I probably could have done

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.750 
top coat I probably could have done
without<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:02.620> know<00:03:02.650> just<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:03.250> seal<00:03:03.520> it

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
without it but you know just to seal it

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.050 
without it but you know just to seal it
I<00:03:03.940> feel<00:03:04.870> safer<00:03:05.410> with<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.770> top<00:03:06.010> coat<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.820> we're

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
I feel safer with the top coat so we're

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.610 
I feel safer with the top coat so we're
gonna<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:09.280> how<00:03:09.520> this<00:03:09.760> loss<00:03:10.200> this<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.380> day<00:03:11.590> one

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
gonna see how this loss this is day one

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.190 
gonna see how this loss this is day one
and<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.730> see<00:03:12.970> if<00:03:13.090> this<00:03:13.150> lives<00:03:13.570> up<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.780> its<00:03:14.110> name

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
and I see if this lives up to its name

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.110 
and I see if this lives up to its name
of<00:03:15.130> lasting<00:03:15.820> for<00:03:16.210> 11<00:03:16.690> days<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.280> one<00:03:18.580> day<00:03:18.610> for

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.699 
there and it still looks pretty good for
the<00:03:31.450> most<00:03:31.480> part<00:03:32.050> but<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:33.390> has<00:03:34.390> chipped<00:03:35.110> in<00:03:35.410> some

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
the most part but it has chipped in some

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.590 
the most part but it has chipped in some
areas<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.490> fading<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:40.180> will<00:03:40.360> see

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
areas and it's fading so we will see

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.020 
areas and it's fading so we will see
where<00:03:40.810> we<00:03:40.959> stand<00:03:40.990> at<00:03:41.680> eleven<00:03:42.100> days<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.550> will<00:03:42.730> try

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
where we stand at eleven days I will try

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.060

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
can the only good thing that it has

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.210 
can the only good thing that it has
going<00:03:48.760> for<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.270> it<00:03:49.600> still<00:03:50.590> is<00:03:50.950> like

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
similar to the left hammer this one is

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.809 
similar to the left hammer this one is
definitely<00:04:43.060> worse<00:04:46.139> in<00:04:47.139> terms<00:04:47.199> of<00:04:47.680> lasting<00:04:48.400> but

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
definitely worse in terms of lasting but

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.179 
definitely worse in terms of lasting but
the<00:04:49.180> shine<00:04:49.389> is<00:04:49.419> still<00:04:49.900> there<00:04:50.199> my<00:04:50.500> verdict<00:04:50.979> is

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
the shine is still there my verdict is

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.700 
the shine is still there my verdict is
that<00:04:51.430> clearly<00:04:52.210> it<00:04:52.449> does<00:04:52.599> not<00:04:52.750> last<00:04:53.080> 11<00:04:53.680> days

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
that clearly it does not last 11 days

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.689 
that clearly it does not last 11 days
like<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:54.550> claims<00:04:54.879> but<00:04:55.270> it<00:04:55.960> is<00:04:56.229> shiny<00:04:57.069> and<00:04:57.340> it

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
like it claims but it is shiny and it

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.269 
like it claims but it is shiny and it
does<00:04:58.000> look<00:04:58.419> like<00:04:58.659> a<00:04:58.870> gel<00:04:59.139> nail<00:04:59.409> polish<00:04:59.680> when

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:00.279 
does look like a gel nail polish when

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.820 
does look like a gel nail polish when
you're<00:05:00.430> applying<00:05:00.699> it<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:01.479> it<00:05:02.259> has<00:05:02.409> that<00:05:02.439> going

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
you're applying it so it has that going

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.749 
you're applying it so it has that going
for<00:05:03.159> it<00:05:03.279> and<00:05:05.129> overall<00:05:06.129> I<00:05:06.460> would<00:05:06.520> definitely

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
for it and overall I would definitely

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.399 
for it and overall I would definitely
buy<00:05:09.759> this<00:05:09.819> again<00:05:10.240> just<00:05:10.750> because<00:05:10.870> it<00:05:11.229> looks

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
buy this again just because it looks

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.519 
buy this again just because it looks
really<00:05:11.650> nice<00:05:11.949> but<00:05:12.879> lasting<00:05:13.509> power<00:05:13.689> is<00:05:14.050> pretty

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:14.529 
really nice but lasting power is pretty

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.159 
really nice but lasting power is pretty
similar<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:15.039> how<00:05:15.550> most<00:05:16.240> nail<00:05:16.449> polishes<00:05:16.930> lost

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
similar to how most nail polishes lost

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.170 
similar to how most nail polishes lost
on<00:05:17.379> my<00:05:17.560> fingers<00:05:17.949> which<00:05:18.189> is<00:05:18.310> about<00:05:18.550> five<00:05:18.849> to<00:05:19.029> six

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
days so this is famous that and that is

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.550 
days so this is famous that and that is
