targets so with this vid i'm gonna do
something<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.540> little<00:00:36.660> bit<00:00:36.780> different<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
something a little bit different and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.530 
something a little bit different and
slow<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> down<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.370> bit<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> step

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
slow it down a little bit and do it step

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.569 
slow it down a little bit and do it step
by<00:00:39.570> step<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.230> everybody<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.250> exactly

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
by step so everybody can see exactly

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
by step so everybody can see exactly
what<00:00:41.820> needs<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.120> be<00:00:42.270> done<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:43.620> also<00:00:43.829> gonna

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
what needs to be done and I'm also gonna

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
show you how to store your mark points
and<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> separate<00:00:46.289> flight<00:00:46.739> plan<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> can

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and a separate flight plan so you can

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.270 
and a separate flight plan so you can
call<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.120> your<00:00:48.239> targets<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.870> any<00:00:48.989> time<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.100> you

call up your targets at any time and you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.240 
call up your targets at any time and you
can<00:00:50.309> store<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.730> many<00:00:50.850> targets<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> need<00:00:51.660> to

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
can store as many targets as you need to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
can store as many targets as you need to
in<00:00:53.250> my<00:00:53.550> training<00:00:53.910> scenario<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.510> I've<00:00:54.719> just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
in my training scenario here I've just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
in my training scenario here I've just
passed<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.070> should<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.640> fence<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.329> point

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
passed what should be my fence in point

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
passed what should be my fence in point
it's<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> Nellis<00:00:58.469> map<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.070> I've<00:00:59.129> got<00:00:59.309> some

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it's on the Nellis map and I've got some

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.209 
it's on the Nellis map and I've got some
targets<00:00:59.730> out<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.420> my<00:01:00.719> third<00:01:00.960> Waypoint<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.160> I'm

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
targets out on my third Waypoint so I'm

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.130

going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> set<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.670> third<00:01:02.940> Waypoint<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> my

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
going to set my third Waypoint to my

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
going to set my third Waypoint to my
current<00:01:04.439> steer<00:01:04.769> point<00:01:05.040> which<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.909> called

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
current steer point which is called

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.200 
current steer point which is called
threat<00:01:06.810> one<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.500> that's<00:01:08.490> gonna<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.850> out<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> my

one o'clock next thing I want to do is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.090 
one o'clock next thing I want to do is
take<00:01:12.180> my<00:01:12.390> targeting<00:01:12.869> pod<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.619> standby

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
take my targeting pod out of standby

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.850 
take my targeting pod out of standby
mode<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.610> air-to-ground<00:01:15.000> mode<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.689> set<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> as

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
mode to air-to-ground mode and set it as

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:26.170 
mode to air-to-ground mode and set it as
SOI<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.790> I'm<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.270> now

next since I've got s ly I'm gonna put

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.760 
next since I've got s ly I'm gonna put
China<00:01:29.490> hat<00:01:29.700> forward<00:01:30.180> long<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.750> slow<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.320> pod<00:01:31.560> on

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
China hat forward long to slow my pod on

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.030 
China hat forward long to slow my pod on
to<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.040> current<00:01:32.340> steer<00:01:32.520> point<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.890> see

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
to my current steer point you can see

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.620 
to my current steer point you can see
there<00:01:35.190> I've<00:01:35.280> got<00:01:35.310> some<00:01:35.640> vehicles<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.150> sight<00:01:36.420> of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
there I've got some vehicles in sight of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.190 
there I've got some vehicles in sight of
the<00:01:37.320> pod<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> next<00:01:39.180> step<00:01:39.510> is<00:01:39.780> going<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.110> be

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the pod so the next step is going to be

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560 
the pod so the next step is going to be
designate<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> mark<00:01:41.370> point<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.880> top<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.420> each<00:01:42.540> of

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
designate a mark point on top of each of

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.780 
designate a mark point on top of each of
those<00:01:42.780> vehicles<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.530> whatever<00:01:44.010> I<00:01:44.280> want<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> use

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
those vehicles or whatever I want to use

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
those vehicles or whatever I want to use
as<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:44.970> target<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.660> case<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.050> gonna<00:01:46.140> be

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
as a target in this case it's gonna be

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.600 
as a target in this case it's gonna be
all<00:01:46.410> three<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:46.920> cause<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.369> want<00:01:47.550> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
all three of them cause I want to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.000 
all three of them cause I want to
destroy<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.210> them<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.830> what<00:01:49.920> I'm

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
destroy all of them and that's what I'm

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.280 
destroy all of them and that's what I'm
gonna<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.690> I'm<00:01:51.690> gonna<00:01:51.840> slew<00:01:52.140> all<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
gonna do now so I'm gonna slew all the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.290 
gonna do now so I'm gonna slew all the
way<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> right<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.729> my<00:01:53.910> rightmost

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
way to the right and get my rightmost

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.999 
way to the right and get my rightmost
vehicle<00:01:54.780> set<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.530> point<00:01:56.070> mode<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:58.009> now

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
vehicle set up in point mode there now

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.430 
vehicle set up in point mode there now
once<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.700> point<00:02:00.090> designated<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.259> want

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
once I have a point designated you want

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.670 
once I have a point designated you want
to<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.590> TMS<00:02:02.250> right<00:02:02.850> short<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:04.110> designate<00:02:04.530> your

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
to do TMS right short to designate your

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.440 
to do TMS right short to designate your
first<00:02:04.890> mark<00:02:05.130> point<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.759> i've<00:02:05.820> got<00:02:06.000> mark<00:02:06.240> point

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
first mark point so i've got mark point

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.919 
first mark point so i've got mark point
a<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:08.070> we're<00:02:08.640> gonna<00:02:08.729> make<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.239> middle<00:02:09.750> one

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
a and we're gonna make the middle one

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:20.830 
a and we're gonna make the middle one
mark<00:02:10.229> point<00:02:10.530> b

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.900 

and<00:02:21.140> finally<00:02:21.920> we're<00:02:22.069> gonna<00:02:22.160> make<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.550> one<00:02:22.760> on

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
and finally we're gonna make the one on

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.680 
and finally we're gonna make the one on
the<00:02:23.000> Left<00:02:23.300> mark<00:02:23.900> point<00:02:24.200> see<00:02:25.420> now<00:02:26.420> as<00:02:26.599> you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the Left mark point see now as you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.690 
the Left mark point see now as you
practice<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.380> you'll<00:02:27.709> find<00:02:28.069> that<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.489> can

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
practice this you'll find that you can

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.729 
practice this you'll find that you can
do<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.090> very<00:02:29.480> very<00:02:29.630> quickly<00:02:30.050> with<00:02:30.590> the

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
do this very very quickly with the

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.530 
do this very very quickly with the
targeting<00:02:31.130> pod<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.580> did<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.090> deliberately

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
targeting pod I did it deliberately

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.650 
targeting pod I did it deliberately
slowly<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:33.739> see<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:35.180> can<00:02:35.209> get

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
slowly so you can see it but you can get

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.190 
slowly so you can see it but you can get
quite<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> few<00:02:36.530> vehicles<00:02:36.709> marked<00:02:37.370> up<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:38.300> almost

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
quite a few vehicles marked up in almost

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.229 
quite a few vehicles marked up in almost
no<00:02:39.319> time<00:02:39.440> at<00:02:39.800> all<00:02:39.920> if<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.400> practice<00:02:40.910> I'm<00:02:41.120> going

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
no time at all if you practice I'm going

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.650 
no time at all if you practice I'm going
to<00:02:41.300> turn<00:02:41.450> my<00:02:41.660> pod<00:02:41.989> into<00:02:42.500> standby<00:02:42.890> mode<00:02:42.980> now<00:02:43.340> and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
to turn my pod into standby mode now and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.780 
to turn my pod into standby mode now and
I'm<00:02:44.660> going<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.870> turn<00:02:45.110> my<00:02:45.290> aircraft<00:02:45.800> on<00:02:46.700> a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
I'm going to turn my aircraft on a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.790 
I'm going to turn my aircraft on a
reverse<00:02:47.239> course<00:02:47.630> away<00:02:48.140> from<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.410> target<00:02:48.769> zone

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
reverse course away from the target zone

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.979 
reverse course away from the target zone
so<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.220> can<00:02:49.370> get<00:02:49.550> some<00:02:49.760> altitude<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.540> program

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
so I can get some altitude and program

00:02:50.989 --> 00:03:07.010 
so I can get some altitude and program
my<00:02:51.140> mark<00:02:51.380> points<00:02:51.739> in

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.170 

okay<00:03:07.830> now<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.070> store<00:03:08.400> these<00:03:08.550> in<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.910> flight

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
okay now to store these in the flight

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.430 
okay now to store these in the flight
plan<00:03:09.360> we're<00:03:09.630> gonna<00:03:09.690> hit<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.960> flight<00:03:10.200> plan

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
plan we're gonna hit the flight plan

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.890 
plan we're gonna hit the flight plan
button<00:03:10.830> on<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.280> CDU<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:12.300> see<00:03:12.510> we<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.870> our

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
default flight plan set up and what I

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.480 
default flight plan set up and what I
want<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.840> do<00:03:15.960> is<00:03:16.140> make<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.350> new<00:03:16.680> flight<00:03:16.980> plan<00:03:17.010> I'm

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
want to do is make a new flight plan I'm

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.880 
want to do is make a new flight plan I'm
gonna<00:03:17.730> call<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:17.940> target<00:03:18.540> one<00:03:18.720> or<00:03:18.750> TGT<00:03:19.650> one

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
gonna call that target one or TGT one

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.690 
gonna call that target one or TGT one
type<00:03:20.580> that<00:03:20.610> in<00:03:20.910> now<00:03:21.090> if<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.440> LSK<00:03:22.950> on<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.310> left

type that in now if the LSK on the left

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.140 
type that in now if the LSK on the left
for<00:03:24.120> two<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.860> new<00:03:25.980> flight<00:03:26.250> plan<00:03:26.280> then

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
for two and it's a new flight plan then

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.210 
for two and it's a new flight plan then
you<00:03:27.270> want<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.480> hit<00:03:27.600> FP<00:03:28.020> build<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.940> do<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:30.320> 1<00:03:31.460> B<00:03:32.460> 2

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
you want to hit FP build and do a 1 B 2

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.510 
you want to hit FP build and do a 1 B 2
C<00:03:35.220> 3<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:36.360> that's<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.560> flight<00:03:37.770> plan<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.310> go

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
C 3 and that's the flight plan if I go

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.850 
C 3 and that's the flight plan if I go
up<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.700> might<00:03:39.000> add<00:03:40.130> after<00:03:41.130> selecting<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:42.860> you

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
up to might add after selecting it you

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.830 
up to might add after selecting it you
can<00:03:43.980> see<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.370> map<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.600> can<00:03:45.720> make

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
can see it on the map and you can make

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.870 
can see it on the map and you can make
as<00:03:45.930> many<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.260> these<00:03:46.350> as<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.650> want<00:03:47.040> with<00:03:47.670> as

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
as many of these as you want with as

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.460 
as many of these as you want with as
many<00:03:48.030> mark<00:03:48.390> points<00:03:48.780> as<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.020> want<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.260> program

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
many mark points as you want to program

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.400 
many mark points as you want to program
in<00:03:49.770> there<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.130> that's<00:03:50.580> really<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.320> once<00:03:52.320> you

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
in there and that's really it once you

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.380 
in there and that's really it once you
do<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.620> once<00:03:52.770> you'll<00:03:53.370> remember<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.180> it's

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
do it once you'll remember it and it's

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.050 
do it once you'll remember it and it's
pretty<00:03:54.600> easy<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.500> that's<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.610> flight<00:03:56.820> plan

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
pretty easy so that's the flight plan

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
pretty easy so that's the flight plan
step<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:59.490> next<00:03:59.520> thing<00:03:59.940> we<00:04:00.030> want<00:04:00.240> to<00:04:00.300> do<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.750> arm

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
step the next thing we want to do is arm

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.580 
step the next thing we want to do is arm
the<00:04:01.290> plane<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.950> go<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.090> Dismas<00:04:03.510> select<00:04:04.140> 3

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
the plane and go to the Dismas select 3

we<00:04:07.710> made<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.550> probably<00:04:08.910> want<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.150> do<00:04:09.300> this

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
we made you probably want to do this

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.180 
we made you probably want to do this
during<00:04:09.840> your<00:04:09.960> fencing<00:04:10.470> procedure<00:04:10.890> but<00:04:11.100> I'm

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
during your fencing procedure but I'm

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.229 
during your fencing procedure but I'm
going<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.370> do<00:04:11.490> it<00:04:11.610> now

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.270 

alright<00:04:19.199> I'm<00:04:19.289> going<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.470> speed<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.739> up<00:04:19.919> here<00:04:20.160> so

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
alright I'm going to speed it up here so

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.379 
alright I'm going to speed it up here so
we<00:04:20.370> can<00:04:20.489> get<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.759> target<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> little<00:04:21.209> bit

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
we can get to the target a little bit

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:35.960 
we can get to the target a little bit
faster

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.760 

one<00:04:36.600> thing<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:36.870> you<00:04:37.260> want<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.500> keep<00:04:37.590> in<00:04:37.740> mind

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
one thing that you want to keep in mind

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.770 
one thing that you want to keep in mind
here<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.310> altitude<00:04:38.580> I'm<00:04:39.390> gonna<00:04:39.540> go<00:04:39.720> to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
here is the altitude I'm gonna go to

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.070 
here is the altitude I'm gonna go to
about<00:04:40.160> 14,000<00:04:41.160> here<00:04:41.310> just<00:04:41.610> under<00:04:41.850> that<00:04:41.970> if<00:04:42.960> you

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
about 14,000 here just under that if you

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.930 
about 14,000 here just under that if you
look<00:04:43.230> at<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.440> launch<00:04:43.770> window<00:04:44.040> is<00:04:44.400> sort<00:04:44.760> of<00:04:44.850> a

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
look at the launch window is sort of a

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.480 
look at the launch window is sort of a
cone<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.480> opens<00:04:45.840> up<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.350> spreads<00:04:46.830> wider<00:04:47.190> as

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
cone that opens up and spreads wider as

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.120 
cone that opens up and spreads wider as
you<00:04:47.550> get<00:04:47.850> higher<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:49.110> can<00:04:49.260> picture<00:04:49.530> that<00:04:49.650> you

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
you get higher you can picture that you

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.860 
you get higher you can picture that you
know<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.370> higher<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.640> you<00:04:50.700> go<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.510> more

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
know the higher that you go the more

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.120 
know the higher that you go the more
that<00:04:52.050> you'll<00:04:52.170> be<00:04:52.290> able<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.560> launch<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.070> the

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
that you'll be able to launch and the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.650 
that you'll be able to launch and the
longer<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.490> windows<00:04:53.760> going<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:53.970> be<00:04:54.090> open<00:04:54.510> as

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
longer the windows going to be open as

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.230 
longer the windows going to be open as
you<00:04:55.320> go<00:04:55.440> over<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.710> target<00:04:56.100> but<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.730> downside

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
you go over the target but the downside

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.670 
you go over the target but the downside
to<00:04:57.360> that<00:04:57.390> is<00:04:57.540> that<00:04:57.690> depending<00:04:58.380> on<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.500> threat

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
to that is that depending on the threat

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.590 
to that is that depending on the threat
picture<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.340> could<00:04:59.580> expose<00:05:00.150> yourself<00:05:00.540> to

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
picture you could expose yourself to

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.500 
picture you could expose yourself to
radar-guided<00:05:01.170> Sam's<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.160> other<00:05:03.000> nasty<00:05:03.480> stuff

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
radar-guided Sam's and other nasty stuff

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.060 
radar-guided Sam's and other nasty stuff
so<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.080> definitely<00:05:04.500> want<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.680> take<00:05:04.830> that<00:05:04.950> into

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
so you definitely want to take that into

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.320 
so you definitely want to take that into
account<00:05:05.160> when<00:05:05.580> you're<00:05:05.670> planning<00:05:06.000> this<00:05:06.120> out

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
account when you're planning this out

account when you're planning this out
and<00:05:06.630> depending<00:05:06.900> on<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.230> mission<00:05:07.560> you<00:05:07.920> know

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
and depending on the mission you know

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:16.330 
and depending on the mission you know
follow<00:05:08.910> that<00:05:09.090> accordingly
