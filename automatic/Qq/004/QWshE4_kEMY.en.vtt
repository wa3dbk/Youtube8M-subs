00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.760 
Kingston so I think you know which which
way<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.189> that<00:01:52.670> match<00:01:52.909> is<00:01:52.939> going<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.299> go

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
way is that that match is going to go

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.710 
way is that that match is going to go
other<00:01:54.770> matches<00:01:55.310> on<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.549> card<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.000> far<00:01:56.299> this<00:01:56.539> is

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
other matches on the card so far this is

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.749 
other matches on the card so far this is
this<00:01:56.959> is<00:01:57.080> quite<00:01:57.289> early<00:01:57.470> but<00:01:57.860> still<00:01:58.159> looking<00:01:58.610> at

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
this is quite early but still looking at

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.029 
this is quite early but still looking at
it<00:01:58.909> you've<00:01:59.569> got<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.840> one-hour<00:02:00.350> iron<00:02:00.740> match

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
it you've got a one-hour iron match

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.190 
it you've got a one-hour iron match
between<00:02:01.399> Randy<00:02:01.940> Orton<00:02:02.209> and<00:02:02.299> John<00:02:02.360> Cena<00:02:02.810> now<00:02:03.170> I

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
between Randy Orton and John Cena now I

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.960 
between Randy Orton and John Cena now I
don't<00:02:03.380> know<00:02:03.619> if<00:02:03.679> it's<00:02:03.860> just<00:02:04.100> me<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.700> can't

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
don't know if it's just me but I can't

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.059 
don't know if it's just me but I can't
stand<00:02:05.330> them<00:02:05.509> for<00:02:05.750> 10<00:02:05.959> minutes<00:02:06.200> let<00:02:06.560> alone<00:02:06.590> and

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
stand them for 10 minutes let alone and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.699 
stand them for 10 minutes let alone and
how<00:02:07.220> long<00:02:07.459> John<00:02:08.269> Cena<00:02:08.539> has<00:02:08.750> like<00:02:09.019> four<00:02:09.380> moves

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
how long John Cena has like four moves

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.920 
how long John Cena has like four moves
and<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.670> don't<00:02:10.910> think<00:02:11.120> Randy<00:02:11.269> Orton's<00:02:11.690> going<00:02:11.840> to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
and I don't think Randy Orton's going to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.570 
and I don't think Randy Orton's going to
be<00:02:12.019> able<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.290> carry<00:02:12.530> him<00:02:12.709> for<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.010> long<00:02:13.069> you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
be able to carry him for that long you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.300 
be able to carry him for that long you
know<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.910> mean<00:02:14.690> they've<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.680> had<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.890> couple<00:02:16.130> of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
know I mean they've just had a couple of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.699 
know I mean they've just had a couple of
pay-per-views<00:02:16.940> where<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:18.140> whole<00:02:18.350> idea

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
pay-per-views where the the whole idea

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.590 
pay-per-views where the the whole idea
has<00:02:19.100> been<00:02:19.130> like<00:02:19.459> hard<00:02:19.700> core<00:02:20.000> tight<00:02:20.299> matches

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
has been like hard core tight matches

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.170 
has been like hard core tight matches
and<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:22.100> only<00:02:22.220> way<00:02:22.549> they're<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.060> be

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
and the only way they're going to be

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.580 
and the only way they're going to be
able<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.480> go<00:02:23.599> for<00:02:23.780> an<00:02:23.870> hour<00:02:23.989> as<00:02:24.200> if<00:02:24.319> they<00:02:24.470> go

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
able to go for an hour as if they go

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.350 
able to go for an hour as if they go
really<00:02:24.799> hardcore<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.849> doesn't<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.330> doesn't

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
really hardcore so it doesn't it doesn't

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
make any more videos unless we really

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.380

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
sick and tired of it so we thought it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.770 
sick and tired of it so we thought it
would<00:03:24.040> be<00:03:24.160> pretty<00:03:24.430> professional<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.660> know
