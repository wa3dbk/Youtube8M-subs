Spanish<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.630> geometry<00:02:05.439> so<00:02:05.829> this<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.280> how

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
Spanish to and geometry so this is how

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.029 
Spanish to and geometry so this is how
it<00:02:06.729> looks<00:02:06.759> on<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.179> inside<00:02:07.509> it's<00:02:08.110> black<00:02:08.440> again

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
it looks on the inside it's black again

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.619 
it looks on the inside it's black again
has<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> flap<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.620> again<00:02:11.620> each<00:02:11.980> life<00:02:12.849> tab<00:02:13.239> has

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
has a flap and again each life tab has

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.250 
has a flap and again each life tab has
some<00:02:14.620> paper<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:16.269> like<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.840> said<00:02:16.989> these

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
three so that each of like my bosses had

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.030 
three so that each of like my bosses had
like<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:45.849> little<00:02:46.000> fuller<00:02:46.989> space<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.859> you<00:02:47.920> can

like a little fuller space that you can
put<00:02:48.220> in<00:02:48.250> any<00:02:48.700> handouts<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.620> maybe<00:02:50.620> aren't

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
put in any handouts that maybe aren't

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.059 
put in any handouts that maybe aren't
full<00:02:51.160> punched<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:52.750> lastly<00:02:53.200> i<00:02:53.319> have<00:02:53.769> my

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
full punched and then lastly i have my

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.720 
full punched and then lastly i have my
notebook<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.299> this<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.079> a<00:02:56.109> big<00:02:56.290> five<00:02:57.129> subject

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
notebook and this is a big five subject

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.220 
notebook and this is a big five subject
180<00:02:58.569> sheets<00:02:58.989> college<00:02:59.440> ruled<00:02:59.730> notebook<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.230> I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
180 sheets college ruled notebook and I

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.520 
180 sheets college ruled notebook and I
thought<00:03:02.819> between<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:03.849> binder<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.750> folders<00:03:05.290> and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
thought between a binder and folders and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.140 
thought between a binder and folders and
stuff<00:03:05.769> you<00:03:06.220> really<00:03:06.579> don't<00:03:06.819> need<00:03:07.090> this

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
stuff you really don't need this

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.210 
stuff you really don't need this
notebook<00:03:07.569> but<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.319> thought<00:03:08.620> maybe<00:03:08.829> a<00:03:08.980> few

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
notebook but I thought maybe a few

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.120 
notebook but I thought maybe a few
classes<00:03:09.760> would<00:03:09.849> like<00:03:10.030> require<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.130> maybe

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
classes would like require it and maybe

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.650 
classes would like require it and maybe
like<00:03:12.400> once<00:03:12.669> in<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.849> while<00:03:13.000> might<00:03:13.329> run<00:03:13.510> out<00:03:13.540> of

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
like once in a while might run out of

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.479 
like once in a while might run out of
paper<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.290> got<00:03:14.440> two<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.769> these<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.010> got<00:03:15.280> in

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
paper so I got two of these I got in

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.789 
paper so I got two of these I got in
blue<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.060> then<00:03:16.209> one<00:03:16.840> in<00:03:16.989> black<00:03:17.169> which<00:03:17.530> I'm

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
blue and then one in black which I'm

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:18.809 
blue and then one in black which I'm
actually<00:03:17.980> not<00:03:18.250> going<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.519> carry<00:03:18.700> around

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
actually not going to carry around

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.509 
actually not going to carry around
because<00:03:19.389> I<00:03:19.450> think<00:03:19.660> one<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:19.989> enough<00:03:20.139> but<00:03:20.709> what<00:03:21.489> I

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
because I think one is enough but what I

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.819 
because I think one is enough but what I
like<00:03:21.849> run<00:03:22.060> out<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.569> paper<00:03:22.930> then<00:03:23.349> I'll

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
like run out of this paper then I'll

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.370 
like run out of this paper then I'll
curate<00:03:24.250> out<00:03:24.370> around<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:25.389> that<00:03:25.419> is<00:03:25.930> what<00:03:26.049> i<00:03:26.079> have

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
curate out around so that is what i have

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.280 
curate out around so that is what i have
in<00:03:26.620> my<00:03:26.769> first<00:03:27.099> compartment<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.959> now<00:03:29.079> in<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
in my first compartment and now in the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.789 
in my first compartment and now in the
second<00:03:29.769> little<00:03:29.919> zipper<00:03:30.370> area<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:32.410> i'm<00:03:32.590> being

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
second little zipper area so i'm being

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.680 
second little zipper area so i'm being
geometry<00:03:33.400> setting<00:03:33.790> off<00:03:33.940> i<00:03:34.090> knew<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.450> or<00:03:34.660> not

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
geometry setting off i knew this or not

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.020 
geometry setting off i knew this or not
but<00:03:34.840> i<00:03:35.139> have<00:03:35.500> like<00:03:35.829> little<00:03:36.130> compass<00:03:36.700> and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
but i have like little compass and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.229 
but i have like little compass and
