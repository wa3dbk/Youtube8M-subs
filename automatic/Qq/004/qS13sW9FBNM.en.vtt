zones<00:01:27.870> difference<00:01:28.350> right<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.560> definitely

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
zones difference right there definitely

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.010 
zones difference right there definitely
whenever<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.970> people<00:01:30.300> all<00:01:30.660> around<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
world come to be so big it's not just

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
world come to be so big it's not just
like<00:01:32.880> an<00:01:32.970> american<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.540> european<00:01:33.860> thing<00:01:34.860> its

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
game so the time zones can get a little

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.130 
game so the time zones can get a little
crazy<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.000> i<00:01:39.030> said<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> google

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
crazy but like i said just go to google

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.230 
crazy but like i said just go to google
and<00:01:40.230> do<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> time<00:01:41.190> zone<00:01:41.430> converter<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.880> find<00:01:42.090> out

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and do a time zone converter to find out
