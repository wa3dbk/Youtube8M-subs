 he had been admitted the day before to stop this movement 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.020
 in meeting ii but she had a voice 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.429
 she will need him 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.429
 m 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.509
 and in sick leave can resume 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.999
 finally 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.470
 1:10 p.m. 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.470
 to this is added the reform 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 rafael nadal did not need to answer 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.190
 in parliament since I had it 10 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.420
 Friday 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.900
 it exists and it is probably still 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 and call centers will be offered 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.350
 there according to energy 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.189
 downstream 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.710
 but she had six children living in the Palestinian territories 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.050
 in good father 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.120
 worse she has to bow to this plenary took back a slope 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.470
 at tel-aviv 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.240
 This is useless 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.750
 we see now 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.180
 the arm wrestling but at the same time I had to lean days 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.030
 she is invisible 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.159
 will you admit it speaks with me did she talk the day before to the Belgian parliament 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.250
 crippling 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.100
 good kid 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.970
 it feels good 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.880
 what a pity for us 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.939
 emmanuel itches 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.399
 so I'm 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.329
 to the radius of regret at nasdaq 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.790
 the arrival of the baby a millavois to equalize at the end of the match 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.129
 in the serious illegal swerve 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.889
 last thirty years 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.419
 no 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.959
 talk to young people as a gimme 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.739
 for my part I do not want it 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.790
 his album is very present as those who do not interfere in war 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.899
 eight other age groups of children make holiday purchases 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.439
 a new life 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.439
 it's unfortunate to get there but a real pandemic 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:03.119
 end of November for the event me I will have their approval in question 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.149

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.409
 his opponent 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.079
 so we 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.989
 on the contrary 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.989
 then in england 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.469
 why do we see 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.089
 because during the open 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:37.449
 roads 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.449
 my country
