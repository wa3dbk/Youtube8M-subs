health
our<00:01:52.630> first<00:01:52.900> step<00:01:53.230> of<00:01:53.410> a<00:01:53.500> healthy<00:01:53.860> eating<00:01:54.100> plan

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
our first step of a healthy eating plan

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.550 
our first step of a healthy eating plan
is<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.150> be<00:01:55.270> completely<00:01:55.780> aware<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.260> what<00:01:56.440> you're

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
is to be completely aware of what you're

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.800 
is to be completely aware of what you're
actually<00:01:56.800> putting<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.460> your<00:01:57.580> mouth<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
actually putting in your mouth that

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.540 
actually putting in your mouth that
means<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.320> need<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.560> be<00:01:59.710> conscious<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.400> what

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
means you need to be conscious of what

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.590 
means you need to be conscious of what
you're<00:02:00.730> eating<00:02:00.760> as<00:02:01.180> opposed<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:01.570> just

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
you're eating as opposed to just

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.890 
you're eating as opposed to just
stuffing<00:02:02.110> your<00:02:02.260> face<00:02:02.560> mindlessly<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:04.300> also

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
stuffing your face mindlessly it also

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.260 
stuffing your face mindlessly it also
means<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.560> need<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.860> know<00:02:06.070> what's<00:02:07.060> in
