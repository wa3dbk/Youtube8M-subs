00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.750
 yes 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.640
 I hope that the cast that I have chosen 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.380
 be the most suitable to develop 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.580
 this project 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.580
 and if they do not agree keep a grudge 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.580
 users 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240
 yes 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.800
 Y 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.850
 yes 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.050
 all right 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.480
 hi what's up here in manuel olivares 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.730
 bothering new account now for 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.350
 upload chapter number 1 of vampire 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.720
 night and must say well bone burnett 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.879
 well first the truth if well 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.050
 remember you actually decided 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.000
 the cast or the majority with their votes 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.830
 so I almost have no candle in that 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.830
 second burial 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.729
 I want to ask for an apology for the 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.250
 exaggerated tardiness down in the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.590
 description I leave the chapter link 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.899
 I do not know if you're going to like them 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.619
 to be honest I liked it a lot 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:28.310
 clear result there are details there are things 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.770
 that we should correct if they liked them 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.450
 I suggest you leave comments not only on 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.869
 this video but in the channels of the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.420
 participants and also because some 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.280
 like if you did not like them well we 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.540
 I invite you to leave your criticisms and also 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.500
 why not her I do not like 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.380
 regardless of whether we continue or 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.850
 not this dubbing funk I want to thank 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.299
 all the actors and actresses that 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.630
 participated stefan dubbing was done 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.100
 by people identified by a language 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.229
 I can not say of a region in 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.140
 specific because there are participants 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.899
 from the United States to Argentina and 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.250
 then we cross the puddle if we cross in 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.890
 the classic since it also existed 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.870
 participation of the mother father 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.800
 it's just a language ID 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.860
 I personally do not have the pleasure of 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.080
 know them to the majority more than to a 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.540
 that another exception like a diego that is 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.510
 a company that came to record with me or 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.450
 bani who knew her recently from all 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.330
 ways I thank all of them if 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.490
 continues that good if not best me 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.490
 would like to still participate with you 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.540
 and good now following good ando 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.239
 limited time as several of 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.190
 you but something sure I have for 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.650
 develop is an original project of 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.140
 vampires called do not fear to darkness or 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.540
 not first of giving next of a treatment 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.000
 of Venezuelan writer called english 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.799
 del carmen who kindly invited us to 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.730
 several of the people that we participate 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.730
 in this project 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.960
 well to participate in yours so no 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.210
 be surprised if you hear well-known voices 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.120
 for now I'm going to get two audio 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.790
 chapters I think they are a good because 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.160
 they are a lot of chapters but 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.000
 for now I'm going to take only 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.820
 two 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.150
 I do not think too much and take longer 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.150
 later he decided and he and 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.850
 later decide if we continue 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.910
 with the pampas project of the night and 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.370
 at the same time to take up a personal project of 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.239
 a fan dubbing the rooney ups 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.540
 that if not zamora and x I already took one 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.209
 but the truth is pretty 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.489
 so I want to do it again 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.420
 since considering that they participated 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.180
 great voices is pretty badly done 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.709
 then I want to make a new edition 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.810
 why do I say good personal project 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.780
 because I really like that series 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.180
 and for those who do not know the one of bom power 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.549
 night so they do not know manpower 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.690
 night I took it only because I was losing 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.210
 a bet 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.860
 I will approach there is the first episode 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.860
 we will see if others are done 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.840
 well it seems to me that that's all those 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.440
 They kindly invite me in their 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.530
 Projects 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.000
 I 'm going to aja, I 'm going to prepare all my list 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.710
 of debts that is enough and do this 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.020
 it helped me to understand a little 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.990
 big fund or see as the young lady 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.020
 directors jaime to the director 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.680
 like good phoenix to the good director 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.420
 phoenix as well as many others who are 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.550
 people doing funk jobs 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.460
 dubbing pretty good 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.490
 pretty well done and the truth is that 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.550
 it's a joke to make us decently good 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.100
 I already left the subject finally if you invite me 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.500
 I gladly accept and I will try 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.890
 deliver as soon as possible in the 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:08.210
 date agreed but I do not assure you anything 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:10.490
 for school issues so now 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.730
 yes it seems to me that that is all take care 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.530
 that they are well and they leave their 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.270
 comments not only on my channel 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.610
 as I did not say but in those of the 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.350
 participants since then the 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.440
 comments are the food of the fans 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.010
 to see from 1 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.690
 and we win so we see each other take care of each other and 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.690
 once again excuse the delay
