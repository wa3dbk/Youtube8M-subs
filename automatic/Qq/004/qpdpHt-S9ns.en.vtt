game is you play this character called
the<00:00:59.460> knack<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.600> seems<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> pick<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.590> various

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the knack that seems to pick up various

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.009 
the knack that seems to pick up various
materials<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.030> grow<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> very<00:01:03.809> large

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
materials and can grow to very large

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.590 
materials and can grow to very large
heights<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> widths<00:01:05.339> during<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> course<00:01:06.510> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
heights and widths during the course of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.850 
heights and widths during the course of
a<00:01:06.689> given<00:01:06.930> level<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.439> kind<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.740> get

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
a given level and then kind of get

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.700 
a given level and then kind of get
broken<00:01:08.130> down<00:01:08.310> again<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:08.970> he<00:01:09.090> takes<00:01:09.240> damage

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
broken down again as he takes damage

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.140 
broken down again as he takes damage
it's<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.010> really<00:01:11.400> interesting<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
it's it's really interesting from a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.520 
it's it's really interesting from a
technical<00:01:12.570> level<00:01:12.720> because<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> does

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
technical level because what it does

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.940 
technical level because what it does
require<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> game<00:01:15.360> space<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:16.500> scale

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
require is that the game space can scale

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.700 
require is that the game space can scale
and<00:01:17.369> move<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.600> change<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> rather

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and move with the change in the rather

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.420 
and move with the change in the rather
dramatic<00:01:20.369> change<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.360> character

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.400 

when<00:01:24.970> you<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.390> kind<00:01:25.600> of<00:01:25.630> watch<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.170> footage

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
when you just kind of watch the footage

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.980 
when you just kind of watch the footage
it<00:01:26.680> seems<00:01:26.980> somewhat<00:01:27.490> nominal<00:01:28.000> but<00:01:28.480> in<00:01:28.660> playing

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
it seems somewhat nominal but in playing

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.420 
it seems somewhat nominal but in playing
it<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.290> realize<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.770> characters<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.310> look

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
it you realize the characters that look

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.370 
it you realize the characters that look
quite<00:01:30.610> sizable<00:01:31.180> at<00:01:31.300> one<00:01:31.540> point<00:01:31.780> actually

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
quite sizable at one point actually

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.130 
quite sizable at one point actually
seemed<00:01:32.740> quite<00:01:33.010> diminutive<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.390> that<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:35.020> is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
seemed quite diminutive and that that is

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.870 
seemed quite diminutive and that that is
not<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.590> easiest<00:01:35.620> of<00:01:36.220> technical<00:01:36.610> feats<00:01:36.790> to

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
not the easiest of technical feats to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.420 
not the easiest of technical feats to
pull<00:01:37.120> off<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:38.050> part<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:38.770> think<00:01:39.010> strikes

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
pull off the part that I think strikes

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.100 
pull off the part that I think strikes
me<00:01:39.640> most<00:01:39.670> interesting<00:01:40.390> about<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.720> game<00:01:40.930> is

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
me most interesting about the game is

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.350 
me most interesting about the game is
while<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.160> quite<00:01:42.490> good-looking<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:43.150> can

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
while it is quite good-looking you can

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.400 
while it is quite good-looking you can
definitely<00:01:43.479> see<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.720> benefits<00:01:44.290> of<00:01:44.320> the

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
definitely see the benefits of the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.590 
definitely see the benefits of the

processing power with the ps4 it's not
kind<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.440> just<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.710> superficial<00:01:48.040> sales<00:01:48.820> pitch

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
kind of just a superficial sales pitch

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.300 
kind of just a superficial sales pitch
for<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.780> strength<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.350> what<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.800> system<00:01:51.130> can

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
for the strength of what the system can

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.460 
for the strength of what the system can
do<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:52.000> actually<00:01:52.060> very<00:01:52.420> similar<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.080> god<00:01:53.320> of

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
out when playing it the game is quite

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.930 
out when playing it the game is quite
challenging<00:02:43.780> on<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:45.130> normal<00:02:45.400> setting<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.790> was

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
challenging on the normal setting I was

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.820 
challenging on the normal setting I was
dying<00:02:46.150> quite<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.480> bit<00:02:46.720> at<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.870> beginning<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.530> had

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
dying quite a bit at the beginning I had

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.400 
dying quite a bit at the beginning I had
to<00:02:48.010> become<00:02:48.130> more<00:02:48.549> sensitive<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.870> actions

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
to become more sensitive to the actions

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.740 
to become more sensitive to the actions
of<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.890> enemy<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.459> don't<00:02:52.030> let<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.390> simple

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750
