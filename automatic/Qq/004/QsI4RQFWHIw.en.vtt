once my dad did the other times and um

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.790 
once my dad did the other times and um
like<00:00:54.140> some<00:00:54.410> cutters<00:00:54.980> which<00:00:55.250> can<00:00:55.489> cut<00:00:55.700> plastic

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
like some cutters which can cut plastic

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.490 
like some cutters which can cut plastic
um<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.329> first<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.600> just<00:00:59.840> get<00:01:00.110> this<00:01:00.230> on<00:01:00.350> the

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
um so first you just get this on the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.060 
um so first you just get this on the
right<00:01:00.680> side<00:01:00.950> and<00:01:02.200> trim<00:01:03.200> quite<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.680> bit<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:03.950> it

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
right side and trim quite a bit of it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.050 
right side and trim quite a bit of it
off<00:01:04.219> I<00:01:05.979> am<00:01:06.979> going<00:01:07.009> to<00:01:07.369> pause<00:01:07.609> through<00:01:07.939> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
off I am going to pause through the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.230 
off I am going to pause through the
video<00:01:08.299> when<00:01:08.509> I'm<00:01:08.630> doing<00:01:08.929> some<00:01:09.079> boring<00:01:09.380> stuff

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
video when I'm doing some boring stuff

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.109 
video when I'm doing some boring stuff
um<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.509> I<00:01:12.469> haven't<00:01:12.740> seen<00:01:13.009> anyone<00:01:13.369> else<00:01:13.609> make

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
um I I haven't seen anyone else make

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.249 
um I I haven't seen anyone else make
this<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.560> think<00:01:16.189> I'm<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.549> first<00:01:16.850> person<00:01:17.259> to

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
this so I think I'm the first person to

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.629 
this so I think I'm the first person to
make<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:18.439> but<00:01:18.770> that<00:01:18.920> doesn't<00:01:19.159> really<00:01:19.280> matter

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
make it but that doesn't really matter

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:23.050 
make it but that doesn't really matter
um<00:01:20.600> if<00:01:21.259> you<00:01:21.439> have<00:01:21.770> done<00:01:22.189> this<00:01:22.340> video<00:01:22.670> like

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
um if you have done this video like

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.559 
um if you have done this video like
something<00:01:23.959> like<00:01:24.079> this<00:01:24.229> before<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.939> have<00:01:25.939> never
