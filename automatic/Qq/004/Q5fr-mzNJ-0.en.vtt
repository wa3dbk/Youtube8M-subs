because this game has scaffolding levels

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.070 
because this game has scaffolding levels

option of remaining on a specific level

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.590 
option of remaining on a specific level
the<00:01:27.619> entire<00:01:27.950> time<00:01:28.310> they're<00:01:28.520> playing<00:01:28.820> or<00:01:29.119> they

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
can challenge themselves and move on to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.999 
can challenge themselves and move on to
a<00:01:31.880> higher<00:01:32.150> level<00:01:32.590> let's<00:01:33.590> look<00:01:33.770> at<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
a higher level let's look at the

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.640 
a higher level let's look at the
different<00:01:34.400> levels<00:01:34.759> that<00:01:34.820> we<00:01:35.060> have<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.500> the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
different levels that we have so the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.920 
different levels that we have so the
first<00:01:39.890> level<00:01:40.159> is<00:01:40.579> matching<00:01:41.119> pictures<00:01:41.659> a

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
first level is matching pictures a

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.280 
first level is matching pictures a
memory<00:01:42.409> game<00:01:42.439> matching<00:01:43.040> picture<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:44.659> match

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
memory game matching picture to match

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.240 
memory game matching picture to match
sound<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:46.280> sound<00:01:46.840> okay<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.020> second<00:01:48.500> game<00:01:48.740> gets

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
sound to sound okay the second game gets

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.069 
sound to sound okay the second game gets
a<00:01:49.369> little<00:01:49.640> bit<00:01:49.759> harder<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.390> it's<00:01:50.810> matching

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
a little bit harder and it's matching

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.020 
a little bit harder and it's matching
the<00:01:51.350> different<00:01:51.860> sounds<00:01:52.340> that<00:01:52.490> we<00:01:52.579> hear<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.909> the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the different sounds that we hear of the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.630 
the different sounds that we hear of the
instruments<00:01:53.659> as<00:01:53.780> well<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:54.140> three<00:01:54.890> match

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
instruments as well a three match

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.109 
instruments as well a three match
picture<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.630> sound<00:01:56.899> okay<00:01:57.829> level<00:01:58.399> three<00:01:58.820> is<00:01:58.939> the

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
picture to sound okay level three is the

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.120 
picture to sound okay level three is the
hardest<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.719> it<00:01:59.780> matches<00:01:59.990> picture<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.829> sound

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
hardest and it matches picture to sound

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.940 
hardest and it matches picture to sound
it<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:02.030> convenient<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.020> game<00:02:03.259> starts

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
it is convenient that the game starts

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.530 
it is convenient that the game starts
with<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.369> first<00:02:04.610> level<00:02:05.090> which<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.509> the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
with the first level which is the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.169 
with the first level which is the
easiest<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.619> let's<00:02:06.860> do<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.130> practice<00:02:07.670> run<00:02:07.909> and

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
easiest so let's do a practice run and

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.500 
easiest so let's do a practice run and
play<00:02:08.360> picture<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.110> picture<00:02:09.970> one<00:02:10.970> match

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
play picture to picture one match

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.630 
play picture to picture one match
picture<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.500> picture

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.929 

that's<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.819> match<00:02:20.140> bagpipes<00:02:21.549> okay<00:02:22.549> we<00:02:22.760> got

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
that's a match bagpipes okay we got

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.550 
that's a match bagpipes okay we got
lucky<00:02:23.150> on<00:02:23.299> that<00:02:23.599> first<00:02:23.840> one<00:02:24.079> and<00:02:24.110> we<00:02:24.319> already

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
lucky on that first one and we already

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.800 
lucky on that first one and we already
got<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.860> match<00:02:25.159> and<00:02:25.489> as<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.939> heard<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.390> receive

this is our form of not only feedback

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.350 
this is our form of not only feedback
but<00:04:37.290> measure<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.920> progress<00:04:38.280> this<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.180> only

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
but measure of progress this is the only

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.440 
but measure of progress this is the only
measurement<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.170> progress<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:41.100> we<00:04:41.250> see<00:04:41.580> it's

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
measurement of progress that we see it's

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.900 
measurement of progress that we see it's
hard<00:04:42.750> sometimes<00:04:43.290> for<00:04:43.710> teachers<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.550> look<00:04:44.760> at

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
hard sometimes for teachers to look at

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.490 
hard sometimes for teachers to look at
this<00:04:45.090> because<00:04:45.510> students<00:04:46.050> can<00:04:46.200> immediately

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
this because students can immediately

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.530 
this because students can immediately
click<00:04:47.070> on<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.670> new<00:04:47.850> game<00:04:48.060> will<00:04:48.270> start

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
click on it and a new game will start

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.330 
click on it and a new game will start
and<00:04:48.810> their<00:04:48.960> record<00:04:49.320> will<00:04:49.500> disappear

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
and their record will disappear

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.020 
and their record will disappear
it<00:04:50.670> is<00:04:51.180> not<00:04:51.420> very<00:04:51.900> necessary<00:04:52.470> for<00:04:53.430> students<00:04:53.910> in

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
it is not very necessary for students in

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.790 
it is not very necessary for students in
kindergarten<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.810> have<00:04:54.990> a<00:04:55.020> record<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.650> how

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
kindergarten to have a record of how

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.160 
kindergarten to have a record of how
many<00:04:55.830> tries<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.520> took<00:04:56.760> but<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.360> is<00:04:57.600> great<00:04:57.930> if

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
many tries it took but it is great if

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.200 
many tries it took but it is great if
they<00:04:58.380> write<00:04:58.620> down<00:04:58.950> or<00:04:59.310> think<00:04:59.610> about<00:04:59.760> and

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
they write down or think about and

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.540 
they write down or think about and
measure<00:05:00.450> over<00:05:00.870> time<00:05:00.900> how<00:05:01.500> many<00:05:01.560> tries<00:05:02.040> it<00:05:02.340> took

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
measure over time how many tries it took

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.400 
measure over time how many tries it took
them<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:03.000> complete<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.570> memory<00:05:03.900> matching

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
them to complete the memory matching

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.470 
them to complete the memory matching
game<00:05:04.620> so<00:05:05.130> there<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.520> possibility<00:05:06.450> to

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
game so there is a possibility to

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.840 
game so there is a possibility to
measure<00:05:06.930> progress<00:05:07.320> if<00:05:07.860> teacher<00:05:08.250> or<00:05:08.580> student

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
measure progress if teacher or student

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.659 
measure progress if teacher or student
is<00:05:09.210> interested<00:05:09.950> another<00:05:10.950> great<00:05:11.250> thing<00:05:11.490> about
