00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130

going<00:00:20.310> along<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.939> was<00:00:21.359> thinking<00:00:21.689> okay<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
going along I was thinking okay this is

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.349 
going along I was thinking okay this is
a<00:00:22.619> different<00:00:23.010> approach<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.550> games<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.180> only

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
a different approach to games we only

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.929 
a different approach to games we only
need<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> draw<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:26.160> were<00:00:26.279> doing<00:00:26.430> our<00:00:26.670> job

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
need to draw and we were doing our job

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
need to draw and we were doing our job
but<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.240> higway<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.720> props<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
but in higway in props up with a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.250 
but in higway in props up with a
world-class<00:00:29.310> finish<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.929> sort<00:00:31.230> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
world-class finish and a sort of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.930 
world-class finish and a sort of
consolation<00:00:31.949> goal<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.309> them<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> end<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
consolation goal for them at the end I

consolation goal for them at the end I
don't<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.450> look<00:00:33.630> too<00:00:33.780> much<00:00:33.899> into

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
don't think you can look too much into

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.979 
don't think you can look too much into
the<00:00:34.860> second<00:00:35.309> goal<00:00:35.489> however<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> defeat

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the second goal however it is a defeat

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.770 
the second goal however it is a defeat
for<00:00:37.200> Arsenal<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.059> although<00:00:39.059> we've<00:00:39.570> gone

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
for Arsenal and although we've gone

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.540 
for Arsenal and although we've gone
through<00:00:39.840> we've<00:00:40.649> gone<00:00:40.860> through<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.160> runners-up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
through we've gone through as runners-up

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.209 
through we've gone through as runners-up
that<00:00:41.940> means<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.690> could<00:00:42.960> face<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
that means that we could face one of the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.610 
that means that we could face one of the
other<00:00:44.550> major<00:00:45.090> teams<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.719> could<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:45.989> Barcelona

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620

tonight I think there'll be a different
mentality<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.100> closing<00:01:38.430> them<00:01:38.790> down

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
