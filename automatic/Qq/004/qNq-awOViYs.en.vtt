know<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.630> key<00:01:42.840> time

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
know this these are this is a key time

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.920 
know this these are this is a key time
the<00:01:43.409> models<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.009> how<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.850> deal<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the models like how do you deal with the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.710 
the models like how do you deal with the
the<00:01:46.170> stress<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.070> demands<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.149> something

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the stress and the demands of something

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.810 
the stress and the demands of something
like<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:48.899> at<00:01:49.170> such<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> young<00:01:49.439> age<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.700> it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
like this at such a young age I think it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.490 
like this at such a young age I think it
almost<00:01:51.060> helps<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.750> young<00:01:51.990> because<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
almost helps to be young because you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.109 
almost helps to be young because you
don't<00:01:52.649> realize<00:01:53.070> how<00:01:53.100> much<00:01:53.490> pressure<00:01:53.729> or

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
don't realize how much pressure or

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.670 
don't realize how much pressure or
stress<00:01:54.240> you're<00:01:54.630> under<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.470> just

party scene or drinking and so if a
model<00:02:49.000> can<00:02:49.330> keep<00:02:49.630> her<00:02:49.780> head<00:02:49.960> screwed<00:02:50.110> on

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
model can keep her head screwed on

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.010 
model can keep her head screwed on
straight<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.550> probably<00:02:52.540> one<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.840> the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
straight that is probably one of the

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.020 
straight that is probably one of the
main<00:02:53.230> factors<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:54.040> her<00:02:54.160> future<00:02:54.430> success

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
main factors and her future success

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.300 
main factors and her future success
because<00:02:55.590> nobody<00:02:56.590> really<00:02:56.650> becomes<00:02:57.190> a

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
because nobody really becomes a

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.580 
because nobody really becomes a
supermodel<00:02:57.910> until<00:02:58.210> they're<00:02:58.390> about<00:02:58.480> 22<00:02:59.140> or<00:02:59.260> 23

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
supermodel until they're about 22 or 23

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.170 
supermodel until they're about 22 or 23
it's<00:03:00.070> rare<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.580> they'll<00:03:01.000> become

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
it's rare that they'll become

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.630 
it's rare that they'll become
supermodels<00:03:01.810> as<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> teenager<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:03.310> really

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
supermodels as a teenager you really

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.250 
supermodels as a teenager you really
have<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.910> pay<00:03:04.090> your<00:03:04.270> dues<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.690> put<00:03:04.870> your<00:03:04.990> time

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
have to pay your dues and put your time

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.080 
have to pay your dues and put your time
in<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.340> industry<00:03:06.820> so<00:03:07.150> if<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.660> can<00:03:09.090> stay

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
in to the industry so if you can stay

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.940 
in to the industry so if you can stay
strong<00:03:10.510> for<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.930> certain<00:03:11.290> amount<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.560> time<00:03:11.770> you

strong for a certain amount of time you

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.340 
strong for a certain amount of time you
have<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.100> much<00:03:12.340> better<00:03:12.580> chance<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:13.230> making<00:03:14.230> it

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350
