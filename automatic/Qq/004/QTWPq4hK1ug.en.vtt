00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.390
 m 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.330
 hello and welcome to the designs of 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.490
 week I have five designs today 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.530
 for you perhaps that is for the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.840
 one or the other something useful with 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.460
 yes yes I start with the first 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.980
 Designer I think you see what it is 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.090
 should not be a bus or something like that 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.890
 and acids trailer for truck and be 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.279
 He then looks like that from the outside 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.620
 little spectacular now in the end 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.480
 originally one should be one 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.600
 trailer of his pad for the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.920
 Wood here, yes, but then we are like that 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.270
 a little bit in and out of the box 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.530
 the end effect is now so halfway 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.450
 become a caravan 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.000
 yes, we'll just take a look 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.829
 remember that looks like the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.469
 Now it is also called the lighting 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.270
 kept relatively simple a bit 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.969
 Furnish couple of pictures to get you now 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.649
 not feeling so bad in here 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.660
 yes and a bit of water here 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.309
 nothing special in the end is so 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.259
 But a small caravan is now 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.910
 I believe a very good beginning to 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.619
 planned yes even in the caravan too 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.659
 sometimes, sometimes 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.790
 on this basis and then just times 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.200
 look like that looks second then 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.950
 his is a tied up wood that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.420
 So here are four pieces in total 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.280
 and originally they should be on the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.740
 vices on it but you see you have 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.659
 so smashed a bit 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.890
 that is tied together now at this 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.259
 So imagine this is now the the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.689
 highlight in this case I have 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.740
 now seen on reddit by the reddot 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:43.490
 users to you wants and he has that 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.860
 said so tied up with with 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.610
 seemed to be what he did differently 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.140
 has is he still did that 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.360
 I think it is with ladders here 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.430
 really attractive around it once 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.869
 to formulate that way 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.670
 looks so in the end is completely 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.619
 nice if you have such a trailer completely 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.469
 simple so now like the classic 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.350
 wood truck so the wood loads and there can 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.479
 you put it on the point that they are the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.260
 very cool 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.180
 design numero three is an i have 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.030
 he thought something went wrong because of the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.450
 his eur 3 is a mail so one 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.579
 watermelon crushed machine is 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.290
 from the reddot user racing 450 pages too 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.860
 his 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.510
 fun aside he has a squeeze 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.319
 machine is built and that is the whole 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.549
 easy seen in this way are ski pistes 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.140
 with such a iron grid may turn and 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.959
 if I will now pressed the button 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.549
 that squeezed and I get here 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:53.489
 my finished so finished my 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.530
 sliced ​​melon is quite cool yes the 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.239
 his pros really right 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.329
 unspectacular but still very nice 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.450
 if you have an oven now 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.959
 and then want a fireplace room then 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.209
 that is a very good idea that with the 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.970
 So that with the stone with the stone wall 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.470
 could do so over there 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.040
 if that were all that would be a stone 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.880
 Fireplace is quite cool that's why I think so 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.780
 we then took that with us 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.780
 his call 5 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.829
 He built such a window 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.389
 I know that there are several more 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.829
 People give the one almost 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:43.829
 have built identical windows 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.720
 looks like some finds relatively cool 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.639
 have also done for a while 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.669
 needed to build that around that 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.230
 recreate 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.299
 yes, what is the highlight here then 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.430
 you have to do that first six 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.470
 blocks or so high then pull this 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.150
 is the seventh row from down there and 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.879
 then you just have to go here now 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.419
 two steps to put it there 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.769
 there is a stair step and then 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.690
 Come here again though so it 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.239
 really is up here almost out 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.129
 complete stairs then here 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.900
 a staircase stage there's one then 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.489
 he pulls that up two blocks again 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.400
 and here comes another staircase 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.289
 back there and here in half step and then 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.880
 is the whole finished and then looks like that 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:28.560
 from really cool gothic window 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.900
 yes those were the designs of the week me 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.390
 hope for you there was something very good 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.190
 useful to thank me for it 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.260
 Wish you a good one 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.260
 week until further video
