00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello today's video is a super video 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.120
 order that I made some time ago but 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.790
 now it 's like the updated version 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.300
 because I do not know why they ask me all this 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.519
 video but I wanted to do it and it's the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.850
 video that I carry in my bag is a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.590
 tag and I'm going to show you my 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.029
 bag to show them what is there 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.029
 inside and this is my bag I 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.039
 I'm really pretty practical and I'm looking for a 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 bag that does not have to be changing 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.910
 every day because every time 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.210
 I change bag things like that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 they lose a lot of things or leave things and left 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.390
 the card and they take so I try that 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.430
 it is a neutral color in this case black 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.140
 obviously so that I combine with everything 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.460
 or almost everything 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.460
 this is a cross bag because for me 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.350
 It's very comfortable to wear it like that 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.800
 I can have as always at hand and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.580
 be watching it when I walk so I 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.670
 I really like this bag and it has several 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.180
 spaces and I'm going to show you the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.880
 space in front where I have more than 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.190
 nothing papers that I will not show you and 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.970
 I have my cell phone that is the Nokia Lumia 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:25.990
 5200 this is the 431 on Sunday 9 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.450
 February and as you know in my background 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.259
 had to be demi lovato because there's no 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.869
 in another way and good here I have the 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.050
 programs and good if you want a video of 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.179
 I can do my cell phone but I do not know if 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.110
 it will be very useful so that what I have 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:48.039
 in the front pocket now I open it 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.410
 to the middle pocket and I have everything 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.060
 it's a disaster because I try 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.619
 It is always a disaster 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.440
 but you wanted it but so if 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.680
 I will show equal 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.830
 to begin with I have this oil 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.950
 macadamia today because it is in the last 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.110
 I was bringing it to hydrate 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.290
 my hair during the day because I eat 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.660
 can see and I have not mentioned painting 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.000
 in my hair about three years ago 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.940
 weeks because I was clarifying it to 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.270
 little and I said already this does not give for more 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.920
 I need a change and I had it in a 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.280
 hairdresser because if they do not leave me a 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.130
 disaster in the hair so now it's 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.500
 well so it has been drying up a 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.060
 little as there was discoloration and all the same 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.770
 it's hard for them to have their hair again 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.850
 as before so this has helped me 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.920
 I also have my wallet 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.390
 it's like that I bought it in all fashion or some 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.250
 of that kind of stores I do not remember 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.880
 exactly the same but I found it very 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.420
 pretty has those details there and it's from 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.500
 this guy that 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.880
 open like this then here I have my 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.489
 cards of which to know that they 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.959
 I can show I have a gift card 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.100
 of leaders the card the network buys my 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.489
 card photo that we can not 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.760
 show because it's horrible and here they are 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.489
 the coins and in the back space 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.420
 I keep what are the tickets that now 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.340
 there's nothing better that I'm poor like that 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.080
 how good this is my wallet is 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.450
 quite big but how the bag is 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.440
 I have no problem because it is super 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:37.480
 practice if I have a mirror that is this 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:40.540
 of home ideas and I like it because it has the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.500
 Perfect size to beat me in the day 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.989
 I have some soda crackers that I do not know if 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.329
 I told them but I mentioned it on facebook 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.359
 I was very sick to my stomach many 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.890
 weeks without eating or eating nothing and 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.439
 now I get a little bit of the diet and 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.200
 I'm more or less new but things that 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.989
 happen I'm much better than before and I've 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.290
 been eating these cookies that are 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.049
 I live them with water and the ones I saw were 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.230
 those that less sodium had then by 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:16.280
 that I chose they are quite rich too 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:18.769
 I have pills for the stomach 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.590
 and it's always bringing a fragrance and 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.200
 what I have at this moment is this 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.720
 is the imagination of agatha ruiz de la prada 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.840
 which is like one of my perfumes 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.700
 favorites because it sounds nice to everyone 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.300
 I have my work credential 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.530
 to see what to prove 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.930
 to see the photo that is the photo of 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.000
 my belief does not go so bad but 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.430
 not also but this 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.350
 I'm bringing my cell phone charger 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.780
 what is inevitable because as I live 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.200
 connected I always download the 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.590
 cellular i 'm reading my mp3 which is this 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.930
 which is phillips and the hearing aids are 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.169
 and because the phillips died so 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.840
 I had to buy another 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.060
 I'm also bringing my droplets to 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.249
 my eyes for when it turns red 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.900
 because I occupy contact lenses that 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:15.790
 today I did not go because I'm not going to 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:19.870
 out of the same occupied the opticians 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.810
 giving with the excess of natural that 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.840
 It is the whole day that is like the one that I have 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.600
 said that lately he's been occupying 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.330
 I walk with a school just in case 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.900
 although most of the time I walk with the 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:38.340
 loose hair I almost never take it and that 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.340
 more coins 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:47.599
 coins paper tickets ethics and in me 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.569
 as they told me that they are usually 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:52.759
 bringing as what I am occupying but 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:55.189
 I'm going to show you so much with this 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.559
 click because when I take my hair 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:59.550
 I like how to do he sold me then 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:02.280
 with this I can do it 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.630
 I walk with another while for the same 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.250
 effect 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:12.410
 I walk with the baby this is the tone that 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:16.949
 before I think then I see it is the tone 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:21.430
 tone tone 05 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:24.790
 and it's transparent that I have more when 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.210
 I do not know why with the king blog law for 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.680
 see in tone 090 sweet tarts 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.539
 s this tone 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.300
 it seems that the other day he occupies it and 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.400
 He saw so much with the corrector that 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.289
 always occupied the one of natura because to 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.320
 dark circles are very large and there are 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:46.009
 than writing them, still covering 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.380
 this soft pounds of those but of a 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:53.080
 collection 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:55.270
 so much in these little boats I have here a 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.000
 shows that they gave me in which a 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:01.750
 lemon scented product and it is that it is 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.600
 for the cuticles so that they are more 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.700
 soft and I still have because the 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.670
 it really gave me a lot, I do not remember the 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:12.550
 product name but it is very good 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.920
 giving with tweezers because you never know 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.010
 so they may be necessary too 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.650
 I walk with estelí planner in tone 07 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:24.310
 I took ping that is one of those 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:29.440
 it's a little bit of memory because I give it 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:33.249
 and with him that system that he believes is 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:37.239

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:39.909
 0 1 velvet rose and finally I walk with my 

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:43.899
 hand cream in installation in size 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:47.289
 small that is this that is the handy 

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:51.009
 gurugú of which I already showed it I believe in 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:53.349
