00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
like pulled up and busty I'm trying to

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.550 
like pulled up and busty I'm trying to
think<00:04:17.699> if<00:04:18.150> they<00:04:18.659> vibrate<00:04:19.139> if<00:04:19.259> they<00:04:19.380> have

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
think if they vibrate if they have

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.560 
think if they vibrate if they have
operations<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.400> know<00:04:20.549> they<00:04:20.759> make<00:04:20.940> sounds<00:04:21.180> and

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
operations I know they make sounds and

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.089 
operations I know they make sounds and
like<00:04:21.780> they<00:04:22.019> can<00:04:22.199> detect<00:04:22.320> when<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:22.919> hit

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
like they can detect when you hit

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.800 
like they can detect when you hit
