00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.090

 Booths around uh-uh not you not separately need would have passed through various j 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.690
 Besides, Akutsu does not like noisy things. 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.370
 I'm not really very close, but I don't hate it 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.050
 He is amazing, but Akutsu is kind to a child like that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.050

 Even if I want to stand out, I can understand that feeling without eyes

 Even though I 'm upset, the ace in the cheering area is standing out 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:07:00.229
 In addition, as soon as I find a cute girl, it's fluffy.
