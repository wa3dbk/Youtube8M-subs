science<00:00:04.500> today<00:00:05.160> we're<00:00:05.490> going<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.700> be<00:00:05.790> using<00:00:06.180> a

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
science today we're going to be using a

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.509 
science today we're going to be using a
Brunel<00:00:06.569> lens<00:00:06.839> like<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.770> large<00:00:08.010> ones<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.400> we

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
Brunel lens like the large ones that we

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.640 
Brunel lens like the large ones that we
have<00:00:08.700> over<00:00:08.940> here<00:00:09.120> but<00:00:09.300> not<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.750> big<00:00:10.170> we're

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
have over here but not that big we're

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.440 
have over here but not that big we're
going<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.830> be<00:00:10.920> making<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.309> knife<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.880> started

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
going to be making a knife that started

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.930 
going to be making a knife that started
with<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.840> original<00:00:13.500> right<00:00:13.679> here<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.219> this

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
with this original right here and this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.810 
with this original right here and this
is<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.839> he<00:00:15.960> actually<00:00:16.350> molded<00:00:16.890> this

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
is the one that he actually molded this

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.260 
is the one that he actually molded this
is<00:00:18.060> larger<00:00:18.630> scale<00:00:19.020> metal<00:00:19.500> foundry<00:00:20.090> using<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
is larger scale metal foundry using a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.250 
is larger scale metal foundry using a
lower<00:00:21.689> temperature<00:00:22.189> metal<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.369> zinc<00:00:24.260> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
lower temperature metal like zinc the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.259 
lower temperature metal like zinc the
lens<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.830> we're<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.400> using<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.970> one

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
lens that we're going to be using is one

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.380 
lens that we're going to be using is one
that<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.869> made<00:00:28.220> using<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.369> process<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.240> we'll

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that we made using a process that we'll

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.089 
that we made using a process that we'll
be<00:00:30.510> showing<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.140> future<00:00:31.410> videos<00:00:31.859> the

be showing you in future videos the
difference<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.850> lens<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:34.110> takes

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
difference to this lens is that it takes

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.370 
difference to this lens is that it takes
the<00:00:34.920> optical<00:00:35.700> part<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.450> converts<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the optical part of it and converts it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.590 
the optical part of it and converts it
into<00:00:37.530> more<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.129> similar<00:00:38.489> application<00:00:38.670> cool

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
into more of a similar application cool

into more of a similar application cool
thing<00:00:39.870> about<00:00:40.020> zinc<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.829> has<00:00:40.950> got<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> low

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
thing about zinc is that has got a low

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.420 
thing about zinc is that has got a low
melting<00:00:41.730> point<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.200> does<00:00:43.530> not<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.280> be

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
melting point and it does not have to be

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
melting point and it does not have to be
extremely<00:00:45.210> hard<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.870> lot<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.110> cutting

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
extremely hard for a lot of cutting

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.990 
extremely hard for a lot of cutting

applications if you're prying something
you<00:00:48.090> probably<00:00:48.329> want<00:00:48.570> steel<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.590> we're<00:00:49.739> going

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you probably want steel but we're going

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.740 
you probably want steel but we're going
to<00:00:49.920> be<00:00:50.039> casting<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> larger<00:00:51.059> amount<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> metal

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
to be casting a larger amount of metal

total collection area of the larger lens
behind<00:01:00.989> us<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.829> reason<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.250> this

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
behind us here the reason that this

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.579 
behind us here the reason that this
smaller<00:01:02.820> lens<00:01:03.180> works<00:01:03.480> versus<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> larger

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
smaller lens works versus the larger

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
smaller lens works versus the larger
lenses<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.400> behind<00:01:05.549> us<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> do

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
lenses like we have behind us has to do

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.760 
lenses like we have behind us has to do
with<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> optics<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
with the optics of it this is like a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.580 
with the optics of it this is like a
crystal<00:01:08.310> clear<00:01:08.430> spot<00:01:09.000> lens<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.659> you've<00:01:10.290> made

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
crystal clear spot lens and you've made

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.250 
crystal clear spot lens and you've made
that<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.729> made<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.330> completely<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that we I made that completely this is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.160 
that we I made that completely this is
from<00:01:13.650> scratch<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.360> some<00:01:15.600> foam<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.020> has

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
from scratch so it has some foam it has

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.420 
from scratch so it has some foam it has
some<00:01:16.380> imperfections<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.250> those

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
some imperfections but those

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
some imperfections but those
imperfections<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.509> matter<00:01:18.750> when

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
imperfections don't really matter when

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320 
imperfections don't really matter when
you're<00:01:19.140> melting<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.710> casting<00:01:20.189> metal<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.640> does

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you're melting or casting metal it does

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.030 
you're melting or casting metal it does
whatever<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.810> Sun<00:01:22.140> decides<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.860> with

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
whatever the Sun decides to do with

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
whatever the Sun decides to do with
concentrated<00:01:23.700> sunlight<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.630> we're<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
concentrated sunlight so we're going to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
concentrated sunlight so we're going to
be<00:01:25.110> showing<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.560> how<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.710> make<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.250> large<00:01:26.820> knife

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
be showing you how to make a large knife

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.840 
be showing you how to make a large knife
like<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.710> in<00:01:28.710> previous<00:01:28.890> videos<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.670> showed

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
like this in previous videos we showed

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.310 
like this in previous videos we showed
you<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.090> make<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.329> small<00:01:30.630> key<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you how to make a small key but that's a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.200 
you how to make a small key but that's a
small<00:01:31.380> amount<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.009> my<00:01:32.130> solid<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.939> weighs

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
small amount of my solid this weighs

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.609 
small amount of my solid this weighs
approximately<00:01:33.799> 20<00:01:34.799> ounces<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.350> heavy

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
approximately 20 ounces it is it's heavy

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.340 
approximately 20 ounces it is it's heavy
so<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> make<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.909> plaster<00:01:39.540> mold<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.020> knife

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
so to make a plaster mold of this knife

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920 
so to make a plaster mold of this knife
we<00:01:40.770> need<00:01:40.950> dimensions<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.729> are<00:01:41.790> 16<00:01:42.600> inches

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
we need dimensions that are 16 inches

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
to expect a cracking where that weakest

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.620 
to expect a cracking where that weakest
point<00:04:04.790> was<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.210> the<00:04:05.300> center<00:04:05.950> well<00:04:07.240> this<00:04:08.240> is<00:04:08.420> it

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
point was in the center well this is it

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.990 
point was in the center well this is it
this<00:04:08.960> is<00:04:09.170> what<00:04:09.320> we're<00:04:09.530> using<00:04:09.830> for<00:04:10.040> our<00:04:10.370> mold

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
this is what we're using for our mold

this is what we're using for our mold
there's<00:04:11.750> some<00:04:12.050> cracks<00:04:12.350> but<00:04:12.740> it's<00:04:12.980> it<00:04:13.250> is

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
there's some cracks but it's it is

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.860 
there's some cracks but it's it is
completely<00:04:14.410> functionable<00:04:16.480> this<00:04:17.480> vanilla

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
completely functionable this vanilla

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
waiting for it to melt into like a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:05:06.690 
waiting for it to melt into like a
liquid
