sides of your pool as long as all your
chemicals<00:00:26.770> are<00:00:26.950> maintained<00:00:27.310> properly<00:00:27.520> you

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
chemicals are maintained properly you

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.090 
chemicals are maintained properly you
want<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.689> start<00:00:28.960> with<00:00:29.140> your<00:00:29.290> top<00:00:29.830> of<00:00:29.980> your

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
want to start with your top of your

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.330 
want to start with your top of your
stairs<00:00:30.370> going<00:00:31.270> from<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.570> top<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:32.020> bottom

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
stairs going from the top to the bottom

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.310 
stairs going from the top to the bottom
brushing<00:00:33.340> that<00:00:33.460> all<00:00:33.640> off<00:00:33.940> and<00:00:34.180> then<00:00:34.270> right<00:00:35.140> up

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
brushing that all off and then right up

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.229 
brushing that all off and then right up
against<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.950> inside<00:00:36.430> corner<00:00:36.790> of<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.910> bottom

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
against the inside corner of the bottom

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.299 
against the inside corner of the bottom
step<00:00:37.540> you're<00:00:37.809> gonna<00:00:37.930> want<00:00:38.200> to<00:00:38.230> sweep<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.860> dust

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
step you're gonna want to sweep the dust

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.030 
step you're gonna want to sweep the dust
and<00:00:39.640> debris<00:00:39.699> away<00:00:40.150> from<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:40.720> edges<00:00:40.949> like<00:00:41.949> I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
and debris away from the edges like I

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.799 
and debris away from the edges like I
said<00:00:42.280> that<00:00:42.550> netting<00:00:43.059> everything<00:00:43.420> out<00:00:43.540> first

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
said that netting everything out first

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.810 
said that netting everything out first
so<00:00:44.050> make<00:00:44.320> this<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.559> lot<00:00:44.739> easier<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:45.400> all<00:00:45.610> that's

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
so make this a lot easier so all that's

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.910 
so make this a lot easier so all that's
left<00:00:46.000> is<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.720> dirty<00:00:46.989> stuff<00:00:47.320> that's<00:00:47.559> settled

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
left is the dirty stuff that's settled

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.310 
left is the dirty stuff that's settled
to<00:00:48.040> the<00:00:48.070> bottom<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:49.750> you're<00:00:49.870> gonna<00:00:49.960> want<00:00:50.260> to

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
to the bottom then you're gonna want to

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.740 
to the bottom then you're gonna want to
push<00:00:50.620> as<00:00:50.920> much<00:00:51.159> of<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.489> debris<00:00:51.850> as<00:00:52.150> far<00:00:52.420> as<00:00:52.600> you

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
push as much of the debris as far as you

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.930 
push as much of the debris as far as you
can<00:00:53.019> as<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:53.680> can<00:00:54.040> reach<00:00:54.250> with<00:00:54.280> your<00:00:54.699> pole

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
can as you can reach with your pole

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.090 
can as you can reach with your pole
towards<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.540> main<00:00:55.750> drains<00:00:56.050> and<00:00:56.320> then<00:00:56.979> you'll

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
towards the main drains and then you'll

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.399 
towards the main drains and then you'll
be<00:00:57.250> able<00:00:57.339> to<00:00:57.519> use<00:00:57.699> your<00:00:57.970> main<00:00:58.180> drains<00:00:58.510> like<00:00:59.350> a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
be able to use your main drains like a

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.189 
be able to use your main drains like a
central<00:00:59.949> vacuum<00:01:00.400> unit<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:01.570> can<00:01:01.720> push<00:01:01.960> all

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
central vacuum unit so you can push all

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.250 
central vacuum unit so you can push all
the<00:01:02.320> dirt<00:01:02.530> right<00:01:02.920> into<00:01:03.430> those<00:01:03.580> main<00:01:04.180> drains<00:01:04.510> if

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
the dirt right into those main drains if

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.350 
the dirt right into those main drains if
you<00:01:05.440> need<00:01:05.560> more<00:01:05.710> suction<00:01:06.100> power<00:01:06.460> at<00:01:06.850> your<00:01:07.150> main

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
you need more suction power at your main

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.719 
you need more suction power at your main
drains<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:08.350> can<00:01:08.530> close<00:01:08.799> off<00:01:09.130> your<00:01:09.159> anti

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
drains you can close off your anti

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.760 
drains you can close off your anti
cavitation<00:01:10.450> devices<00:01:10.930> at<00:01:11.170> your<00:01:11.380> skimmer

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
cavitation devices at your skimmer

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.740 
cavitation devices at your skimmer
baskets<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.549> that<00:01:13.180> way<00:01:13.360> you'll<00:01:13.570> have<00:01:13.600> more

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
baskets and that way you'll have more

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.350 
baskets and that way you'll have more
suction<00:01:14.260> power<00:01:14.590> how<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:14.950> pull<00:01:15.190> more<00:01:15.490> at<00:01:16.090> the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
suction power how to pull more at the

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.209 
suction power how to pull more at the
main<00:01:16.540> drains<00:01:16.869> then<00:01:17.649> you're<00:01:17.770> gonna<00:01:17.860> want<00:01:18.130> to

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
main drains then you're gonna want to

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.760 
main drains then you're gonna want to
brush<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.759> entire<00:01:18.820> clean<00:01:19.479> shell<00:01:19.780> brushing<00:01:20.649> it

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
brush the entire clean shell brushing it

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.090 
brush the entire clean shell brushing it
towards<00:01:21.219> the<00:01:21.310> center<00:01:21.899> again<00:01:23.100> brushing

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
towards the center again brushing

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.999 
towards the center again brushing
everything<00:01:24.640> towards<00:01:25.119> your<00:01:25.299> main<00:01:25.479> drains<00:01:26.009> this

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
everything towards your main drains this

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.490 
everything towards your main drains this
is<00:01:27.189> a<00:01:27.219> strategy<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:28.030> minimize<00:01:28.180> vacuuming<00:01:29.049> if

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
is a strategy to minimize vacuuming if

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.319 
is a strategy to minimize vacuuming if
need<00:01:29.859> be<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.070> can<00:01:30.430> follow<00:01:30.640> this<00:01:30.939> separate

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
need be you can follow this separate

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.660 
need be you can follow this separate
with<00:01:31.960> vacuuming<00:01:32.560> this<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.399> a<00:01:33.430> way<00:01:33.640> of

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
with vacuuming this is a way of

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.090 
with vacuuming this is a way of
maintaining<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.020> getting<00:01:35.409> most<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.979> it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
maintaining it and getting most of it

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.550 
maintaining it and getting most of it
out<00:01:36.219> and<00:01:36.460> then<00:01:36.759> whatever<00:01:37.210> settles<00:01:37.810> left<00:01:38.079> in

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
out and then whatever settles left in

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.700 
out and then whatever settles left in
detail<00:01:39.009> with<00:01:39.250> your<00:01:39.460> full<00:01:40.090> vacuum<00:01:43.530> again<00:01:44.530> this
