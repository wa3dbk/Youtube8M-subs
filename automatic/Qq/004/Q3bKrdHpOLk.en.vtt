 the last efforts of evolutionists yes 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.800
 they are focused on the concept 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.810
 of man's evolution from creatures 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.869
 similar to monkeys over time 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.019
 more than 6,500 species have lived 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.269
 apes are mostly extinct today 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.950
 120 species of monkeys are present 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.950
 on earth 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.980
 these 6,500 species represent one 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.260
 rich resource for evolutionists they 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.700
 have described the scenario 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.740
 of human evolution by arranging one 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.350
 part of the skulls that responded to theirs 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.840

 evolutionists designate the so-called

 first common ancestor of men and 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.040

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.590
 means the first South African monkey 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.219
 australopitecus fossil was discovered 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.240
 in 1924 by a paleoanthropologist called

 all the comparisons between the skeleton 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.360
 of Australopithecus and the chimpanzee 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.770
 show that there is none 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.950
 obvious difference between them 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.479
 evolutionists despite these discoveries 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.850
 still state that although in 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.520
 australopithecus have the anatomy of one 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.729
 however they walked upright like a monkey 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.810
 humans but also this claim 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.000
 invalidated by two very famous

 all species of australopitecus are 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.090
 extinct monkeys that look like

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.080
 classified by evolutionists as

 of archaic species are actually i

 members of different human species the exam 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.920
 of these fossils reveals that they are not 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.610
 different from contemporary men

 [Music] 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.840
 the only difference is noted in the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.060
 but the structure of the skull is the same 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.800
 differences still exist today among the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.020
 different human species that live

 also the famous richard evolutionist 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.730
 lee who notes that the difference between 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:02.370
 the erectus man and the modern man is equal 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.740
 to such a variation of race 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.810
 differences are probably not that 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.090
 spoken of those we see today 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.600
 among the different geographical races of the

 modern humans 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.940
 admit however this fact is of the

 all contrary to dogmatic philosophy 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.280
 and to the ideology of evolutionists and yes 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.350
 therefore they try to represent the homo 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.510
 erectus as a half creature 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.000

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.580
 deceptive propaganda in the

 habilis this method is humanized 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.880
 conceals the attempt to bring them closer 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.830
 monkeys to humans thus filling 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.100
 the gap between these two

 imposed on the masses with an intense

 publish these reconstructions

 deceptive and the family tree

 it is limited to imaginary drawings

 man monkey creatures have played a

 cinematographic but all this history 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.270
 the only proof is generally a deception 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.460
 it is no more than a piece of skull or 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.380
 a tibia

 comment on the structure of the hair

 [Music] 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.879
 instead evolutionists give shape to

 these soft tissues they don't leave

 when the fabrics are shaped 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.579

 monkey with a human look

 alleged ancient reconstructions

 types of men do not have any 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.040
 scientific value and serve only to

 mislead the public

 in short, all these designs and models 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.830
 evolutionists do not represent anything else

 actually the stories invented by i 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:30.830
 evolutionists are so absurd as to 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.830
 attribute to the same skull 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.379
 even three times different ad
