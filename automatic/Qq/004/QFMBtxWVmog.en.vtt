everything's black and white the reason

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.889 
everything's black and white the reason
you<00:00:32.640> want<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> do<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:33.480> there's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
you want to do this is because there's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.110 
you want to do this is because there's
usually<00:00:34.649> when<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.040> color<00:00:35.399> correct<00:00:35.760> like<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
usually when you color correct like that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540 
usually when you color correct like that
it<00:00:36.930> leaves<00:00:37.620> these<00:00:37.800> little<00:00:38.040> blocks<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
it leaves these little blocks on the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.729 
it leaves these little blocks on the
outside<00:00:38.879> they're<00:00:39.030> yellow<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.540> blue<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.140> you

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
outside they're yellow and blue and you

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.560 
outside they're yellow and blue and you
want<00:00:40.890> everything<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.340> black<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
want everything to be black and so it

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.670 
want everything to be black and so it
turns<00:00:42.780> those<00:00:42.899> little<00:00:43.110> blocks<00:00:43.320> into<00:00:43.500> grey

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
turns those little blocks into grey

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
turns those little blocks into grey
blocks<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.700> see<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> line<00:00:45.210> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
blocks as you can see on that line of

blocks as you can see on that line of
his<00:00:45.420> hair<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.649> go<00:00:46.800> back<00:00:46.829> into<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
his hair so then I go back into the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
his hair so then I go back into the
brightness<00:00:47.550> contrast<00:00:47.789> turn<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
brightness contrast turn it up all the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.090 
brightness contrast turn it up all the
way<00:00:49.530> again<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:52.530> turns<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.980> little

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
way again and then that turns a little

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.560 
way again and then that turns a little
blocks<00:00:53.430> into<00:00:53.640> black<00:00:54.270> blocks<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:56.570> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
blocks into black blocks and then you

usually you want to use the brightest
tone<00:01:41.400> first<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.869> actually

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
tone first because this is actually

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.749 
tone first because this is actually
going<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> color<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.799> your<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and hit the subtract button so then I'm

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.609 
and hit the subtract button so then I'm
going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> speed<00:01:51.960> through<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.259> part<00:01:52.590> right

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
going to speed through this part right

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.240 
going to speed through this part right
