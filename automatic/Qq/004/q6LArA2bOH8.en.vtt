00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
revision rhinoplasty I recommend that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.550 
revision rhinoplasty I recommend that
they<00:01:35.550> rate<00:01:35.760> even<00:01:36.000> long

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
they rate even long

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.680 
they rate even long
depending<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.650> their<00:01:37.800> skin<00:01:38.190> type<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.270> level

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
depending on their skin type the level

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.630 
depending on their skin type the level
of<00:01:39.720> issues<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.530> hand<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.220> forth<00:01:41.520> and

of issues at hand and so forth and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
of issues at hand and so forth and
sometimes<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.240> recommend<00:01:42.720> waiting<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.230> to<00:01:43.260> two

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
sometimes I recommend waiting up to two

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770 
sometimes I recommend waiting up to two
years<00:01:43.890> before<00:01:44.670> proceeding<00:01:45.480> with<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
years before proceeding with the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.380 
years before proceeding with the
revision<00:01:46.260> surgery<00:01:46.740> because<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.940> still

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
revision surgery because there is still

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.570 
revision surgery because there is still
healing<00:01:48.840> process<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.770> through<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
healing process that's going through and

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.600 
healing process that's going through and
sometimes<00:01:51.480> you<00:01:51.690> just<00:01:51.870> need<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
sometimes you just need to like just in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.230 
sometimes you just need to like just in
a<00:01:53.760> sense<00:01:54.000> cool<00:01:54.330> off<00:01:54.590> both<00:01:55.590> from<00:01:55.979> an<00:01:56.240> anatomic
