their path the track lines are already
set<00:02:01.580> in<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.759> ice<00:02:02.000> but<00:02:02.810> they<00:02:02.960> refreeze<00:02:03.470> nightly

set in the ice but they refreeze nightly

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.310 
set in the ice but they refreeze nightly
so<00:02:04.250> between<00:02:04.880> us<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.420> Biscayne<00:02:05.810> Bay<00:02:06.020> will

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
so between us and the Biscayne Bay will

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.040 
so between us and the Biscayne Bay will
go<00:02:06.860> out<00:02:07.039> pull<00:02:07.399> up<00:02:07.580> break<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.030> ice<00:02:08.209> loosen<00:02:08.959> it

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
go out pull up break the ice loosen it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.170 
go out pull up break the ice loosen it
up<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.560> plan<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.039> run<00:02:10.310> up<00:02:10.429> one<00:02:10.700> side<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
up the plan is to run up one side of the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.940 
up the plan is to run up one side of the
track<00:02:11.450> lines<00:02:11.750> getting<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.440> escorted

hopefully<00:02:15.530> widening<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.130> path<00:02:16.340> enough<00:02:16.730> for

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.090 
ship on the Great Lakes in the winter is
built<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.450> withstand<00:03:11.600> ice<00:03:12.079> which<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.709> more<00:03:13.040> of

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
built to withstand ice which is more of

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.130 
built to withstand ice which is more of
an<00:03:13.190> obstacle<00:03:13.519> than<00:03:13.940> an<00:03:14.060> actual<00:03:14.299> danger<00:03:14.630> we're

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
an obstacle than an actual danger we're

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.720 
an obstacle than an actual danger we're
not<00:03:15.290> real<00:03:15.500> worried<00:03:15.769> about<00:03:15.920> ice<00:03:16.160> piercing<00:03:16.670> a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
not real worried about ice piercing a

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.759 
not real worried about ice piercing a
hole<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.060> can<00:03:17.239> happen<00:03:17.540> but<00:03:18.440> most<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.680> the

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
hole it can happen but most of the

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.199 
hole it can happen but most of the
vessels<00:03:19.130> at<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:19.489> point<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.910> year<00:03:20.060> that

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
vessels at this point of the year that

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.449 
vessels at this point of the year that
are<00:03:20.239> out<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:20.690> do<00:03:21.049> have<00:03:21.230> ice<00:03:21.650> capable<00:03:22.250> hulls

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
are out here do have ice capable hulls

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.580 
are out here do have ice capable hulls
so<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.420> concern<00:03:23.720> is<00:03:23.900> more<00:03:24.079> just<00:03:24.380> their

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
so the concern is more just their

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.800 
so the concern is more just their
forward<00:03:24.950> progress<00:03:25.190> being<00:03:25.670> halted<00:03:25.970> slow<00:03:26.600> and

steady<00:03:27.079> even<00:03:27.739> with<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.010> path<00:03:28.220> broken<00:03:28.700> for<00:03:28.850> the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
steady even with the path broken for the

steady even with the path broken for the

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
crest while the freighter still gets

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.590 
crest while the freighter still gets
