00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670 

today<00:00:00.870> we're<00:00:00.989> going<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.140> be<00:00:01.260> showing<00:00:01.410> off

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
today we're going to be showing off

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.720 
today we're going to be showing off
another<00:00:02.040> pc<00:00:02.580> from<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.090> NCIX<00:00:03.870> PC<00:00:04.730> laboratory

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
another pc from the NCIX PC laboratory

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.540 
another pc from the NCIX PC laboratory
so<00:00:06.060> I'm<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.420> well<00:00:07.350> you've<00:00:07.770> got<00:00:07.980> three<00:00:08.280> guesses

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
so I'm in well you've got three guesses

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.030 
so I'm in well you've got three guesses
as<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:08.970> whose<00:00:09.630> office<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.320> happen<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.769> in

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
as to whose office we happen to be in

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.430 
as to whose office we happen to be in
here<00:00:11.370> right<00:00:11.400> now<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.900> first<00:00:13.110> two<00:00:13.259> don't

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
here right now and the first two don't

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.310 
here right now and the first two don't
count<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.280> basically<00:00:15.210> he's<00:00:15.360> got<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> new<00:00:15.900> system

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
count so basically he's got a new system

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.990 
count so basically he's got a new system
that<00:00:16.379> we're<00:00:16.650> working<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> end<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
that we're working on for the end of the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.370 
that we're working on for the end of the
month<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.260> our

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
month and this is going to be our

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.250 
month and this is going to be our
fastest<00:00:20.130> Vesta<00:00:20.520> PC<00:00:20.970> ever<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> Vesta

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
fastest Vesta PC ever this is the Vesta

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.620 
fastest Vesta PC ever this is the Vesta
6050<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.880> actually<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.539> be

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
6050 and it's actually going to be

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.580 
6050 and it's actually going to be
available<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.199> couple<00:00:25.230> different

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.529 
available in a couple different
configurations<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.300> have

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
configurations so the one that we have

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.050 
configurations so the one that we have
here<00:00:27.900> since<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.160> balls<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.029> the

and the base edition actually has some
key<00:00:56.789> changes<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.449> comes<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.750> ddr3<00:00:58.289> 1333

and<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.330> base<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:06.810> does<00:01:07.110> not<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.740> then<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and the base one does not and then the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.070 
and the base one does not and then the
power<00:01:08.430> supply<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.909> another<00:01:09.240> key<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
power supply is another key one so the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.260 
power supply is another key one so the
performance<00:01:10.650> edition<00:01:10.830> comes<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.369> TX<00:01:11.729> 850

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
video is not just to show off the new

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
video is not just to show off the new
system<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.500> coming<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.979> oh<00:01:20.159> oh

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
system that we have coming out oh oh

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399 
system that we have coming out oh oh
yeah<00:01:20.939> they're<00:01:21.119> both<00:01:21.240> liquid<00:01:21.659> cooled<00:01:21.930> even

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
yeah they're both liquid cooled even

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.950 
yeah they're both liquid cooled even
though<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.590> can't<00:01:22.860> see<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.460> feet<00:01:23.729> look

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
though you can't see it some feet look

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.090 
though you can't see it some feet look
liquid<00:01:24.960> cooling<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.380> coming<00:01:25.710> when<00:01:25.979> we

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
liquid cooling is coming when we

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.530 
liquid cooling is coming when we
actually<00:01:26.490> put<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> case<00:01:27.150> which<00:01:27.390> is

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
actually put it in the case which is

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.109 
actually put it in the case which is
going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.140> fractal<00:01:28.829> design<00:01:28.979> define<00:01:29.159> XL

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
going to be a fractal design define XL

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.450 
going to be a fractal design define XL
so<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> base<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.200> uses<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.710> age<00:01:31.829> 50<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
so the base one uses in age 50 and the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.359 
so the base one uses in age 50 and the
performance<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.150> being<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.720> utter<00:01:34.500> maximum

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
procedure that goes into these systems

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130 
procedure that goes into these systems
and<00:01:43.979> has<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.579> helped<00:01:45.060> us<00:01:45.149> catch<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.689> lot

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and has actually helped us catch a lot

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.230 
and has actually helped us catch a lot
of<00:01:46.200> problems<00:01:46.979> before<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.549> release<00:01:47.820> into<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
of problems before we release into the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600 
of problems before we release into the
general<00:01:48.450> public<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.140> example<00:01:49.619> we

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
general public for example we

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.539 
general public for example we
encountered<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.180> rand<00:01:51.390> kit<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:52.290> was

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
encountered a rand kit that was

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.609 
encountered a rand kit that was
uniformly<00:01:53.549> incompatible<00:01:54.329> with<00:01:54.750> every<00:01:55.200> fenham

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
uniformly incompatible with every fenham

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.819 
uniformly incompatible with every fenham
2<00:01:55.860> x4<00:01:56.460> +<00:01:56.640> x6<00:01:56.909> processor<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> market<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.710> had

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
2 x4 + x6 processor on the market we had

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.200 
2 x4 + x6 processor on the market we had
no<00:01:58.979> way<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.130> knowing<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.640> specs<00:01:59.909> said<00:02:00.090> they

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
no way of knowing the specs said they

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
no way of knowing the specs said they
should<00:02:00.270> work<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.869> because<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> our

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
should work but because of our

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.499 
should work but because of our
validation<00:02:02.310> procedures<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.090> were<00:02:03.210> able<00:02:03.329> to

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
validation procedures we were able to

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.969 
validation procedures we were able to
find<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.170> system<00:02:04.469> was<00:02:04.590> randomly

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
find out that the system was randomly

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
find out that the system was randomly
locking<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.390> even<00:02:06.689> though<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
locking up and that even though the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.719 
locking up and that even though the
parts<00:02:07.290> weren't<00:02:07.469> defective<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.369> didn't<00:02:08.610> work

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
parts weren't defective they didn't work

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.369 
parts weren't defective they didn't work
together<00:02:08.940> even<00:02:09.569> though<00:02:09.690> they<00:02:09.899> should<00:02:10.140> work

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
together even though they should work

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.940 
together even though they should work
together<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.069> basically<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.150> use<00:02:12.390> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
together so basically we use a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.410 
together so basically we use a
host<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.280> different<00:02:13.459> programs<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.209> these<00:02:14.300> are

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
host of different programs and these are

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.510 
host of different programs and these are
all<00:02:14.510> enthusiast<00:02:15.110> grade<00:02:15.290> programs<00:02:15.770> not<00:02:16.040> your

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
all enthusiast grade programs not your

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.490 
all enthusiast grade programs not your
you<00:02:16.819> know<00:02:16.940> grandpa's<00:02:17.420> benchmarking<00:02:18.140> program

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
you know grandpa's benchmarking program

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.670 
you know grandpa's benchmarking program
so<00:02:18.709> we<00:02:18.739> use<00:02:18.920> Linux<00:02:19.370> as<00:02:19.550> well<00:02:19.700> as<00:02:19.819> prime95

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
so we use Linux as well as prime95

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.860 
so we use Linux as well as prime95
memtest<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.980> then<00:02:22.430> for<00:02:22.700> 3d<00:02:23.150> we<00:02:23.360> do<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.569> test

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
memtest and then for 3d we do a test

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.410 
memtest and then for 3d we do a test
with<00:02:24.080> vantage<00:02:24.500> as<00:02:24.650> well<00:02:24.800> as<00:02:24.920> furmark<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.610> with

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
with vantage as well as furmark and with

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.570 
with vantage as well as furmark and with
all<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.959> these<00:02:27.110> prototype<00:02:27.680> systems<00:02:28.099> so<00:02:28.340> far

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
all of these prototype systems so far

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.880 
all of these prototype systems so far
we've<00:02:28.760> done<00:02:28.970> at<00:02:29.120> least<00:02:29.450> some<00:02:29.810> gameplay<00:02:30.349> with

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
we've done at least some gameplay with

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.610 
we've done at least some gameplay with
an<00:02:31.040> intensive<00:02:31.489> game<00:02:31.670> like<00:02:31.880> Crysis<00:02:32.450> mafia<00:02:33.410> two

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
an intensive game like Crysis mafia two

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.259 
an intensive game like Crysis mafia two
just<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.280> make<00:02:34.430> sure<00:02:34.459> that<00:02:34.819> besides<00:02:35.150> the

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
just to make sure that besides the

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.729 
just to make sure that besides the
synthetic<00:02:35.780> benchmarks<00:02:36.290> we're<00:02:36.440> not<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.680> to

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
synthetic benchmarks we're not going to

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.620 
synthetic benchmarks we're not going to
run<00:02:36.860> into<00:02:36.980> any<00:02:37.190> problems<00:02:37.400> with<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.120> demanding

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
run into any problems with a demanding

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.589 
run into any problems with a demanding
modern<00:02:39.049> game<00:02:39.319> engine<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.970> system<00:02:41.390> this

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
modern game engine so this system this

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.509 
modern game engine so this system this
prototype<00:02:41.930> won't<00:02:42.349> be<00:02:42.470> ready<00:02:42.680> probably<00:02:43.040> for

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
prototype won't be ready probably for

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.270 
prototype won't be ready probably for
another<00:02:43.900> four<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.930> five<00:02:45.260> days<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:46.099> because

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
another four to five days just because

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.300 
another four to five days just because
the<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.870> crazy<00:02:48.049> Russian<00:02:48.590> needs<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.920> do<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.069> lot

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the the crazy Russian needs to do a lot

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.100 
the the crazy Russian needs to do a lot
more<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.549> his<00:02:49.790> crazy<00:02:50.120> brush<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.660> stuff<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:51.079> it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
more of his crazy brush and stuff on it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.140 
more of his crazy brush and stuff on it
make<00:02:51.709> sure<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.130> passes<00:02:52.340> all<00:02:52.640> these<00:02:52.790> tests

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
make sure that it passes all these tests

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.120 
make sure that it passes all these tests
overnight<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.840> it's<00:02:53.989> just<00:02:54.230> crazy<00:02:54.349> stable<00:02:54.980> and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
overnight and it's just crazy stable and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.410 
overnight and it's just crazy stable and
then<00:02:55.519> we're<00:02:55.610> going<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.790> be<00:02:55.910> able<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.209> go<00:02:56.299> ahead

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
then we're going to be able to go ahead

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.089 
then we're going to be able to go ahead
and<00:02:56.780> release<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.170> system<00:02:57.500> around<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:57.860> so

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
and release the system around this so

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.589 
and release the system around this so
