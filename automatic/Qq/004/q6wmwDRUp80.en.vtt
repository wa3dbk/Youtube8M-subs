00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:21.570
 [Music] 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.280
 hi to all ex creative and is 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.800
 today we find ourselves in for two 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.869
 little glitch on skyrim that are going 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.760
 pass both solitudes so the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 first will happen in blue steps 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.590
 so the palace of charles so have signed 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.260
 here show you on the map anyway 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.140
 so it's blue puck balls so 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.190
 the first glitch or there excuse me for 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.090
 the log there but it's really abused 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.280
 so the first shot 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.830
 it's going to be to have the house free 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.420
 of solitude so I think it's 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.219
 one of the most expensive houses in the game 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.690
 which is worth 25 thousand so it's not nothing 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.520
 but we will have it for free 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.590
 with a little guide that lasted a few 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 seconds but who is really but very 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.770
 very simple 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.920
 so to do that you just have to 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.560
 go see the chamberlain of mourning arles 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.490
 that normally a foot here that's it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.100
 him 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 so if you click here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.140
 asks you 25000 to have the house 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.850
 but not in fact we will place ourselves 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.610
 behind him and what will 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.220
 to interest is that it is the closet in 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.840
 do we go buy him the house we go 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.700
 confirm him and at the moment we know 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.869
 we will confirm to him there will be a 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.150
 little sentence I know they'll go to me 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.220
 say well etc you can settle 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.320
 but we will not wait until the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.220
 France to finish we will tell who you are 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.130
 and this planes will do and hurry up 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.560
 to go on to the closet and put everything 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540
 your money like this then your 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.259
 money will be stored worth a little bug 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.310
 and you will have the house free so we 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.890
 will test right away so these parties 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.540
 have been worth click on so wanted said 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.560
 perfect woody a house is 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.720
 currently available 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.700
 and there right now and you'll say 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.340
 I take you will do to put them 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.350
 in the closet you are ready attention 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:14.519
 I go round to the closet you go hop 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.709
 right away at various you put where 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.799
 it is the money here is your gold 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.750
 you store square yes so here's the 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.430
 store in the closet and here and there 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.900
 There is written to visit the manor with arrows 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.299
 your new house you have the keys 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.270
 everything you come back so if you want 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.670
 you can talk to him 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.900
 and we rewrite I would decorate decorate my 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.450
 house and there you go back to the closet and 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.390
 you resume your series in summer so 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.220
 So now we will go to the 2nd 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.860
 glitch to do this so to do this 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.930
 you just need them how 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.100
 is called decorating your house but 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.380
 not with lounges etc 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.240
 because apart if you're still at 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.310
 your house but you will need that 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.790
 One thing is the Hotel John 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.730
 chapman does so you bought in 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.960
 the cold it is quite expensive and more 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.490
 laboratory in change so 2500 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.340
 still the money you'll have 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.020
 store it will serve you for that especially 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.360
 so here you have something else so 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.490
 your friends the hotel and we are going to go to 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.480
 the house actually to see where there and 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.070
 it's really being abused starting to log so 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.250
 the house is located in the driveway 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.100
 main loneliness so here too 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.330
 will be the second beach will serve us 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.210
 also but very good for money or 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.850
 good for your companions, how are you? 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.560
 actually increases your armor 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.690
 so be it their basic walls 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.420
 men's coccyx iron armor or 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.920
 their walls like ge that their walls of 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.000
 sheets 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.060
 so good me I had created a second 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.470
 armor for my character but so 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.730
 the armor of the sheets I show you these 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.530
 wise so this is the most armed 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.290
 powerful of the game but it is an armor 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.300
 so heavy which is quite painful 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.550
 so the house in the global developed 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.100
 a term in the long run 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.360
 the academy of the bards and you go 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.110
 directly hop here is in the basement 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.580
 you unlock the door with the key 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.110
 so you too want to equip 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.970
 your house but from a to z 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.140
 good you can but I have not 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.430
 want to waste money for a 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.020
 house is that I'm never there so 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.799
 this is yes had a hell of a buzz tim hunkin has 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.470
 took the pose 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.480
 good so in fact here you have just 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.800
 need the hotel the enchantment and the 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.080
 bias game is going to happen around 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.060
 mannequins so to do this you where 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.770
 you take any manikin 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.750
 you welcome the name dummy he has 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.000
 strictly nothing and you will do that 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.050
 so held you put the armor you 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.480
 so want my forgiveness but I 'm going 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.910
 recover that army in d2 rank with 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.100
 the beauties of the drains and the helmet 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.230
 rights whose referral doctor but you 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.330
 did you come back to them on the 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.190
 manikin so held you pick up 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.770
 exactly their walls sheets 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.360
 the helmet and the good boots exist good 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.130
 you will not have team and so you go 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.980
 see my character he is naked 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.320
 it does not matter so after having 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.180
 picked it all up you go out you 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.880
 go back into the main alley of 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.040
 loneliness so in the end I recap the 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.060
 teams and the dummy but while 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.190
 you're getting on the team and you 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.350
 take it all back so that's just it 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.320
 you take back just what you him 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.300
 have team and you go out and in 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.860
 do you go back and you go 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.750
 see the little bug that's pretty 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.530
 nice 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.320
 ah the small changes were going so 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.240
 there you are in the main alley of 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.740
 loneliness here too that we came this lag 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.720
 still as much but it's really 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:38.600
 abused 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:39.950
 we go back into the mansion to go so 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.479
 that's normally 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.140
 so you can do it on the 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.610
 two mannequins and when we arrive you 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.950
 see here the model and exchanged 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.840
 so that makes you a buzz like that 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.360
 means you're going to have but that 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.220
 it's often when it's not bad 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.720
 just go see the model well 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.330
 visible but if you click on it 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.840
 but now you have the full armor 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.240
 so either if your game turns out well you 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.090
 are you going to have the manikin or is that 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.210
 you will see the army rocco my companion 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.889
 while they also have no but 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.389
 it will be invisible so wanted click 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.270
 on here you have their walls of 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:20.210
 sheets so you take all that stuff 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.740
 see them appeared and as you can 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.870
 see it ben I 'll show you 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.590
 their walls sheets that I had 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:30.080
 enchanted so who at 109 2 about ago 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.210
 now the one that was duplicated to 78 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.889
 boots that have been duplicated too 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.020
 the helmet too so 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.969
 for example I make myself equipped with all 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.399
 in Europe 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:43.639
 legendary goals legendary armor that's it 

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:45.589
 so I have everything we duplicate and so that's 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.289
 really very handy for you 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:49.669
 make money on selling them 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.039
 in all that is blacksmith and all 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.719
 so it's really about these practices and 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.309
 even to equip your companions for 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:57.229
 that at least they undergo less 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:58.610
 damage so here it was two small 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.619
 pretty friendly glitch 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.569
 so thank you for watching the 

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:04.549

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:07.419
