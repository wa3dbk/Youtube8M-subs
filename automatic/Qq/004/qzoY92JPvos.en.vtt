00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
a couple first just to get an idea of

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.080 
a couple first just to get an idea of
the<00:00:28.430> kind<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.640> thing<00:00:28.760> we're<00:00:28.850> going<00:00:28.970> to<00:00:29.029> be

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
the kind of thing we're going to be

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.960 
the kind of thing we're going to be
doing<00:00:29.320> this<00:00:30.320> one's<00:00:30.529> like<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:30.680> watery<00:00:31.279> one<00:00:31.490> it's

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
doing this one's like a watery one it's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.420 
doing this one's like a watery one it's
got<00:00:32.090> some<00:00:32.410> some<00:00:33.410> mountains<00:00:33.890> around<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.160> sides

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
got some some mountains around the sides

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.810 
got some some mountains around the sides
with<00:00:34.760> bit<00:00:35.059> of<00:00:35.120> snow<00:00:35.300> on<00:00:35.449> them<00:00:36.460> I've<00:00:37.460> got<00:00:37.670> one

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
with bit of snow on them I've got one

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.330 
with bit of snow on them I've got one
here<00:00:38.090> it's<00:00:38.210> like<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.480> it's<00:00:39.079> like<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.829> golf<00:00:40.130> course

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340

here it's like a it's like a golf course
I<00:00:40.520> think<00:00:40.730> it<00:00:40.790> was<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:40.970> force<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:41.540> start<00:00:41.750> with

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
I think it was a force to start with

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.430 
I think it was a force to start with
it's<00:00:43.640> got<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.820> lake<00:00:44.030> some<00:00:44.660> some<00:00:45.079> house<00:00:45.260> or

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
it's got a lake some some house or

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.260 
it's got a lake some some house or
outside<00:00:46.300> it's<00:00:47.300> really<00:00:47.540> cool<00:00:48.760> this<00:00:49.760> one's<00:00:50.030> like

outside it's really cool this one's like

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:58.270 
outside it's really cool this one's like
some<00:00:50.570> big<00:00:51.140> rocks<00:00:51.649> in<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.340> water<00:00:56.050> and<00:00:57.280> finally

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
some big rocks in the water and finally

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.209 
some big rocks in the water and finally
we've<00:00:58.399> got<00:00:58.640> looks<00:00:59.329> like<00:00:59.360> a<00:00:59.950> like<00:01:00.950> a<00:01:00.980> little

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
we've got looks like a like a little

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.970 
we've got looks like a like a little
town<00:01:01.460> round<00:01:01.789> frozen<00:01:02.270> lake<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:03.559> if<00:01:03.649> you<00:01:03.739> see<00:01:03.890> on

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
town round frozen lake and if you see on

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.889 
town round frozen lake and if you see on
the<00:01:04.009> bottom<00:01:04.250> right<00:01:04.580> down<00:01:04.820> here<00:01:05.239> if<00:01:05.390> i<00:01:05.479> zoom<00:01:05.509> in

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
the bottom right down here if i zoom in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.779 
the bottom right down here if i zoom in
you<00:01:06.680> can<00:01:06.740> see<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.369> people<00:01:07.490> actually

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
you can see this and people actually

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.540 
you can see this and people actually
skating<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.360> lake<00:01:08.950> so<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.069> really<00:01:10.280> cough

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
skating on the lake so it's really cough

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.880 
skating on the lake so it's really cough
it<00:01:10.700> up<00:01:10.759> all<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.000> way<00:01:11.090> around<00:01:12.610> it's<00:01:13.610> seamless

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
it up all the way around it's seamless

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.359 
it up all the way around it's seamless
which<00:01:15.890> is<00:01:16.069> the<00:01:16.369> idea<00:01:16.399> really<00:01:20.200> this<00:01:21.200> is<00:01:21.440> this<00:01:22.190> is

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
which is the idea really this is this is

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.540 
which is the idea really this is this is
the<00:01:22.459> end<00:01:22.610> image<00:01:22.910> where<00:01:23.450> we're<00:01:23.750> aiming<00:01:23.780> for

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
the end image where we're aiming for

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.540 
the end image where we're aiming for
this<00:01:25.550> is<00:01:25.640> our<00:01:25.759> start<00:01:26.090> image<00:01:27.130> got<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:28.250> just<00:01:28.399> a

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
this is our start image got it's just a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.180 
this is our start image got it's just a
standard<00:01:29.140> landscape<00:01:30.140> with<00:01:30.560> some<00:01:30.740> grass<00:01:30.950> and

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
standard landscape with some grass and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.969 
standard landscape with some grass and
some<00:01:31.310> sky<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:32.720> something<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:33.020> look<00:01:33.050> for<00:01:33.440> when

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
some sky it's something to look for when

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.469 
some sky it's something to look for when
you're<00:01:34.280> choosing<00:01:34.610> your<00:01:34.789> images<00:01:35.209> to<00:01:35.330> make

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
you're choosing your images to make

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.710 
you're choosing your images to make
these<00:01:35.630> mini<00:01:35.929> panic<00:01:36.170> selves<00:01:36.530> is<00:01:37.149> you<00:01:38.149> see<00:01:38.420> here

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
these mini panic selves is you see here

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.199 
these mini panic selves is you see here
we<00:01:38.869> need<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.259> horizon<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.130> be<00:01:40.310> pretty<00:01:41.030> much

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
we need the horizon to be pretty much

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.210 
we need the horizon to be pretty much
level<00:01:41.630> from<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.289> left-hand<00:01:42.740> side<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
level from the left-hand side to the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.969 
level from the left-hand side to the
right<00:01:43.250> hand<00:01:43.550> side<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.090> that's<00:01:45.080> because<00:01:45.289> you

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
right hand side and that's because you

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.740 
right hand side and that's because you
can<00:01:46.099> actually<00:01:46.130> bend<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.910> image<00:01:47.149> round<00:01:47.420> in<00:01:47.690> a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
can actually bend the image round in a

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.630 
can actually bend the image round in a
full<00:01:47.929> circle<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:48.800> the<00:01:48.920> left-hand<00:01:49.250> side<00:01:49.459> is

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
full circle so the left-hand side is

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.760 
full circle so the left-hand side is
going<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.030> end<00:01:50.149> up<00:01:50.330> in<00:01:50.509> line<00:01:51.140> with<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.619> right

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
going to end up in line with the right

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.219 
going to end up in line with the right
hand<00:01:51.920> side<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.509> if<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.630> horizon<00:01:53.989> isn't

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
hand side and if the horizon isn't

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.510 
hand side and if the horizon isn't
completely<00:01:54.530> in<00:01:54.679> line<00:01:54.830> it's<00:01:55.069> going<00:01:55.099> to<00:01:55.250> make<00:01:55.340> it

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
completely in line it's going to make it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.749 
completely in line it's going to make it
quite<00:01:55.700> hard<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.910> fix<00:01:56.239> down<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.869> line<00:01:57.610> so<00:01:58.610> this

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
quite hard to fix down the line so this

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.339 
quite hard to fix down the line so this
one's<00:01:58.940> pretty<00:01:59.509> good<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.840> know<00:01:59.869> it's<00:02:00.080> almost

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
one's pretty good you know it's almost

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:01.990 
one's pretty good you know it's almost
almost<00:02:00.800> spot-on<00:02:01.220> there<00:02:01.670> shouldn't<00:02:01.819> be<00:02:01.880> too

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
almost spot-on there shouldn't be too

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.660 
almost spot-on there shouldn't be too
much<00:02:02.119> work<00:02:02.179> to<00:02:02.360> get<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:02.660> looking<00:02:02.840> perfect

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
much work to get it looking perfect

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.550 
much work to get it looking perfect
first<00:02:04.670> thing<00:02:04.849> we<00:02:04.940> need<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.119> do<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:05.929> you<00:02:06.259> need<00:02:06.319> to

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
first thing we need to do is you need to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.050 
first thing we need to do is you need to
change<00:02:06.739> the<00:02:06.920> image<00:02:07.009> size<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.640> make<00:02:07.759> sure<00:02:07.910> it's

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
change the image size to make sure it's

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.180 
change the image size to make sure it's
a<00:02:08.090> complete<00:02:08.420> square<00:02:08.840> now<00:02:09.410> at<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.590> moment<00:02:10.009> it's

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
a complete square now at the moment it's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.000 
a complete square now at the moment it's
a<00:02:10.340> right<00:02:10.520> angle<00:02:10.849> it's<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.450> landscape<00:02:12.010> we're

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
a right angle it's the landscape we're

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.520 
a right angle it's the landscape we're
going<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.189> destroy<00:02:13.519> it<00:02:13.640> slightly<00:02:14.290> but<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.409> is

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
going to destroy it slightly but this is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.990 
going to destroy it slightly but this is
going<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.739> mean<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.159> going<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.459> shape

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
going to mean that it's going to shape

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.950 
going to mean that it's going to shape
better<00:02:17.239> when<00:02:17.750> we

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
better when we

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.320 
better when we
by<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.320> filter<00:02:18.650> turn<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.940> make<00:02:20.120> sure<00:02:20.150> you've

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
by the filter turn so make sure you've

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.950 
by the filter turn so make sure you've
got<00:02:20.360> constrain<00:02:20.930> proportions<00:02:21.010> not<00:02:22.010> ticked<00:02:22.960> set

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
got constrain proportions not ticked set

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960 
got constrain proportions not ticked set
it<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.290> largest<00:02:24.620> size<00:02:24.950> out<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.400> two<00:02:25.610> so

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
it to the largest size out of the two so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.300 
it to the largest size out of the two so
the<00:02:26.090> larger<00:02:26.360> size<00:02:26.540> here<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.650> width<00:02:27.890> which

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
the larger size here is the width which

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.550 
the larger size here is the width which
is<00:02:28.340> 1920<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:29.330> I've<00:02:29.390> set<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> height<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.960> 1920

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
is 1920 so I've set the height to 1920

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.460 
is 1920 so I've set the height to 1920
as<00:02:30.620> well<00:02:30.800> let<00:02:31.730> me<00:02:31.790> do<00:02:31.910> okay<00:02:32.180> we<00:02:32.930> can<00:02:33.080> see<00:02:33.290> now

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
as well let me do okay we can see now

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.730 
as well let me do okay we can see now
that<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.770> images<00:02:33.980> are<00:02:34.190> square<00:02:35.290> from<00:02:36.290> here<00:02:36.530> we

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
that the images are square from here we

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.520 
that the images are square from here we
need<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.070> turn<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.760> 180<00:02:38.240> degrees<00:02:38.530> that's

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
need to turn it 180 degrees that's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.680 
need to turn it 180 degrees that's
because<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.160> filter<00:02:40.580> wraps<00:02:40.970> from<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.360> bottom

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
because the filter wraps from the bottom

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.290 
because the filter wraps from the bottom
upwards<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.490> we<00:02:43.490> need<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> planet<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.120> be<00:02:44.210> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
upwards and we need the planet to be the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.000 
upwards and we need the planet to be the
center<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.690> image<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.320> we<00:02:45.500> will<00:02:45.680> keep<00:02:45.860> it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
center of the image so we will keep it

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.060 
center of the image so we will keep it
at<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.160> top<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.660> image<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.930> now<00:02:48.110> ready<00:02:48.410> no<00:02:49.010> two

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
at the top the image is now ready no two

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.590 
at the top the image is now ready no two
we're<00:02:49.610> going<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.790> actually<00:02:49.880> apply<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.300> filter

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
we're going to actually apply the filter

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.450 
we're going to actually apply the filter
to<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.020> now<00:02:51.200> that's<00:02:51.860> how<00:02:51.980> she's<00:02:52.130> going<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.280> turn

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
to it now that's how she's going to turn

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.880 
to it now that's how she's going to turn
it<00:02:52.580> into<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.850> spherical<00:02:53.450> shape<00:02:53.660> if<00:02:54.590> we<00:02:54.680> go<00:02:54.830> to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
it into a spherical shape if we go to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.180 
it into a spherical shape if we go to
filter<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:55.780> distort<00:02:56.780> do<00:02:57.380> polar<00:02:57.710> coordinates

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
filter and distort do polar coordinates

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.150 
filter and distort do polar coordinates
gives<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.210> quick<00:02:59.330> preview<00:03:00.040> yeah<00:03:01.040> it's

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
gives you a quick preview yeah it's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.970 
gives you a quick preview yeah it's
going<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.340> look<00:03:01.460> so<00:03:01.760> that's<00:03:02.300> what<00:03:02.420> we<00:03:02.510> want<00:03:02.980> and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
going to look so that's what we want and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.370 
going to look so that's what we want and
this<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.160> what<00:03:04.250> we<00:03:04.280> now<00:03:04.460> got<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:05.630> it's<00:03:06.080> pretty

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
this is what we now got it it's pretty

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.020 
this is what we now got it it's pretty
much<00:03:06.530> close<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.950> our<00:03:07.070> final<00:03:07.460> image<00:03:07.670> if<00:03:07.880> I

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
much close to our final image if I

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.320 
much close to our final image if I
switch<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.690> over<00:03:08.810> here<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:10.000> but<00:03:11.000> we've<00:03:11.150> got

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
switch it over here and but we've got

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.420 
switch it over here and but we've got
this<00:03:11.510> big<00:03:11.780> line<00:03:12.380> down<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.710> middle<00:03:12.860> where<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
this big line down the middle where the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.030 
this big line down the middle where the
left<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.090> right<00:03:14.120> inside<00:03:14.570> of<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.780> images<00:03:15.110> met

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
left and right inside of the images met

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.040 
left and right inside of the images met
each<00:03:16.190> other<00:03:16.340> what<00:03:17.240> we<00:03:17.300> need<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.540> do<00:03:17.660> now<00:03:17.840> is<00:03:17.870> we

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
each other what we need to do now is we

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.540 
each other what we need to do now is we
need<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.260> tidy<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.620> up<00:03:18.740> a<00:03:18.830> little<00:03:18.920> bit<00:03:19.160> blend

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
need to tidy this up a little bit blend

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.330 
need to tidy this up a little bit blend
it<00:03:19.760> blend<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:20.870> drag<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> few<00:03:21.770> pieces<00:03:21.920> across

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
it blend it in drag a few pieces across

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.990 
it blend it in drag a few pieces across
and<00:03:22.730> then<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.780> pretty<00:03:24.080> much<00:03:24.170> ready<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:25.310> what<00:03:25.970> I

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
and then it pretty much ready and what I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.530 
and then it pretty much ready and what I
use<00:03:26.300> for<00:03:26.330> this<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.470> clone<00:03:27.800> stamp<00:03:27.830> tool

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
use for this is the clone stamp tool

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.210 
use for this is the clone stamp tool
havoc<00:03:29.540> quite<00:03:29.960> decent<00:03:30.440> size<00:03:30.710> because<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.040> want

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
havoc quite decent size because you want

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.160 
havoc quite decent size because you want
to<00:03:31.280> book<00:03:31.610> while<00:03:31.880> at<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.060> same<00:03:32.240> time<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:32.930> I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
to book while at the same time and I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.920 
to book while at the same time and I
take<00:03:33.440> areas<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.100> this<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.910> white<00:03:35.180> cloud<00:03:35.750> on

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
take areas of this this white cloud on

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.150 
take areas of this this white cloud on
the<00:03:36.020> left<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.500> just<00:03:37.690> drag<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.750> across<00:03:42.130> so<00:03:43.130> you

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
the left and just drag it across so you

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.470 
the left and just drag it across so you
can<00:03:43.400> see<00:03:43.550> you<00:03:43.610> know<00:03:43.700> it's<00:03:43.880> starting<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.300> blend

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
can see you know it's starting to blend

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.800 
can see you know it's starting to blend
in

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:04:01.449 

kept<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:50.959> more<00:03:51.200> on<00:03:51.319> there<00:04:00.040> maybe<00:04:01.040> get<00:04:01.250> a<00:04:01.280> bit

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
kept it more on there maybe get a bit

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.899 
kept it more on there maybe get a bit
right<00:04:01.730> at<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.000> top<00:04:02.180> as<00:04:02.360> well<00:04:03.700> splint<00:04:04.700> this

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
right at the top as well splint this

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:21.180 
right at the top as well splint this
topic<00:04:05.390> sky

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.360 

okay<00:04:22.200> right<00:04:23.200> skies<00:04:23.530> looking<00:04:23.800> pretty<00:04:24.010> blend<00:04:24.250> it

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
okay right skies looking pretty blend it

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.830 
okay right skies looking pretty blend it
out<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.950> now<00:04:26.950> we<00:04:27.010> need<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.550> blend<00:04:28.240> in<00:04:28.480> this

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
out and now we need to blend in this

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.660 
out and now we need to blend in this
thin<00:04:29.440> line<00:04:29.650> down<00:04:29.920> the<00:04:29.950> center<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.460> planet

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
thin line down the center of the planet

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.210 
thin line down the center of the planet
and<00:04:31.660> what<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.840> do<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.110> I'd<00:04:32.290> use<00:04:32.530> elliptical

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
and what I do is I'd use elliptical

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.600 
and what I do is I'd use elliptical
marquee<00:04:33.490> just<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:35.860> create<00:04:36.160> an<00:04:36.250> area<00:04:36.460> to

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
marquee just to to create an area to

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.280 
marquee just to to create an area to
work<00:04:36.820> within<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:37.330> we<00:04:37.420> don't<00:04:37.570> go<00:04:37.690> over<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.960> sky

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
work within so we don't go over the sky

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.970 
work within so we don't go over the sky
which<00:04:38.530> is<00:04:38.680> already<00:04:38.950> done<00:04:40.200> right<00:04:41.200> it's<00:04:41.740> pretty

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
which is already done right it's pretty

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.790 
which is already done right it's pretty
good<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.130> me<00:04:42.870> then<00:04:43.870> using<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.380> same<00:04:44.590> tool

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
good to me then using the same tool

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.890 
good to me then using the same tool
again<00:04:45.100> maybe<00:04:45.370> a<00:04:45.490> bit<00:04:45.610> smaller<00:04:45.910> this<00:04:46.030> time<00:04:46.090> take

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
again maybe a bit smaller this time take

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.780 
again maybe a bit smaller this time take
some<00:04:47.080> areas<00:04:47.380> of<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.590> planet<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.040> just<00:04:48.250> draw

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
some areas of the planet and just draw

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.010 
some areas of the planet and just draw
them<00:04:49.020> across<00:04:50.020> over<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.560> line<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:52.750> can<00:04:52.900> see

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
them across over the line you can see

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.320 
them across over the line you can see
I'm<00:04:53.110> starting<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.410> fill<00:04:53.650> their<00:04:53.830> now<00:04:54.210> get<00:04:55.210> a

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
I'm starting to fill their now get a

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
I'm starting to fill their now get a
edge<00:04:55.480> nice<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:55.930> sharp<00:04:56.200> atop<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.810> hopefully

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
edge nice and sharp atop and hopefully

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.150 
edge nice and sharp atop and hopefully
yeah<00:05:00.270> now<00:05:01.270> you<00:05:01.330> can<00:05:01.510> see<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:02.800> line<00:05:02.950> down<00:05:03.130> the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
yeah now you can see the line down the

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.540 
yeah now you can see the line down the
middle<00:05:03.250> is<00:05:03.520> pretty<00:05:04.120> much<00:05:04.270> gone<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:06.400> we've

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
middle is pretty much gone and we've

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.010 
middle is pretty much gone and we've
still<00:05:06.730> got<00:05:06.850> this<00:05:06.910> nice<00:05:07.090> edge<00:05:07.390> because<00:05:07.870> I've

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
still got this nice edge because I've

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.490 
still got this nice edge because I've
used<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.350> Marquis<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.640> work<00:05:09.820> with<00:05:09.970> him<00:05:10.500> the

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
used the Marquis to to work with him the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.980 
used the Marquis to to work with him the
image<00:05:11.740> is<00:05:11.800> looking<00:05:12.040> pretty<00:05:12.160> good<00:05:12.370> now<00:05:12.930> all<00:05:13.930> I

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
image is looking pretty good now all I

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.830 
image is looking pretty good now all I
do<00:05:14.140> now<00:05:14.500> is<00:05:14.530> just<00:05:14.740> crop<00:05:15.130> it<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.490> nice<00:05:16.210> nice

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
do now is just crop it to a nice nice

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.260 
do now is just crop it to a nice nice
size<00:05:17.170> so<00:05:17.560> you<00:05:17.620> get<00:05:17.890> only<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.640> most<00:05:18.790> important

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
size so you get only the most important

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.330 
size so you get only the most important
bits<00:05:19.390> of<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.570> image<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:20.770> was<00:05:20.950> smaller<00:05:21.280> than

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
bits of the image it was smaller than

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:29.750 
bits of the image it was smaller than
that<00:05:22.110> that<00:05:23.110> sort<00:05:23.410> of<00:05:23.470> size<00:05:24.570> yeah<00:05:25.570> excites<00:05:26.110> me

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.670 

and<00:05:30.760> there<00:05:30.910> we<00:05:30.970> have<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.120> this<00:05:31.870> is<00:05:32.080> our<00:05:32.350> final

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
and there we have it this is our final

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.800 
and there we have it this is our final
image<00:05:33.130> our<00:05:33.400> mini<00:05:34.090> planet<00:05:34.450> that<00:05:34.540> we've<00:05:34.660> made

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
image our mini planet that we've made

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.170 
image our mini planet that we've made
from<00:05:35.140> our<00:05:35.320> landscape<00:05:35.890> of<00:05:35.920> green<00:05:36.550> grass<00:05:36.850> and

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
from our landscape of green grass and

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.370 
from our landscape of green grass and
blue<00:05:37.360> sky<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:38.740> really<00:05:39.040> is<00:05:39.250> that<00:05:39.550> easy<00:05:40.380> i'd

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
blue sky it really is that easy i'd

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.700 
blue sky it really is that easy i'd
suggest<00:05:41.830> trying<00:05:42.280> it<00:05:42.580> with<00:05:42.700> like<00:05:43.710> sandy

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
suggest trying it with like sandy

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.840 
suggest trying it with like sandy
landscapes<00:05:45.550> or<00:05:45.820> maybe<00:05:46.560> with<00:05:47.560> skyscrapers<00:05:48.220> and

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
landscapes or maybe with skyscrapers and

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.780 
landscapes or maybe with skyscrapers and
and<00:05:49.210> lakes<00:05:49.750> and<00:05:50.260> forests<00:05:51.100> i<00:05:51.250> mean<00:05:51.460> you<00:05:51.520> can<00:05:51.670> do

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
and lakes and forests i mean you can do

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.040 
and lakes and forests i mean you can do
all<00:05:51.820> sorts<00:05:51.970> of<00:05:52.270> different<00:05:52.420> stuff<00:05:52.780> to<00:05:52.930> make

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
all sorts of different stuff to make
