juice correct correct you know what's it

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.330 
juice correct correct you know what's it
called<00:00:21.080> what<00:00:21.439> is<00:00:21.529> this<00:00:21.650> product<00:00:21.860> color<00:00:22.130> the

called what is this product color the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.880 
called what is this product color the
hyrum<00:00:22.759> slow<00:00:23.060> juicer<00:00:23.650> compared<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:24.680> other

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
hyrum slow juicer compared to other

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.069 
hyrum slow juicer compared to other
traditional<00:00:25.610> high-speed<00:00:26.060> juicers<00:00:26.480> are

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
traditional high-speed juicers are

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.560 
traditional high-speed juicers are
juicer<00:00:27.739> it<00:00:27.890> actually<00:00:28.189> rotates<00:00:28.460> in<00:00:28.849> 80<00:00:29.059> rpm

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
juicer it actually rotates in 80 rpm

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.460 
juicer it actually rotates in 80 rpm
it's<00:00:30.489> slowly<00:00:31.489> squeezes<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:32.540> by<00:00:33.050> doing<00:00:33.350> that

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
it's slowly squeezes and by doing that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.530 
it's slowly squeezes and by doing that
we<00:00:34.130> actually<00:00:34.250> minimize<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.090> oxidation

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
we actually minimize the oxidation

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.080 
we actually minimize the oxidation
process<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.469> maximize<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:37.460> vitamins<00:00:37.969> and

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
process and maximize the vitamins and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.389 
process and maximize the vitamins and
nutrients<00:00:38.540> that<00:00:38.690> are<00:00:38.750> in<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.050> fruit<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.010> if

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
nutrients that are in the fruit so if

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.759 
nutrients that are in the fruit so if
you<00:00:40.579> see<00:00:40.910> that<00:00:41.620> comparison<00:00:42.620> between

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
you see that comparison between

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.029 
you see that comparison between
traditional<00:00:43.519> and<00:00:43.699> our<00:00:43.910> juicer<00:00:44.359> a<00:00:45.039> traditional

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
traditional and our juicer a traditional

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.160 
traditional and our juicer a traditional
juicer<00:00:46.370> by<00:00:46.609> high<00:00:46.879> speed<00:00:47.239> it<00:00:47.539> oxidized<00:00:48.140> and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
juicer by high speed it oxidized and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.500 
juicer by high speed it oxidized and
separates<00:00:48.800> for<00:00:49.309> our<00:00:49.489> juicer<00:00:49.940> because<00:00:50.179> it's

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
separates for our juicer because it's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.569 
separates for our juicer because it's
slow<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:51.379> actually<00:00:51.499> maintains<00:00:52.070> its<00:00:52.309> form

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
slow it actually maintains its form

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.770 
slow it actually maintains its form
you're<00:00:52.850> right<00:00:52.999> now<00:00:53.149> you're<00:00:53.329> feeding<00:00:53.539> the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
you're right now you're feeding the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.759 
you're right now you're feeding the
thing<00:00:53.960> celery<00:00:54.289> and<00:00:55.359> apples<00:00:56.359> and<00:00:56.839> how<00:00:57.649> does<00:00:57.710> it

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
thing celery and apples and how does it

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.560 
thing celery and apples and how does it
actually<00:00:57.890> tastes<00:00:58.370> well<00:00:58.879> it<00:00:59.059> tastes<00:00:59.329> like

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
actually tastes well it tastes like

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.200 
actually tastes well it tastes like
heaven<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.440> most<00:01:00.800> of<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.100> vitamins<00:01:01.609> nutrients

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
heaven a most of the vitamins nutrients

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.790 
heaven a most of the vitamins nutrients
that<00:01:02.390> are<00:01:02.449> already<00:01:02.690> extracted<00:01:03.230> in<00:01:03.499> the<00:01:03.589> juice

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
that are already extracted in the juice

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.340 
that are already extracted in the juice
so<00:01:04.370> if<00:01:04.550> you<00:01:04.699> could<00:01:04.909> grab<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.540> piece<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.050> put<00:01:06.110> in

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
let's see how easy this thing is to use

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.090 
let's see how easy this thing is to use
all<00:01:39.070> right<00:01:39.480> okay<00:01:40.480> so<00:01:40.960> it's<00:01:41.500> got<00:01:41.620> it<00:01:41.710> okay<00:01:41.950> we're

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
all right okay so it's got it okay we're

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.219 
all right okay so it's got it okay we're
turning<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.430> on<00:01:42.520> if<00:01:43.420> there's<00:01:43.720> two<00:01:43.900> there's<00:01:44.170> two
