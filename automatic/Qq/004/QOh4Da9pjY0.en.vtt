well I think that the fact that there's
a<00:00:50.910> conversation<00:00:51.600> about<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.610> there<00:00:53.610> are

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
a conversation about it and there are

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.240 
a conversation about it and there are
tools<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:55.020> know<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.620> make<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
tools out there that we know can make a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.310 
tools out there that we know can make a
difference<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.940> bridging<00:00:57.449> those<00:00:57.660> gaps<00:00:57.719> of
