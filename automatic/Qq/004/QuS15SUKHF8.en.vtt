that's the time difference between the
original<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> prequels<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
original like the prequels in the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.590 
original like the prequels in the
original<00:01:41.070> movie<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.299> would<00:01:42.390> make<00:01:42.420> sense

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
original movie so it would make sense

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.520 
original movie so it would make sense
but<00:01:43.259> all<00:01:44.100> I'm<00:01:44.310> saying<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.700> through<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
but all I'm saying is through the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.139 
but all I'm saying is through the
executive<00:01:46.530> producers<00:01:47.040> eyes<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.729> would

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
executive producers eyes and like would

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.030 
executive producers eyes and like would
it<00:01:48.270> bring<00:01:48.509> more<00:01:48.750> money<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.290> they<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.710> bring

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it bring more money if they can bring

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
it bring more money if they can bring
back<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.430> solo<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:52.110> probably

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
back on solo and I think that probably

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.170 
back on solo and I think that probably

back<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.730> not<00:03:10.850> having<00:03:11.330> those<00:03:11.660> actors<00:03:12.050> play

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
back and not having those actors play

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.440 
back and not having those actors play
them<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.709> think<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.640> question<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.269> like

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
them I think that the question is like

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.390 
them I think that the question is like
what<00:03:14.660> capacity<00:03:14.930> they<00:03:15.320> use<00:03:15.739> them<00:03:15.950> in<00:03:16.070> because

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
what capacity they use them in because

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.759 
what capacity they use them in because
I've<00:03:16.700> read<00:03:16.940> rumors<00:03:17.630> on<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.200> web<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.530> know<00:03:18.650> the

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
I've read rumors on the web you know the

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.729 
I've read rumors on the web you know the
most<00:03:19.100> reliable<00:03:19.340> sources<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.590> new

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
most reliable sources that that the new

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.590 
most reliable sources that that the new
movies<00:03:22.040> would<00:03:22.340> Center<00:03:22.880> entirely<00:03:23.420> around

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
movies would Center entirely around

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.509 
movies would Center entirely around
older<00:03:24.050> versions<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.470> these<00:03:24.590> characters<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.370> I

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
older versions of these characters and I

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.440 
older versions of these characters and I
don't<00:03:25.700> think<00:03:25.820> that<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.150> would<00:03:26.269> necessarily

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
don't think that that would necessarily

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.300 
don't think that that would necessarily
work<00:03:26.959> for<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.200> next<00:03:27.290> three<00:03:27.560> but<00:03:27.980> if<00:03:28.070> they<00:03:28.160> had

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
work for the next three but if they had

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.220 
work for the next three but if they had
them<00:03:28.430> back<00:03:28.580> as<00:03:28.730> mentors<00:03:29.239> or<00:03:29.480> even<00:03:29.840> just<00:03:29.870> you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
them back as mentors or even just you

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.470 
them back as mentors or even just you
know<00:03:30.380> as<00:03:30.620> secondary<00:03:31.340> characters<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.269> with<00:03:32.450> a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
know as secondary characters but with a

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.610 
know as secondary characters but with a
new<00:03:32.810> like<00:03:33.739> we're<00:03:34.959> missing<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.260> think<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.590> that

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
new like we're missing I think that that

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.470 
new like we're missing I think that that
at<00:03:36.920> least<00:03:37.100> four<00:03:37.280> star<00:03:37.459> wars<00:03:37.640> 7<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:38.120> i<00:03:38.209> think<00:03:38.300> it

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
at least four star wars 7 it i think it

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.460 
at least four star wars 7 it i think it
would<00:03:38.600> work<00:03:38.630> if<00:03:38.900> they<00:03:39.019> brought<00:03:39.200> all<00:03:39.380> the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
would work if they brought all the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.560 
would work if they brought all the
characters<00:03:39.830> in<00:03:39.920> in<00:03:40.220> one<00:03:40.489> aspect<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.330> maybe

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
characters in in one aspect and maybe

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.870 
characters in in one aspect and maybe
they<00:03:42.019> were<00:03:42.080> fostering<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:43.130> know<00:03:43.250> some<00:03:43.760> other

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
they were fostering you know some other

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.370 
they were fostering you know some other
younger<00:03:44.239> characters<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.840> will<00:03:44.989> become<00:03:45.049> more

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
younger characters that will become more

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.979 
younger characters that will become more
important<00:03:45.769> in<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.160> next<00:03:46.430> two<00:03:46.690> movies<00:03:47.690> well<00:03:47.959> I
