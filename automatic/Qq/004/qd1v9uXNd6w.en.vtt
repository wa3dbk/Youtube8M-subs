interesting<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> hard<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> start

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
interesting so was it hard to start

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.780 
interesting so was it hard to start
using<00:01:44.549> these<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:45.240> any<00:01:45.479> any<00:01:45.930> bumps<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> road

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
using these or any any bumps in the road

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.700 
using these or any any bumps in the road
implementing<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.909> technology<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:49.380> far<00:01:49.619> as

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
implementing this technology as far as

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.889 
implementing this technology as far as
the<00:01:49.829> smartphones<00:01:50.369> go<00:01:50.640> no<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> mean<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> know
