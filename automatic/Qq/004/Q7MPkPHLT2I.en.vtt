00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.160
 good welcome welcome to this 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.140
 mini research garden and 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.810
 training in intensive culture 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.460
 mesquite today what we are going to 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.739
 see let's see the preparation of the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.870
 bed the preparation of the bed 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.570
 so good cultivation let's see the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.180
 tools that we need and which ones 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.160
 are the characteristics and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.070
 considerations that we should have 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.489
 for 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.660
 to properly prepare our bed 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.989
 well our bed has to be 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.890
 oriented from north to south to take advantage 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.930
 of better shape especially the sun the sun 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.090
 that is going to come out of the east and is going to get 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.570
 in the west therefore the sun does 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.780
 this route and the plants will receive the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.700
 as much light as possible good 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.410
 because because we have different plants 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.270
 that demand more amounts of light and 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.479
 other less in the case of onions 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.720
 garlic demands up to 12 hours 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.690
 of light or in the corn minimum demand 8 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.399
 hours of light and good is better than that 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.440
 give the most light on everything 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.670
 so that the plants also grow 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.050
 one way couples well then our bed 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.619
 The first thing we are going to do is good 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.990
 mark it if there are different measures that 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.710
 We can use to prepare 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.930
 our beds our cameras we can 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.630
 measure from 150 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.200
 yes wide for the length that we 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.420
 We want or can be from 120 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.480
 which is what we should consider for 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.400
 for the width of the bed 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.280
 just at the time of stooping us and 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.740
 make cultivation weeding our 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.810
 hands should be touched at the moment 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.030
 that our hands touch us 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.660
 we can work in a more comfortable way 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.700
 he weeded our bed and that of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.209
 perform the different tasks of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.580
 cultivate well in this case our beds 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.180
 here in the orchard the mesquite in 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.090
 our beds are about 50 then 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.950
 let's mark it properly it's always 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.780
 important that we have marked our 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.910
 bed to be able to know this good 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.770
 dimensions when we are going to quantify 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.760
 returns or just to be 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.540
 see nice and nice we are not going to 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.569
 use is usually stakes 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.740
 I fell what 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.960
 and our sea 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.230
 Well, well, here I have the width of 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.819
 about 50 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.150
 yes and I'm going to start placing the 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.150
 stakes 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.299
 and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.580
 you always have to have finds our 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.659
 bed can be 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.090
 I repeat again the width and the length 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.920
 that we want or the dimensions 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.579
 we recommend that the bed be 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.310
 minimum of 120 wide especially for 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.140
 that the plants in the nearby planting 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.420
 can get to touch and form a 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.610
 microclimate if it is too narrow 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.500
 we will be imitating a little bit the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.140
 traditional agriculture of the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.019
 Groove agriculture therefore not 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.569
 there would be a that that bubble or that 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.000
 microclimate in the garden space 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.609
 you can have your garden start 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.010
 make your garden from from a 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.579
 square meter up to the dimension that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.620
 want if you look at these beds 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.590
 they have 10 square meters each 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.200
 we will do here is half bed 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.849
 good perfectly in half a bed 5 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.050
 square meters we can have and 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.020
 Grow the necessary food 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.750
 for a 10 12 percent of our 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.690
 very good diet since we have 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.820
 marked our bed put our 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.760
 stakes and put to our mecca and what 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.590
 we proceed to be a simple excavated in 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.250
 what is the simple excavation when 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.860
 we use the veil and what what 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.350
 we need to simply introduce the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.080
 wind in and then 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.570
 pull back to open the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.610
 first 30 centimeters of soil loosen 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.550
 I just recommend that if it is 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.940
 the first time they are going to prepare 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.580
 bed recommend you as you 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.880
 wetted three days before watering 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.730
 late at night and later 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.220
 if this one perform the perform the simple 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.020
 excavated 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.580
 in order that it will serve us to realize a 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.500
 first time the simple excavated then 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.270
 good to facilitate the desert to 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.750
 remove all the weeds and everything 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.030
 that later they will serve us for 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.360
 compost the technique of 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.540
 excavated is to introduce the good towards 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.960
 forward use the instep or arch 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.460
 of our foot without using the tip or 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.260
 the heel the intensive cultivation method 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.330
 recommends an ergonomic way a 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.030
 way to learn to dig without 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.820
 hurting our bodies without hurting 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.120
 our back always dig with the 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.640
 back right and loosen what I'm going to 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.340
 to do is that I simply am 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:47.960
 pushing forward my weight and 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.320
 loosening back 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.810
 this is the basic technique already in conformity 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.480
 go acquire the skill is good 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.660
 perform this technique is going to be more 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.970
 more simple 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.610
 once the simple excavation is done 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.890
 the entire bed or we do not proceed to weeding 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.560
 to remove all the herbs I would 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.050
 I recommend that we leave the roots 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.330
 the roots are going to give structure to 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.390
 soil the roots also contain 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.490
 some microorganisms some fungi 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.550
 how good they are or what 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.010
 transform the transport them 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.230
 nutrients to the plants if we go to 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.630
 remove the herbs I recommend you 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.080
 we go collecting them in a bunch and 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.980
 later they will serve us for 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.980
 prepare the compost 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.930
 once taken to our bed 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:58.120
 we proceed to match the one bit with 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.500
 the 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.320
 with the rake mostly breaking 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.979
 some lumps of soil that is very 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.979
 tight 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.780
 and especially to facilitate 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.599
 following tasks that we are going to carry out 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.610
 for the preparation of our bed 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:26.580
 let's remember good let's review what 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.490
 we made the bed marked with stakes and 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.979
 I fell what the measures the good the ideal 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.139
 It would be about 50 but from 120 to one meter 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:36.590
 the size is fine what you 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:40.289
 decide from one square meter 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:43.439
 subsequently weeding open to be a 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:46.169
 simple excavated moistening return to 

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:48.870
 moisten to facilitate and we have 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:53.599
 our bed ready for later 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.599
 grow our food thank you
