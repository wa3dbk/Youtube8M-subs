00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.990
 we'll take this one 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.090
 Pathogens have the first hurdle 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.349
 overcome the immune defenses and are 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.330
 now in our body 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.820
 now is the task of the defense system 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.739
 to recognize these little louts and as 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.510
 Immediate help the right defensive cells 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.519
 the non-specific immune defense too 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.650
 activate short repetition to the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.140
 Non-specific defense cells include the 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.210
 following white blood cells 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.519
 granulocyte monocytes are the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.500
 precursor of macrophage dendritic 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.449
 cells mast cells and natural 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.100
 killer cells all of which except the 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.199
 last two favorites so 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.019
 Mouth cells are the enclosing exciters 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.879
 and then solve the most common 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.400
 Defensive cells of unspecific defense 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.960
 the neutrophilic granulocytes are the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.610
 most of whom recognize them 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.470
 the exciters often first and 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.360
 enclose digest and destroy them 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.490
 the granulocytes are replaced by this 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.830
 defense process stimulated and pour 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.960
 cytokines from these hormone-like 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.939
 Messengers reach the blood vessels of the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.689
 environment and make you feel yourself 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.400
 expand 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.290
 thereby the blood circulation at the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.930
 infected place and it comes to 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.700
 typical redness at the infection center now 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.890
 ground were the cells from the vascular 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.869
 cytokines in the environment depend on these 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.030
 Cytokines are chemotaxis 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.780
 the curls other white blood cells 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.820
 on 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.950
 In addition, the vascular cells form a kind 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.359
 barb for master blood corpuscles 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.460
 she at the infected place 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.200
 to hold on to the arrested whites 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.969
 Blood cells can get through now 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.549
 gaps between the vascular cells for 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.840
 infection site by squeezing 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.569
 in addition to liquid 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.219
 infection called the weir text and it 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.619
 for the swelling at the infection 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.990
 responsible also contains the exotic 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.939
 components of the complementary system that 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.100
 There are many different types of eggs 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.289
 in a kind of chain reaction each other 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.539
 activate and in different ways 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.190
 Proceed against pathogens if this 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.200
 system for example by contact with 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.580
 the pathogen has been activated it moves 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.980
 including a distribution of 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.540
 Histamine is in masses of histamine 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.850
 also a main messenger 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.650
 allergic reactions and it expands 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.080
 also the blood vessels and so provides 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.970
 for that more people so white 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.770
 Blood cells to the infected area 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.900
 so far was the only task 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.760
 of the defense system so many defensive cells 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.310
 as possible to the place of infection too 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.290
 bring 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.180
 Now the system of complements begins with 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.430
 the next step of defense and indeed 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.590
 it marks the invaders in the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.420
 particles of the system appear like protein 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.670
 their surface to bring this 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.080
 process is called whether the renovation 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.430
 Marked exciters can now 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.200
 faster and easier from the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.400
 scavenger sensed and destroyed 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.410
 In addition, this can be 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.569
 Compensation system some year direct 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.250
 destroy it by perforating it with the 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.230
 time come more defense cells 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.910
 infected tissue underneath tissue 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.580
 macrophages and dendritic cells 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.530
 tissue macro questions are the cells 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.140
 have evolved from a month 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.280
 possess dendritic cells 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.290
 Branches on their surface like 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.480
 However, they have a nerve cell 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.519
 a completely different task the macrophages 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.680
 and dendritic cells divide 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.140
 to be a new defense mechanism and 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.670
 Although the antigenic presentation these two 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.650
 Mammals possess the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.269
 ability of the antigen of the annihilated 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.890
 to present the exciter 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.900
 that means after having the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.459
 have destroyed invaders show them 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.380
 be antigenic to certain 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.239
 protein complexes on their own 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.150
 surface one distinguishes two 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.519
 different protein complexes in hc 1 and 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.290
 mhc 2 these are two, so to speak 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.140
 different presenter for 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.359
 the antigenic mhc stands for major hisste 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.760
 Compatibility complex in German there 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.170
 the main compatibility complex no 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.760
 afraid it just does not understand 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.739
 Just remember that there are two 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.840
 different protein complex at the 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.480
 surface of the dendritic cells 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.150
 and that on these protein complexes the 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.370
 why are they presented? 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.079
 important is we explain you later 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.480
 antigen presenting macrophages 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.910
 stay on the infected cell and the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.100
 Dendritic cells migrate into the tissue 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.620
 there are large quantities waiting for the active ones 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.329
 t and b lymphocytes of the specific 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.489
 defend against the dendritic cells 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.859
 there now exactly the t and b lymphocytes 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.500
 find the antigen of the pathogen 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.600
 fit this antigen presentation forms 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.800
 So the transition between 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.360
 Unspecific and specific defense 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.220
 and that's the topic of the next one 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.020
 videos playlist so stay tuned 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.789
 there you see how the specific 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.110
 defense system works if I am one 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.940
 little more about pathogens 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.539
 then you want to click on this 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.310
 video here 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.810
 There we explain everything to you around 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.640
 aids and haifa on how this disease 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.930
 is transferred and how to get on 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.789
 best protects against it 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.120
 Three people stay healthy until then and 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.120
 ciao
