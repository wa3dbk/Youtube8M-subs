00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
and we're using the hand because dr. dan

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.069 
and we're using the hand because dr. dan
Siegel<00:00:29.189> has<00:00:29.579> helped<00:00:29.970> us<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:30.360> of<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> hand

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
Siegel has helped us think of the hand

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.350 
Siegel has helped us think of the hand
as<00:00:31.349> being<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> brain<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.120> other<00:00:33.239> parts

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
as being like the brain and other parts

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.130 
as being like the brain and other parts
of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> brain<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.280> bullying<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
of the brain so bullying what is it it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.210 
of the brain so bullying what is it it
is<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:38.000> repeated<00:00:39.000> offense<00:00:39.680> against<00:00:40.680> others

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
is a repeated offense against others

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.110 
is a repeated offense against others
it's<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> relational<00:00:42.390> power<00:00:43.100> struggle<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
it's a relational power struggle and it

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.420 
it's a relational power struggle and it
happens<00:00:45.780> when<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.290> repeated<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.220> it's

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
happens when it's repeated and it's

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
happens when it's repeated and it's
intentional<00:00:48.330> now<00:00:48.960> what<00:00:49.170> happens<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
intentional now what happens in the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.040 
intentional now what happens in the
brain<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.970> important<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.780> us<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
brain is really important for us all to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.350 
brain is really important for us all to
know<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:52.770> scientists<00:00:53.400> are<00:00:53.610> showing<00:00:54.180> us

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
know because scientists are showing us

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
know because scientists are showing us
just<00:00:54.390> how<00:00:54.750> bad<00:00:55.260> bullying<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.700> brain

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
just how bad bullying is for the brain

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.870 
just how bad bullying is for the brain
and<00:00:57.240> I'm<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.900> show<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> where<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.310> how

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
and I'm going to show you where and how

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.600 
and I'm going to show you where and how
it<00:01:00.240> affects<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.900> brain<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.860> we<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.100> colored

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
it affects the brain so we have colored

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.759 
it affects the brain so we have colored
the<00:01:02.970> hand<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.720> in<00:01:03.870> different<00:01:04.079> colors<00:01:04.320> for

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the hand here in different colors for

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.950 
the hand here in different colors for
you<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.009> get<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> idea<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:06.509> are<00:01:06.600> three

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you to get the idea that there are three

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.859 
you to get the idea that there are three
big<00:01:07.290> parts<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> brain<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.850> oldest<00:01:09.600> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
big parts of the brain the oldest and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.410 
big parts of the brain the oldest and
the<00:01:09.960> inside<00:01:10.590> deepest<00:01:11.189> part<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.850> red<00:01:12.090> part

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the inside deepest part is this red part

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.050 
the inside deepest part is this red part
which<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.229> responsible<00:01:13.679> for<00:01:14.100> our<00:01:14.340> heart<00:01:14.670> rate

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
which is responsible for our heart rate

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.959 
which is responsible for our heart rate
and<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.659> our<00:01:15.749> breathing<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:17.130> next<00:01:17.460> part

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
and for our breathing the next part

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.270 
and for our breathing the next part
within<00:01:18.569> the<00:01:18.749> brain<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.289> this<00:01:19.499> green<00:01:19.890> part

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
within the brain is this green part

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.819 
within the brain is this green part
which<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.549> our<00:01:20.939> emotional<00:01:21.719> or<00:01:21.899> limbic<00:01:22.409> system

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
which is our emotional or limbic system

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.160 
which is our emotional or limbic system
and<00:01:22.979> our<00:01:23.460> limbic<00:01:24.030> system<00:01:24.539> is<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.899> gets

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and our limbic system is what gets

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.889 
and our limbic system is what gets
driven<00:01:25.649> when<00:01:26.399> we<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:27.090> troubles<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
driven when we have troubles and

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.599 
driven when we have troubles and
relationships<00:01:28.679> and<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.130> get<00:01:29.310> bullied

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
relationships and when we get bullied

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.300 
relationships and when we get bullied
what<00:01:29.999> happens<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:31.170> limbic<00:01:31.829> system

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
what happens is that limbic system

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.309 
what happens is that limbic system
releases<00:01:32.639> all<00:01:33.030> kinds<00:01:33.719> of<00:01:33.749> different

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
releases all kinds of different

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.849 
releases all kinds of different
transmitters<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> chemicals<00:01:36.179> that<00:01:36.600> affect

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
transmitters and chemicals that affect

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.039 
transmitters and chemicals that affect
how<00:01:37.859> your<00:01:38.249> blue<00:01:38.700> part<00:01:39.179> of<00:01:39.359> the<00:01:39.420> brain<00:01:39.749> on<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
how your blue part of the brain on the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.550 
how your blue part of the brain on the
top<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.950> thinking<00:01:41.579> part<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.389> function<00:01:42.959> so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
top the thinking part can function so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.940 
top the thinking part can function so
when<00:01:43.770> kids<00:01:44.100> are<00:01:44.340> bullied<00:01:45.179> we<00:01:45.719> know<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
when kids are bullied we know that that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.699 
when kids are bullied we know that that
emotional<00:01:47.880> brain<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.539> sending<00:01:49.289> out<00:01:49.439> signals

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
emotional brain is sending out signals

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.910 
emotional brain is sending out signals
to<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.520> protecting<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.170> fact<00:01:52.439> when<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
to be protecting but in fact when it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.480 
to be protecting but in fact when it
happens<00:01:53.429> over<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.060> over<00:01:54.209> again<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.869> actually

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
happens over and over again it actually

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.609 
happens over and over again it actually
damages<00:01:56.490> parts<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> brain<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.959> during

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
damages parts of the brain and during

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.029 
damages parts of the brain and during
that<00:01:58.770> process<00:01:59.069> the<00:01:59.310> kids<00:01:59.819> cannot<00:02:00.569> think<00:02:01.039> so

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
that process the kids cannot think so

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.069 
that process the kids cannot think so
what<00:02:02.219> happens<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.909> us<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.270> parents<00:02:03.600> our
