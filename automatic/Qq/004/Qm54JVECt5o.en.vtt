00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
monster originally I thought maybe they

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.499 
monster originally I thought maybe they
might<00:01:22.290> be<00:01:22.560> trying<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> game<00:01:23.909> similar<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the 3ds and the other for the Wii U but

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.260 
the 3ds and the other for the Wii U but
I<00:01:30.540> couldn't<00:01:31.259> figure<00:01:31.650> out<00:01:31.799> why<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:33.000> do

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
I couldn't figure out why they would do

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.420 
I couldn't figure out why they would do
this<00:01:33.570> sure<00:01:34.170> there's<00:01:34.439> potential<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.250> Wii

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this sure there's potential for the Wii

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.330 
this sure there's potential for the Wii
U<00:01:35.729> game<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.299> far<00:01:36.720> better<00:01:36.770> graphics<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
U game to have far better graphics but I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.120 
U game to have far better graphics but I
mean<00:01:38.610> who<00:01:38.880> cares<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.869> would<00:01:39.960> likely<00:01:40.290> cost<00:01:40.710> more

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
mean who cares it would likely cost more

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700 
mean who cares it would likely cost more
and<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.670> wouldn't<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.450> portable<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.409> thought

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and it wouldn't be portable a thought

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.030 
and it wouldn't be portable a thought
does<00:01:44.220> occur<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> me<00:01:44.880> though<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.899> wii<00:01:46.079> u<00:01:46.409> isn't

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
does occur to me though the wii u isn't

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.399 
does occur to me though the wii u isn't
doing<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.640> well<00:01:47.820> as<00:01:47.880> Nintendo<00:01:48.720> would<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.229> it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
doing as well as Nintendo would like it

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.819 
doing as well as Nintendo would like it
to<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.979> has<00:01:50.310> probably<00:01:51.030> crossed<00:01:51.780> their<00:01:52.110> minds

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
to it has probably crossed their minds

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.399 
to it has probably crossed their minds
making<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.490> Pokemon<00:01:54.060> game<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.689> their<00:01:54.869> console

making a Pokemon game for their console

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.859 
making a Pokemon game for their console
might<00:01:55.829> help<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.430> greatly<00:01:57.000> well<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
might help it out greatly well I have a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
might help it out greatly well I have a
hard<00:01:58.200> time<00:01:58.439> believing<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:59.130> these<00:01:59.280> games

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
hard time believing that these games

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.929 
hard time believing that these games
would<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.270> standalone<00:02:01.130> generation<00:02:02.130> 7<00:02:02.579> wii<00:02:02.759> u
