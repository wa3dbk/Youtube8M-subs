hey<00:00:01.140> lands<00:00:01.860> here<00:00:01.979> again<00:00:02.220> part<00:00:02.879> 2<00:00:03.030> on<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.810> box

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
hey lands here again part 2 on the box

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.730 
hey lands here again part 2 on the box
ultrasonic<00:00:04.920> trying<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.790> get<00:00:05.910> through<00:00:06.649> many<00:00:07.649> of

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
ultrasonic trying to get through many of

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.030 
ultrasonic trying to get through many of
the<00:00:07.799> features<00:00:07.950> as<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.309> can<00:00:08.809> the<00:00:09.809> with<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.769> video

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
the features as I can the with the video

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.120 
the features as I can the with the video
so<00:00:12.049> waking<00:00:13.049> Chester<00:00:13.349> was<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> source<00:00:14.009> and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
so waking Chester was the source and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.930 
so waking Chester was the source and
circuit<00:00:14.519> coupled<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.660> bass<00:00:16.529> boost<00:00:16.940> so

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
circuit coupled with the bass boost so

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.120 
circuit coupled with the bass boost so
going<00:00:18.210> into<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> repeater<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.010> said

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
going into the repeater this like I said

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.250 
going into the repeater this like I said
earlier<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.789> more<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.750> hear<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:22.020> like

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
earlier is more of what you hear on like

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.560 
earlier is more of what you hear on like
an<00:00:22.350> older<00:00:22.619> style<00:00:23.150> Hammond

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.450 

so<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.990> knob<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.010> variable

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
so the knob here is just a variable

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
so the knob here is just a variable
speed<00:00:32.450> she<00:00:33.450> gets<00:00:33.660> pretty<00:00:33.899> psychedelic<00:00:34.469> sound

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
speed she gets pretty psychedelic sound

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
speed she gets pretty psychedelic sound
stuff<00:00:45.680> where<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.280> know<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.610> more

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
stuff where you go you know for more

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.369 
stuff where you go you know for more
traditional<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:48.329> musical<00:00:48.840> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.170> style

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
traditional more musical kind of style

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.930 
traditional more musical kind of style
where<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.860> sounds<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.550> bit<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.879> that

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
where it sounds a little bit like that

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.569 
where it sounds a little bit like that
tremolo<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:54.559> prefer<00:00:55.559> somewhere<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
tremolo I prefer somewhere kind in the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:10.300 
tremolo I prefer somewhere kind in the
middle

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.300 

so<00:01:11.310> that's<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> repeater<00:01:12.710> one<00:01:13.710> other<00:01:13.980> really

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
so that's the repeater one other really

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.300 
so that's the repeater one other really
cool<00:01:14.610> feature<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.120> this<00:01:15.330> guitar<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
cool feature on this guitar is the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.380 
cool feature on this guitar is the
