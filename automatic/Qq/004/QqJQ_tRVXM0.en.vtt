design<00:01:10.740> options<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.610> those<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
design options so those are the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 
design options so those are the
instructions<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.170> we're<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> start

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
instructions and we're going to start

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.870 
instructions and we're going to start
with<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:15.330> squares<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.490> one<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.640> wrong

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
with two squares that are one is wrong

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
with two squares that are one is wrong
side<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.299> ones<00:01:18.540> right<00:01:18.810> side<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.439> going

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
side up ones right side up that's going

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.160 
side up ones right side up that's going
to<00:01:19.650> give<00:01:19.770> us<00:01:19.920> our<00:01:20.070> mirror<00:01:20.580> image<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.170> we're

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to give us our mirror image and we're

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.530 
to give us our mirror image and we're
going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.409> cut<00:01:22.890> using<00:01:23.460> our<00:01:23.549> 60-degree<00:01:24.180> ruler

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
going to cut using our 60-degree ruler

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
going to cut using our 60-degree ruler
we've<00:01:25.170> lined<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.710> up<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.729> we're<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> be

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
we've lined this up so we're going to be

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.940 
we've lined this up so we're going to be
cutting<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> diagonal<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.799> we'll

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
cutting this on the diagonal then we'll

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.890 
cutting this on the diagonal then we'll
rotate<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:30.000> why<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.390> working

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
rotate it and that's why I like working

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.109 
rotate it and that's why I like working
at<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> Brooklyn<00:01:31.710> revolver<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.430> we're<00:01:33.000> going

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
at the Brooklyn revolver and we're going

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.539 
at the Brooklyn revolver and we're going
to<00:01:33.150> cut<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> diagonal<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> gives<00:01:35.280> us

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
to cut on that diagonal that gives us

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.240 
to cut on that diagonal that gives us
four<00:01:36.119> pieces<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.009> same<00:01:38.189> shape

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
four pieces that are all the same shape

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.120 
four pieces that are all the same shape
and<00:01:38.900> they<00:01:39.900> will<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.200> able<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.860> laid<00:01:41.100> out

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and they will be able to be laid out

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.760 
and they will be able to be laid out
into<00:01:41.909> blocks

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
into blocks

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.109 
into blocks
pulling<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> combinations<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> want

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
pulling the combinations that you want

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.990 
pulling the combinations that you want
and<00:01:45.649> being<00:01:46.649> able<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> make<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> block<00:01:47.790> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
and being able to make the block that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.210 
and being able to make the block that
you<00:01:48.149> want<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.079> we'll<00:01:49.229> sew<00:01:49.409> those<00:01:49.590> together<00:01:49.770> in

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you want and we'll sew those together in

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.819 
you want and we'll sew those together in
pairs<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.420> pair's<00:01:51.659> together<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
pairs so the pair's together and that

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.789 
pairs so the pair's together and that
gives<00:01:53.040> us<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.250> block<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.520> looks<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.000> this

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
gives us a block that looks like this

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.469 
gives us a block that looks like this
this<00:01:55.799> piece<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.399> need<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.670> square<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
this piece we now need to square up and

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
this piece we now need to square up and
we're<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.049> use<00:01:58.290> our<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.649> dot<00:01:59.040> to

on<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.040> dot<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.830> that's<00:02:32.010> how<00:02:32.160> easy<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
on the dot so that's how easy the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.460 
on the dot so that's how easy the
chameleon<00:02:33.000> pattern<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.569> thanks<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.230> joining
