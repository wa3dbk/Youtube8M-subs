00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:05.899
 Hello everyone, Meshuggah we today 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:07.360
 play the sand Germans again 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.309
 later 2g 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.299
 light tank of the third level we are 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.720
 on chemistry on ensk will be level 3 well 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.450
 top hit himself and his preferential terms 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.230
 while we are leaving now I will tell by 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.130
 the gun is three centimeters m to 103 very 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.560
 not bad 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.990
 cluster machine gun as you see ninety 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.010
 five breaks this is very, very much 30 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.379
 podkalibery damage there are 110 penetration 30 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.160
 damage but they rarely come in handy i 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.480
 I drive 30 pieces here 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.850
 by the way we have cassette tapes here 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.070
 We are here as we see three volleys and 2 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.480
 bullets in each ie we all have 6 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.359
 bullets bullets a6 to 30 damage on average 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.960
 180 damage from one 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:05.750
 the drum is unlikely to take anyone but 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.700
 wounded animal can be quite a pick plus 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.040
 we have great just to punch and for 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.500
 your level and here in battles 3 levels and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.740
 In general, all we sew at any angle but 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.690
 the only limitations are all too 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.950
 a350 there or 380 meters for all 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.450
 automatic guns and therefore fight 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.360
 we will have mostly on medium and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.940
 close distances the main difference is for 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.090
 2g from grooves 1c is that we have 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.690
 frontal armor of 30 centimeters but 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.260
 millimeters i.e. these are the grooves 1c in 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.180
 They have diamond does not penetrate at all and 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.190
 stick to them album at an angle and they 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.530
 we will not be punched to break through there for 30 seconds 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.480
 penny gold 40 that is, if we 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.760
 let's be about like a diamond to them 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.930
 keep punching and they have no way 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.520
 can't we are here here 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:01.210
 Su-76 is pretty good tandem 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.540
 It turns out and now I do not decide yet 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.570
 head on and get out on sneeze x38 they me 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.729
 just struck and the lesson was me a little but 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.280
 Here 's a sneeze and yawn at once all three 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.230
 his cassette two shells issued and how 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.380
 see you expect a long recharge 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.989
 16 seconds here in this recharge lies 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.540
 the main difficulty of the game on this tank 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.050
 tank dynamics in principle quite good but 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.840
 much weaker in z rio or ass 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.730
 we are significantly slower and so plus 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.360
 long recharge when we are perfectly 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.269
 helpless 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.690
 Well, as you can see, I completely disassembled and 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.390
 ms 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.300
 38 it was not difficult to break through but 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.640
 This I absorbed one splash from him on 40 and 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.489
 here it starts interestingly look 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.070
 I'm here on one side of 1 is running out 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.260
 whom our sovzvodnye prodamazhil with 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.920
 such a dribbling ltp yes beer there still 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.610
 somewhere its a marder and here I am trying 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.150
 somehow survive well we arrived in time 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.040
 drummer that LTP prodamazhil and how 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.510
 see he managed to survive there though 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.620
 five of my shells went into suran 150 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.900
 damage here Mordor begins 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.570
 me to press this jersey and with a platoon 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.390
 so he killed faster 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.060
 at-1 inside as you can see goes to deuce 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.450
 and so it does as I have requested now 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.630
 my soul I leave he as you see to 2 i 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.970
 I almost got 180 just drank the whole 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.030
 cassette realized with damage and at the same time 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.799
 even managed to grab him as you see 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.190
 the main difficulty of this tank is that 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.480
 you need to understand where you will be for 16 minutes 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.750
 be in seva 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.700
 at the same time, far from opponents 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.700
 it will turn out because of bad dynamics 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.829
 sit out sit in the corner behind the building 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.859
 in nsk very very good 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.750
 quite a working moment well, that's all 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.379
 we kind of disassembled pay attention 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.170
 how many corpses then two three three 4 5 he there 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.000
 still probably somewhere 6 further and almost all 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.310
 put literal or intercourse 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.989
 feasible help but as we see it all 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.390
 the rest have already merged bt-7 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.849
 there he is standing there most likely of a cage 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.099
 did not stay in cm pak 40 flocks and frag 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.739
 very dangerous opponent of good and on 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.079
 enske and here and currency review is wrong 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.449
 very critical because here we are 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.440
 get away the corners ourselves, too, sow 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:28.199
 if that's what you can observe the dynamics 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.680
 how he su-76 overtook me now 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.870
 only catch up starting node40 approximate 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.970
 more or less scored and so here is the food well 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.250
 Here we lit pak40 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.160
 fortunately he was already shot here 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.330
 sovzvodny gets and here we have 2 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.849
 board 7 frags 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.250
 only cruiser cruiser 43 remains 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.880
 percent and i'm suspicious creeps in 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:54.690
 that, too, of a cage is not worth it 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.990
 driving ahead and now we have it here 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.130
 notice but here he is seen see lighted 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.610
 in sniper scope 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.430
 that does not twitch and shirt and platoon 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.800
 so that he gets up to capture what we just 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.320
 so here we will ride again 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.990
 such a present under the tree under a bush 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.970
 more precisely we decided to farm 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.630
 invader but not to disappear the same 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.789
 opportunity 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:23.669
 they just stand by and control him 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:28.099
 just in case but even turn on 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:32.780
 fast playback here for now 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:34.919
 syrochek chatting does not mean ok 38 caught fire 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.110
 can read if you have nothing to do 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.740
 not 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.910
 ticked entry taking this frag and look 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.860
 afterwards you want 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.900
 I did it here to inflict whole 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:51.110
 800 2 damage I received 676 experience 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.680
 who is generally primal of course although here in 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.540
 Basically basically 3 second level 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.550
 naturally and in principle it was enough 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.340
 to obtain a master sign klassnosti 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.290
 also we took the medal to the platoon brothers 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.290
 in arms 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.090
 convened there is still something grabbed and in 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.660
 Overall if we talk about the tank there is quite 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.340
 yourself fit if you choose which 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:16.670
 car to go further along this thread I would 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.590
 recommended you grooves 2g since 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.430
 there are no problems with breaking through 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.320
 the problem is where to wait out your drum and in 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.950
 principle to cope with this problem 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.400
 much easier than with a bad breakthrough but 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:34.550
 good speed if you take in 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.650
 platoon still a couple of such grooves 2g then in 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.710
 the drum damage principle is enough for you 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.890
 to pick up almost any target 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:45.440
 down to level five if you take tts 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:49.250
 the most enjoyable moment of breaking through 90 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:53.660
 even enough to fight with KV1 in the forehead 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:55.760
 principle it can be pierced and principle 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.440
 you can even not use gold and 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.770
 take yourself here but it is not for me 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.770
 In principle, the tanchik was useful, but not bad 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.840
 farm it like that 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.790
 rather doubtful occupation easier 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.430
 take a car like anti fifth level or 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:14.090
 6 there and damage can cause more and 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.890
 inflicts itself somehow simpler than on 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.960
 third but the machine itself is pretty 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.020
 same fan as I said before 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.010
 plus it is a battle that protects against 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.880
 automatic guns of the same 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:28.040
 groove 1c and in principle on this pros well 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.140
 along with breaking through on these pluses 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.420
 run out pretty pretty 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.810
 not bad someone can leave in the hangar 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:39.680
 fan in the sand if there is no 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:42.980
 Primov and I perhaps passed and selling in 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.140
 principle not a cactus and passes quite 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.780
 still fun thank you for your attention and good luck 

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.780
 to you in battles and see you soon bye
