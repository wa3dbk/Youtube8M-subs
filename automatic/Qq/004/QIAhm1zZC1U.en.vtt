00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.840 
different um
I<00:01:35.679> think<00:01:36.679> because<00:01:37.670> it's<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.240> true<00:01:38.810> story<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.850> I

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
I think because it's a true story and I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.980 
I think because it's a true story and I
think<00:01:41.209> that<00:01:41.360> makes<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:42.490> very<00:01:43.490> big<00:01:43.609> difference

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
think that makes a very big difference

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.099 
think that makes a very big difference
because<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:46.159> director<00:01:46.609> he's<00:01:47.179> he's<00:01:47.840> the

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
because the director he's he's the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.499 
because the director he's he's the
scriptwriter<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.009> then<00:01:49.369> it's<00:01:49.819> his<00:01:50.030> own<00:01:50.209> story

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
scriptwriter and then it's his own story

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.059 
scriptwriter and then it's his own story
