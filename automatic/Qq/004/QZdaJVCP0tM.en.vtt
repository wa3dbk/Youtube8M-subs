00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 I'll play to fix this 4 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.560
 while she can not see a bad one there 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.690
 snow in the middle of the table without 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
 pay the requested amount in gansu jan only 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 I wanted to charge 900 paulo to change the screen 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.809
 He said I bought this bottle. 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.240
 here on the internet just over 100 reais 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.820
 I saw a crazy doing and I say crazy 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 because if you move the phone to the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.689
 text without knowledge you have to be 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.480
 kind of crazy then here to prove it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.580
 a stylus palette a business card 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 credit card credit will go with 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.630
 The win I'll try to do I think 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.170
 I think I can do how to do the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.380
 what 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.950
 I already called metallica I already know mello and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950
 rue cell 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.480
 the first step is to remove the battery from the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.820
 cell phone is fine but this was a deal 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.820
 here's the heat that's going to stay 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.020
 not to get a boring video of a 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.780
 Accelerated there but I held three 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.390
 the white dryer because it does not 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.860
 would start madness by undoing and 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:32.250
 come here I do not know if it will improve or 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:34.479
 getting worse is very cheap, right? 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.729
 Sometimes the stylus does not have to be a mistake. 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:43.890
 already donated this is not happening 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.890
 a little more just for guarantee 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.760
 I confess that I am well and anxious in 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.150
 relation to this process 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.610
 the average fear I have with s3 here 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.170
 theo but I'll talk to him 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.170
 said it only broke four more 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.060
 I just do not have three arms, did not see it. 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.540
 here sometimes I put a hairdryer in the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.190
 mouth led the sector here is not the ideal is 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.140
 making the team 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.140
 A tractor depends on how you will be alone. 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.900
 the staff thinks I fucked up 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.610
 ugly dona here that will be forever 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.800
 now that it is a risk that within the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.750
 is this could not have happened 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.460
 to create a risk forever in the queue 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.460
 his but God 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.580
 I 'm sorry I did it alone. 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.860
 I already ruined typing on him. 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.860
 The stretch does what? 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.640
 I just took it so it scares it open like this 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.070
 here is the risk that the spindle here 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.390
 but the rene tries to clean now sad 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.390
 this sad risk 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.290
 I'm not trying to make the risk is 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.290
 trying to pull glue 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.780
 on this screen is very scratch resistant 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:10.200
 you need a stylus to get 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:12.050
 scale as glass cleaner with a 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.490
 A little patience is coming out 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.180
 removing all glue I just did not take the 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.610
 the prison of lamb you 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.830
 rope 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:27.420
 doing this, you already were pole and such 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.820
 Doing this here I do not recommend for 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:35.820
 none of my friends is in being fat 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.140
 nor do it here the bug just to see 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.540
 a glance if you play a little bit for 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.090
 force the bag into the circuit 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.070
 open then beauty counted with leave 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.010
 of rue here to scare away the evil eye 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.200
 and concentration a look not to 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.510
 break the screen again and concentration 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.370
 do not stay here one more 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.990
 the screen has is completely flat 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.280
 when you finish because otherwise the 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.500
 time you put the glass porcelain 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.570
 But I think this is kind of obvious right. 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.790
 I just did not fall apart 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:08.430
 very happy we're drying michael 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:20.400
 jackson 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:24.480
 we're almost there taking that risk 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:45.120
 that i did it digital the psychologist 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:48.740
 also the following was relatively 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.540
 well taking that risk I did in it 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.360
 ok here you can see that too I 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.100
 I think when I put kite will 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.860
 improve well and forgot fernandÃ£o 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.150
 he who is also by force and such I will 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.870
 put the battery now and see what 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.050
 happens 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:08.640
 this is the end result now people 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:12.600
 will see if he wins no more 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:17.420
 so the video because my chip offers 13 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.420
 to play hot air band.com.br
