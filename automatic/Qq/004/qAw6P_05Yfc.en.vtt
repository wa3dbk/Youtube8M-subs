00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.189
 I have been a nature facilitator for five years 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.259
 holidays oblige the sign of the mill 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.599
 Fightbach offers a home to re-read 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.310
 for 6 to 12 years old and benjamin organizes 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.619
 activities around the theme of 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.640
 huts so this week is going to be in 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.830
 several times because there is a 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.239
 discovery about how animals do 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.460
 blow huts the kids are going 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.900
 discover a little what it all 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.580
 they use as materials etc 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.350
 can we use the earth to 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.839
 to make huts how to wetting 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.830
 the earth what does it give the 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.019
 mud is standing what can we 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.250
 make 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.320
 you can spread it out and then she 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.580
 dried 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.900
 here we have a bit like cement you have 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.799
 reason we can call it daub 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.059
 also and that you may be able to 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.100
 used this week by building 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.540
 your cabin then the children spend there 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.409
 will therefore participate in a construction of 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.210
 huts so they will try 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.880
 to learn to reuse what they have 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.710
 learned and in a last time and ben 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.000
 they will take advantage of these huts where they 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.680
 will go see a little bit elsewhere how 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 it's happening and all that so it's a 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.549
 thematic a little broad 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.340
 fun that allows children to 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.920
 really here's discovering this case around 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.450
 from them and visualize this nature and 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.340
 especially to appreciate it too is for 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.650
 give some kind of contact with this 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.510
 nature actually today the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.760
 urban spaces is intensifying and our 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.130
 links with the nature of the mini the role 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.280
 of a nature facilitator and therefore to recreate 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.110
 of contact between nature by composing 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.400
 a number of the activities 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.040
 activities they can be done at 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.870
 garden on the theme of the garden 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.070
 natural 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.210
 how to grow flowers 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.850
 and plants and vegetables and see 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.100
 fruit without pesticides 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.020
 we can do activities around 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.630
 hives since we have bees 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 so understand what it's like 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.790
 hive how does it work 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.460
 the importance of a bee we can go 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.799
 on the land at the edge of the marshes or at 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.929
 stream edge see all the little 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.099
 wildlife that binds to teeth in marshes 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.560
 then obviously we have microscope 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.140
 binocular loupe a whole bunch of 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.200
 teaching materials to make a whole 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.120
 heap of scientific activities your heart 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.060
 business and to escape near it 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.609
 discover and but let's say in some 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.920
 so and protected so it's a small 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.420
 little the three big aspects also of 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.010
 environmental education in 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.930
 discovering that's how we like it 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.609
 nature and that's how we go 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.920
 protect her is the big three 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.719
 things we want to bring to the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.579
 children doing our job 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.700
 whether in the school setting or 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.579
 in the leisure environment when we talk 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.219
 of environment we are not talking about 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.069
 the thur we talk about it of course but we 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:59.560
 also talk about transportation we talk about 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.799
 waste we talk about energy 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.989
 we talk about landscapes we talk about quality 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.900
 water we talk about pollution here we are 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.909
 do not speak only of trees and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.900
 animals have of course a planet 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:17.529
 small that we must share and we 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.109
 are here all passing on earth on 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:23.319
 inherited the nature of those who have us 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.239
 preceded and we will transmit it to 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.040
 our children and to our grandchildren and to 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.870
 all who will follow this 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.879
 transmission can not be improvised 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.059
 nature facilitator to own some 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.370
 qualities patience listened to each other 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:38.529
 all a job of contact so must 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.969
 really keep pace with everyone 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:42.340
 because we will see children too 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.650
 well two three four years that as soon 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.389
 than the high school students of the primaries 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.139
 college students should not be afraid of 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.359
 speaking in public 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.249
 we will talk about insects as well as 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.889
 birds that all this is suddenly needed 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:56.379
 to be interested in taking 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:59.169
 continually to try here 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.829
 to be at the heart of expectations we will 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.480
 say children 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.470
 we can not always learn everything 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.000
 school so 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.590
 savard also take it as and 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.780
 measure will to move forward 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.120
 to learn all the time to transmit 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.930
 values that can not be bought let's say 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.200
 that the base salary is around 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.130
 1500 euros gross and the animators do not 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.410
 sale no education 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.770
 you have to have a double training to 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.020
 exercise this profession a training 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.240
 naturalist with with a bac + 2 and then 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.320
 training also animators so 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.100
 with a minimum 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.870
 only the diploma called pafa 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.850
 nature educators a noble profession and 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.230
 aims to disseminate knowledge and 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.640
 values â€‹â€‹and to promote 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.960
 responsible behavior 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.110
 it is a profession of passion of all 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.850
 way so you have to have the passion of to 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.160
 the time we are going to say of the contact with 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.250
 children and then also the passion of 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.370
 want to show and protect what we 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.370
 surrounded
