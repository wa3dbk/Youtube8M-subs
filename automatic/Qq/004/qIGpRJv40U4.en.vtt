00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
so this is um I forgot the name of this

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
so this is um I forgot the name of this
one<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.520> I'll<00:01:50.850> link<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> down<00:01:51.270> below<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:52.259> so

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
one but I'll link it down below just so

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.249 
one but I'll link it down below just so
you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.680> check<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> out

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
you can check it out

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.620 
you can check it out
so<00:01:55.259> obviously<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.340> tote<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.390> has

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
so obviously it's like a tote and it has

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
so obviously it's like a tote and it has
a<00:01:57.930> shorter<00:01:58.320> handle<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.250> hold<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.549> like

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
a shorter handle so you can hold it like

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.649 
a shorter handle so you can hold it like
this<00:02:00.030> or<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.460> wear<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.670> over<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
you can close it up or I guess it's just

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.309 
you can close it up or I guess it's just
for<00:02:57.640> people<00:02:57.760> who<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.420> pack<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.750> lot<00:02:59.019> in<00:02:59.170> their
