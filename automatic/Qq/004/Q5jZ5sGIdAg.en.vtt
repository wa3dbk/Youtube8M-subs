 a botanical garden that has more than 1,500 species of cactus and 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.190
 succulents 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 being considered unique in its kind in South America 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.060
 conceived by patricia granillo and sebastián caro 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.000
 the botanical garden gathers species from all over the world like b argentina

 the attractiveness of the entity 100 cent 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.719
 but beyond that, what we want is also

 part of the collection 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.270
 which come from very different places 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.280
 from each other so that you can also compare the adaptation times that

 comes from the Quechua language and means spring 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.850
 and it is what happens permanently in this refuge of cacti and succulents 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.340
 For businesses 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.230
 plants like any other

 percent what was that would be these plants of enrique have changed by me 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.570
 Function to adapt to Darias climates with little more than 10 thousand meters 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.070

 that prospered in our continent before the arrival of the Spanish 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.689
 ea-canarias where we can see is 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.829
 just what what is the difference between a succulent and a 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:20.850

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.670

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.429
 and invites that of prelates the herbivores especially serve as in the 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.239
 leaf and lélia swallow are 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.519
 both take out that it would be very difficult to bring her but it's pretty much go 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.669
 seeing the difference between a succulent as are the salons 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.369
 and a cactus in doing what he says 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:54.039
 the main difference is that the coasts of gedeon-specific organ 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.599
 to stop mariola 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.979
 is the white don benito where the thorns come from

 good ss now does not fulfill the functions of fec aids remain in the rest 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.949
 of the plants 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.509
 the layout of this botanical garden 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.569
 allows a direct appreciation 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.579
 and in several levels of all the plants in a walk that groups them by countries and 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.579
 degrees of interest 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.860
 He revealed that he will not take 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.039
 relation to the other careers that do 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.590
 the president-elect of the body 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.760
 is that here in the frozen hair is that it is 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.769
 about the performance of the spine

 percent of the generate sec to protect the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.859
 already in the freeze 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.000
 what serves is to protect the vote flora 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.229
 Roldos has been promoting as 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.289
 for one hundrerd 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.289
 each plant is adapting its critical environment 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.259
 There are more than 200 genera of cactus 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:06.889
 with around 2,500 species, mostly adapted 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.219

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.940

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.979
 and as you see

 rabanne to camouflage yourself with the stone that you climb piera and that is a plant 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:32.019
 they are very interesting and they were not discovered and not also in 50 because 

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:35.019
 no person interested in the subject 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.699
 I had seen you want to bloom 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.199
 It is curious to know about the adaptation of succulents to inhabited areas 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:47.599
 this allows them to colonize uninhabited environments and those that do not have 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.849
 competition from other plant species 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.849
 and in those that lost them pores are scarce 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.559
 ferreti in this particular plant 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:05.899
 this operator contributes data of the account that when the high that the one of the cdla 

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:08.899

 up that the sun has the epidermis as it has inés to protect from the sun 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.460

 the same thing happens in the same way without being AIDS pillar 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.120
 with what is within the succulents and cacti the cities banned them

 the botanical garden chira humita 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.129
 It is an interesting opportunity to learn about specials 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:08.020
 characteristics of the cactus and succulents that today attracts the attention of 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.469
 numerous botanists and collectors
