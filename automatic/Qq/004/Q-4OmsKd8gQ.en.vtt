00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to all in this video I will show you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.190
 how to make cookies with drops of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.760
 chocolate 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.210
 the ingredients for about 25 30 cookies 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.960
 they are 400 g of flour 200 200 g of butter 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.240
 150 g of sugar 2 eggs a zest of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.310
 lemon a spoon of yeast 4 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.320
 spoons of a sweet liqueur and drops 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.820
 of chocolate first of all we fill 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.830
 a bowl with all the ingredients 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.439
 except the chocolate drops that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.510
 we will insert later we mix the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.550
 all up to form a smooth ball 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.110
 I'm helping myself with a whip but 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 you can also use a simple one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.879
 wooden kitchen spoon 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.750
 we knead until the dough does not 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.910
 becomes less sticky after which towards 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.559
 all on the table and continues to knead 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.570
 with my hands I mix everything for about 5 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.399
 minutes until I get one 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.520
 smooth and homogeneous ball 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.440
 if the dough sticks on the table 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 you can pay a small amount 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.500
 of flour in such a way that the dough does not 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.500
 stick more 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.430
 well when the dough becomes smooth and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.830
 homogeneous we turn it into the film 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.080
 transparent and subsequently the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.080
 let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.440
 in the meantime let's spread out a little 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.930
 paper 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.850
 oven on our pan and I'm going 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.640
 already prepare the chocolate drops in 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.800
 a dish spent thirty minutes 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.320
 we take the pasta and go to form the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.510
 our cookies then to speed up 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.030
 the thing you can spread the dough on 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.220
 table and cut out the biscuits with 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.320
 the important thing is that the biscuits 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.050
 are not more than one centimeter tall 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.970
 I am better at forming every 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.550
 single cookie then simply 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.950
 is with the pasta and the piece 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.530
 model with hands and later 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.510
 once I have verified that it is not 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.500
 I go to a centimeter taller 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.240
 add the chocolate drops 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.520
 after which it shuffles everything and I go to 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.560
 place the biscuit on the baking tray e 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.560
 so do all the other cookies 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.640
 once he has finished creating 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.470
 all the cookies I'm going to add 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.210
 over a few more chocolate drops 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.730
 well once they are ready we go to 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.980
 Bake the cookies at 180 degrees for 15 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.980
 About 20 minutes in a preheated oven 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.510
 after about ten minutes the biscuits yes 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.489
 present 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.560
 rome are not yet completely cooked 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.560
 because they must be slightly golden 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.050
 all are cookies 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.570
 I don't know if it is good to see from 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.090
 light but are slightly golden on 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.769
 board 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.709
 these are all the cookies I have 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.870
 fact they came about 25 30 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.769
 I hope the video was helpful and 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.340
