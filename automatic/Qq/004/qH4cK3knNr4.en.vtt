let's<00:03:49.600> get<00:03:49.720> an<00:03:49.840> energy<00:03:49.960> from<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.530> Sun<00:03:50.710> we're

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
let's get an energy from the Sun we're

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.890 
let's get an energy from the Sun we're
going<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.520> see<00:03:51.580> how<00:03:51.700> much<00:03:51.880> energy<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.450> has<00:03:52.480> ones

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
going to see how much energy it has ones

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:05.850 
going to see how much energy it has ones
