00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.880 
think that Palpatine or Sidious in this
case<00:00:53.640> has<00:00:53.969> ever<00:00:54.210> appeared<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:55.020> anything<00:00:55.739> other

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
than a hologram I don't think he's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990

now the figure itself I've got quite a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
now the figure itself I've got quite a
few<00:01:31.320> gripes<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.820> first<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.270> them

this<00:01:36.810> figure<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.409> definitely<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
this figure is definitely one of the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730 
this figure is definitely one of the
worst<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.090> Hasbro<00:01:39.540> released<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.350> terms<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
articulation basically it only has is

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.740 
articulation basically it only has is
not<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.040> collision<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> neck<00:01:44.850> ball<00:01:45.540> he's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
full torso and that's it there's not

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.840 
full torso and that's it there's not
circulation<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> knees<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:51.930> ankles<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
circulation in the knees or ankles and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.880 
circulation in the knees or ankles and
so<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.600> makes<00:01:54.899> his<00:01:55.110> figure<00:01:55.439> you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so it just really makes his figure you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.520 
so it just really makes his figure you
know<00:01:56.149> pretty<00:01:57.149> bad<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.600> terms<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.960> movement<00:01:58.439> you

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
know pretty bad in terms of movement you

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.780 
know pretty bad in terms of movement you
know<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.799> can't<00:01:59.040> pose<00:01:59.310> him<00:01:59.549> very<00:01:59.759> well<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
know you can't pose him very well and

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.580 
know you can't pose him very well and
it's<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> static<00:02:03.899> piece<00:02:04.110> really

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it's just more of a static piece really

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.840 
it's just more of a static piece really
as<00:02:04.680> opposed<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> an<00:02:05.159> action<00:02:05.399> figure<00:02:05.640> which<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
as opposed to an action figure which is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.010 
as opposed to an action figure which is
quite<00:02:06.180> ashamed

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
quite ashamed

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.830 
quite ashamed
on<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> plus<00:02:08.099> side<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.849> headsculpt<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
on the plus side the headsculpt if you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.020 
on the plus side the headsculpt if you
can<00:02:09.959> see<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.400> try<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.489> zoom<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
can see it try and zoom in on the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.720 
can see it try and zoom in on the
actually<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:13.590> head<00:02:13.739> sculpt<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.430> figure

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
actually the head sculpt of this figure

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.199 
actually the head sculpt of this figure
is<00:02:14.910> absolutely<00:02:15.690> phenomenal<00:02:16.940> for<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.030> bits

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
is absolutely phenomenal for the bits

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.089 
is absolutely phenomenal for the bits
that<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.540> see<00:02:18.750> anyway<00:02:19.080> she's<00:02:19.739> got<00:02:19.770> hard

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
that you can see anyway she's got hard

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.540 
that you can see anyway she's got hard
to<00:02:20.190> pick<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.459> up<00:02:20.550> on<00:02:20.640> camera<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.950> he<00:02:23.010> does<00:02:23.430> have

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
to pick it up on camera but he does have

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.890 
to pick it up on camera but he does have
a<00:02:23.580> fantastic<00:02:24.060> head<00:02:24.390> sculpt<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
a fantastic head sculpt and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.540 
a fantastic head sculpt and
unfortunately<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.620> hoods<00:02:25.830> not<00:02:26.069> removable

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
unfortunately the hoods not removable

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.479 
unfortunately the hoods not removable
that's<00:02:27.330> probably<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.930> keep<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.470> suspense<00:02:29.220> in

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
that's probably to keep the suspense in

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.570 
that's probably to keep the suspense in
the<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.660> mystery<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.290> Sidious<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.310> hidden

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
but I'm hoping did we get a glimpse of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.470 
but I'm hoping did we get a glimpse of
that<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.410> forthcoming<00:02:52.739> series<00:02:56.330> as<00:02:57.330> you
