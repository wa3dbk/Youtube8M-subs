00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.950
 so turning on the back camera on kia 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.490
 cerate 2 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:13.730
 It means I did not see the camera for not leaving it 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.630
 goes embedded with this crap she 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.160
 stock is exactly the same as it was 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.710
 just fill in ie installation 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.260
 no programs yet there is no right there 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.570
 there were cuts but I was still worried 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.609
 missed through this stub had to 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.970
 slur there si rubber seals and 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.239
 that is, he quietly came out here means 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:41.059
 connection hooked it up 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:47.420
 I'll take the video signal and power to the world 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:51.200
 The most video to this camera treatment 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:57.340
 performed that is, we spill it back 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:01.340
 move plus is minus total 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:06.560
 bezraznitsy yet like so then all I 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.900
 take away certainly means well, you know Che 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.950
 but still here the video signal was also 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.950
 allocating entries 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.750
 manager so that when turned on 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.700
 reverse gear automatically on 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.189
 the tape recorder appeared an image and 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.909
 the prophets put down there photographs there 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.330
 began to bother with 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:29.479
 here it turns on but the same thing that is 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:36.340
 video signal and rights manager include 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.340
 ignition naturally while 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.100
 I help you a long time loading that is, I 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.100
 I don't know if she will be right there for you 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.020
 flash drive basically boot fast then 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.090
 there is a laptop at ease your eyes how much 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.150
 seconds five may have passed that is cold 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.430
 40 and a second I do not know what depends 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.480
 A flash drive for 8 discs on them does not matter either 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.160
 turn on the rear gear automatically 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.650
 loaded cameras but she is now with him 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.500
 looks eat mind. 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.930
 until everyone knows how it will work but 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:23.680
 the basic fact is that the camera is working 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:27.000
 there is also on the camera 4 LEDs all 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.590
