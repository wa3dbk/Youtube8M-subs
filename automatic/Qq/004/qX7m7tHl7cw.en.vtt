00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.560 
about group dynamics doing this kind of
an<00:05:03.500> exercise<00:05:03.920> I<00:05:04.370> think<00:05:04.910> what<00:05:05.060> it's<00:05:05.210> doing<00:05:05.480> is

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
an exercise I think what it's doing is

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.630 
an exercise I think what it's doing is
it's<00:05:05.750> allowing<00:05:06.230> them<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.650> come<00:05:07.250> out<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.520> their

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
it's allowing them to come out of their

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.310 
it's allowing them to come out of their
shells<00:05:07.940> that<00:05:08.240> they<00:05:08.390> would<00:05:08.510> normally<00:05:08.630> have<00:05:09.140> in

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
shells that they would normally have in

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.550 
shells that they would normally have in
a<00:05:09.380> work<00:05:09.560> environment<00:05:09.680> and<00:05:10.690> hopefully<00:05:11.690> it'll

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
a work environment and hopefully it'll

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.590 
a work environment and hopefully it'll
open<00:05:12.740> them<00:05:13.070> up<00:05:13.100> to<00:05:13.550> listening<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.450> other

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
open them up to listening to other

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.290 
open them up to listening to other
people<00:05:14.990> at<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.230> jobs<00:05:15.530> I'm<00:05:16.460> amazed<00:05:16.850> at<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.150> way

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
people at the jobs I'm amazed at the way

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.570 
people at the jobs I'm amazed at the way
people<00:05:17.960> are<00:05:18.140> able<00:05:18.290> to<00:05:18.500> edit<00:05:18.620> themselves<00:05:19.280> when

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580
