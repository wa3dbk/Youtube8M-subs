00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello and welcome on how to photograph points like today 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.119
 talk to you about the morning addicted 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.659
 then the macro is done to get as close as possible to the subject 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.079
 to make your bear skin 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.220
 so the macro how does it work as soon as you use the intro scene mode on 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.349
 your camera 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.619
 it's not going to be it's not going to complicate it's a system 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.880
 no motor 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.169
 one shot at a time 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.470
 a focus mode where she sings 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.279
 howard 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.980
 s 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.670
 it's going to be the bigot early 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.120
 and then bessalah especially depend on your goal 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.280
 if your goal 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.710
 hold the camera will be in automatic mode 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.720
 but encrypted that will do that you could see here to make beautiful pictures 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.770
 basically it's going to depend 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.140
 distance is a focus of your camera on your lens 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.390
 if you have a 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.950
 a device that is not my troop 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.850
 we could not get too close 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.330
 of your subject 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.110
 bamako goes especially they are only costs 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.110
 of your goal is its focus mini distance 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.060
 the light measurement will be 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.410
 matrix evaluative 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.080
 to be able to take everything on the screen 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 and then decline to encourage used to really make the macro deduced 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.740
 employment 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.440
 the ring flash 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.260
 or then rolls on each side 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.180
 we can see to enlighten the subject who will be very ready to hleb the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.200
 lens 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.920
 because to make the hand too much advance a little material 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.360
 I think we'll talk about it in another video but here you go 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.520
 in outline what I could 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.270
 tell you about how 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.870
