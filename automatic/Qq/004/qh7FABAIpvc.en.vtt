00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.730
 I would like to introduce you to a channel today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.069
 Mr. tutorial show because I already 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.349
 I've got to know for a long time 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.469
 honestly admit to the hairstyle 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.630
 I'm not so fit and yet this thing 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.430
 I can do it very well because I too 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.500
 have practiced a lot so exercise does that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.060
 Master and I will show you now step 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.769
 Step by step as her hairstyle 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.990
 if that was super often 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.920
 requested by you on instagram on 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 facebook and on youtube, of course 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.719
 And this hairstyle is called wrong 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.059
 victory roll i dont know why you 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.960
 but is incorrectly called this is a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.270
 victory roll and been so much in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.730
 15 years and 60 years like some 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.500
 maybe know or my videos 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.450
 I've got my defect in my five too 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.510
 I'm told that I'm the 60s 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.300
 very dear and I like to play sometimes 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.219
 a little over the times and that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.090
 is a hairstyle you absolutely love and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.340
 the super easy 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.960
 then I would not say so much blah 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.510
 blah blah and let's go right now 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.710
 start everything you look for this 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.530
 needs is a curling iron 1 came one 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.530
 round brush hairclips and hairspray 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.420
 as a first part as our hair in two 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.909
 halves then you can have your topia came 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.640
 take a nice head 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.770
 at the side and then put the other 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.450
 Half of the hair just goes up with it 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 they just do not stand in our way anymore 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.330
 Now we work with ours 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.040
 curling iron streaks for strand and head ahead 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.540
 I also like to stick my hair here 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.520
 upwards so I really only ever 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.200
 with a strand work and so not 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.790
 as hair lies 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.790
 Personally, I always think that's the best 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.460
 exactly the same thing we do on the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.250
 the other side we are working together 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.170
 for strands back to the front and to 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.170
 I finish my crest 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.420
 and if we did it all 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.930
 I take my round brush and brush 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.200
 it lures me out very gently 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.070
 so that we are quite glamorous and noble 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.930
 lure 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.570
 Now I'm coming to something 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.550
 more complicated part of my hairstyle and 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.320
 Although I'm striding, I take mine 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.980
 crest in hand and part lines 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.110
 three pieces i copy the first part 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:23.180
 the second part and the third part 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:25.130
 with my raging came you now I lay down 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.600
 my toupierten crest back into the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.780
 right direction 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.150
 the crosses came out of my hair 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.140
 and at the end we know the lure 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.390
 out of the top 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.570
 and if I did it all 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.330
 namely the tips and wicks them over 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.209
 my index finger and middle finger 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:49.100
 she looks very easy and then 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:51.230
 turn this curl very slowly 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.700
 top to top piece by piece 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.540
 clean and clean and put them under it 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.920
 copied and when I have that fasten 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.200
 I quickly with mine 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.769
 hairpins and fix the whole thing with 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.769
 hair spray 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.450
 for the super six I praise myself 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.580
 the hair on the side a bit and 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.040
 fix that too with the hairpins 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:24.400
 and if we all that comes again 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.400
 in and then our air is ready 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.860
 that is the finished look and I am 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.590
 I must say that I am very satisfied 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.080
 It also does not take you so hard 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.480
 a curling iron makes you curls 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.650
 and the only difficult thing is this 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.060
 small rolled the up here and I 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.160
 So do not I like and I 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.720
 Hope you let me, of course, like 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.670
 always know in the comments then 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.960
 I'll tell you until the next video 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.960
 and chrissy cost
