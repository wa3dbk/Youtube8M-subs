Ubuntu with an i pod but an iPod is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400 
Ubuntu with an i pod but an iPod is
different<00:00:27.000> than<00:00:27.150> an<00:00:27.269> iPad<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.140> when<00:00:28.320> they

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
different than an iPad and when they

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.500 
different than an iPad and when they
came<00:00:28.650> out<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.130> iPad<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:30.150> reason

came out with the iPad for some reason
gtk<00:00:31.140> pod<00:00:31.439> would<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.430> recognize<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.420> think

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
gtk pod would not recognize it I think

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.510 
gtk pod would not recognize it I think
people<00:00:33.930> are<00:00:34.020> working<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.040> but

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
people are working on that right now but

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
people are working on that right now but
right<00:00:36.210> now<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.570> still<00:00:36.750> kind<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
right now it's still kind of up in the

files<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.670> my<00:00:44.910> Lou<00:00:45.270> bunt<00:00:45.510> oh<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.160> use

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
files to my Lou bunt oh and I can use

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
files to my Lou bunt oh and I can use
Dropbox<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.930> takes<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.320> very

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
Dropbox to do that but it takes a very

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.000 
Dropbox to do that but it takes a very
long<00:00:50.010> time<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.730> transfer<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> files<00:00:52.010> however

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
long time to transfer the files however

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.639 
long time to transfer the files however
with<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> USB<00:00:53.910> cable<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.840> transfer<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
with a USB cable you can transfer the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.810 
with a USB cable you can transfer the
files<00:00:55.920> rather<00:00:56.250> quickly

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
files rather quickly

and<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> back<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> CD<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

has a whole bunch of extra things and I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.770 
has a whole bunch of extra things and I
found<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.729> PDF<00:01:15.150> file<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.890> read<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
found this PDF file and I read it and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.590 
found this PDF file and I read it and
it's<00:01:18.780> very<00:01:18.930> good<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.240> here<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> says

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it's very good and here it says

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's very good and here it says
installing<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> bunch<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.070> 9-10<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
installing on a bunch of 9-10 so I

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.950 
installing on a bunch of 9-10 so I
assume<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> rather<00:01:25.200> old<00:01:25.650> file<00:01:26.930> but<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
assume this is a rather old file but I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.160 
assume this is a rather old file but I
went<00:01:28.320> down<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.520> said<00:01:29.759> gtk<00:01:30.450> pod<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.079> then

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
went down and it said gtk pod and then

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.030 
went down and it said gtk pod and then
it<00:01:31.320> said<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.979> fuse<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> made<00:01:33.659> sure<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.350> my

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it said get fuse so I made sure that my

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.630 
it said get fuse so I made sure that my
boob<00:01:35.250> untrue<00:01:35.579> Software<00:01:36.150> Center<00:01:36.540> had<00:01:36.810> fuse

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
boob untrue Software Center had fuse

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.999 
boob untrue Software Center had fuse
installed<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.900> talks<00:01:40.110> about<00:01:40.259> handbrake

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
installed and it talks about handbrake

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.359

travel through that cable and it's only
972<00:05:43.710> kilobytes<00:05:44.279> and<00:05:44.550> it's<00:05:44.699> still<00:05:45.180> graying<00:05:45.719> out

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
972 kilobytes and it's still graying out

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.010 
972 kilobytes and it's still graying out
would<00:05:46.289> you<00:05:46.409> look<00:05:46.620> at<00:05:46.740> that<00:05:46.979> I<00:05:47.599> mean<00:05:48.599> that's

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
would you look at that I mean that's

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.350 
would you look at that I mean that's
just<00:05:49.080> terrible<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:49.979> I<00:05:50.669> don't<00:05:50.699> know<00:05:51.060> what<00:05:51.240> the

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
just terrible and I don't know what the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.899 
just terrible and I don't know what the
deal<00:05:51.569> is<00:05:51.599> on<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:52.289> I<00:05:52.440> think<00:05:52.860> that<00:05:53.099> there<00:05:53.669> is

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
deal is on that I think that there is

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.700 
deal is on that I think that there is
something<00:05:54.210> wrong<00:05:55.310> now<00:05:56.310> hopefully<00:05:56.580> I<00:05:56.849> am<00:05:57.180> still
