classes from the original Diablo or
diablo<00:01:04.140> 2<00:01:04.519> but<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.540> were<00:01:06.659> developing<00:01:06.810> we

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
diablo 2 but we as we were developing we

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.020 
diablo 2 but we as we were developing we
found<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> barbarian<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.729> kind<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
found that the barbarian was kind of the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.570 
found that the barbarian was kind of the
one<00:01:09.180> exception<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.950> we<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.220> wanted<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
one exception that we really wanted a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.890 
one exception that we really wanted a
class<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.970> kind<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.180> played<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.659> him

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
class that kind of played like him

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.590 
class that kind of played like him
because<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.320> felt<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.650> as<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> class<00:01:14.790> yet<00:01:15.420> we

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
because we felt like as a class yet we

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.390 
because we felt like as a class yet we
had<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> lot<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> room<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.260> grow<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:17.310> was

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
had a lot of room to grow and there was

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.680 
had a lot of room to grow and there was
a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:17.580> more<00:01:17.610> things<00:01:17.940> we<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.510> him

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
a lot more things we can do with him

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.000 
a lot more things we can do with him
whereas<00:01:19.020> some<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.380> other<00:01:19.500> classes<00:01:19.740> we

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
whereas some of the other classes we

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.980 
whereas some of the other classes we
looked<00:01:20.190> at<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.490> said<00:01:20.549> that's<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.540> great<00:01:21.570> class

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
looked at and said that's a great class

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.980 
looked at and said that's a great class
and<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.740> gameplay<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.159> great<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:23.700> there's<00:01:24.420> we

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
and the gameplay is great but there's we

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.649 
and the gameplay is great but there's we
can't<00:01:25.320> make<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> ton<00:01:27.090> better<00:01:27.299> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
can't make them you know a ton better so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.330 
can't make them you know a ton better so
we'd<00:01:27.840> rather<00:01:28.020> try<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> explore<00:01:29.100> different

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
we'd rather try to explore different

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.429 
we'd rather try to explore different
idea<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.539> create<00:01:30.719> some<00:01:30.960> new<00:01:30.990> gameplay

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
idea that can create some new gameplay

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.279 
idea that can create some new gameplay
so<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.799> diablo<00:01:32.130> 3<00:01:32.399> will<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.210> able<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.079> stand

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
so that diablo 3 will be able to stand

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.719 
so that diablo 3 will be able to stand
on<00:01:34.469> its<00:01:34.500> own<00:01:34.740> compared<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.609> other

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
on its own compared to the other

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.639 
on its own compared to the other
projects<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> barbarian<00:01:37.109> will<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
projects so the barbarian will be the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.340 
projects so the barbarian will be the
only<00:01:37.770> one<00:01:38.100> who<00:01:39.030> comes<00:01:39.329> back<00:01:39.539> from<00:01:39.840> diablo<00:01:40.200> 2

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
only one who comes back from diablo 2

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.740 
only one who comes back from diablo 2
yeah<00:01:40.859> he's<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.250> only<00:01:41.399> only<00:01:42.030> literal

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
yeah he's the only only literal

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.420 
yeah he's the only only literal
returning<00:01:43.229> class<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:43.799> some<00:01:43.950> classes

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
returning class there are some classes

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.459 
returning class there are some classes
where<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.759> archetypes<00:01:45.210> are<00:01:45.329> similar<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.899> for

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
where the archetypes are similar but for

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.590 
where the archetypes are similar but for

the most part he well not for the most

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.270 
the most part he well not for the most
part<00:01:48.719> he<00:01:48.929> is<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> only<00:01:49.320> actual<00:01:49.829> returning

and play games together what's the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.500 
and play games together what's the
overall<00:02:55.190> structure<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.060> game<00:02:56.240> is<00:02:56.390> it

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
overall structure of the game is it

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.720 
overall structure of the game is it
essentially<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.320> same<00:02:57.530> as<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:58.070> was<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.280> diablo

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
essentially the same as it was in diablo

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.090 
essentially the same as it was in diablo
2<00:02:58.910> i<00:02:58.940> mean<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.300> have<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.510> town<00:02:59.810> you<00:03:00.050> have<00:03:00.230> areas

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
2 i mean you have a town you have areas

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.420 
2 i mean you have a town you have areas
area<00:03:01.670> transitions<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.630> everything<00:03:03.430> overall

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
area transitions and everything overall

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.360 
area transitions and everything overall
the<00:03:04.610> structure<00:03:05.000> is<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.360> very<00:03:05.570> similar<00:03:06.190> we<00:03:07.190> use

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
the structure is is very similar we use

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.580 
the structure is is very similar we use
what<00:03:07.640> we<00:03:07.700> have<00:03:07.850> for<00:03:08.150> acts<00:03:08.360> those<00:03:09.170> acts<00:03:09.380> are

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
what we have for acts those acts are

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.760 
what we have for acts those acts are
roughly<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.459> same<00:03:10.640> length<00:03:10.970> as<00:03:11.750> as<00:03:12.200> be<00:03:12.470> able<00:03:12.650> to

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
roughly the same length as as be able to

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.440 
roughly the same length as as be able to
at<00:03:12.830> least<00:03:12.920> we're<00:03:13.130> targeting<00:03:13.340> roughly<00:03:14.330> the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
at least we're targeting roughly the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.890 
at least we're targeting roughly the
same<00:03:14.630> length<00:03:14.950> there<00:03:15.950> are<00:03:16.130> some<00:03:16.400> differences

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
same length there are some differences

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.290 
same length there are some differences
we<00:03:17.900> use<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.920> way<00:03:19.040> point<00:03:19.280> system<00:03:19.670> similar<00:03:20.239> to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
we use the way point system similar to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.240 
we use the way point system similar to
diablo<00:03:20.840> 2<00:03:20.989> but<00:03:21.260> we've<00:03:21.380> made<00:03:21.560> some<00:03:21.800> changes<00:03:22.010> to

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
diablo 2 but we've made some changes to

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.949 
diablo 2 but we've made some changes to
it<00:03:22.489> one<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.880> big<00:03:22.970> ones<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.239> we've<00:03:23.450> added<00:03:23.630> a

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
it one of the big ones is we've added a

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.410 
it one of the big ones is we've added a
second<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.770> new<00:03:25.190> kind<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.760> waypoint<00:03:26.180> called<00:03:26.239> a

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
second a new kind of waypoint called a

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.020 
second a new kind of waypoint called a
checkpoint<00:03:26.840> which<00:03:27.110> is<00:03:27.260> not<00:03:27.890> visualized<00:03:28.880> with

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
checkpoint which is not visualized with

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.850 
checkpoint which is not visualized with
in<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.360> world<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:29.810> when<00:03:29.989> you<00:03:30.110> hit<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.830> you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
in the world but when you hit it you

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.500 
in the world but when you hit it you
kind<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.160> get<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.340> message<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:32.000> then<00:03:32.090> that's<00:03:32.360> a

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
kind of get a message and then that's a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.090 
kind of get a message and then that's a
place<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.840> can<00:03:32.930> always<00:03:33.170> return<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.500> whatever

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
place you can always return to whatever

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.729 
place you can always return to whatever
your<00:03:34.280> last<00:03:34.489> kind<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.150> checkpoint<00:03:35.600> you<00:03:36.049> hit<00:03:36.260> so

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
your last kind of checkpoint you hit so

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.979 
your last kind of checkpoint you hit so
it<00:03:36.830> makes<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.070> kind<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.250> easier<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.730> return<00:03:38.120> to

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
it makes it kind of easier to return to

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.479 
it makes it kind of easier to return to
you<00:03:39.320> know<00:03:39.410> different<00:03:39.590> spots<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.340> world

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
you know different spots in the world

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.850 
you know different spots in the world
because<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.299> you<00:03:42.019> checkpoints<00:03:42.739> are

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
because you you checkpoints are

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.199 
because you you checkpoints are
generally<00:03:43.190> more<00:03:43.340> frequent<00:03:43.790> than<00:03:43.910> white

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
generally more frequent than white

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.199 
generally more frequent than white
points<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:45.410> we<00:03:45.769> also<00:03:46.100> are<00:03:46.519> probably<00:03:47.000> going<00:03:47.120> to

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
points so we also are probably going to

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.970 
points so we also are probably going to
change<00:03:47.510> how<00:03:47.750> town<00:03:48.019> portaling<00:03:48.440> works<00:03:48.680> but<00:03:48.920> we

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
change how town portaling works but we

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.770 
change how town portaling works but we
haven't<00:03:49.160> decided<00:03:49.549> exactly<00:03:49.730> i<00:03:50.090> was<00:03:50.330> a<00:03:50.360> bit<00:03:50.570> of<00:03:50.660> a

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
haven't decided exactly i was a bit of a

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.740 
haven't decided exactly i was a bit of a
cheap<00:03:51.560> tactic<00:03:52.010> in<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:52.670> diablo<00:03:53.120> 2<00:03:53.299> allowed

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
cheap tactic in in diablo 2 allowed

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.120 
cheap tactic in in diablo 2 allowed
people<00:03:53.959> kind<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.230> walk<00:03:54.440> out<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.680> any<00:03:54.890> fight

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
people kind of walk out of any fight

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.610 
people kind of walk out of any fight
that<00:03:55.370> they<00:03:55.489> were<00:03:56.120> having<00:03:56.750> was<00:03:57.080> going<00:03:57.410> badly

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
that they were having was going badly

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.199 
that they were having was going badly
and<00:03:57.950> we<00:03:58.040> really<00:03:58.340> don't<00:03:58.430> want<00:03:58.670> that<00:03:58.820> we<00:03:58.880> want<00:03:59.030> a

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
and we really don't want that we want a

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.720 
and we really don't want that we want a
little<00:03:59.420> bit<00:03:59.540> more<00:03:59.750> tension<00:04:00.350> in<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.680> fights<00:04:00.920> so

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
little bit more tension in the fights so

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.490 
little bit more tension in the fights so
we're<00:04:02.660> probably<00:04:02.810> going<00:04:02.989> to<00:04:03.049> change<00:04:03.260> some

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
we're probably going to change some

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.870 
we're probably going to change some
little<00:04:03.709> details<00:04:04.040> like<00:04:04.160> that<00:04:04.280> but<00:04:04.670> there'll<00:04:04.850> be

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
little details like that but there'll be

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.640 
little details like that but there'll be
minor<00:04:05.150> changes<00:04:05.600> that<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:06.230> will<00:04:06.350> still<00:04:06.500> have<00:04:06.590> a

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
minor changes that it will still have a

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.710 
minor changes that it will still have a
way<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.830> go<00:04:06.950> back<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.220> town<00:04:07.370> easily<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.299> just

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
way to go back to town easily and just

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.900 
way to go back to town easily and just
some<00:04:08.840> local<00:04:09.170> things<00:04:09.320> like<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:09.910> there's

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
some local things like that there's

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.420 
some local things like that there's
other<00:04:11.060> changes<00:04:11.450> like<00:04:11.680> not<00:04:12.680> every<00:04:12.980> act<00:04:13.160> has<00:04:13.400> a

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
other changes like not every act has a

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.870 
other changes like not every act has a
central<00:04:13.880> town<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:15.140> sometimes<00:04:15.769> they<00:04:16.370> starts

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
central town and sometimes they starts

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.219 
central town and sometimes they starts
with<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.030> central<00:04:17.269> town<00:04:17.479> but<00:04:17.660> that<00:04:17.780> changes

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
with a central town but that changes

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.620 
with a central town but that changes
mainly<00:04:19.010> because<00:04:19.160> we<00:04:19.790> want<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.030> world<00:04:20.060> that<00:04:20.419> just

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
mainly because we want a world that just

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.320 
mainly because we want a world that just
feels<00:04:20.930> more<00:04:21.140> alive<00:04:21.440> we<00:04:21.979> want<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.300> we<00:04:23.300> really

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
feels more alive we want to we really

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.500 
feels more alive we want to we really
want<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.810> improve<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.260> feeling<00:04:24.590> of<00:04:24.820> diablo<00:04:25.820> 3

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
want to improve the feeling of diablo 3

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.170 
want to improve the feeling of diablo 3
being<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.810> role-playing<00:04:27.290> game<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.550> know<00:04:28.640> if

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
being a role-playing game so you know if

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.510 
being a role-playing game so you know if
we<00:04:29.450> will<00:04:29.600> say<00:04:29.930> want<00:04:30.650> demons<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.130> overrun<00:04:31.460> the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
we will say want demons to overrun the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.670 
we will say want demons to overrun the
town<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.030> burn<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.300> down<00:04:32.330> like<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.500> wasn't

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
town and burn it down like that wasn't

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.110 
town and burn it down like that wasn't
really<00:04:33.860> an<00:04:34.010> option<00:04:34.130> diablo<00:04:34.610> 2<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:34.910> way<00:04:35.000> the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
really an option diablo 2 the way the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.610 
really an option diablo 2 the way the
game<00:04:35.240> was<00:04:35.360> set<00:04:35.540> up<00:04:35.690> but<00:04:35.930> that's<00:04:36.110> an<00:04:36.290> option<00:04:36.410> for

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
game was set up but that's an option for

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.239 
game was set up but that's an option for
us<00:04:36.800> like<00:04:36.979> we

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:37.249 
us like we

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:38.739 
us like we
do<00:04:37.369> that<00:04:37.549> and<00:04:37.699> then<00:04:37.759> transplant<00:04:38.329> into<00:04:38.569> a<00:04:38.629> new

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:38.749 
do that and then transplant into a new

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:41.109 
do that and then transplant into a new
town<00:04:38.989> so<00:04:39.739> you<00:04:40.309> know<00:04:40.399> those<00:04:40.669> are<00:04:40.789> those<00:04:41.059> are

00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:41.119 
town so you know those are those are

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:42.849 
town so you know those are those are
things<00:04:41.359> that<00:04:41.509> might<00:04:41.839> change<00:04:42.139> and<00:04:42.469> got<00:04:42.679> to<00:04:42.769> be

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:42.859 
things that might change and got to be

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:47.990 
things that might change and got to be
little<00:04:43.069> surprises<00:04:43.549> throughout<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.939> game

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.940 

they<00:04:48.840> were<00:04:48.960> trying<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.320> do<00:04:49.410> anything<00:04:49.860> they
