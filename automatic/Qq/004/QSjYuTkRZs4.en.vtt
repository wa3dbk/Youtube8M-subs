00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.859
 we are doing delicious together today 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.540
 Whipped cream with whipped cream and cherry 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:24.390
 sauce and I'll show you how easy that is 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:28.230
 it takes 250 milliliters of water 50 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 grams under 150 grams of flour 25 grams 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.110
 starch a pinch of salt 1 teaspoon 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.480
 baking powder four to five eggs 500 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.300
 milliliter liquid cream 25 grams 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 icing sugar vanilla flavor two packs 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.590
 sandstone a big glass 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.899
 shadow morels 20 grams of starch abrasion 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.980
 half a lemon 80 grams of sugar 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.530
 half a marginalized vanilla instead 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.390
 prepare the fire dough water 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:03.960
 bring to the boil 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:07.820
 the butter plus salt pinch the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.820
 let's boil it up then 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.850
 we give the sea and the strength once 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.799
 to the race the dough gets 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.170
 also send edge dough you have the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.820
 namely strengthening nice work out the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.259
 afterwards the windbag is also correct 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 can grow up pretty big 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.350
 The eggs beat you best before 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.610
 already open 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.670
 then it's just more practical form 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.700
 one can boil a color that cooks water 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 wants to continue and stronger at once 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:45.850
 stir in quickly 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.240
 so it must be on the pot floor with it 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.729
 whole white layer make more effort 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.430
 Result time lets all the better 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.250
 more windbags therefore they already 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.050
 here this wise strength layer completely 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.600
 you can never see clearly here 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.270
 bowl wide us the dough maybe 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.670
 that he can cool down faster 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.560
 Now I am working on the five eggs 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.269
 after the mass is a nice plate 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.830
 Dough now I find the mass in 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.959
 a pouch with a sterntaler 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.230
 it's all on the baking sheet and then 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.360
 we pack this at 200 degrees about 25 to 30 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.940
 minutes we still show content 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.830
 Building a proven house asks the crowd 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.549
 Waste still a little bit 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.000
 baking powder in the mountain which nevertheless good 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.000
 mix 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.310
 Dough portions must not be too dense 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.540
 be together because the farmers are right 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.989
 a lot of space to rise 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:03:00.909
 that on the tin sometimes I say 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:03.760
 many three pieces okay if both 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.110
 now come in the oven with it the wind 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.760
 ball go out well that this 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.950
 Old trick that gives you a good mouthful 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.849
 water in the hot oven on water 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.849
 gives the metal sheets 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.849
 and in the meantime we can 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.389
 prepare our cherry sauce and the 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:31.959
 cream filling make the cherries caught 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:34.109
 the sawed churches in juice that 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.870
 stronger one to cover 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:41.250
 and here sugar in lemon peel 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.349
 Why put the sugar in a pot? 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.969
 I have a small shot of water 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.969
 the sugar can just dissolve like that 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:05.290
 let him even also caramelize 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:06.609
 ever get the vanilla pod to the 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.319
 I can always be strong with something 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.319
 mix with cold water 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.769
 Our caramel is ready to go now 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.769
 we as managed in 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.310
 the boil as long as a cook until 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.450
 The caramel is completely recovered 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.610
 has dissolved because he is now 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:38.660
 The cold liquid solidifies the same 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.720
 our vanilla flavor with lemon peel 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.830
 let the beautiful now boil down to the 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.150
 Most is not even with the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.840
 whisk in because then there is only 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.210
 unnecessary 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.210
 hang the caramel and whisk and 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.270
 that could already cook a and 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.960
 The caramel has completely 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.690
 disbanded 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.380
 spins to move away the whole thing 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.380
 food starch 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.380
 more and more gradually do not give 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.080
 at a time otherwise you have the finished 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.930
 you do not actually glue the paste 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.310
 That's why you want to do it then 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.210
 is it then boil briefly until the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.210
 educational uses 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.589
 strength is tied off you can do that 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:24.239
 Cook for two minutes what the 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.159
 strength you can sell that properly 

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:28.139
 Do not taste in these strengths 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:40.649
 and then we will go 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:42.959
 I put our passion to it now 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:46.189
 cool down in the window of the meantime 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.189
 Let's make our whipped cream 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.110
 I'll hit me first one says so 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.029
 Half a minute you beat the times 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.579
 alone on only then you give the 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:06:00.829
 other components with sugar and cream 

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:00.829
 stiff now a little louder 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:17.110
 so can cream and vanilla cream 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.110
 Aroma 

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:41.489
 who now has the fridge and then 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.110
 let's see what our with you 

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:44.429
 take it outside that you can immediately 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.689
 what they do not cut 

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:54.919
 coincide it's true 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:57.919
 nice air the stay longer super 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.919
 funny 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.880
 just as you have to be that nice 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.130
 cooling down 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:10.410
 Only then can you headline 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:12.810
 our klose windbag is beautiful 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:19.940
 the churches always cooled down too 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:32.790
 to the movie I 'm looking forward to the flag 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:34.380
 not too little if the cherries are so 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:51.930
 Run down a bit longer 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:55.070
 off and little tower cream 1 still nice 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.070
 sprinkle with icing sugar 

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:03.560
 the girl ran emperor our wind 

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:06.640
 continue with whipped cream and church st 

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.640
 Enjoy the meal
