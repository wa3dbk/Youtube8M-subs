so you can see what it's like to push

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.660 
so you can see what it's like to push
snow<00:01:06.110> around<00:01:06.409> here<00:01:06.650> if<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.130> thing<00:01:07.400> still

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
snow around here if this thing still

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.380 
snow around here if this thing still
works<00:01:07.939> or<00:01:08.150> not

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
works or not

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.500 
works or not
you<00:01:09.110> know<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:11.000> know<00:01:11.119> over<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.479> years

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
you know and you know over the years

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.110 
you know and you know over the years
I've<00:01:12.080> really<00:01:12.439> only<00:01:12.470> modified<00:01:13.280> my<00:01:13.490> craftsmen

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
I've really only modified my craftsmen

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.600 
I've really only modified my craftsmen
by<00:01:14.660> adding<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.230> different<00:01:15.380> bar<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:16.070> raise<00:01:16.310> and

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
by adding the different bar to raise and

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.240 
by adding the different bar to raise and
lower<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:17.000> blade<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.300> little<00:01:17.540> stronger<00:01:18.100> plus<00:01:19.100> I

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
lower the blade a little stronger plus I

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.520 
lower the blade a little stronger plus I
put<00:01:19.430> some<00:01:19.610> small<00:01:19.970> rails<00:01:20.630> on<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:20.960> side<00:01:21.110> to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
put some small rails on the side to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.920 
put some small rails on the side to
block<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.980> snow<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.540> weight<00:01:23.720> transfer

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
block the snow on the weight transfer

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.290 
block the snow on the weight transfer
system<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:25.100> just<00:01:25.430> shortened<00:01:25.910> it<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.120> made<00:01:26.270> it

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
system I just shortened it and made it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.590 
system I just shortened it and made it
simpler<00:01:26.720> by<00:01:26.990> using<00:01:27.920> sliding<00:01:28.670> clamps<00:01:29.210> instead

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
simpler by using sliding clamps instead

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.120 
simpler by using sliding clamps instead
of<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.780> cord<00:01:30.050> system<00:01:30.350> it's<00:01:30.920> real<00:01:31.100> easy

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
of the cord system it's real easy

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.340 
of the cord system it's real easy
loosening<00:01:31.880> thing<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.330> slide<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:32.750> left<00:01:33.200> or

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
loosening thing and slide it left or

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.460 
loosening thing and slide it left or
right<00:01:33.560> it's<00:01:34.160> just<00:01:34.280> as<00:01:34.580> easy<00:01:35.080> doesn't<00:01:36.080> freeze

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
right it's just as easy doesn't freeze

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.130 
right it's just as easy doesn't freeze
up<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.980> snow<00:01:37.280> either<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.850> today<00:01:38.810> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
up in the snow either and today the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.899 
up in the snow either and today the
temperature<00:01:39.620> is<00:01:39.890> I'm<00:01:40.130> doing<00:01:40.460> this

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
temperature is I'm doing this

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.200 
temperature is I'm doing this
tamo<00:01:41.360> is<00:01:41.600> minus<00:01:42.170> 15<00:01:42.590> degrees<00:01:43.010> with<00:01:43.730> wind<00:01:43.970> chill

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
tamo is minus 15 degrees with wind chill

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.560 
tamo is minus 15 degrees with wind chill
at<00:01:44.480> minus<00:01:44.900> 24<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:46.460> let's<00:01:46.880> see<00:01:47.090> if<00:01:47.180> it<00:01:47.300> still

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
at minus 24 so let's see if it still

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.840 
at minus 24 so let's see if it still
works
