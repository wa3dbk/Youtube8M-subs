00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.860
 our fourth book on the doges of the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.109
 It 's just that accordion comes with a good cloth 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.430
 always charging me also greatness 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:25.320
 Your participation is as if in favor 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.760
 of the last one and my agent started with 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:36.149
 xote rate nÃ© 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:39.390
 We're doing it, so we're going. 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.960
 this rhythm on the bass with the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 keys then that's good for you guys 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.910
 the next phase keys a little here is the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 The next reality is yours. 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.850
 remember which notes are the strings 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.850
 douro 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.550
 remembering that the doha agreement is also 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.450
 we will do we will 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.890
 talk and achieve quality 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.940
 home 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.070
 Brother you can get as much of the hi 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.050
 controlled doc 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.050
 in this case we will start on Thursday 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:35.820
 to do two on the fifth two in the tonic 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:39.220
 two malteza two on the sharp fifth 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.180
 repeating to stay more or less like this 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.180
 joining bass 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:20.470
 That's it already do not work agent 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.239
 It is increased we give a play a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.130
 Time in that there to not stay 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.049
 just did not pay a sunshine 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.390
 You go and you will look for us in the bass 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.570
 I'm not mistaken about the bridge 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.730
 up at fifth intervals when 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.730
 down from the car maker 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.850
 now fifth down range 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.280
 fourth 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:52.950
 So we hired you out. 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:55.829
 Just what do we think about sunsets? 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.790
 against the sun 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:06.519
 So we'll do the same. 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:12.760
 accompaniment by sound has nothing 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:14.950
 I've moved the community to save it only 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.280
 within the same purpose but what 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:32.030
 a variable that will stick around 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:34.730
 only now that as we already had 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.470
 commented at the beginning is doing 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.470
 two in each note leaving the farm 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.180
 now we will do just to also 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:55.220
 a source of just starting from sun 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:04:01.250
 the dense one of the sun that is 15 the fifth of the sun 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:05.000
 that is a is is the octave of the sun is the same 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.050
 solo getting more or less so more 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:32.990
 key 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:34.970
 together we played two more variations in 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.200
 two hands is more or less this way 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.200
 too slow for you to understand 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.450
 when you are in a tragic you 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.470
 They will be able to make a faster way 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.990
 it's a natural thing it's beyond you 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:18.190
 can exchange this fifth condition 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:22.120
 You can not touch this thing so I 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:28.560
 I'm sorry but they can have the version 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.560
 although thus 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.509
 the next
