plane<00:00:19.039> what<00:00:20.039> interested<00:00:20.820> me<00:00:20.850> about<00:00:21.240> this

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
plane what interested me about this

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.349 
plane what interested me about this
plane<00:00:22.670> is<00:00:23.670> really<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.210> canals<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> front

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
plane is really the canals at the front

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.830 
plane is really the canals at the front
control<00:00:27.359> surface<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.349> at<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> front

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
control surface is up here at the front

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.170 
control surface is up here at the front
and<00:00:30.840> get<00:00:31.050> some<00:00:31.920> super<00:00:32.550> maneuverability<00:00:33.300> so

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
and get some super maneuverability so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.910 
and get some super maneuverability so
the<00:00:36.180> reasons<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.780> building<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.469> plane<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the reasons for building this plane is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.380 
the reasons for building this plane is
firstly<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:40.460> what<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> canals<00:00:42.000> work

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
firstly to see but what the canals work

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.060 
firstly to see but what the canals work
like<00:00:42.690> how<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.379> kind<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> effect<00:00:43.920> they

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
like how to see what kind of effect they

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.860 
like how to see what kind of effect they
have<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:45.809> also<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.390> Russian<00:00:48.390> pack

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
have and then also the Russian pack

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
have and then also the Russian pack
40-50<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.890> prototype<00:00:50.370> plane<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
40-50 is a prototype plane it's going to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.819 
40-50 is a prototype plane it's going to
be<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.579> basis<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.809> new<00:00:55.110> design<00:00:55.500> newly

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
be the basis for the new design newly

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.819 
be the basis for the new design newly
designed<00:00:55.980> plane<00:00:56.430> which<00:00:56.610> will<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> fgfa

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
designed plane which will be the fgfa

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.340 
designed plane which will be the fgfa
which<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.010> being<00:00:59.250> built<00:00:59.520> by<00:01:00.329> Russia<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.050> India

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
which is being built by Russia and India

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.250 
which is being built by Russia and India
being<00:01:02.250> Indian<00:01:02.520> myself<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.210> course<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.690> was

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
being Indian myself of course I was

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.070 
being Indian myself of course I was
quite<00:01:04.470> interested<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.189> design<00:01:06.470> so<00:01:09.080> this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
quite interested in this design so this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.330 
quite interested in this design so this
is<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> plane<00:01:10.710> looks<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.070> we'll<00:01:11.220> go

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
is what the plane looks like we'll go

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.859 
is what the plane looks like we'll go
for<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.670> tour<00:01:12.030> around<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.450> plane<00:01:12.659> right

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
for a little tour around the plane right

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.039 
for a little tour around the plane right
now<00:01:14.420> ok<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> top<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:18.049> pack

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
now ok so this is the top of the pack

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:29.899 
now ok so this is the top of the pack
far<00:01:19.820> t-50

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:41.190 

we<00:01:30.909> have<00:01:31.530> rudders<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.540> rudders<00:01:34.840> work<00:01:40.200> we

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
we have rudders to the rudders work we

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.460 
we have rudders to the rudders work we
have<00:01:41.530> an<00:01:42.430> elephant<00:01:43.180> configuration<00:01:44.170> so<00:01:44.320> that's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
have an elephant configuration so that's

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.290 
have an elephant configuration so that's
elevators<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.310> ailerons<00:01:46.300> that<00:01:47.170> umekes<00:01:47.470> and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
elevators and ailerons that umekes and

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.530 
elevators and ailerons that umekes and
then<00:01:49.300> working<00:01:49.479> 4x4<00:01:50.290> so<00:01:50.470> we<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.710> have<00:01:50.920> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
then working 4x4 so we do have the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.420 
then working 4x4 so we do have the
everyone's<00:01:52.540> here<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:54.070> move<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:57.040> well<00:01:57.280> as<00:01:57.340> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
everyone's here that move as well as the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.790 
everyone's here that move as well as the
elevators<00:02:00.430> as<00:02:00.580> well<00:02:02.160> so<00:02:03.160> they<00:02:03.460> move<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:05.649> we

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
elevators as well so they move if we

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.210 
elevators as well so they move if we
move<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.190> elevator<00:02:06.700> or<00:02:06.940> stick<00:02:07.149> up<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.450> down

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.940 

you<00:02:12.220> can<00:02:12.370> see<00:02:12.550> they're<00:02:12.730> moving<00:02:13.030> together<00:02:13.950> if

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
you can see they're moving together if

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.070 
you can see they're moving together if
we<00:02:15.280> move<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.930> aileron<00:02:17.640> they<00:02:18.640> move<00:02:19.080> in

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
we move that the aileron they move in

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.360 
we move that the aileron they move in
the<00:02:20.440> opposite<00:02:20.739> direction<00:02:22.650> we<00:02:23.650> also<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:24.130> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
the opposite direction we also have the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.530 
the opposite direction we also have the
canals<00:02:24.970> apart<00:02:26.190> which<00:02:27.190> set<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.300> move<00:02:30.390> with<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
canals apart which set to move with the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.430 
canals apart which set to move with the
elevators<00:02:34.890> we<00:02:35.890> also<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.430> course<00:02:36.459> have<00:02:36.790> our

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
elevators we also of course have our

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.509 
elevators we also of course have our
motor<00:02:38.440> mounted<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.530> center<00:02:41.709> there<00:02:42.070> with

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
motor mounted in the center there with

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.319

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
electronics hatch is hidden away you can

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.890 
electronics hatch is hidden away you can
open<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.500> up<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.970> all<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.239> our<00:02:55.329> electronics

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
open that up have all of our electronics

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.789 
open that up have all of our electronics
in<00:02:56.049> here<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.850> there's<00:02:58.420> our<00:02:58.660> receiver<00:02:59.230> I've<00:02:59.650> got

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
in here so there's our receiver I've got

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.690 
in here so there's our receiver I've got
a<00:02:59.829> B<00:03:00.040> C<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.890> battery<00:03:02.890> lives<00:03:03.430> down

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
a B C and then the battery lives down

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.759 
a B C and then the battery lives down
there<00:03:03.880> as<00:03:04.239> well<00:03:06.480> okay<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.540> we've<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:07.840> turned

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
there as well okay so we've just turned

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.930 
there as well okay so we've just turned
the<00:03:09.130> plane<00:03:09.610> over<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.540> this<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.989> underside

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
the plane over and this is the underside

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.210 
the plane over and this is the underside
you<00:03:12.940> can<00:03:13.660> see<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.049> electronic<00:03:14.980> speed

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
you can see the electronic speed

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.789 
you can see the electronic speed
controller<00:03:15.640> there<00:03:15.910> I've<00:03:16.600> got<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.840> 60<00:03:17.290> amp<00:03:17.470> speed

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
controller there I've got a 60 amp speed

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.620 
controller there I've got a 60 amp speed
controller<00:03:18.160> on<00:03:18.519> this<00:03:19.079> model<00:03:21.150> what's<00:03:22.150> probably

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
controller on this model what's probably

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.270 
controller on this model what's probably
most<00:03:22.900> interesting<00:03:23.380> here<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.890> four<00:03:24.250> by

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
most interesting here is the four by

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.060 
most interesting here is the four by
four<00:03:24.610> configuration<00:03:25.329> for<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.769> elevator<00:03:26.769> and

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
four configuration for the elevator and

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.440 
four configuration for the elevator and
ailerons<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:28.570> we've<00:03:28.690> got<00:03:28.900> one<00:03:29.079> servo<00:03:30.450> you're

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
ailerons so we've got one servo you're

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.259 
ailerons so we've got one servo you're
getting<00:03:31.750> close<00:03:31.989> there<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.610> one<00:03:33.760> servo

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
getting close there so the one servo

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.740 
getting close there so the one servo
moves<00:03:35.260> both<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:37.079> aileron

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
moves both the aileron

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.440 
moves both the aileron
and<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.620> elevator<00:03:42.910> another<00:03:43.910> important

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
and the elevator another important

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.210 
and the elevator another important
design<00:03:44.570> feature<00:03:45.020> of<00:03:45.140> course<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.680> canards

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
design feature of course is the canards

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.310 
design feature of course is the canards
so<00:03:46.490> this<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:48.260> canards<00:03:50.140> control<00:03:51.140> rod

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
so this is the the canards control rod

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.230 
so this is the the canards control rod
and<00:03:51.560> we<00:03:51.830> have<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.070> servo<00:03:52.520> separately

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
and we have the servo separately

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.030 
and we have the servo separately
attached<00:03:54.700> okay<00:03:55.700> so<00:03:56.500> what<00:03:57.500> really<00:03:57.620> interested

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
attached okay so what really interested

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.430 
attached okay so what really interested
me<00:03:58.130> was<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.400> canards<00:03:59.150> at<00:03:59.240> the<00:03:59.330> front<00:04:01.270> now<00:04:02.440> this

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
me was the canards at the front now this

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.290 
me was the canards at the front now this
could<00:04:04.100> not<00:04:04.220> work<00:04:04.459> in<00:04:04.640> three<00:04:04.850> different<00:04:05.030> modes

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
could not work in three different modes

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.680 
could not work in three different modes
and<00:04:06.260> this<00:04:06.410> was<00:04:06.620> put<00:04:07.220> together<00:04:07.400> by<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.360> lot<00:04:08.630> of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
and this was put together by a lot of

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.480 
and this was put together by a lot of

the<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:28.520> can<00:04:28.640> see<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.970> canals<00:04:32.360> aren't<00:04:32.660> moving

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
the you can see the canals aren't moving

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.510 
the you can see the canals aren't moving
at<00:04:33.080> all<00:04:34.240> in<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.419> second<00:04:35.810> mode<00:04:36.280> what<00:04:37.280> we<00:04:37.400> call

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
at all in the second mode what we call

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.140 
at all in the second mode what we call
high<00:04:37.760> speed<00:04:38.090> mode<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.830> canards<00:04:40.400> move<00:04:40.640> in<00:04:41.000> the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
high speed mode the canards move in the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.770 
high speed mode the canards move in the
opposite<00:04:41.570> direction<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.740> elevator<00:04:43.250> so<00:04:44.210> if

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
opposite direction to the elevator so if

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.830 
opposite direction to the elevator so if
I<00:04:44.930> pull<00:04:45.140> up<00:04:45.290> for<00:04:45.470> example<00:04:46.630> let's<00:04:47.630> say<00:04:47.750> the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
I pull up for example let's say the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.510 
I pull up for example let's say the
elevators<00:04:48.290> block<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.919> front<00:04:51.919> of<00:04:52.190> the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
elevators block and the front of the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.610 
elevators block and the front of the
canals<00:04:52.850> pull<00:04:53.180> up<00:04:53.330> so<00:04:53.450> they<00:04:53.540> form<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.960> nice<00:04:54.140> ear

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
canals pull up so they form a nice ear

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.960 
canals pull up so they form a nice ear
shape<00:04:54.919> so<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.250> should<00:04:55.520> give<00:04:55.669> it<00:05:00.490> back<00:05:01.490> pushes

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
shape so I should give it back pushes

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.790 
shape so I should give it back pushes
down<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.419> front<00:05:03.110> pulls<00:05:03.380> up<00:05:05.650> they're<00:05:06.650> probably

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
down the front pulls up they're probably

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.870 
down the front pulls up they're probably
this<00:05:07.340> mode<00:05:07.610> is<00:05:08.180> that<00:05:09.010> it<00:05:10.010> only<00:05:10.250> works<00:05:10.370> at<00:05:10.700> high

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
this mode is that it only works at high

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.730 
this mode is that it only works at high
speed<00:05:11.210> because<00:05:11.630> if<00:05:11.810> you're<00:05:12.020> going<00:05:12.229> at<00:05:12.530> low

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
speed because if you're going at low

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.610 
speed because if you're going at low
speed<00:05:13.070> was<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.120> cannot<00:05:14.450> pop<00:05:14.750> up<00:05:14.930> they're

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
speed was the cannot pop up they're

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.610 
speed was the cannot pop up they're
gonna<00:05:15.710> block<00:05:16.100> airflow<00:05:16.910> over<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.330> week<00:05:17.620> so

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
gonna block airflow over the week so

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.080 
gonna block airflow over the week so
there's<00:05:18.919> no<00:05:19.040> airflow<00:05:19.460> over<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.700> wing<00:05:19.880> once

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
there's no airflow over the wing once

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.710 
there's no airflow over the wing once
the<00:05:20.240> canals<00:05:20.630> are<00:05:20.780> up<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.880> combat<00:05:23.270> that<00:05:23.450> if

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
the canals are up so to combat that if

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.930 
the canals are up so to combat that if
with<00:05:24.229> low<00:05:24.380> speed<00:05:24.440> we<00:05:25.190> have<00:05:25.340> a<00:05:25.370> motor<00:05:25.640> speed

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
with low speed we have a motor speed

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.460 
with low speed we have a motor speed
motor<00:05:26.240> when<00:05:27.229> you<00:05:27.320> flip<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.530> switch<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:29.470> now

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
motor when you flip the switch and now

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.070 
motor when you flip the switch and now
when<00:05:30.680> I<00:05:30.770> pull<00:05:30.979> up<00:05:31.070> in<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:32.390> lowest<00:05:32.660> speed<00:05:32.810> mode

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
when I pull up in the lowest speed mode

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.900 
when I pull up in the lowest speed mode
that<00:05:33.290> can<00:05:33.470> hunt<00:05:33.680> actually<00:05:34.100> move<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.370> downwards

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
that can hunt actually move it downwards

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.670 
that can hunt actually move it downwards
so<00:05:35.660> they're<00:05:35.780> actually<00:05:35.870> pitching<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:36.500> nose

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
so they're actually pitching the nose

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.920 
so they're actually pitching the nose
down<00:05:37.010> but<00:05:37.280> what<00:05:37.430> they're<00:05:37.640> doing<00:05:37.669> is<00:05:38.060> at<00:05:38.750> low

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
down but what they're doing is at low

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.350 
down but what they're doing is at low
speed<00:05:39.320> we're<00:05:39.560> capturing<00:05:40.040> more<00:05:40.490> air<00:05:40.790> to<00:05:41.180> push

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
speed we're capturing more air to push

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.450 
speed we're capturing more air to push
over<00:05:41.540> the<00:05:41.720> wing<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.110> therefore<00:05:43.070> stopping<00:05:43.280> the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
over the wing and therefore stopping the

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.300 
over the wing and therefore stopping the
wing<00:05:43.610> from<00:05:43.820> stalling<00:05:44.270> out<00:05:44.440> so<00:05:45.440> hopefully<00:05:45.830> that

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
wing from stalling out so hopefully that

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.030 
wing from stalling out so hopefully that
will<00:05:46.490> allow<00:05:46.760> to<00:05:47.120> fly<00:05:47.960> in<00:05:48.020> more<00:05:48.440> of<00:05:48.530> a

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
will allow to fly in more of a
