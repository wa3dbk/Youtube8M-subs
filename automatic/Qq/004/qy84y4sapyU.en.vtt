00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
of what we know today kind of comes from

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.170 
of what we know today kind of comes from
that<00:00:36.130> time<00:00:36.310> period<00:00:36.340> as<00:00:36.640> far<00:00:36.820> as<00:00:36.970> like

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
that time period as far as like

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.790 
that time period as far as like
technology<00:00:37.600> is<00:00:37.900> concerned<00:00:38.350> so<00:00:38.590> it<00:00:38.650> seemed

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
technology is concerned so it seemed

forefront of the core mechanics of the

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.610 
forefront of the core mechanics of the
game<00:00:51.670> we<00:00:52.090> saw<00:00:52.140> opportunity<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.200> kind<00:00:53.350> of<00:00:53.380> go<00:00:53.470> in

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
game we saw opportunity to kind of go in

know about and actually applies to our

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.640 
know about and actually applies to our
weapons<00:00:58.210> notes<00:00:58.449> some<00:00:59.019> of<00:00:59.110> that<00:00:59.199> today<00:00:59.350> we<00:00:59.530> kind

against<00:01:03.339> people<00:01:03.670> as<00:01:03.820> weapons<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:04.809> this<00:01:04.960> kind

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
against people as weapons so this kind

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.570 
against people as weapons so this kind
of<00:01:05.290> was<00:01:05.500> you<00:01:05.710> know<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.100> was<00:01:06.220> kind<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.370> cool<00:01:06.520> to

be<00:01:06.850> better<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.330> be<00:01:07.420> happening<00:01:07.750> for<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:07.930> first

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
be better to be happening for the first

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.270 
be better to be happening for the first
time<00:01:08.290> here<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.680> eighteen<00:01:08.920> hundreds<00:01:09.220> of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
time here in the eighteen hundreds of

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.780 
time here in the eighteen hundreds of
our<00:01:09.460> game<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.830> ps4<00:01:12.100> was<00:01:12.460> an<00:01:12.580> interesting

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
our game the ps4 was an interesting

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.790 
our game the ps4 was an interesting
machine<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.510> start<00:01:13.720> working<00:01:14.050> on<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.590> gave

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
machine to start working on it it gave

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.980 
machine to start working on it it gave
us<00:01:14.980> the<00:01:15.310> ability<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.970> do<00:01:16.210> what<00:01:16.480> we<00:01:16.570> thought<00:01:16.750> was

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
us the ability to do what we thought was

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.390 
us the ability to do what we thought was
kind<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.260> lacking<00:01:17.470> in<00:01:17.740> previous<00:01:18.070> gen<00:01:18.220> which

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
kind of lacking in previous gen which

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.910 
kind of lacking in previous gen which
was<00:01:18.610> really<00:01:19.270> kind<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.780> crossing<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.500> boundary

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
was really kind of crossing the boundary

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.830 
was really kind of crossing the boundary
of<00:01:21.010> believable<00:01:21.790> characters<00:01:22.270> in<00:01:22.510> a<00:01:22.570> video<00:01:22.780> game

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
of believable characters in a video game

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.480 
of believable characters in a video game
we're<00:01:23.260> getting<00:01:23.350> close<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.740> really<00:01:24.070> being<00:01:24.310> able

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
we're getting close to really being able

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.770 
we're getting close to really being able
to<00:01:24.729> kind<00:01:24.940> of<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.150> know<00:01:25.180> get<00:01:25.540> out<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.720> the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
to kind of you know get out of the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.960 
to kind of you know get out of the
uncanny<00:01:26.080> valley<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.620> let<00:01:26.710> people<00:01:26.860> see<00:01:27.820> these

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
uncanny valley and let people see these

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.120 
uncanny valley and let people see these
characters<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.390> moat<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:28.960> speak<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:29.650> feel<00:01:29.890> in

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
characters a moat and speak and feel in

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.740 
characters a moat and speak and feel in
a<00:01:30.190> way<00:01:30.220> where<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:31.090> don't<00:01:31.120> feel<00:01:31.450> like<00:01:31.480> it's<00:01:31.690> a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
a way where you don't feel like it's a

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.990 
a way where you don't feel like it's a
game<00:01:31.870> anymore<00:01:32.140> well<00:01:32.440> now<00:01:32.650> that's<00:01:33.310> monocular

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
game anymore well now that's monocular

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.550 
game anymore well now that's monocular
part<00:01:34.480> of<00:01:34.540> that<00:01:34.630> was<00:01:34.780> developing<00:01:35.230> a

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
part of that was developing a

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.130 
part of that was developing a
performance<00:01:36.310> capture<00:01:36.490> process<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:37.600> would

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
performance capture process that would

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.540 
performance capture process that would
allow<00:01:38.380> us<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.710> actually<00:01:39.070> take<00:01:39.370> those

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
allow us to actually take those

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.280 
allow us to actually take those
performances<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.450> really<00:01:40.780> get<00:01:40.960> them<00:01:41.140> as

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
performances and really get them as

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.230 
performances and really get them as
genuinely<00:01:41.680> as<00:01:41.830> possible<00:01:42.250> into<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.490> game<00:01:42.670> so

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
genuinely as possible into the game so

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.180 
genuinely as possible into the game so
we<00:01:43.300> developed<00:01:43.510> very<00:01:43.780> complex<00:01:44.230> head<00:01:44.710> rigs<00:01:44.980> that

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
we developed very complex head rigs that

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.190 
we developed very complex head rigs that
are<00:01:45.250> carried<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.180> game<00:01:46.360> our<00:01:46.660> game

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
are carried in the game our game

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.720 
are carried in the game our game
