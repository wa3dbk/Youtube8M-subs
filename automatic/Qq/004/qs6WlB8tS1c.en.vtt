doing<00:03:57.180> commentary<00:03:57.479> is<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.780> don't<00:03:57.870> think

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
doing commentary is I don't think

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.229 
doing commentary is I don't think
anybody<00:03:58.319> started<00:03:58.829> off<00:03:59.009> really<00:03:59.639> really<00:03:59.849> great

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
anybody started off really really great

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.809 
anybody started off really really great
going<00:04:00.449> commentaries<00:04:01.079> unless<00:04:01.409> you<00:04:01.650> really<00:04:02.579> did

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
going commentaries unless you really did

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.729 
going commentaries unless you really did
some<00:04:03.030> studies<00:04:03.359> but<00:04:03.629> I<00:04:03.659> think<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:04.259> really<00:04:04.290> takes

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
some studies but I think it really takes

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.039 
some studies but I think it really takes
a<00:04:04.829> while<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.310> actually<00:04:05.970> get<00:04:06.389> comfortable<00:04:06.599> and

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
a while to actually get comfortable and

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.929 
a while to actually get comfortable and
to<00:04:07.500> be<00:04:07.620> honest<00:04:07.889> like<00:04:07.949> it's<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.729> and<00:04:08.759> the

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
to be honest like it's just you and the

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.449 
to be honest like it's just you and the
mic<00:04:09.150> now<00:04:09.659> when<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:09.900> think<00:04:10.139> about<00:04:10.199> it<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.650> used

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
mic now when you think about it I used

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.129 
mic now when you think about it I used
to<00:04:11.519> get<00:04:11.609> that<00:04:11.759> nervous<00:04:12.239> feeling<00:04:12.269> like<00:04:12.780> I'm

to<00:04:32.610> just<00:04:32.820> flow<00:04:33.030> with<00:04:33.060> commentaries<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:33.810> then

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
to just flow with commentaries and then

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.300 
to just flow with commentaries and then
when<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.140> realized<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:34.620> wasn't<00:04:34.950> really

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
when I realized that wasn't really

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.740 
when I realized that wasn't really
working<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.850> would<00:04:36.240> actually<00:04:36.510> get<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:36.720> a

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
working I would actually get like a

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.660 
working I would actually get like a
notepad<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.350> write<00:04:37.410> down<00:04:37.680> topics<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.400> didn't

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
notepad and write down topics I didn't

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.180 
notepad and write down topics I didn't
necessarily<00:04:39.000> right<00:04:39.660> mom<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:40.470> didn't

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
necessarily right mom I didn't

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.070 
necessarily right mom I didn't
necessarily<00:04:41.280> write<00:04:42.060> my<00:04:42.300> commentary<00:04:42.780> out<00:04:42.900> but

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
necessarily write my commentary out but

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.300 
necessarily write my commentary out but
I<00:04:43.110> would<00:04:43.290> just<00:04:43.440> write<00:04:43.560> down<00:04:43.620> like<00:04:44.010> let's<00:04:44.220> say

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
I would just write down like let's say

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.980 
I would just write down like let's say
apple<00:04:45.300> banana<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:47.270> peanut<00:04:48.270> butter<00:04:48.420> which

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
those are the top three things that just

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.640

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
running gun but it's a game that you

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.470 
running gun but it's a game that you
have<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.610> actually<00:05:38.760> take<00:05:39.000> your<00:05:39.150> time<00:05:39.270> and<00:05:39.300> be

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.390 
actually just downloaded the beta or so
I<00:06:06.840> think<00:06:07.140> it's<00:06:07.290> still<00:06:07.410> on<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.740> marketplace<00:06:08.100> as

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
I think it's still on the marketplace as

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.070 
I think it's still on the marketplace as
well<00:06:08.580> so<00:06:08.850> if<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.390> don't<00:06:09.570> want<00:06:09.690> to<00:06:09.750> try<00:06:09.840> it<00:06:09.930> out

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
well so if you don't want to try it out

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.300 
well so if you don't want to try it out
I<00:06:10.230> would<00:06:10.410> say<00:06:10.530> try<00:06:10.590> it<00:06:10.770> out<00:06:10.919> but<00:06:11.100> it<00:06:11.190> is

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
I would say try it out but it is

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.640 
I would say try it out but it is
definitely<00:06:11.490> a<00:06:11.850> different<00:06:12.419> game<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:12.990> I'm<00:06:13.470> it's
