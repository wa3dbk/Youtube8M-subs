00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.170
 I want more video from today 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.690
 with you like a higher class 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.550
 watch the hifi world and have for it 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.519
 I here imagine the mini compact 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.680
 speakers from the brand psb first 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.880
 of course thank you the left ones 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.800
 as always in the video description 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.210
 make sure to stop by and then 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:30.510
 I would say let's just start 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:32.610
 directly with the test report how to do that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.200
 already knows from psb here is the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.850
 Processing really on the highest 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.670
 level or you find absolutely no 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.050
 Manko hundred percent everything done and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.050
 I also say something like that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.210
 such for example as a front visor which 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.160
 is often easy with willing models 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.530
 only that this is a plastic frame 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.730
 there the cloth is over it and on 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.219
 the back then we have here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.289
 These pens are made of plastic totally 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.129
 thin one puts two times to it there are 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.899
 which stopped 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.910
 and it is really quite right here 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.920
 different plastic is here a foreign word 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.899
 This is completely made of metal here 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.640
 lattice because the donors also beautiful 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.740
 massive and thick so that report 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.380
 absolutely not from then the cloth nice 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.090
 sticks everything really super super good 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.439
 made 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.119
 Also the design of the speakers is 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.340
 really very chic by this 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.530
 slight rounding back so 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.140
 both up here and at the side 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.020
 as the form really very very elegant 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.689
 and so the whole package so the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.640
 entire look is really very noble 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.750
 whether you have a blind on it now or 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 Of course you can not do it yourself 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.009
 decide both looks very good 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.299
 this being blind without of course 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.590
 Also a bit chic 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.890
 because you go there I can see 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.409
 can 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.290
 looks pretty cool then 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.990
 you still have five color variations of it 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.909
 are 3 different real wood of hers 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.880
 and then there are still 100 euros 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.740
 surcharge high-gloss versions each 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.570
 in black and white here you see 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.930
 especially the glossy black version 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.500
 the tweeter of imagine mini is one 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.200
 25 mm the tan calotte during the deep 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.380
 midrange here a 102 millimeters 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.450
 ceramic membrane 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.009
 then the exact name 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.230
 just from the shooting ranges too 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:20.890
 again shown here the dimensions 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:22.510
 are 14 3 cm x 23 4 cm x 21.2 cm and that 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.260
 whole at a weight of three 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.940
 kilogram 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.620
 this is a 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.230
 magnetically shielded bass reflex 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.239
 system for that we have in the back yes too 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.819
 the opening for the air exchange and 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.890
 while a compact system yes mostly 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.560
 no subwoofer is used it is 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.049
 just important that the boxing alone 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.360
 just make a decent deal 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.880
 because without what without the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.380
 reasonable low notes music was missing yes 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.640
 a big part or even if you are now 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.950
 in the living room with it for example movies 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.200
 Look or anything else would be easy 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.239
 but what is missing then most of the time 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.620
 imagine mini really pretty good so 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.090
 one dares these little boxes 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.819
 actually not to that so 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.349
 have a full bass over the two 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.230
 connections here will be the speakers 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.099
 then connected to an amplifier and 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.049
 that's all nice again 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.250
 marked her with plus and minus 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.590
 and again in color to the 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.390
 So that's all very important 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.280
 nicely done we can not just do that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.569
 from the bottom that would connect 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.340
 actually only go downstairs if that 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.569
 hanging on the wall we have so too 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.579
 if we stand the normal way 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.130
 possibility the cables then back here 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.709
 so really to think with 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.930
 then we come now to the sound quality there 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.880
 Of course it is extremely important with what 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.109
 for an accessory we imagine the minis 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.329
 operate here at all 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.420
 I had a power amplifier from 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.010
 peachtree audio and indeed the cover of the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.989
 also comes in one of the next videos 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.459
 here with me as a test so necessarily 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.870
 stay tuned if he already 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.940
 is published if you just 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.459
 looks then up here also directly 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.950
 a link then of course that is 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.590
 Cable very important and I had that 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.569
 per 12 speaker cables from straight 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.400
 By the way, the links are also there 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.660
 all in the video description and man 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.850
 you can already see that that really is 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.620
 a very decent cable is also the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.540
 contacts up here everything beautifully gilded 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.920
 So the right accessory is very 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.959
 important and then you should also 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.639
 not for example on the cable save if 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.400
 then you have the right accessories and 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.170
 the whole thing 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.450
 closes then comes only once the series 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.660
 effect you do not expect this 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.280
 Small plant such a great one 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.709
 detailed small brings out and before 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.020
 not that they have such a deep and 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.520
 powerful water has so that's 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.990
 really incredible though here 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.000
 The subwoofer is missing like that 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.400
 compact systems is common we have 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.380
 an incredibly good powerful bass 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.050
 and I like that pretty much for that 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.840
 a compact system and the other 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.300
 Sound is really very detailed 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.280
 and sounds very dynamic and wants 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.740
 Do not stop music to one without it 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.630
 is fun to keep hearing and that 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.370
 That's what it's supposed to do 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.720
 So I enjoy music and I like that 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.510
 Hold on to this very well 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.300
 Speakers super good workmanship 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.550
 chic design and a stunning 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.620
 sound that is exactly what you have 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.570
 I want to and that is exactly what 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.280
 you get her with the imagine minis 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.139
 We really like the speakers 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.360
 very good so have a very nice one 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.370
 Sounded despite missing subwoofer 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.810
 Superpass by the small size can 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.880
 you can put it anywhere it is 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.979
 into the shelf or somewhere else 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.510
 you can optionally still a wall holder 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.099
 order it then you can do that too 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.900
 Mount somewhere on the wall 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.820
 So the possibilities are real 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.860
 varied and the performance here 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.639
 is offered is really very good 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.970
 they should cost 800 eur or in the 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.810
 high gloss finish 900 euro now listens 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.099
 The first much 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.870
 of course, but I can you 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.280
 assure the facility is really everyone 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.870
 cent worth for the performance you 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.409
 this is really totally in 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.060
 order 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.860
 then we are now at the end 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.240
 I pray you remember that 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.159
 now a video in the mouth of the 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.099
 really was upscale 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.750
 and that's why not everyone writes like that now 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.639
 a lot of money for such a facility or what it 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.620
 is really worth it if you like that 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.159
 have heard then understand what 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.320
 I mean 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:59.210
 yes thank you for watching and 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.620
 thanks again to psb the links 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.760
 are in the video description and me 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.389
 Hope to see you next time 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.389
 again, it's good
