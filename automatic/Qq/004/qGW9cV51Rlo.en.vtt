00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.750
 divided into three seasons but the story is 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.160
 far from over 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.260
 in fact the producers are already at work

 they tried to bring something 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.529
 different indeed everything is set to 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.210
 our days 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.239
 eight hundred but a technological bored and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.410
 how grumpy investigator of the

 anderson un for the low area the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.410
 IQ of the whole 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.239

 I'm not a psychopath anderson are 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.629
 an operational sociopath in the form of in 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.120
 everything is masterfully managed between 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.280
 surprises and reconfirmation and all the cast has 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.530
 done an impressive job we note 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.199
 an almost obsessive attention to detail 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.030
 but let's move on to the charlotte protagonists 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.800
 as we said before is not the same 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.160
 character that dal describes in his 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.589
 books 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.799
 instead of the pipe thing generations 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.750
 chain to communicate use of text messages and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 especially not to the etiquette that to leave it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.010
 so once it had to lead 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.780
 with himself and the free to be rude 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.460
 to offend and prove again by 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.130

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.720

 arguments against such artisans gmati 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.220
 I know that you are a military doctor 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.299
 been injured in Afghanistan and I know that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.659
 opportunity will be constellation to bring 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.729

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.340
 the words of sherlock his character 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.689
 slowly he will break away from the role of 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.250
 who will take the same position 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.860
 importance of the same sherlock 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.869

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.409
 watching the series also because its 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.849
 figure will be deepened only at the end 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.470
 of the first season but I can 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.620
 assure he already has that he is one of the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.659
 more cared for characters so if you like it 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.069
 investigative yellow if you are 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.379

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.890
 doyle but if you've never heard of it 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.680
