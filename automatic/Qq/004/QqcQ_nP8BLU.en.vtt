00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.160 
stirring I just think that looks awesome
ok<00:02:57.760> 2<00:02:57.820> more<00:02:58.120> minutes<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.510> go<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.660> have<00:02:58.959> my

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
ok 2 more minutes to go I have my

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.970 
ok 2 more minutes to go I have my
temperature<00:02:59.770> on<00:02:59.950> a<00:02:59.980> 3<00:03:01.110> -<00:03:02.110> between<00:03:02.410> low<00:03:02.950> and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
temperature on a 3 - between low and

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.470 
temperature on a 3 - between low and
high<00:03:03.959> 0<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.050> 9<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> 3<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.190> perfect<00:03:06.700> for<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.360> to

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
high 0 to 9 so a 3 is perfect for it to

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.260 
high 0 to 9 so a 3 is perfect for it to
boil<00:03:07.660> without<00:03:08.020> stirring<00:03:08.670> okay<00:03:09.700> while<00:03:09.910> that<00:03:10.120> is

just usually let it cool off for a

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.890 
just usually let it cool off for a
second<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.700> eat<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.060> straight<00:05:31.450> out<00:05:31.750> of<00:05:31.780> the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
second and eat it straight out of the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.290 
second and eat it straight out of the
bowl<00:05:32.110> nice<00:05:32.440> and<00:05:32.710> warm<00:05:32.950> but<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.669> recipe<00:05:33.850> does

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
bowl nice and warm but the recipe does

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.930 
bowl nice and warm but the recipe does
say<00:05:34.510> that<00:05:34.660> you<00:05:34.750> can<00:05:34.930> spread<00:05:35.260> it<00:05:35.320> on<00:05:35.940> cookie

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
say that you can spread it on cookie

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.990 
say that you can spread it on cookie
sheets<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.360> bake<00:05:37.540> for<00:05:37.570> 1<00:05:38.020> hour<00:05:38.229> at<00:05:38.440> 225<00:05:39.130> strain

it<00:05:40.150> occasionally<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:40.780> it<00:05:40.990> will<00:05:41.080> harden<00:05:41.380> up

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560

but<00:05:42.340> in<00:05:42.460> my<00:05:42.580> experience<00:05:43.090> if<00:05:43.240> you<00:05:43.840> actually<00:05:44.080> let

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
but in my experience if you actually let

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.900 
but in my experience if you actually let
it<00:05:44.560> cool<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.800> little<00:05:44.890> bit<00:05:45.130> and<00:05:45.280> then<00:05:45.610> you<00:05:45.790> can

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
it cool a little bit and then you can

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.400
