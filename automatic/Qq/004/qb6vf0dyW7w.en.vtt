hopeless<00:01:29.710> two<00:01:29.860> patter<00:01:30.070> of<00:01:30.720> meiosis<00:01:31.720> and

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
hopeless two patter of meiosis and

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.720 
hopeless two patter of meiosis and
default<00:01:33.370> it<00:01:33.490> all<00:01:33.610> out<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:35.320> can<00:01:35.500> see<00:01:35.740> all<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
default it all out you can see all the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.270 
default it all out you can see all the
liquid<00:01:37.150> that's<00:01:37.360> in<00:01:37.480> that<00:01:37.690> meiosis<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.500> some

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
liquid that's in that meiosis and some

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.650 
liquid that's in that meiosis and some
of<00:01:39.340> that's<00:01:39.430> water<00:01:39.730> some<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.360> is<00:01:40.510> the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
of that's water some of that is the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.860 
of that's water some of that is the
nutrients<00:01:41.080> actually<00:01:41.470> coming<00:01:41.740> out<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:41.980> the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
nutrients actually coming out of the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.250 
nutrients actually coming out of the
meiosis<00:01:43.870> itself<00:01:44.320> but<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:46.690> reason<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:47.050> do<00:01:47.110> this

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
meiosis itself but the reason I do this

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.980 
meiosis itself but the reason I do this
is<00:01:47.470> because<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:48.910> fish<00:01:49.120> will<00:01:49.330> eat<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.570> meiosis

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
is because the fish will eat the meiosis

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.950 
is because the fish will eat the meiosis
but<00:01:50.230> not<00:01:50.380> all<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.920> liquid<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:51.640> your<00:01:52.540> skimmer

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
but not all the liquid so your skimmer

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.790 
but not all the liquid so your skimmer
is<00:01:53.020> gonna<00:01:53.170> have<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.320> deal<00:01:53.500> with<00:01:53.650> all<00:01:53.770> that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
is gonna have to deal with all that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.250 
is gonna have to deal with all that
liquid<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.820> if<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.030> doesn't<00:01:55.210> ask<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.170> to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
liquid and if it doesn't ask is going to

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.590 
liquid and if it doesn't ask is going to
in<00:01:56.620> turn<00:01:56.920> raise<00:01:57.400> your<00:01:57.610> nitrates<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.300> raise

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
in turn raise your nitrates and raise

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.840 
in turn raise your nitrates and raise
your<00:01:58.750> phosphates<00:01:59.230> so<00:02:00.040> if<00:02:00.250> we<00:02:00.370> can<00:02:00.490> get<00:02:00.580> rid<00:02:00.640> of

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
your phosphates so if we can get rid of

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.480 
your phosphates so if we can get rid of
some<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.090> liquid<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:02.160> improve<00:02:03.160> the

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
some of that liquid and improve the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.820 
some of that liquid and improve the
quality<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.420> food<00:02:04.600> by<00:02:04.840> adding<00:02:05.200> vitality

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
quality of the food by adding vitality

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.070 
quality of the food by adding vitality
and<00:02:06.160> garlic<00:02:06.520> guard<00:02:06.760> I<00:02:07.000> think<00:02:07.630> it's<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.780> win-win

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
and garlic guard I think it's a win-win

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.100 
and garlic guard I think it's a win-win
situation<00:02:08.110> really<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.760> what<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:09.970> do<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:11.050> get

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
situation really so what I do is I get

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.500 
situation really so what I do is I get
an<00:02:11.290> old<00:02:11.470> fish<00:02:12.190> net<00:02:12.460> which<00:02:12.790> I've<00:02:12.940> cut<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.330> net

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
an old fish net which I've cut the net

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.330 
an old fish net which I've cut the net
the<00:02:13.660> rim<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.080> net<00:02:14.260> out<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.250> I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
the rim of the net out and and I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.150 
the rim of the net out and and I
basically<00:02:16.440> get<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:19.150> pour<00:02:19.450> off<00:02:19.720> all<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
basically get that and pour off all the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.270 
basically get that and pour off all the
frozen<00:02:21.640> food<00:02:22.270> into<00:02:22.690> their<00:02:22.900> default<00:02:23.830> frozen

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
frozen food into their default frozen

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.340 
frozen food into their default frozen
food<00:02:24.570> into<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.750> net<00:02:26.610> give<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.730> quick<00:02:28.350> squeeze

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
food into the net give a quick squeeze

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.820 
food into the net give a quick squeeze
out<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.820> see<00:02:31.090> all<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.570> liquid<00:02:31.989> brown

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
out as you can see all the liquid brown

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.760 
out as you can see all the liquid brown
liquid<00:02:33.310> coming<00:02:33.580> out<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.500> which<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.650> going

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
liquid coming out of that which is going

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.050 
liquid coming out of that which is going
to<00:02:35.830> go<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.040> your<00:02:36.160> tank<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.700> raise<00:02:36.880> your

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
to go in your tank and raise your

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.650 
to go in your tank and raise your
nitrates<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.660> phosphates<00:02:39.450> you'll<00:02:40.450> probably

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
nitrates and phosphates you'll probably

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.750 
nitrates and phosphates you'll probably
find<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.320> most<00:02:41.530> frozen<00:02:42.070> foods<00:02:42.340> will<00:02:42.640> be

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
find this with most frozen foods will be

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.640 
find this with most frozen foods will be
the<00:02:42.910> same<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.989> just<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.230> way<00:02:44.470> it's

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
the same it's just the way it's

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.560 
the same it's just the way it's
manufactured<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:46.270> way<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.540> food

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
manufactured and the way the food

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.170 
manufactured and the way the food
behaves<00:02:48.690> take<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.900> food<00:02:50.830> out<00:02:51.040> pop<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.150> back

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
behaves take that food out pop it back

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.220 
behaves take that food out pop it back
in<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.570> jug<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:53.970> put<00:02:54.970> four<00:02:55.450> cupfuls<00:02:55.720> of

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
in the jug I put four cupfuls of

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.940 
in the jug I put four cupfuls of
vitality<00:02:56.739> n<00:02:57.190> which<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.180> amino<00:02:58.660> acid<00:02:59.050> and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
vitality n which is the amino acid and

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.160 
vitality n which is the amino acid and
vitamin<00:03:00.750> supplement<00:03:03.390> okay<00:03:04.390> should<00:03:04.780> give<00:03:04.930> up<00:03:05.050> a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
vitamin supplement okay should give up a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:20.050 
vitamin supplement okay should give up a
little<00:03:05.500> shake<00:03:06.390> quick<00:03:07.390> shake

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.150 

and<00:03:21.060> then<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.300> give<00:03:21.480> three<00:03:21.990> capfuls<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.710> garlic

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and then I give three capfuls of garlic

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:32.820 
and then I give three capfuls of garlic
guard

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:41.480 

kind<00:03:33.490> of<00:03:33.550> guide<00:03:33.970> smells<00:03:34.330> strong<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:35.350> garlic

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.210 

and<00:03:42.490> they're<00:03:42.640> like<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.910> could<00:03:43.180> swell<00:03:43.480> round

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.450 

like<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.550> so<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.000> can<00:03:49.180> absorb<00:03:49.540> all<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:50.460> amino

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
like so so it can absorb all the amino

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.870 
like so so it can absorb all the amino
acids<00:03:52.000> like<00:03:52.480> bitumens<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.710> garlic<00:03:54.160> all<00:03:54.430> up<00:03:54.730> in

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
acids like bitumens and garlic all up in

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.410 
acids like bitumens and garlic all up in
it<00:03:55.030> really<00:03:56.190> does<00:03:57.190> smell<00:03:57.490> strong<00:03:57.820> I<00:04:00.300> leave<00:04:01.300> that

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
it really does smell strong I leave that

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.230 
it really does smell strong I leave that
soaked<00:04:01.780> now<00:04:01.990> for<00:04:02.290> an<00:04:02.770> hour<00:04:02.950> or<00:04:03.130> so<00:04:05.910> right<00:04:06.910> let

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
soaked now for an hour or so right let

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.520 
soaked now for an hour or so right let
me<00:04:07.410> mixture<00:04:08.410> now<00:04:08.590> soak<00:04:09.070> for<00:04:09.220> about<00:04:09.310> an<00:04:09.550> hour

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
me mixture now soak for about an hour

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.770 
me mixture now soak for about an hour
not<00:04:11.530> all<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.770> liquid<00:04:12.070> is<00:04:12.190> absorbed<00:04:12.540> up<00:04:13.540> into

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
not all the liquid is absorbed up into

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.330 
not all the liquid is absorbed up into
the<00:04:13.900> food<00:04:14.080> but<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:14.470> doesn't<00:04:14.680> really<00:04:15.040> matter

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
the food but that doesn't really matter

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.550 
the food but that doesn't really matter
because<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:16.390> amino<00:04:16.690> acids<00:04:17.080> will<00:04:17.260> actually

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
because the amino acids will actually

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.960 
because the amino acids will actually
work<00:04:17.739> if<00:04:17.950> they're<00:04:18.070> just<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.489> water<00:04:18.670> as

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
work if they're just in the water as

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.930 
work if they're just in the water as
well<00:04:19.209> as<00:04:19.390> being<00:04:19.690> in<00:04:19.840> their<00:04:20.020> food<00:04:20.520> so<00:04:21.520> now<00:04:21.730> the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
well as being in their food so now the

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.410 
well as being in their food so now the
next<00:04:22.090> step<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:23.260> pre-prep<00:04:24.190> this<00:04:24.430> sister<00:04:24.760> get

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
next step is to pre-prep this sister get

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.150 
next step is to pre-prep this sister get
this<00:04:25.570> in<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.750> nice<00:04:25.960> little<00:04:26.290> plastic<00:04:26.500> bag<00:04:26.920> you

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.030 
this in a nice little plastic bag you
can<00:04:27.310> use<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:27.550> sandwich<00:04:28.360> bag<00:04:28.600> any<00:04:29.320> food<00:04:29.710> grade

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
can use a sandwich bag any food grade

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.370 
can use a sandwich bag any food grade
bags<00:04:30.070> will<00:04:30.550> be<00:04:30.670> just<00:04:30.940> fine<00:04:31.170> what<00:04:32.170> I'm<00:04:32.230> going<00:04:32.350> to

no<00:04:50.650> package<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:53.260> what<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.410> do<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:54.060> flatten<00:04:55.060> this

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
no package and what I do is flatten this

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.530 
no package and what I do is flatten this
out<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:56.460> nice<00:04:57.460> thin<00:04:57.760> layer<00:04:58.380> and<00:04:59.380> then<00:05:00.300> pop<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:01.450> in

out a nice thin layer and then pop it in

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.780 
out a nice thin layer and then pop it in
the<00:05:01.600> freezer<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.230> freeze<00:05:02.470> solid<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:03.730> the
