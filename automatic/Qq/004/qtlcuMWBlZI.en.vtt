 hi friends from youtube i am giving in this 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.509
 new video tutorial we will learn how to 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.490
 make games even in the 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.139
 computer and the internet have given us a 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.429
 little faster than not being treated 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.220
 both the computer and 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.350
 they usually know how to do 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.300
 the program is called line up in the 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.100
 description of the video I will leave you a 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.160
 link so you can download it is 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.020
 Free is in app basically in what 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.120
 which consists of the program is a program 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.660
 that changes the configuration of our 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.989
 windows to a basic windows windows 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.359
 98 for example so that the machine does not 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.969
 bind us so much once downloaded the 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.960
 program we open it once the 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:50.289
 program we go down here and there 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.730
 we will have activated the program we do 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.960
 click there and we will get this window 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.280
 inclusive that we get the status of the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.800
 system 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.930
 that has detected errors and we can 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.379
 optimize the equipment clean all 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.500
 mistakes a maintenance also does if 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.740
 we configure it every 15 days each 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.079
 hour 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.409
 and now we'll go where it says tour mode or 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.850
 for windows we press the button there and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.340
 we will begin to change the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.049
 configuration to a basic windows for 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.049
 that the machine does not swallow them so much 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.740
 they saw how the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.010
 look at the bar 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.100
 including the folders 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.380
 everything is changed to a common windows 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.860
 although the machine does not look very pretty 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.689
 it works to make it faster 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.729
 then to deactivate it we do 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.680
 exactly the same we go the little symbol 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:56.860
 from tayna we click there and make another 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.549
 once click on the turn button to 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.840
 windows and everything will be returned to us as 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.840
 we had configured before 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.370
