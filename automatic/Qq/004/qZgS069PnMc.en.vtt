00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:11.329
 Socks have now filled up the situation reasonably 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:13.559
 and yes 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.140
 here we are the game Arminia against ten we take stock of this now 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.419
 so far negative 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:23.119
 But once you have a scooter, the galaxies ultimately turn out to be positive 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.239
 is 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.409
 So we at the now a city 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:29.570
 I will 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.519
 a gummi developed 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.780
 Use Paul pattern that has proven very well 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.600
 So here's two in a row and then comes a way 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.910
 that's the road network now 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.290
 and up here 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.470
 comes in there 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.580
 built a market victim 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.710
 and then even more dull in the way 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.710
 Danzig SID then look like this 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.940
 a good one percent too 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.950
 me here 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.480
 we're going to build it now 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 a few more houses 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.290
 and the PI are not coming yet 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 now we have to build stands at Marc 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.980
 but here we leave a place free 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.280
 which is then for the tavern that will soon follow 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.280
 sda 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.460
 and this cross pattern 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.700
 that is good for the market stalls so in the middle comes the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.680
 Cloth and leather the king stood on a side exit of the thriller Zidan von 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.800
 shopping on all sides should be first 100 already 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.070
 and buy 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.470
 Leather or fabric r stood under near-time help here 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.820
 Here you always get new food that means then you have to subscribe to the people on it 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.820
 Not so important at the beginning 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 then expand once 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.389
 so now we have reached enough residents commented house to build 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.280
 However, we dive for the tavern alcohol 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.599
 the alcohol 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.379
 Wels because he has produced with the small farm 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:26.609
 this means 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.879
 yes here closely with that Kurth 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.579
 over Lapland 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.019
 when we 4 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.139
 small flames 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.989
 now animals come out here too they produce food 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.170
 the party 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.499
 if you click here 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.269
 a potato field is continued 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.669
 Here we do it too 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.129
 and here 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.959
 and here 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.809
 Now the animals are disappearing and the company has specialized in al-ko 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.949
 The Mater Way 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.949
 Now Alcoa is produced 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.549
 angry 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.620
 Now we see we already have it 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.169
 relatively little tool 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.140
 Of course, it is still abundant on the ship 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.360
 but that will not take long 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.909
 that is also the way it is 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.059
 here hoped counterattack and then on was Lenka open 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.829
 Here we lay out the tool 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.609
 here we make 4 CT for the price of 52 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.129
 and then percent is coming 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.170
 archery 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.069
 if free traders stole Jahner 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.139
 who else 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.909
 around the tools the app delivers 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.979
 sda 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.979
 court tool too - so do not worry anymore 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.399
 meanwhile we can also enlarge the city a bit 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.729
 so we have now 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.889
 five houses in a row will add another sixth 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.749
 and now 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.159
 comes to the European Championship 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.159
 who strips 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.229
 thus 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.119
 is 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.399
 The city is very good you can very nice here in Bern 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.809
 in it up here 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.809
 Okay, we need tools now 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.349
 already we have again 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.860
 up here 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 ProMarkt has off 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 and her parents 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:41.699
 that is the basic structure of the city 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.840
 Here in this strip are the whole operation percent holdings 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.520
 public building 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.129
 settled 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.629
 and that is 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:56.110
 40 children from the catchment area on the lowest inhabitants here 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.110
 to get 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.930
 we still feel the event 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.050
 now again look at the camp 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.139
 Kurth alcohol is a bit slow that lasts 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.509
 the other is good 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.229
 bin Laden is also already a bit more positive 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.310
 but really positive 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.889
 wat me first 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.889
 below to quote the first pioneers 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.249
 Gould 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:31.759
 so 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.389
 just take a look 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.680
 since when an alcohol bar clover 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.020
 we build the tavern 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.690
 It is important that we always should 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.050
 where that is head of the market whether house stand 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.050
 because it can be as fast as possible 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.469
 pick up the alcohol 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.469
 but it is possible that it is in the building 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.009
 and running into the house meets house right here is the 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.770
 and he gets the alcohol now and then goes back 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.289
 sda now the inhabitants are really only the chapel and then they can 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.289
 also stuck 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.440
 so we'll build the chapel right away 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:22.099
 There was still room for a fire department that will be needed later 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:24.409
 it will also 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.409
 always fires in the city 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.529
 So now all of them are going to church together 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:35.089
 and 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:38.919
 As soon as these 2 needs are met he will be in Beijing 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.830
 Kuhrt 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.830
 and here are the first settlers 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:52.219
 I still have the same needs as a pioneer 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.630
 and once you have reached a certain number you need one too 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:57.259
 school 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.210
 expert 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.509
 a school can be built which is important to invent things 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:06.449
 for example the fire department 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:07.330
 but that 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.160
 simple 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.680
 that will come in the next step 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.550
 So we did it once 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.379
 To achieve goals and distributed in the next one, I show you how to do it now 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:19.600
 really to one 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.699
 positive balance comes 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.050
 and then you too 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.850
 8 to pilgrim his settlers 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.270
 set up 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.499
 that was it until the next goal crown
