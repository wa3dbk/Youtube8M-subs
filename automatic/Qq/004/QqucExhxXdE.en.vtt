properly timed that way you know your
governors<00:02:54.079> time<00:02:54.650> properly<00:02:54.980> we're<00:02:55.610> going<00:02:55.730> to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
governors time properly we're going to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.060 
governors time properly we're going to
do<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.120> we're<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.660> take<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.290> we're

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
do is we're going to take this and we're

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.789 
do is we're going to take this and we're
going<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.220> rotate<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.360> so<00:03:00.079> that<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.350> lines<00:03:00.560> up

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
going to rotate this so that it lines up

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.870 
going to rotate this so that it lines up
up<00:03:01.340> here<00:03:01.910> or<00:03:02.150> as<00:03:02.780> close<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.170> as<00:03:03.260> possible

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
up here or as close to it as possible

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.130 
up here or as close to it as possible
then<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.120> rotate<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.540> backwards<00:03:05.750> so<00:03:06.110> you

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
then you rotate it backwards so you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.410 
then you rotate it backwards so you
don't<00:03:06.350> get<00:03:06.410> snapped<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:07.820> bring<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.180> back

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
don't get snapped you bring this back

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.050 
don't get snapped you bring this back
this<00:03:08.600> way<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:10.070> bring<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.459> almost

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
this way and you bring it to almost

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.789 
this way and you bring it to almost
where<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.540> trips<00:03:11.810> but<00:03:12.019> not<00:03:12.230> quite<00:03:12.590> where<00:03:12.769> it

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
where it trips but not quite where it

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:13.780 
where it trips but not quite where it
trips<00:03:13.070> you'll<00:03:13.220> feel<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.370> little<00:03:13.579> resistance

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
trips you'll feel a little resistance

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.210 
trips you'll feel a little resistance
right<00:03:14.239> about<00:03:14.450> there<00:03:14.660> that's<00:03:15.440> right<00:03:15.950> after

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
right about there that's right after

right about there that's right after
number<00:03:16.549> one<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.940> fired<00:03:17.180> so<00:03:17.630> now<00:03:18.049> we'll<00:03:18.200> go

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
number one is fired so now we'll go

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.650 
number one is fired so now we'll go
uninstall<00:03:18.769> it<00:03:18.829> on<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:18.980> tractor<00:03:19.480> all<00:03:20.480> right
