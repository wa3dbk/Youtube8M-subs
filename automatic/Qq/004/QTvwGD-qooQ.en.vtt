00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello your sewing pillar and in this video 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.060
 we will learn how to make a buttonhole and 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.180
 sew a button 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.430
 we have a job with low points but 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.240
 in the same way it could be with points 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.590
 tall 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.190
 this time we are going to make a buttonhole 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.230
 jumping the two low points 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.410
 1 and 2 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.400
 then we would make a chain and two 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.300
 cadenetas we jump the two base points and 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:39.640
 in the third we make the low point already 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.560
 we have made the hole of lohan 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.280
 now I will give a return to the work 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.880
 we would say doing it until a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.880
 body 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.010
 in the same hole make the 2 points 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.010
 low 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.090
 the two of us who had jumped 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.280
 previously 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.820
 if we want if the button larger 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.540
 we would do it with more jumps 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.540
 low points 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.980
 we already have the buttonhole made 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.760
 now let's see how we do with the 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.760
 needle 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.750
 gin 1 the enebral sometimes yes 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.210
 a little small we have to use a 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.210
 Sewing needle like this patient 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.979
 and you are forming we know a button 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.579
 to the other part of the work that we 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.579
 we need 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.090
 this button is known in the same way in 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.840
 a needle in a sock 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.760
 or in a confession of a pledge 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.870
 you have to take a turn to reinforce it 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.870
 and again 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.100
 get me white 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.100
 from behind we give a couple of stitches 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.280
 with the scissors therefore 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.200
 Remember that depends on the button 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.550
 number of points that we skip if 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.040
