adobe<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:51.320> something<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.649> custom

adobe one something like this custom

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799 
adobe one something like this custom
intro<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:53.730> that's<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.690> also
