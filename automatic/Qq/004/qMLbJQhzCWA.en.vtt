00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
as I think there's only a few changes

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.780 
as I think there's only a few changes
with<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> permissions<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.160> needed<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
with the permissions that needed just a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.900 
with the permissions that needed just a
minute<00:00:36.320> em<00:00:37.320> last<00:00:37.980> night<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.579> did<00:00:39.200> skyblock<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
minute em last night we did skyblock and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.440 
minute em last night we did skyblock and
that<00:00:42.530> started<00:00:43.530> off<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> big<00:00:44.129> fail<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> die

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that started off as a big fail and die

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.450
