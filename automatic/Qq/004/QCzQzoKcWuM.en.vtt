officially change your major another
question<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.440> we<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.040> how<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.310> math

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
question that we get is how much math

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.760 
question that we get is how much math
and<00:01:17.880> science<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.450> required<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.140> computer

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and science is required for computer

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100 
and science is required for computer
science<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.340> engineering<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:21.390> there's<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.869> lot

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
science and engineering if there's a lot

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
science and engineering if there's a lot
of<00:01:22.140> math<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.650> science<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.119> well

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
of math and science you have to be well

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.570 
of math and science you have to be well
prepared<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.260> calculus<00:01:25.710> physics<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
prepared in calculus physics and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.770 
prepared in calculus physics and
chemistry<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> fairly<00:01:29.400> good

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
chemistry and you have a fairly good

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.859 
chemistry and you have a fairly good
ability<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.140> understand<00:01:31.890> logic<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.869> work

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
ability to understand logic and work

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.320 
ability to understand logic and work
with<00:01:34.170> technology<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.970> good<00:01:36.090> fit

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
with technology and so that's a good fit

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.810 
with technology and so that's a good fit
for<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.689> that's<00:01:37.560> usually<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> usually<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
for you that's usually this is usually a
