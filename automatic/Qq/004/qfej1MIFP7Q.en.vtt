so<00:00:39.760> this<00:00:39.940> is<00:00:41.280> inside<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.550> barn<00:00:42.820> here<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.550> can

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
so this is inside the barn here you can

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.819 
so this is inside the barn here you can
see<00:00:46.030> just<00:00:46.059> in<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.719> ceiling<00:00:47.260> there<00:00:47.469> we<00:00:47.680> have

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
see just in the ceiling there we have

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.729 
see just in the ceiling there we have
three<00:00:48.280> cameras<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.379> just<00:00:50.739> see<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:52.469> end<00:00:53.469> of

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
three cameras and just see the end of

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.539 
three cameras and just see the end of
the<00:00:53.890> camera<00:00:54.399> coming<00:00:54.670> down<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.329> first<00:00:55.629> one

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:56.549 
the camera coming down the first one

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:59.880 
the camera coming down the first one
basically<00:00:57.549> we've<00:00:58.149> used<00:00:58.449> three<00:00:58.780> cameras<00:00:59.530> to

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
basically we've used three cameras to

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.660 
basically we've used three cameras to
capture<00:01:00.549> the<00:01:01.030> entire<00:01:01.149> barn<00:01:01.839> here<00:01:05.399> there's<00:01:06.399> one

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
capture the entire barn here there's one

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.859 
capture the entire barn here there's one
of<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.940> cameras<00:01:07.420> there<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:10.360> this<00:01:10.659> is<00:01:10.899> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
of the cameras there so this is the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.469 
of the cameras there so this is the
wireless<00:01:13.869> antenna<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:15.670> we<00:01:15.819> have<00:01:16.030> installed

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
wireless antenna that we have installed

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.690 
wireless antenna that we have installed
at<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.890> barn<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:20.020> this<00:01:20.289> is<00:01:20.530> where<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.130> cameras

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
at the barn so this is where the cameras

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.639 
at the barn so this is where the cameras
and<00:01:21.850> everything<00:01:21.940> are<00:01:22.390> installed<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.200> this<00:01:23.380> is

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
and everything are installed and this is

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.399 
and everything are installed and this is
antenna<00:01:24.580> links<00:01:25.119> back<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.750> house<00:01:25.929> we<00:01:26.259> have

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
antenna links back to the house we have

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.499 
antenna links back to the house we have
two<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.830> these<00:01:27.009> antennas<00:01:27.869> installed<00:01:30.509> so

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
two of these antennas installed so

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.200 
two of these antennas installed so
that's<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.960> house<00:01:32.170> over<00:01:32.619> there<00:01:32.800> I'm<00:01:33.250> now

the wall there of the barn so there's
the<00:02:27.550> wireless<00:02:28.060> antenna<00:02:28.660> here<00:02:29.019> installed<00:02:29.620> at

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
the wireless antenna here installed at

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.619 
the wireless antenna here installed at
the<00:02:30.040> house<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:32.590> unit<00:02:33.099> links<00:02:33.819> directly<00:02:34.150> to

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
the house so that unit links directly to

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.619 
the house so that unit links directly to
the<00:02:34.780> barn<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:36.099> have<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.310> nice<00:02:36.610> strong<00:02:37.150> link

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.770 
the barn that we have a nice strong link
between<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:39.489> two<00:02:39.700> buildings<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
between the two buildings so that the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.040 
between the two buildings so that the
cameras<00:02:41.230> can<00:02:41.470> be<00:02:41.620> viewed<00:02:41.920> now<00:02:42.129> on<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.489> house

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
cameras can be viewed now on the house

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.660 
cameras can be viewed now on the house
and<00:02:43.140> also<00:02:43.590> while<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.220> client<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.820> away<00:02:46.670> so

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
and also while the client is away so
