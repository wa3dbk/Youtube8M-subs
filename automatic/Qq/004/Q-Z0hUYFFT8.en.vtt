00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
all the way and realizes the race is

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.100 
all the way and realizes the race is
about<00:03:51.360> 60<00:03:51.960> meters<00:03:52.320> not<00:03:52.830> 50<00:03:53.370> not<00:03:53.790> 55<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.750> worked

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
about 60 meters not 50 not 55 I worked

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.870 
about 60 meters not 50 not 55 I worked
all<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.620> way<00:03:55.650> through<00:03:55.770> to<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.250> line<00:03:56.490> addition

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
all the way through to the line addition

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.840 
all the way through to the line addition
gets<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.630> jump<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.050> shoulder<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:59.550> think

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
gets to jump the shoulder I just think

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.080 
gets to jump the shoulder I just think
she<00:04:00.030> needs<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.420> little<00:04:00.450> bit<00:04:01.110> stronger<00:04:02.090> stronger

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
she needs a little bit stronger stronger

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.600 
she needs a little bit stronger stronger
but<00:04:03.780> either<00:04:04.080> way<00:04:04.440> there<00:04:04.709> was<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.830> crack<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.280> race

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
but either way there was a crack in race

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.310 
but either way there was a crack in race
as<00:04:05.850> I'm<00:04:05.970> look<00:04:06.120> at<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.450> angle<00:04:06.630> now<00:04:06.900> how<00:04:07.260> the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
as I'm look at this angle now how the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.620 
as I'm look at this angle now how the
blocks<00:04:07.740> showed<00:04:08.490> them<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.790> very<00:04:09.090> good<00:04:09.240> that

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
blocks showed them a very good that

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.530 
blocks showed them a very good that
obviously<00:04:09.990> Smith<00:04:10.500> who<00:04:11.010> really<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:12.209> man

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
obviously Smith who really is the man

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.470 
obviously Smith who really is the man
who<00:04:12.690> knows<00:04:12.810> everything<00:04:12.870> about<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:14.850> big<00:04:15.120> and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
who knows everything about that big and

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.590 
who knows everything about that big and
there's<00:04:16.320> Jose<00:04:16.709> can<00:04:17.580> focus<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.180> little<00:04:18.390> bit

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
there's Jose can focus a little bit

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.080 
there's Jose can focus a little bit
older<00:04:19.020> but<00:04:19.280> even<00:04:20.280> though<00:04:20.400> she's<00:04:20.609> not<00:04:20.640> quite<00:04:20.910> as

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
older but even though she's not quite as

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.540 
older but even though she's not quite as
rangy<00:04:21.570> their<00:04:21.750> projectile<00:04:22.680> she<00:04:22.890> worships<00:04:23.370> the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
rangy their projectile she worships the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.400 
rangy their projectile she worships the
line<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:23.970> she<00:04:24.060> didn't<00:04:24.390> even<00:04:24.510> just<00:04:24.960> one<00:04:25.230> see

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
line and she didn't even just one see

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.900 
line and she didn't even just one see
that<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.740> we've<00:04:25.860> got<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.220> official<00:04:26.430> result

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
that and we've got the official result

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.360 
that and we've got the official result
the<00:04:27.390> victory<00:04:27.780> does<00:04:28.110> go<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.470> Carmelita<00:04:29.130> Jetta
