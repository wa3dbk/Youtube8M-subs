00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.110
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.060
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.930
 Thank you in the morning for today 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.900
 About 5:40 Thank you in advance 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.690
 Today's theme is here 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.830
 To everyone called radish cutting down rotation serve 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.320
 I'm going to introduce this This is everyone deadly serve 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.130
 When it can not be used When deadly serve is not useful 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.460
 I think there are everyone but there is a service ace 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.000
 It will be a useful service when you can not take at all 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.260
 If you really can not get points in serving 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.001
 To the opponent who I thought in the actual match during the match to the third ball is easy to serve 

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.500
 I think I'm changing If there is no effect on the service there 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.180
 It is easy for me to develop the third game 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.940
 You can use it when you want to make it easy to hit 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.739
 It is a radish cut down rotation serve Today has a sense of cutting down the rotation 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.110
 Even if there is no one in this downward rotation 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.539
 Because you can remember the radish cutting 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.179
 Please try if you like 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:10.389
 Today's radish cutting and rotating service method 

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.799
 First of two steps 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.409
 There is a feature in how to make the face of this racket 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.719
 First of all, please prepare for everyone of the lower rotation serve 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.880
 At this time, the normal downward rotation is well cut 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.439
 I will usually bring the lower side of the ball 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.299
 The surface of the racket that catches is facing the ceiling 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.959
 It looks like the front side is facing the ceiling 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.130
 I think that I have put out the bottom rotation 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.939
 But this radish cutting down rotation serve is 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:45.459
 This aspect is to the vertical table tennis table 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:50.989
 I will do the vertical angle and hang 

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:53.781
 Be prepared to rotate the racket vertically 

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:55.851
 When I put it out, I made it vertical 

00:01:55.851 --> 00:02:05.739
 Please remember first 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.340
 I wonder why I would do something like this 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.540
 I will go to the second step of the procedure 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.150
 Make the racket face up when putting out the lower rotation serve 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.719
 Make the vertical angle the angle vertical and this time 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:26.299
 Please cut it from the top to the bottom in the feeling of cutting radish 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.730
 This is only when serving 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.769
 It is such a feeling to cut from the top to the bottom 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.790
 To make sure to make it short 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.370
 Please be conscious of everyone This radish cutting down rotation serve 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.909
 In a short serve of two-turn down rotation 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.859
 You can get a short serve with a pretty fast speed 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.090
 This is pretty big but short but fast serve 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:58.799
 It means that it can be put out 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.999
 This radish cutting down rotation serve is a short down rotation serving 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.629
 Because the ball speed is very fast 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.829
 So it is the receiving side that there is momentum of the ball 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.300
 When there is a momentum of the ball, it bounces back long 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.560
 Because it is easy to return, firmly receive 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:39.659
 It can be said that the serve is difficult to shorten 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.099
 Short serve, safe and third ball 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.319
 A long received hit is coming back 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.360
 It feels like it's simple and floats a little bit 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.860
 There are a lot of service Aces 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.249
 I want to score in the third game when I can not take it 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.299
 This serve is a pragmatic service that can be used quite 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.099
 I think I also 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.189
 When serving doesn't work at all 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.690
 Drive the third ball by putting this radish cutting down rotation service short 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.480
 Gon is a service that is easy to hit 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.529
 It feels like it cuts daikon from top to bottom 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.459
 Chung and radish to cut 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.120
 I feel like I'm cutting it 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.789
 It is two bound in Chun for short 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.780
 It's just good I put a turn in a tense scene 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.340
 I think there are many people who can not afford to hang out 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.139
 At that time the radish cutting down rotation serve 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.199
 If you turn the bottom slightly 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.780
 As it is only good, as frequency of use 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.889
 I think it is very expensive When I was brave 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.560
 For the time being, let's put out the radish cutting down rotation service. 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.650
 It's like a speed serve even though it's a short downward spin 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.590
 The other party is on the terrace so it feels like 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.650
 I'm getting busy but it's short 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.870
 I can feel quite fast, so I think it is Chikita 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.240
 It's a bit hard to do with a chikita or bench drive 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.400
 Coming quickly on a hard-to-fit table 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.370
 If you say serve, the receiving side is 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.370
 You have to hurry, so if you hurry there 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.500
 It is a stop to put in roughly with the tsutsuzuki 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.150
 As there are many scenes to try to match, when it becomes so 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.551
 A little fluffy and floating long simple reception 

00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:17.090
 I will go to Fuwan, so please hit 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.370
 Because you will usually receive a return 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.650
 You can hit a ball that says "Please hit it" 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:42.319
 So it's quite interesting 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.590
 Please try if you like 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.650
 Thank you very much
