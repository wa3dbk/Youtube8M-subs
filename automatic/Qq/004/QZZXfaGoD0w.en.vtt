00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
pretty big even though it was like a

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.469 
pretty big even though it was like a
burger<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:08.010> salad<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.430> salad<00:04:09.609> wasn't

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:10.479 
burger and a salad so the salad wasn't

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.740 
burger and a salad so the salad wasn't
too<00:04:11.109> much<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.759> tried<00:04:12.759> to<00:04:12.879> fill<00:04:13.030> up<00:04:13.150> on<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.329> salad

too much I tried to fill up on the salad

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.899 
too much I tried to fill up on the salad
before<00:04:14.049> I<00:04:14.079> went<00:04:14.259> into<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.530> burger<00:04:14.889> I<00:04:15.069> still
