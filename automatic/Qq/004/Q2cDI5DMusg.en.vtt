00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the market you know personally I think

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.709 
the market you know personally I think
that<00:00:49.230> antibacterial<00:00:49.620> soap<00:00:50.370> works<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:50.879> I'd

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that antibacterial soap works well I'd

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.750 
that antibacterial soap works well I'd
like<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> keep<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.920> temperature<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
like to keep the temperature of the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.380 
like to keep the temperature of the
water<00:00:53.969> too<00:00:54.539> warm<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.710> not<00:00:55.789> scalding<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:57.180> too

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
water too warm but not scalding or too

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
water too warm but not scalding or too
hot<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.170> wears<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
hot I think that that wears down the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.000 
hot I think that that wears down the
hairs<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.210> brush<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.590> case<00:01:01.800> we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
hairs of the brush so in this case we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
hairs of the brush so in this case we
have<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> two<00:01:02.399> sided<00:01:02.670> brush<00:01:02.910> we've<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.449> taken

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
water out from the base and you'll

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.749 
water out from the base and you'll
notice<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.700> I'm<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:53.850> tugging<00:01:55.369> I'm<00:01:56.369> simply

that<00:01:59.579> point<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.060> could<00:02:00.180> go<00:02:00.329> ahead<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.719> once

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that point you could go ahead and once

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.310 
that point you could go ahead and once
you<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> end<00:02:02.659> you<00:02:03.659> could<00:02:03.930> use<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you get that to the end you could use a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.950 
you get that to the end you could use a
towel<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.159> clean<00:02:05.520> virgin<00:02:06.180> surface<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.810> you

could<00:02:07.110> wipe<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.489> once<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.599> know

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
could wipe that on but once you you know

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.500 
could wipe that on but once you you know
we<00:02:09.810> eliminate<00:02:10.140> extra<00:02:10.760> moisture<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.239> go<00:02:12.330> ahead

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
we eliminate extra moisture and go ahead

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.040 
we eliminate extra moisture and go ahead
and<00:02:12.690> lay

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and lay

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.750 
and lay
down<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.720> you'll<00:02:15.840> notice<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.400> lay<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.580> so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
down and you'll notice that I lay it so

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.390 
down and you'll notice that I lay it so
it's<00:02:17.940> kind<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.270> off<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.810> edge<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:20.190> want

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
it's kind of off of the edge and we want

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.700 
it's kind of off of the edge and we want
to<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:21.510> know<00:02:21.540> give<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.080> free<00:02:22.350> edge<00:02:22.530> so

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
to you know give it that free edge so

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.010 
to you know give it that free edge so
that<00:02:22.740> can<00:02:23.010> dry<00:02:23.250> nicely<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.240> reason<00:02:24.540> why<00:02:24.690> is

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
that can dry nicely the reason why is

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.430 
that can dry nicely the reason why is
then<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.290> get<00:02:25.440> all<00:02:25.710> areas<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.700> brush<00:02:26.970> all
