DVD and believe it or not is the feature
that<00:04:37.169> I<00:04:37.350> less<00:04:37.650> use<00:04:38.100> on<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.490> system<00:04:39.199> because

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
that I less use on the system because

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.290 
that I less use on the system because
I'm<00:04:40.530> not<00:04:40.650> really<00:04:40.830> a<00:04:41.160> fan<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.610> watching<00:04:41.880> TV

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
I'm not really a fan of watching TV

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.800 
I'm not really a fan of watching TV
while<00:04:43.020> driving<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.940> screen<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.300> gonna<00:04:45.419> pop<00:04:45.660> up

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
while driving the screen is gonna pop up

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.689 
while driving the screen is gonna pop up
since<00:04:46.139> I<00:04:46.260> bought<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.620> unit<00:04:46.650> with<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.160> kit<00:04:47.520> that

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
since I bought the unit with a kit that

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.280 
since I bought the unit with a kit that
they<00:04:47.940> sold<00:04:48.180> me<00:04:48.360> at<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:48.600> stereo<00:04:48.930> store<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:49.260> I

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
they sold me at the stereo store that I

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.290 
they sold me at the stereo store that I
bought<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:50.490> kid<00:04:50.699> actually<00:04:50.790> has<00:04:51.150> the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
bought it and the kid actually has the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.350 
bought it and the kid actually has the
resistor<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.800> don't<00:04:52.949> have<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.280> put<00:04:54.270> your

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
resistor so you don't have to put your

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.020 
resistor so you don't have to put your
parking<00:04:54.720> brake<00:04:54.750> if<00:04:55.080> you're<00:04:55.229> going<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.530> drive

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
parking brake if you're going to drive

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.990 
parking brake if you're going to drive
so<00:04:57.030> that's<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.690> video<00:04:57.900> playback<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.380> it

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
so that's the video playback of it

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.350 
so that's the video playback of it
sounds<00:05:00.000> pretty<00:05:00.150> good<00:05:00.360> as<00:05:00.479> well

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
sounds pretty good as well

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.880 
sounds pretty good as well
