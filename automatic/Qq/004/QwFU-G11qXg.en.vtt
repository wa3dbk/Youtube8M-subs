honestly<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.930> was<00:00:25.230> probably<00:00:25.590> slower<00:00:25.949> than<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
honestly it was probably slower than the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.960 
honestly it was probably slower than the
biggest<00:00:26.880> liar<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.470> TV<00:00:28.859> history<00:00:28.970> that's

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
tie his shoes well the fact of the
matter<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.700> if<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.300> remember<00:00:42.719> correctly<00:00:42.750> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
matter is if I remember correctly that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.979 
matter is if I remember correctly that
damn<00:00:43.920> piece<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.579> green<00:00:44.789> shit<00:00:45.180> never<00:00:45.660> wore

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
damn piece of green shit never wore

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.529 
damn piece of green shit never wore
shoes<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.649> fact<00:00:47.100> he'd<00:00:47.309> even<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.730> feet<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.450> if

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
shoes in fact he'd even have feet so if

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.869 
shoes in fact he'd even have feet so if
he<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.200> running<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.980> race<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.460> could

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
he was to go running a race I could

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
he was to go running a race I could
guarantee<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.449> he<00:00:51.870> would<00:00:51.960> probably<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.320> slow

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
guarantee that he would probably be slow

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.799 
guarantee that he would probably be slow
as<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.399> maybe<00:00:53.640> slow<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.210> computer<00:00:54.660> or

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
as well maybe slow as my computer or

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.689 
as well maybe slow as my computer or
maybe<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.410> computer<00:00:55.920> would<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.370> slow<00:00:56.670> as

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
maybe my computer would be as slow as

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.420 
maybe my computer would be as slow as
him<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.719> saying<00:00:57.989> my<00:00:58.199> computer<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.890> really

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
him just saying my computer was really

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.760 
him just saying my computer was really
crappy<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.059> would<00:01:00.449> take<00:01:00.629> me<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.899> five<00:01:01.739> hours

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
crappy it would take me like five hours

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
crappy it would take me like five hours
to<00:01:02.340> render<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.640> five<00:01:03.030> minute<00:01:03.449> video<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
to render a five minute video it was it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.490

was<00:01:04.860> mind-blowing<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.729> how<00:01:05.909> slow<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.510> was<00:01:06.689> but

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
was mind-blowing on how slow it was but

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560
