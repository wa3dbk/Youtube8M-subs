00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
is sitting right so much serious science

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.660 
is sitting right so much serious science
it's<00:00:58.050> happening<00:00:58.379> underground<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.280> Canada

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
it's happening underground in Canada

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
it's happening underground in Canada
these<00:00:59.820> days<00:01:00.030> yeah<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:00.960> much

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
these days yeah it's very much

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.990 
these days yeah it's very much
underground<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.890> you've<00:01:02.280> put<00:01:02.550> human<00:01:02.969> beings

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
underground so you've put human beings

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.770 
underground so you've put human beings
in<00:01:03.660> these<00:01:04.170> pods<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.700> attach<00:01:06.360> them<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
in these pods and you attach them to a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.630 
in these pods and you attach them to a
hydraulic<00:01:07.380> lift<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.100> kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.369> shake

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
hydraulic lift and you kind of shake

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.000 
hydraulic lift and you kind of shake
them<00:01:08.790> around<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.810> how<00:01:09.960> they<00:01:10.110> react<00:01:10.470> yeah

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
them around and see how they react yeah

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
them around and see how they react yeah
it's<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.310> quite<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.700> entertaining<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
it's not quite as entertaining as that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
it's not quite as entertaining as that
usually<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.229> we're<00:01:13.380> trying<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> we're

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
usually what we're trying to do is we're

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
usually what we're trying to do is we're
trying<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.369> develop<00:01:14.520> something<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.750> will

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
trying to develop something that will

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.630 
trying to develop something that will
stop<00:01:16.409> them<00:01:16.590> getting<00:01:16.799> into<00:01:16.890> trouble<00:01:17.310> like

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
stop them getting into trouble like

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460 
stop them getting into trouble like
better<00:01:18.030> footwear<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.689> won't<00:01:18.869> slip<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.350> in

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
better footwear that won't slip in in

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.320 
better footwear that won't slip in in
the<00:01:19.560> winter<00:01:19.890> okay<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.640> case<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:21.150> might

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the winter okay in that case we might

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.090 
the winter okay in that case we might
not<00:01:21.450> even<00:01:21.600> shake<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.140> all<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:22.740> might<00:01:22.890> just

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
not even shake them at all we might just

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
not even shake them at all we might just
have<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.340> nice<00:01:23.580> snow-covered<00:01:24.299> surface<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.200> we

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
have a nice snow-covered surface and we

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.710 
have a nice snow-covered surface and we
might<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.530> tip<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> what<00:01:27.240> angle

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
might just tip it and see it what angle

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.300 
might just tip it and see it what angle
they<00:01:27.869> start<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> slip<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> interesting

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
they start to slip this is interesting

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.679 
they start to slip this is interesting
because<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.939> perfect<00:01:30.180> example<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
because this is a perfect example of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
because this is a perfect example of
like<00:01:30.810> science<00:01:31.259> that's<00:01:31.439> very<00:01:31.680> practical<00:01:32.250> for

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
like science that's very practical for

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.130 
like science that's very practical for
all<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.939> us<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.479> walk<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
all of us because we all walk up and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.560 
all of us because we all walk up and
down<00:01:34.229> stairs<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:35.159> all<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> go<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
down stairs we all have to go out and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.330 
down stairs we all have to go out and
maneuver<00:01:37.049> through<00:01:37.290> ice<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.829> snow<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.280> all

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
maneuver through ice and snow and all

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.670 
maneuver through ice and snow and all
that<00:01:38.490> business<00:01:38.670> yeah<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.990> very<00:01:40.229> practical

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that business yeah we do very practical

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.490 
that business yeah we do very practical
