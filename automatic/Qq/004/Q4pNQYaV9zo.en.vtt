00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.009
 accept the pause but I was left 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.570
 itching in the head of this issue 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.460
 leader what we talked about other of 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.400
 organizations foundations sector 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.770
 public where rose this don jose the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.720
 young boys 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.070
 This is leadership, because what I see in 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.690
 the companies my experience is that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.610
 we hope that the solutions 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.670
 solve another I hope in the month and so 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.970
 it seems one goes through messianism there 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.350
 but leadership if you know it well 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.410
 because together with our colleagues 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.870
 we are training and training and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.290
 collaborating and accompanying with hundreds of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.290
 leaders per year from different sectors 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.530
 places and well clearly there is a series 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.560
 of general attributes that can 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.640
 allow this to really take on 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.430
 way I would almost tell you methodological and which 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.780
 it would be a first characteristic attribute 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.210
 of a good leader that we continue to speak 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.190
 so much of this difficult castlevania you 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.040
 always bringing me some challenge look 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.680
 there are as many models as we say schools 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.170
 there is and the truth if I had to choose 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.210
 two or three would be chosen in principle and you 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.430
 left foot to see what you think you I 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.470
 I remain with the theme of the vision the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.720
 subject of having the vision and that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.190
 can share that vision in a format 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 of history all this stream of 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.299
 storytelling let's say it does 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.100
 that we really have to have a 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.140
 exciting story to be able to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.970
 share but you have to start from the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.399
 you happened to you in your own life me 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 like the truth that in my experience 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.659
 that also makes me understand a little 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.979
 when companies are said and one 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.539
 note not that it's full of good 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.970
 good managers managers but 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.060
 few leaders and this to have vision of 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.060
 future 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.060
 in my understanding another thing I see this 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.590
 of the domains of emotions 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.150
 I see very good this let's say leaders like 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.099
 if you want like machines to work 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.750
 production to the world of work bringing 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.900
 he gave his teams a lot of good 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.420
 tasks are generating money business 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.520
 but in what is the emotional part of 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.550
 enthuse and make the others 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.910
 follow and love you in the no sense 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.069
 comes the rational but they do not fall in love and it's 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.620
 more what is a light in this machine 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.910
 of working those are to the linking part 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.160
 because it will allow us to reach 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.420
 large managerial positions to great subject the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.819
 theme of the links let's talk 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.310
 about that but I tell you another the ability 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.290
 of learning that in the background could 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.030
 be the manifestation of a huge 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.019
 humility is not these beings that 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.870
 we know that they are 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.590
 permanently learning by absorbing 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.290
 improving without fear of what they will say and 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.810
 leaving a legacy a brand not really 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.150
 I have a case of that if it is so true 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.180
 what you say 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.069
 I sometimes see 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.530
 young people that early achieve a 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.629
 important position and already with that I already learned 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.030
 I arrived and like they are arrogant 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.849
 and closed and obtuse and some colleagues 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.790
 60-70 years old always wanting to learn 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.280
 weeks ago in a major company 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.719
 vitivinÃ­cola the founders auto gene 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.700
 observing a course of 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:34.260
 training and at home and you here is 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.790
 that always a time in life for 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.409
 to learn is that it has nothing to do with 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.379
 art has to do with the mental model 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:43.109
 it has to do with opening now what 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.569
 issue this subject of the emotional the 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.930
 leadership of yourself as always 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.819
 he liked this topic totally and every day what 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.500
 check more because we want the 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.900
 problem is in going to take you to the course 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.510
 to be a better manager better director and 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.290
 it really goes through growth that of 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.290
 know yourself 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.950
 if I had to say something one 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.440
 thing to dona rosa to don jose look 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.810
 this issue of being on axis has to do 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.870
 with what time are they sometimes when 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.660
 you are totally creative and you can not 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.669
 generate innovation with that creation you 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.290
 lack of ground and sometimes the opposite 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.150
 they are in the vortex is in what 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.940
 so everyday in the day to day that you are 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.350
 below your waterline you 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.480
 miss heaven 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.030
 then the balance is not only 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.460
 be on axis but let's say be well 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.990
 equidistant and try to see what is it 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.360
 what are you having and what is 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.669
 missing 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.169
 how interesting the truth that I share 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.229
 what you say I agree very much because 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.360
 today the training for the leaders is 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.159
 armed from the outside from how to form the 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.840
 another and in fact that little of the 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.129
 development of the link then with what 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.499
 same 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.729
 good the subject of the links that had 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:04.330
 remained pending of what we said 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.969
 before it is one of the big issues 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.979
 generate that network of links first 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:12.349
 linking with itself and then 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.599
 generating the link with others and here 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.849
 remains pending and raised the 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.999
 little magic word that you know so much 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.860
 vocationally it attracts us that is the type 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:24.879
 special network of links that are the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:29.229
 teams great subject no but that goes for 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.229
 good the next break
