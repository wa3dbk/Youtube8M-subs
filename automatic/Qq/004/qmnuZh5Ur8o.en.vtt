00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.530 
all right now let's talk about the
benefit<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:13.430> besides<00:01:13.909> being<00:01:14.030> fun

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
benefit of this besides being fun

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.760 
benefit of this besides being fun
flipping<00:01:15.320> tires<00:01:15.560> for<00:01:16.520> hope<00:01:16.700> I<00:01:17.500> like<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.620> when<00:01:18.710> I

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
flipping tires for hope I like it when I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.850 
flipping tires for hope I like it when I
flip<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.840> he's<00:01:21.050> going<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.230> use<00:01:21.410> full<00:01:21.650> body

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
flip it so he's going to use full body

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.380 
flip it so he's going to use full body
it's<00:01:22.040> like<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.160> deadlift<00:01:22.550> right<00:01:22.820> there<00:01:23.060> he's

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
it's like a deadlift right there he's

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.540 
it's like a deadlift right there he's
using<00:01:23.720> biceps<00:01:24.200> forearms<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.160> it<00:01:25.280> becomes

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
using biceps forearms and it becomes

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.850 
using biceps forearms and it becomes
like<00:01:25.760> an<00:01:25.880> upper<00:01:26.090> body<00:01:26.270> press<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.350> harder<00:01:27.830> he

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
like an upper body press the harder he

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.580 
like an upper body press the harder he
pushes<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:29.390> farther<00:01:29.690> kind<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.140> skids<00:01:30.410> each

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
pushes it the farther kind of skids each

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.230 
pushes it the farther kind of skids each
time<00:01:30.860> as<00:01:31.010> it<00:01:31.100> flips<00:01:31.340> over<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.730> it's<00:01:31.850> less<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.060> a

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
time as it flips over and it's less of a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.530 
time as it flips over and it's less of a
distance<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:32.780> he<00:01:32.810> has<00:01:33.050> to<00:01:33.200> travel<00:01:34.390> she<00:01:35.390> can

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
distance that he has to travel she can

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.620 
distance that he has to travel she can
hear<00:01:35.750> from<00:01:35.930> yells<00:01:36.820> it's<00:01:37.820> hard<00:01:38.090> he's<00:01:38.270> making<00:01:38.540> it

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
hear from yells it's hard he's making it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.500 
hear from yells it's hard he's making it
look<00:01:38.750> easy<00:01:38.870> he's<00:01:39.200> going<00:01:39.440> very<00:01:39.620> quickly<00:01:40.510> this

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
look easy he's going very quickly this

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.730 
look easy he's going very quickly this
is<00:01:41.690> actually<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.050> toughest<00:01:42.380> part<00:01:42.440> of<00:01:42.620> the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
is actually the toughest part of the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.800 
is actually the toughest part of the
course<00:01:42.980> it's<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.700> pretty<00:01:43.910> good<00:01:44.180> incline<00:01:44.780> going

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
course it's a pretty good incline going

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.980 
course it's a pretty good incline going
up<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:46.160> building<00:01:46.400> here<00:01:46.820> at<00:01:47.000> test<00:01:47.330> sports<00:01:47.660> and

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
up the building here at test sports and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.300 
up the building here at test sports and
then<00:01:48.590> we're<00:01:48.680> going<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.890> turn<00:01:49.010> around<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
then we're going to turn around the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.890 
then we're going to turn around the
corner<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.730> we<00:01:49.790> head<00:01:50.060> back<00:01:50.270> down<00:01:50.570> its

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
corner and we head back down its

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.470 
corner and we head back down its
downhill<00:01:51.140> which<00:01:51.560> would<00:01:51.680> be<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.800> lot<00:01:52.010> easier

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
downhill which would be a lot easier

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.140 
downhill which would be a lot easier
I<00:01:53.540> keep<00:01:54.230> that<00:01:54.350> back<00:01:54.560> flat<00:01:54.590> now<00:01:55.010> as<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.000> get

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
I keep that back flat now as you get

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.060 
I keep that back flat now as you get
tired<00:01:56.360> you're<00:01:56.540> going<00:01:56.660> to<00:01:56.720> want<00:01:56.840> around<00:01:57.050> had<00:01:57.800> to

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
tired you're going to want around had to

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.290 
tired you're going to want around had to
drive<00:01:58.340> into<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.700> tire<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:03.680> now<00:02:03.800> Sam<00:02:04.300> is

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
drive into that tire so now Sam is

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.270 
drive into that tire so now Sam is
stronger<00:02:05.720> than<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:05.990> am<00:02:06.140> when<00:02:06.260> I<00:02:06.320> did<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:07.010> was

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
stronger than I am when I did this I was

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.120 
stronger than I am when I did this I was
doing<00:02:07.520> at<00:02:07.610> intervals<00:02:08.000> for<00:02:08.630> Flip's<00:02:09.110> rest<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
doing at intervals for Flip's rest the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.760 
doing at intervals for Flip's rest the
rest<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.550> minute<00:02:10.820> each<00:02:10.940> time<00:02:11.530> he's<00:02:12.530> going

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
rest of the minute each time he's going

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.250 
rest of the minute each time he's going
a<00:02:12.920> much<00:02:13.070> quicker<00:02:13.310> pace<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:14.510> we're<00:02:14.720> for<00:02:14.930> me<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
a much quicker pace so we're for me the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.770 
a much quicker pace so we're for me the
limiting<00:02:15.830> factor<00:02:16.250> we<00:02:16.340> strength<00:02:16.780> limiting

60 you are only two minutes and 40
seconds<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.230> you're<00:02:42.219> almost<00:02:42.370> halfway

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.090 

Oh

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.630

you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.530 

so<00:02:59.620> besides<00:02:59.769> a<00:03:00.069> strength<00:03:00.370> exercise<00:03:00.879> this<00:03:01.390> is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
so besides a strength exercise this is

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.449 
so besides a strength exercise this is
obviously<00:03:01.900> going<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.140> be<00:03:02.200> aerobic<00:03:02.709> anaerobic

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
obviously going to be aerobic anaerobic

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.800 
obviously going to be aerobic anaerobic
because<00:03:03.970> it's<00:03:04.090> going<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.239> drive<00:03:04.480> his<00:03:04.629> heart

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
because it's going to drive his heart

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.899 
because it's going to drive his heart
rate<00:03:04.930> up<00:03:05.049> because<00:03:05.230> he<00:03:05.409> is<00:03:05.560> using<00:03:05.830> pretty<00:03:06.730> much

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
rate up because he is using pretty much

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.539 
rate up because he is using pretty much
everything<00:03:07.480> he's<00:03:08.379> using<00:03:08.739> back<00:03:08.950> he's<00:03:09.340> using

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
everything he's using back he's using
