00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.139
 now the most sensational thing that ever had 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.380
 in the history of this game then check out 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.449
 This is where the liberal rainer is. 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.750
 the monster to work you can buy 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.269

 july 4th independence day theme 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.050
 in the United States what is legal about 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 relation to him he is practically 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.130
 destructive and he can pass over 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.020
 anything is basically a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.110
 helicopter only who 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.579
 destructible I can go through 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.469
 pretty much anything like that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.360
 You have cars in my way I do I 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.180
 advance over the cars as if they 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.219
 there was no such thing as the monster 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 shock does not face much exaggeration 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.809
 big this car here is not cool that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.149
 you can use on the street something that you do not 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.000
 can do with a reality center 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.590
 Sorry people, I'm trying to reach you. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.140
 city is I'm trying to reach 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.750
 This is obviously counter-hand as gta 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.850
 I wanted to ask you guys what you propose 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.710
 for you a resistance test that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.020
 since this car has a reputation for 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.299
 be so sturdy that it's the following I 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.009
 I'm going to try to invade a sacred photo and I want to 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.240
 see how long it survives 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.590
 that simple 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.689
 Let's see if we can get in. 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.700
 because I do not know if online gta can 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.710
 get into that crap that does not land 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.530
 give it so I 'm gone I'm leaving 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.479
 because I 'm in the niche 5 now they do not 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.740
 I was definitely hopeful but now the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.530
 People have a new resistance test. 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.119
 I'm on level 4 as long as I can 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.130
 survive with four stars 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.380
 This is test number two so I go. 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.670
 escape from the strong agreement as if 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.470
 there was tomorrow 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.750
 and I'll try to get into the living city 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.880
 This is my life goal now I 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.560
 I hope I can please you 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.820
 military helicopter does not come after me 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.579
 please 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.290
 Raining rainy face itself is not clever 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.750
 there was something on the other side of the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.299
 what is police car sorry 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.000
 Police Excuse Police Gave License Give 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.189
 police license was barely up to 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.259
 close to the police were four 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.179
 stars is the delay of the license gives 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.410
 Leave a Reply 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.750
 Can I get to the city? 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.470
 This is the big question I got. 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.570
 to arrive 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.460
 one time but I believe it's so 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.270
 Strong as a tank I'll admit 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.590
 for you 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.930
 and someone is giving me a shot already 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.310
 taking bullet putz grila goes well 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.710
 that car is fast he is not 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.300
 slowly and it seems slow but it has 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.910
 kind of like the speed of a car 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.680
 normal is not a super car but could 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.230
 to have died running for the river tomato 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.270
 to the macaÃ© to come there the car 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.340
 survived I died 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.020
 This was not a good test and I admit more 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.150
 It was fun as part of this event. 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.460
 commemorative you can also buy a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.780
 rocket launchers only he launches fireworks 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.370
 This works like a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.890
 normal rocket launcher only a little 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.930
 weaker and it explodes in fireworks 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.730
 fireworks in the end this way has no 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.920
 level limit also to buy this 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.030
 Trick you have a moschetti that gives a lot 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.830
 giving continuous only 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.959
 only it takes forever to be able to 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.030
 carry on forever and we have 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.140
 also fireworks and look what 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.880
 awesome thing 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.709
 we will have the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.870
 demonstration of fireworks and 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.180
 also the one of throw the rocket that turns 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.740
 fireworks but before that I 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.450
 I want to show you my 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.269
 New apartment as I was saying 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.860
 This is where my apartment is now. 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.170
 I have a place where I live the only 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.820
 problem is that the car in it does not 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.290
 can put export and garage 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.989
 always have to search the dealership 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.090
 because I do not know why it is so 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.500
 so I 'll stop in front of the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.420
 apartment will probably be 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.739
 stolen, which is what always happens 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.459
 When I stop in front of my 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.930
 apartment 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.820
 but we will now enter the 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.920
 garage understood let's start with 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.930
 cool part is the next in the garage there 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.610
 There's a lot of car that I spent buying. 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.650
 that nonsense of that car and also 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.060
 buying an apartment then i have 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.880
 these two cars that I got 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.970
 borrowed from people on the street and they 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.200
 they turned my cars, not only that but 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.820
 Now we're going up to the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.370
 apartment we also have a 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.709

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.120
 in my apartment is an expensive duplex 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.430
 Sensational I paid more expensive to catch 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.900
 on the floor 20 instead took 7 for power 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.000

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.380

 business to keep alive at temperature 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.350
 sure that's the name 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.390
 We also have here a television 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.950

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.030

 but look here sensational we can 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.260

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.150

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.730
 beach exactly view to the beach and 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.590
 It's okay, it 's just here, but it has a view. 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.240

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.180

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.170
 ceiling of places that have no 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.870
 importance and here I have my bed

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.030
 It worked there. I can take a shower. 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.620
 also this is another functionality I 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.180
 I have to get the best costume out of the game. 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.590
 to do that but then I can 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.270
 take away those spots that I have 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.560
 body that I do not know how it looks like 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.640
 I was wearing clothes all the time. 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.220
 must be from blows 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.230
 probably then people down there 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.910
 It's the saints, I think this one 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.950
 our final celebration 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.710
 I'll send the fireworks to the air. 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.970
 It's one and two and I hope it's cool. 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:57.070
 because I worked to make all of us 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:06:06.970

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:09.610

 How the rocket is then? 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.150
 I trained two verses from the 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:26.790
 United States to do this, then 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:26.790

 I wanted to show you here this 

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:48.039
 update that motivated me to play gta 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.809
 again because I found it very crazy 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.219
 likes these crazy things when they 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:54.099
 they occasionally make games that are already 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:56.650
 two then put a lot of shock on the 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.569
