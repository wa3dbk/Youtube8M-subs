 users dock for iDevice 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.509
 well let's 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.350
 and we got this docking station from 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.030
 lg firms which are already pretty 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.490
 offer or time engaged 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.460
 production of accessories this data 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.100
 models n d 15 20 on the front side 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.830
 we see the image of our dock 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.260
 exactly the same image and on the back 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.830
 the lid below we have nothing 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.090
 top 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.370
 we have a kind of list 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.040
 The advantages of this docking station and also its 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.070
 functions let's open and see what 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.050
 do we have such a box inside and 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.790
 at the very top we have a little book 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.610
 which all instructions are warranty 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.440
 coupons well let's let's together 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.930
 look in the box and see all 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.850
 the charms of this accessory 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.520
 unusual for such reviews 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.840
 do not see how everything will fall 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 cords view of the device itself 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.750
 decided to do so and so what do we 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.520
 boxes in the box we have as I have in the menu 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.270
 previously there are instructions and warranty 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.650
 coupon and all such polyethylene 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.300
 small bags let's get it out 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.400
 I have 3 books in my hands 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.930
 first in a language incomprehensible to me 2 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.330
 warranty card for several 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.400
 languages ​​including English Russian 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.370
 Ukrainian and also a book 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.780
 here with the characteristics as well 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.770
 recommendations to users of this 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 docking stations 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.200
 what are we going on and then we attack 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.290
 curious wire and performs the same function 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.100
 for your get this wire is 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.090
 fmt not so that this station will support 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.500
 also coffee maker radio the length of this wire 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.280
 about three meters and basically if you 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.720
 put it on the table and you can 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.760
 stretch this posting up for example 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.150
 us on the shelf or somewhere else ios 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.820
 thoughts up can enjoy 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.240
 listening is equal to what is 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.410
 brother let's put it aside what 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.150
 We also still there as we go 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.730
 not charging but unfortunately given yes 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.840
 Xancar stationary and this wire 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.880
 write off here is such a wire length 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.070
 also about one and a half meters 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.030
 which is enough if you 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.110
 socket on the floor 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.980
 and so the sun will stand on the table so 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.530
 connects 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.440
 but on the manufacturer's website also counted 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.900
 what 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.360
 You can buy a separate adapter and 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.540
 charge it just by car 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.140
 cigarette lighter if you or dear well and 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.150
 the nail of our program guests from the package 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.740
 this is the docking station on the front side 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.900
 us touch control panel 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.610
 below there are such rubber 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.120
 lining so that it does not slide 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.380
 on the table and in the back we have three connectors and 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.430
 also the on / off button 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.130
 alarm clock 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.520
 1 connector power connector second connector 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.800
 This connector for the adapter from three to 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.130
 half millimeter port to our 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.410
 docking station and 4 is the connector for this horn 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.750
 there is also a button on top 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.830
 by which you yourself can calmly 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.270
 buy off logged on wisla diary 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.180
 Here's a control panel let 's 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.930
 let's turn on our docking station 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:54.070
 behind the wire in we need our connector 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.550
 case is so extreme and as you can see the panel 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.950
 caught fire on her writing with tankoy 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.880
 We press the button to activate the mode and we 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:07.360
 writes the vall and indicates lack 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.450
 ipod iphone and also for their quarrel in 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.150
 support this station by putting 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.509
 your iphone to charge 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.829
 I probably save time rather than charging 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.669
 its from standard charge 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.530
 while she charges pretty quickly 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.080
 try the same chip crank all 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.430
 let's go though the book says that this 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.280
 accessory not supported 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.340
 but not in this case, everything is fine 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.600
 works and it charges pretty too 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.690
 so fast and so button which 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.520
 clicked when just turned off the station 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.130
 also switches between three modes 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.820
 port in ipod mode 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.330
 and rfm mode robin and well let's set 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.610
 our wiring with fm radio 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.680
 do we need a connector insert to the end of that 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.550
 very important many will complain that 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.860
 docking station just doesn't work so 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.849
 let's right now from i stretched the wire 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.169
 the shelf above the docking table is made on 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.060
 such a white color that perhaps 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.110
 will be perfectly compatible with your 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.150
 devices too minimalism and design in 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.740
 one bottle 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.120
 so turn on this port mode and 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.360
 which I mentioned earlier need in order 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.360
 to 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:32.659
 station draw to your three bedrooms 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:39.229
 3 your solder is not 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:44.139
 and drove well so a lot of drink and 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:46.219
 the tooth of this station is just awesome 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.060
 I will tell about sound in detail 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.439
 the next video that we test 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.900
 remote cancellation short distance 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:57.639
 and try to turn it on to different levels 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.639
 loudness like us and release 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:07.540
 that is, it works that way you can 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:10.420
 the same time, though already quietly as 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:15.160
 on the left we can turn on or off 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.770
 the alarm indicator lights up turn off 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.010
 his blinks varieties 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.970
 let's set the alarm 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.260
 approximately so he called through 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.960
 minute off 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.910
 our docking station mode will be us 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.200
 show time only 12 hour mode 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:37.170
 and now call an alarm clock but plays 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.320
 Now the dynamics of the station and not in our 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.910
 In this case, the iphone and all because 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.460
 if you want the station to cool 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.920
 you need to set the alarm already on 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.200
 the station itself is the upper switch you can 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.110
 adjust brightness as well as sleep mode and 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.040
 the gap belt through which she 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.780
 turns off holding the mode switch 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.670
 our station does not turn off and 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.670
 turn into a regular desk clock 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.900
 Well, this is probably all subscribe 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.340
 on the channel leave your comments with 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.340
 you had a question yet
