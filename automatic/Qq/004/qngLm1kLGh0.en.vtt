00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.420
 magna on is found today for a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.880
 little tutorial compared to 2 comments 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.200
 that were left on the video that 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.940
 when I said that it was necessary 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.210
 reinstall windows 8 for those who have 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.940
 the problem of vignettes actually I was 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.430
 left a message saying that they have that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.380
 everyone did not know how to finally do 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 how to do so 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.769
 so I do them as you see 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
 now but all my glasses mark 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.269
 so I confirm you and it works very 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.289
 good but I have a little galley I'm going 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.880
 show you how to do it more 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.860
 easily 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.520
 so when you have installed once 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.890
 windows 8 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.320
 so you always have to tick nothing 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 nothing to keep nanani nanana here once 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.510
 you will have to reinstall once 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 windows 8 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.210
 so wait i 'll show you when 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.870
 you will go to your club 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.920
 that's when you will go in the on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.690
 your hard drive it will always be 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.649
 complained because in fact you will have a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.760
 folder here one that will be called windows 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.100
 points 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.629
 auld actually that means you 're 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.920
 the old windows 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.540
 the old windows and in there he kept 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.180

 videos your videos your images that has everything 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.700
 have to go into the settings of the pc that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:23.640
 now walk flat in general 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:28.470
