don't have to play the melody at all in

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.309 
don't have to play the melody at all in
fact<00:03:20.849> you<00:03:21.629> shouldn't<00:03:21.870> play<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.079> melody

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319

because<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:23.159> chances<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.730> playing<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:24.439 
because the chances of you playing the

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.780 
because the chances of you playing the
same<00:03:25.439> note<00:03:25.680> at<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.950> same<00:03:26.159> time<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.760> same

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
same note at the same time and the same

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.580 
same note at the same time and the same
pitch<00:03:27.180> as<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.390> singer<00:03:27.750> does<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:27.989> rather<00:03:28.200> remote

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
pitch as a singer does is rather remote

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.440 
pitch as a singer does is rather remote
