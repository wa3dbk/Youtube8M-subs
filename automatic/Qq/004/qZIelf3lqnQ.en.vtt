00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.009
 hello everyone today as promised i 'm doing 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.730
 a review on your lacquers purchased on the site 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.170
 aliexpress link to the video in which 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.350
 You can learn more about it. 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:26.060
 see i will leave in the description and so i 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.660
 bought 4 varnishes new necker completely third 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:37.210
 I drink and guess now consider each in 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:42.129
 separately 1 there is no girs here and so 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.820
 looks on a tassel so beige 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.280
 very natural lends itself out of the way 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.769
 well-groomed look the varnish itself is not thick and not 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.909
 liquid is very well applied here it is on 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.640
 tips and here he is in my arms on 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.409
 hands covered in three layers on tips i'm all 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.420
 covered in two layers therefore on tips 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.420
 seems a little bit lighter 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:14.110
 I also wanted to say that here on 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:17.940
 lacquer there is an icon right here which 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.460
 talks about how thick the varnish is 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.759
 filled over filled circle is 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.720
 dense opaque is called because of misher 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:32.009
 translucent shades 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.009
 so whim etc. 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:42.460
 Here is a very beautiful pink color 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.120
 nice gentle so here it looks 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.120
 on tips 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.370
 next beat 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:01.140
 it's so transparent 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.229
 varnish with a little tint lilac a little 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.939
 blue he is very beautiful well suited 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.750
 to cover french 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:13.069
 on the tips is probably not visible but the color and 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.069
 really very beautiful 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.510
 shimmers very beautiful in the sun 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.810
 looks 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.260
 so the next one is decadence 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:32.659
 it is such a maroon brown color very 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.340
 beautiful saturated warm so on 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:38.090
 tassel looks 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.090
 and on tips 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.620
 such 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:57.239
 Now I want to compare these varnishes with 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:57.239
 original varnishes take two varnishes 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.020
 the first thing that catches your eye is that 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.880
 on the original there is a sticker 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.120
 holographic network written on it 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.510
 the original on these varnishes such a sticker 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.980
 no These nakleechki that here they are 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.890
 exactly the same 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.960
 the inscriptions all match the only thing that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.990
 here here is this icon a little bit 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.250
 less 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.440
 than this one and so basically all one in 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.570
 one 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.460
 another difference is 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:43.960
 Chinese lacquer caps are matte 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:49.640
 on the original they are glossy shiny 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:54.020
 still here at the bottom of the original there are such 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:59.650
 there is no bulging Chinese thing 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:02.030
 here is a sticker with the number of varnish so 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.940
 brushes in these varnishes a little bit 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.940
 different from whom they originally 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.030
 and 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.099
 Chinese 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.099
 Leopard they have tons and hide the secret here 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.660
 these are a little shorter varsa 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.660
 and it is a little bit wider 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.710
 so but in principle it is very convenient for me 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.730
 It was convenient to coat the layer applied 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.420
 evenly in principle 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.420
 normal brush 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.380
 the most obvious and 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.120
 the main difference of these gel polishes in that 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:03.620
 that they have a completely different smell at 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:06.590
 creative original varnishes smell 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.919
 closer to the usual varnish is so sharp not 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.750
 very nice chinese he is so 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.750
 calm barely noticeable and 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:23.370
 and I also like it more that is in 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.460
 principle even if you will compare 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.569
 small bottles of a jar there it is all one but 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:34.259
 opening the bottle you will immediately understand where 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:37.259
 real creative where is fake yet 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:40.409
 Unfortunately, I do not have the same color 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:44.120
 original and fake to compare 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:47.569
 how much does the varnish match in color 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.970
 but I will definitely order some varnish 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:53.729
 to compare them probably do 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.849
 creative much more pigmented 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.310
 colors but maybe not going to look 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.500
 try to share with you 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:07.680
 I also wanted to say that she wore me here 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:12.000
 this varnish on the base or the top of the company code 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:15.979
 and but I want to order on the site 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.479
 Chinese their basis and fixer and 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.940
 cover the whole system see how 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:24.270
 she will be good or bad worn 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.580
 I will conclude whether to buy it or 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.880
 still base top take good 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:33.120
 Firm color lacquer principle can be taken 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:38.770
 any impression of whether 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:43.020
 buy the whole system or not i 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.020
 I will share with you a video necessarily 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:50.349
 But today perhaps all hope my 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.360
 video you like subscribe 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.270

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.729
