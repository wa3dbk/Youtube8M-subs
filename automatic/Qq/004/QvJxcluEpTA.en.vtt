it really should be no formal way of
exercise<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:15.240> put<00:01:15.450> resistance<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:15.990> your<00:01:16.110> body

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
exercise you put resistance on your body

putting it to a belt or anything the
tension<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.790> causes<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.479> on

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
tension that this causes when it's on

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
any resistance you know that's the thing

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.670 
any resistance you know that's the thing
guys<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.570> there's<00:01:33.570> no<00:01:33.689> should<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.500> kind

guys is there's no should it be in kind
of<00:01:34.740> formal<00:01:35.100> way<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.310> training<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:37.079> might

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
of formal way of training so this might

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.170

another<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.519> things<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.060> do

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
another one of the things I like to do

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.589 
another one of the things I like to do
is<00:02:52.350> get<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.620> scrap<00:02:52.860> here<00:02:53.040> real<00:02:53.250> quick

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.890 

if<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:56.959> have<00:02:57.080> these<00:02:57.260> bolts<00:02:57.560> down<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.010> side

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
if you have these bolts down to the side

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.929 
if you have these bolts down to the side
wrap<00:02:59.900> them<00:03:00.049> around<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.319> waist<00:03:00.500> real<00:03:00.799> fast<00:03:01.099> and

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
wrap them around the waist real fast and

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.350 
wrap them around the waist real fast and
actually<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.110> main<00:03:03.290> reason<00:03:03.680> why<00:03:03.829> I<00:03:04.360> created

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
actually the main reason why I created

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.380 
actually the main reason why I created
this<00:03:05.540> in<00:03:05.689> the<00:03:05.750> first<00:03:06.019> place<00:03:06.519> is<00:03:07.519> so<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.090> can<00:03:08.299> do

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
this in the first place is so I can do

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.920 
this in the first place is so I can do
side<00:03:08.629> steps<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:11.120> see<00:03:11.299> how<00:03:11.450> I'm<00:03:11.599> going

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
side steps so you can see how I'm going

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.229 
side steps so you can see how I'm going
here<00:03:12.110> I'm<00:03:12.200> doing<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:12.500> side<00:03:12.709> step<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:14.000> course

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
here I'm doing a side step and of course

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.140 
here I'm doing a side step and of course
you<00:03:14.360> go<00:03:14.480> faster<00:03:15.159> and<00:03:16.159> you<00:03:16.370> can<00:03:16.549> see<00:03:16.760> how<00:03:16.940> it

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
you go faster and you can see how it

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.080 
you go faster and you can see how it
digs<00:03:17.959> in<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.200> little<00:03:18.530> adds<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.700> little<00:03:19.879> bit<00:03:19.970> more

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
digs in a little adds a little bit more

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.149 
digs in a little adds a little bit more
resistance<00:03:20.720> but<00:03:21.260> these<00:03:21.530> straps<00:03:21.799> aren't<00:03:22.010> going

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
resistance but these straps aren't going

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.789 
resistance but these straps aren't going
to<00:03:22.220> snap<00:03:22.400> anytime<00:03:22.790> soon<00:03:23.409> what<00:03:24.409> this<00:03:24.560> is<00:03:24.709> going

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
to snap anytime soon what this is going

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.830 
to snap anytime soon what this is going
to<00:03:24.859> do<00:03:25.069> is<00:03:25.310> it's<00:03:25.459> going<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.609> activate<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.629> side

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
to do is it's going to activate the side
