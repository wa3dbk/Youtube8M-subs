00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.430
 hi here begins a new episode of 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.710
 christie I saw in our school still 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.900
 giving very good news because 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.240
 again we left in chilevision with 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.860
 our excellent security measures 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.150
 michelle invite you to see the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.599
 next notes we talk about the doubts 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.599
 you think 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.490
 you are watching the morning of chilevisión 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.010
 remember the earthquake of the past 27 of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.600
 February 2010 are you like to 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.489
 many chileans and it's ironic that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.900
 living in a seismic country we were 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.150
 many that are not all of the best 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.520
 way to protect us but now that 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.660
 Two years of that episode have passed 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.700
 we will be prepared to face a 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.500
 new earthquake we want that if it is in the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.110
 street in the car and their children in the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.870
 school what to do where to go or how to act 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.400
 in order to avoid greater misfortunes the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.230
 your children's school will have a plan 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.480
 contingency to protect children 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.040
 when they are not with their parents in the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.870
 gray establishment with stress of 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.059
 huechuraba have a novelty 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.500
 operation cooper something like the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.900
 legendary stool operation 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.490
 basically we have tried this 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.990
 proportion of children with what you have 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.670
 what to do with evacuation shifts there 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 some that still maintain the name 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 of daisy in some schools other than 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.570
 remember by Franciscan electro 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.490
 cooper that is as commemorative let's say 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.690
 in relation to her death and it's 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.640
 that a plan of 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.810
 evacuation with the room that the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.310
 operation cooper function 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.439
 the educational establishment must 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.570
 have a safe area that houses 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.310
 children a place that is bounded with 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.170
 these yellow stripes so that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.000
 students identify it from this 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.710
 perspective is that we choose two courtyards 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.299
 that are characteristic and that are 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.100
 central and known to all 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.590
 children because that is very important for 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.810
 choose a safety zone that is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.970
 easy access that children can download 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.460
 quickly and that allows us really 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.649
 that are far from sectors that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.509
 have levels of danger in this 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.610
 place the children are prepared in case 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.440
 emergency just start the tremor 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.330
 the sound of this alarm will encourage them 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.950
 so they are giving their classrooms and they 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.950
 head to the security zone 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.310
 if the students are inside of 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.990
 the classrooms and listen to the warning sound 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.180
 they should leave quietly with the 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.920
 driving the teacher in charge 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.130
 to reassure children so that 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.770
 evict in the classroom 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.290
 we're going to stand behind alien 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.910
 come on let's do the exercise 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.510
 evacuation standing or we left behind 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.790
 Matías walking calm walking 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.319
 quiet let's go to martín the process has 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.170
 that keeping calm has to take 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.239
 also his class book that is intimate 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.160
 details but that allows us also in 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.600
 the most extreme case have control and 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.700
 know perfectly what is the amount 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.290
 of children that I had in the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.030
 class area and is the same 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.940
 number of children in the area 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.350
 security that is very very important 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.790
 from the stairs and the corridors of 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.739
 school we can see the students 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.470
 move towards the safety zone 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.300
 where they should stay until 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.950
 end the sinister children so 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.780
 general tend to be such a few minutes 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.269
 as I was saying there is a security chief 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.310
 that organizes each zone and televises each 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.410
 sector to be this collective a 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.840
 concrete construction 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.400
 strong and I do not expect to have the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.650
 tranquility to return with the children to 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.060
 classroom but what would happen if the earthquake 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.310
 begins when the children are in 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.880
 recreation will know how to act without the guidance of a 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.710
 adult 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.420
 we have an emergency bell by the 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.790
 field and a well-known dream 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.140
 when there is an evacuation plan and that 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.850
 Allows children immediately 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.560
 know that something is happening and that 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.300
 the evacuation plan what the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.400
 operation cooper is to keep children away 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.990
 of possible landslides that could damage 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.730
 the so that when parents and 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.650
 Proxies arrive at the establishment 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.930
 find in perfect conditions to 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.390
 your children always deliver them to 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.640
 agent or to a responsible adult who 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.860
 they have left registered with 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.870
 prior in the school keeps them 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.940
 here or how to take anywhere and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.310
 we can hold another adults responsible 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.170
 for the safety of them all 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.150
 parents place full confidence in the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.100
 care of their children when they are in the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.870
 school so it's critical that 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.640
 the different educational centers of 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.070
 country are prepared for possible 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.060
 eventualities like an earthquake like this 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.430
 like the serious college 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.440
 account with the operation cooper will be 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.710
 prepared the educational center of his 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.710
 son
