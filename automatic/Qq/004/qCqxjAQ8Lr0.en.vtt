00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:01.699
 Hello friends 

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:04.799
 today we are going to teach the boxes 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.109
 a tablet with android 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.279
 a mobile phone with android 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.279
 he even played an inn 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.829
 a mouse to be able 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.269
 he handles the pointer and even the keyboard 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.900
 ruz and character that the keyboard owes 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.089
 the fattening 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.769
 for this we are going to use hundreds of different applications the first 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.620
 now the one that we go to 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.230
 to use the mouse 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.200
 we will be a utility of interest 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.060
 in the post we will put the 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.440
 exact name of the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.500
 of activity in the direction 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.420
 you can download it 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.320
 i on the device p we will use all of them as well as discard manuel marquez also 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.980
 we will wear 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830
 the directions 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.020
 download it 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.770
 ee quique that by means of which we configure this fruit 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.329
 basically 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.650
 ll this works as follows 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.350
 for your mobile device 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 I talked about a mobile phone 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.930
 they are having wi-fi connection 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.840
 and we have to connect 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.790
 and wi-fi 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.690
 computer on which we have slipped the utility of 23 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.990
 percent and we have to simply put the population the address 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.610
 ip 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.520
 d that order 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.940
 and from today 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.850
 together we can read interacting with him as if they were 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.730
 a tourist 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.680
 let's see the different steps we have to follow to make it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.700
 and then 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.160
 we will see 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.640
 what is the function 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.240
 percent a priori this may seem 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.580
 no nonsense 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.790
 by mistake and that we will go down will be ready because surely you will have reasons 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.760
 of the attack 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.200
 it is important to try simplistic 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.840
 but what 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.940
 we will realize when it will return control to work 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.469
 that real life 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.490
 p this this 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.989
 that function is for the presentation that is 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.109
 when we have children 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.349
 portable noah connected to a video projector 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.769
 iquique we have it located at an approximate distance 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.609
 starting 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.149
 we are placed 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:27.269
 that with the ere of the conventional plutus device 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.939
 it could become more distance however 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.869
 with this type of device thanks to the commission 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.079
 we will allow it 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.319
 let's go see what happened 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.319
 and then we will see the hostility 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:42.269
 first 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.540
 we will make sure that we have in our device connected to the network 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.619
 wifi in case it is not so we will activate the uis and panama 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:59.259
 once we have done is that we have installed the show because it is going to 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:03.109
 allow to use it as a platter in this case jungle herbón 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.719
 we will not configure 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.089
 putting the ip address of the computer that we are going to control 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:19.930
 of course we will have to go have this objective data we will find out 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:21.299
 we are will not have to give 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.399
 avn 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:28.440
 the rest of the data comes from the headquarters village configuration options 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.070
 for example we can use it as their promoter for left-handed these ingredients 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.679
 as a goal 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:34.589
 the move 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:39.339
 percent or invest the expert but the main one of course is this 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:40.250
 IP adress 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.189
 if which 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.539
 we will not be able to connect with him 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:45.569
 with the computer we want you to marta 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.749
 once we have this because we simply have a surface in the 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:52.829
 which then we will see how the mouse moves 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.589
 / t 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:04:01.239
 keyboard where we will be able to describe what we want and this will reflect 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.239
 in 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.939
 three buttons the left the right i the central one that will serve us for 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.689
 do this 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.219
 it has no more mystery 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.629
 then 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:20.069
 let's see in the northeast the laptop 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.069
 d as functions 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.759
 as you see these words do they practice we have the crime has prepared 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:29.919
 and in the background 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.019
 We have one to one led screen 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.939
 so we have located at that time about five meters from there 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.669
 i silence 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.360
 with a movement 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.759
 for 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.199
 we will see 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.099
 your processes 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.099
 do any time 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.029
 1 a service 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.029
 monthly 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.599
 even with the vote 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.029
 by shubert e 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.699
 it does not serve only a simple 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.419
 going up hopefully not by simple 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.749
 the pointer above or below 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:43.039
 the brand of sorbas 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.199
 the bleak 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.199
 just by going back to using 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.129
 already 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:53.870
 to four 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.150
 in a page 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.150
 now he will know how to use on that device too 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.409
 a keyboard 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:05.779
 for example 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.819
 juan josé c 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.819
 / blessings the browser 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.349
 and we will know 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.669
 in the green belt was placed in the derby 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.270
 2 is the indicated hour 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.270
 a mobile device 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.069
 in which we can write what you need 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:32.730
 once this is done 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.969
 abuse as a leader 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.969
 Pink has gone unnoticed 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:42.469
 p 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:48.439
 tinsa 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.439
 pajín back 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.059
 how you have seen is quite simple 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:58.990
 configure the program is how to use 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.550
 look for pretty much 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.339
 we all know that 

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:06.349
 the handle puts the finger on mice is that they could 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.379
 percent then on the screen with japan in the elections not 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.699
 you can download the benitez software 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:18.699
 i the far east 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:25.020
 and in the post that we publish in nerión that analyzes and we will put the links 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.869
 as well 

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:31.619
 but they have not been served utility they hope in the next 

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:32.589
 thank you
