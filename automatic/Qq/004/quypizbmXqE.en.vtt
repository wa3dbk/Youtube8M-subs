field we're little bit tight around the
breakdown<00:02:03.970> obviously<00:02:04.330> but<00:02:05.080> then<00:02:05.260> we<00:02:05.410> can<00:02:05.560> go

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
breakdown obviously but then we can go

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.120 
breakdown obviously but then we can go
get<00:02:05.830> them

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
get them

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.620

lead<00:03:00.190> runner<00:03:00.340> through<00:03:01.090> their<00:03:01.239> life<00:03:01.390> because

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
lead runner through their life because

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.960 
lead runner through their life because
once<00:03:02.260> you've<00:03:02.410> got<00:03:02.530> through<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.830> line<00:03:03.010> you've

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
once you've got through the line you've

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.490 
once you've got through the line you've

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
got quit ball 9 gets it away and then

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.050 
got quit ball 9 gets it away and then
you<00:03:05.560> kill<00:03:05.769> Tim's<00:03:06.070> but<00:03:06.250> overall<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.820> thought

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060
