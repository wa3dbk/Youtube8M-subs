00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
sick orphan ha I have a new theory yeah

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.100

if<00:03:01.819> I<00:03:01.910> could<00:03:02.060> just<00:03:02.090> explain<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.630> is<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:02.750> I

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
if I could just explain it is that I

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.930 
if I could just explain it is that I
think<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.620> better<00:03:03.799> question<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.310> where<00:03:04.519> did<00:03:04.670> new

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
think a better question is where did new

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.539 
think a better question is where did new
socks<00:03:05.329> come<00:03:05.690> from<00:03:05.989> because<00:03:06.769> I<00:03:06.860> think<00:03:06.920> we<00:03:07.430> can

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
socks come from because I think we can

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.350 
socks come from because I think we can
trace<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.329> back<00:03:08.739> well<00:03:09.739> here's<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.310> guy<00:03:10.940> or<00:03:11.180> the

trace it back well here's a guy or the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.600 
trace it back well here's a guy or the
basically<00:03:11.720> without<00:03:11.930> which<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.650> ball<00:03:12.920> no<00:03:13.250> no<00:03:13.459> no

basically without which I ball no no no

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.300 
basically without which I ball no no no
