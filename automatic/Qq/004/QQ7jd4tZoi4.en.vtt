00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
in this video sum up what we've looked

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.289 
in this video sum up what we've looked
at<00:01:58.840> here<00:01:59.049> today<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.649> on<00:01:59.770> Michael's<00:02:00.369> farm<00:02:00.670> it's

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
at here today and on Michael's farm it's

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.789 
at here today and on Michael's farm it's
basically<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.869> importance<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.380> grassland

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
basically the importance of grassland

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.800 
basically the importance of grassland
management<00:02:02.859> and<00:02:03.369> ultimately<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.420> impact

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
management and ultimately the impact

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.999 
management and ultimately the impact
that<00:02:04.990> will<00:02:05.049> have<00:02:05.259> in<00:02:05.380> your<00:02:05.409> bottom<00:02:05.859> line

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
that will have in your bottom line

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.520 
that will have in your bottom line
profit
