00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello, we are starting the first lesson on 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.899
 realflow program 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.420
 we will work version 2014 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.509
 so after starting the program with us 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.880
 there is such a window in which 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.619
 we need to project 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.859
 specify the project name and select a folder in 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.910
 which we will save it click 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.220
 create new project and you can work 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.619
 what attracts attention in 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.649
 the program interface first of all 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.350
 what is missing the buttons to to control 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.050
 the camera therefore 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.469
 remember the hotkeys and so alt and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.059
 left mouse button allows you to rotate 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.680
 the camera around the alt scene and the right button 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.610
 mouse removes and brings the camera from 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.600
 center of the scene alt and middle mouse button 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.710
 moves the camera up down right 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.920
 left further which is convenient 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.970
 the interface itself in version 2014 has become more 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.340
 friendly i mean most teams 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.070
 it becomes intuitive and necessary 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.830
 note that any sockets you can 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.270
 just dragging holding it just over it 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.490
 mouse button and move to any field 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.140
 where do you like that is basically everything 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.040
 here it moves more less everything 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.799
 as you like in work you can 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.310
 move let's say down all these 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.310
 instruments 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.920
 that is, to make absolutely any 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.820
 layout that allows you to do 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.119
 the program can be brought to the main field 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.030
 programs that is not fixing somewhere 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.509
 specifically again can be transferred 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.460
 down and so on here are the main panels 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.770
 tools can also be moved 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:11.009
 in places with each other as you like 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.470
 in order to save the settings of that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.720
 layout which 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:23.420
 took for themselves go to the tab lauch 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:27.020
 back click save laute and ask 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.210
 the name of this layout is saved 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:35.090
 later you can apply it as 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.110
 either make a default 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.190
 layouts and so on using buttons 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.270
 on keyboard 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.200
 one two three four we can change 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:52.880
 kind of display on the projection that is from 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:59.000
 us perspective top view front view 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.070
 side view and back perspective clicking on 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.970
 we can select this button 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.130
 simultaneous viewing from four cameras 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.030
 each of which we can build if 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.400
 don't need that 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:17.660
 closes the extra windows option is possible 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.459
 horizontal splits and also by two 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.459
 vertical windows 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:32.230
 below we have a standard panel 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:36.920
 animations and simulation buttons as well 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.170
 panel to create key frames all 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.930
 additional functions we will be with you 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.660
 look at our lessons 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.239
 Now for a long time not to dwell on them 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.269
 let's take a closer look let's 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:55.940
 scale of animation and what do these 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:57.880
 numbers and so this window indicates the total 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.690
 number of frames 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.900
 our scene figure in this window will be 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:11.030
 mark the frame from which to start 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:14.739
 Simulation figure from this side will be 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.650
 mark the frame in which the simulation 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.030
 will end and also we will need 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.389
 periodically look here in 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.000
 this window means the simulation is open 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.950
 arrow and choose additional 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.340
 teams will especially interest us 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:35.780
 this is a command line simulation 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.530
 command line settings that we 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:43.220
 also analyze putting additional 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:50.180
 simulation settings about which we also 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:53.030
 talk a little later later if 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.750
 go to the file menu and select the command 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.480
 reference to we can produce 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.820
 additional settings for the program 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.290
 it means there are a lot of settings 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.870
 we will not consider everything as in 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.270
 In principle, they are not all we need but like 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.660
 any program as i always say 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.810
 for full study it all depends 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.790
 only from you and the method of scientific poking but 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.669
 what we need most often first 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.160
 this is the general folder that we specify 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.010
 folder where our projects will be saved 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.570
 by default 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.260
 do a review choose a folder on 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:38.030
 computer and save further 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.390
 x and y axes layout 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.370
 3 options are possible here 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:48.130
 program related position 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:51.350
 lodge wave and cinema 4d for 3d max may 7 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.229
 houdini since i work more cinema 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:58.550
 4d thats i will leave lightwave 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.770
 and cinema 4d further simulation tab 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.770
 there are also a lot of settings here 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.539
 whom we talk later if they us 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.120
 need but consider the tab 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.400
 general means in the general tab we 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.470
 we can specify 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:17.870
 clean frame per second in this case 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:20.810
 worth 30 and the number of steps by how much i 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.470
 understood this number of particle collisions 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:28.310
 among themselves, the default is from 1 to 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.560
 300 the higher the maximum value 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.060
 more 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.990
 and stitch on will look your 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.870
 simulation but the longer it will go and 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:41.830
 the more power you need from 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:44.050
 your computer further in the tab 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:49.510
 display you can customize 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:52.900
 the color scheme that we still need and 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:57.750
 You can also note the tab came from 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:00.910
 where we can change the size of the icons 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.840
 let's try that is how you see 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:07.000
 icons have become much bigger knife on this 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.810
 our first lesson is over let's meet at 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.810
 next all bye
