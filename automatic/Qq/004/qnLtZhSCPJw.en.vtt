00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
movements the footwork which looks like

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.780 
movements the footwork which looks like
this<00:00:30.849> and<00:00:32.290> then<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.470> upper<00:00:33.770> body<00:00:33.949> which<00:00:34.520> looks

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
this and then the upper body which looks

you<00:00:42.890> starting<00:00:43.460> with<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.180> footwork<00:00:45.110> what's

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
you starting with the footwork what's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.549 
you starting with the footwork what's
gonna<00:00:45.830> happen<00:00:46.310> is<00:00:46.790> it's<00:00:47.090> pretty<00:00:47.570> simple<00:00:48.050> you

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
gonna happen is it's pretty simple you

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.560

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
like this going to tap it forward

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.030 
like this going to tap it forward
that's<00:00:53.180> your<00:00:53.330> pivoting<00:00:53.900> basically<00:00:54.470> on<00:00:54.800> your

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
that's your pivoting basically on your

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.720 
that's your pivoting basically on your
toe<00:00:55.970> okay<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:57.320> want<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.559> do<00:00:57.650> this<00:00:57.830> very

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
toe okay so you want to do this very

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.060 
toe okay so you want to do this very
simple<00:00:59.180> tap<00:00:59.570> out<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.410> then<00:01:00.650> bring<00:01:00.830> it<00:01:00.920> back

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
simple tap out and then bring it back

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.760 
simple tap out and then bring it back
the<00:01:01.699> other<00:01:01.730> one<00:01:02.050> back<00:01:04.300> out

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
the other one back out

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.609 
the other one back out
so<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:07.100> counts<00:01:07.460> go<00:01:07.610> like<00:01:07.790> this<00:01:07.970> one<00:01:08.720> in<00:01:09.080> two

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
so the counts go like this one in two

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.960 
so the counts go like this one in two
one

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.980 

-<00:01:13.570> yeah<00:01:14.110> one<00:01:14.650> -<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:15.820> know<00:01:16.150> this<00:01:16.420> seems<00:01:16.630> really

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
- yeah one - I know this seems really

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.580 
- yeah one - I know this seems really
simple<00:01:17.230> but<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.980> next<00:01:18.310> step<00:01:18.340> will<00:01:18.790> make<00:01:18.820> this

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
simple but the next step will make this

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.190 
simple but the next step will make this
proper<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:21.070> make<00:01:21.250> it<00:01:21.400> look<00:01:21.550> good<00:01:21.880> so<00:01:22.480> here<00:01:23.110> we

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
proper and make it look good so here we

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.680 
proper and make it look good so here we
go<00:01:23.350> this<00:01:23.650> is<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:24.310> second<00:01:24.970> movement<00:01:25.150> which<00:01:25.510> is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
go this is the second movement which is

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.480 
go this is the second movement which is
the<00:01:25.720> upper<00:01:26.110> body<00:01:26.290> movement<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:27.160> looks<00:01:27.340> like

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
the upper body movement it looks like

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.980 
the upper body movement it looks like
this<00:01:29.550> all<00:01:30.550> right<00:01:30.610> let<00:01:31.300> me<00:01:31.330> break<00:01:31.420> this<00:01:31.780> one

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
this all right let me break this one

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.530 
this all right let me break this one
down<00:01:32.050> for<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:32.650> what's<00:01:33.310> going<00:01:33.610> on<00:01:33.790> is<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.420> are

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540

down for you what's going on is you are
actually<00:01:34.990> leaning<00:01:35.230> backwards<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.340> you're

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
actually leaning backwards and you're

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.580 
actually leaning backwards and you're
bending<00:01:36.760> by<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.420> waist<00:01:37.750> here<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
bending by the waist here and the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.830 
bending by the waist here and the
movement<00:01:39.010> actually<00:01:39.490> goes<00:01:39.670> like<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.030> one<00:01:40.570> and

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
movement actually goes like this one and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.070 
movement actually goes like this one and
two<00:01:41.260> and<00:01:41.740> one<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.490> two<00:01:43.000> if<00:01:43.510> I<00:01:43.630> have<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.900> mimic

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
two and one and two if I have to mimic

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.500 
two and one and two if I have to mimic
it<00:01:44.440> let<00:01:44.800> me<00:01:44.920> show<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.400> you<00:01:45.550> on<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.820> side<00:01:46.060> so

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
it let me show it to you on the side so

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.830 
it let me show it to you on the side so
it<00:01:46.600> looks<00:01:46.750> like<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:47.050> one<00:01:47.980> and<00:01:48.400> two<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.150> one

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
it looks like this one and two and one

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.760 
it looks like this one and two and one
and<00:01:51.510> all<00:01:52.510> right<00:01:52.660> so<00:01:52.870> let's<00:01:53.290> give<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.620> try

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
and all right so let's give it a try

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.590 
and all right so let's give it a try
leaning<00:01:54.190> backwards<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.850> this<00:01:54.970> side<00:01:55.240> for<00:01:55.480> its

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
leaning backwards to this side for its

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.180 
leaning backwards to this side for its
part<00:01:55.840> counts<00:01:56.230> five<00:01:56.770> six<00:01:57.720> seven<00:01:58.720> eight<00:01:59.080> one<00:01:59.500> and

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
part counts five six seven eight one and

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.110 
part counts five six seven eight one and
two

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.700 

putting<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.270> two<00:02:07.300> together<00:02:07.660> looks<00:02:08.380> like<00:02:08.530> this

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
putting the two together looks like this

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:16.620 
putting the two together looks like this
one<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:10.030> two<00:02:14.700> let's<00:02:15.700> get<00:02:15.850> started<00:02:16.240> with<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
one and two let's get started with the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.540 
one and two let's get started with the
upper<00:02:16.990> body<00:02:17.020> leaning<00:02:17.650> motion<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.340> then

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
upper body leaning motion and then

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.640 
upper body leaning motion and then
working<00:02:18.730> out<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.360> footwork<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.320> I'm<00:02:20.470> gonna

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
working out on the footwork so I'm gonna

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.180 
working out on the footwork so I'm gonna
start<00:02:20.980> like<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.370> one<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.110> one<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.070> two

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
start like this one you and one and two

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.150 
start like this one you and one and two
and<00:02:24.630> once<00:02:25.630> they<00:02:25.750> get<00:02:25.900> into<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.200> group<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.740> I<00:02:26.950> get

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
and once they get into a group and I get

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.890 
and once they get into a group and I get
more<00:02:27.310> comfortable<00:02:27.640> I'm<00:02:28.180> gonna<00:02:28.360> have<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.690> full

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
more comfortable I'm gonna have the full

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.200 
more comfortable I'm gonna have the full
get<00:02:29.200> there<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.650> looks<00:02:29.830> like<00:02:29.890> this<00:02:30.160> one<00:02:30.820> and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
get there so it looks like this one and
