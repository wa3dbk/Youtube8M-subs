00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.190
 their ranks of late polish and 22 years 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.990
 of saint jean baptiste in montérégie 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.599
 then you evolve for the redmen of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.420
 mcgill today on one's own stock market 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.460
 15 100 dollars to their account that's 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.080
 sure it's fun to be 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.480
 receive some money actually 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.519
 a lot of money as a student 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.570
 athlete of a work tale we do not have 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.580
 a lot of time to work on 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.510
 studying one's training having one's 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.589
 $ 3000 press for to overcome these 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.030
 Personal expenses 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:37.559
 for sure it's a really good 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.539
 help is sure it's 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.609
 a lot of sacrifices but I would say 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.159
 when we love what we do we count 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.139
 not the hours finally that side school side 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.429
 so a lot of time but I think 

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:49.739
 that what is important is investing 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.239
 some agreements to invest do 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.559
 that we arrive on the ground gives me 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.260
 100% then not to do too much 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.199
 football the discipline of life but 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.029
 Jacques not to the season is enough 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.280
 it's military enough because we have 

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:07.229
 is a morning meeting after his gma 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.729
 school day now I counted 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.159
 adopted full time so what to say 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.859
 since a full time jobs then after 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.329
 his evening in a practice so let's go 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.240
 raji of the party at the end of the week so 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.810
 there is not much time left but 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.789
 for sure, as I said earlier 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.549
 importance and remote channels free 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.750
 to enjoy it even if half an hour 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.729
 unhooked then I think is important to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.039
 compartmentalize well since we do for 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.630
 to be able to fully enjoy 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.869
 moments at the time we are even it's 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.499
 not much what it is more 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.700
 big dream is going to have to ask the 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:40.109
 question some of the earlier 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.969
 I did not know what to say but 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.799
 now I think I see the 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.109
 opportunities that starts to smile for 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.700
 perhaps may be cfl 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.649
 maybe in the united states it's 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.939
 will see finally I would like that it's from 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.009
 push as far as possible why 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.390
 to bet regret later because 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.689
 I love football obviously 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.819
 moreover I think and will have to answer as 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.639
 question but the whole strategic aspect 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.929
 of the game the spirit of equipped then to see 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.090
 how much we can always push without 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.659
 another level be it small 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.679
 videos 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.049
 training is a sport really 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.170
