00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.669
 and select memories ti 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:31.109

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.219
 achievements 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.859
 they give him x 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.309
 then squeeze a lot x about five or six times 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.939
 and you're done, you're already hacked your psp 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.359
 they no longer have to be spending on games they already saw 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.239
 he is already jaqueado 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.749
 but not completely sacked 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.479
 they have to install the recovery phase 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.929
 that program is so that it is permanently plundered 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:01.159
 because if you're hacked if you're hacked but for example if you take away the battery to your 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.209
 psp is going to remove the one that has been 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 and with this program it is no longer taken away, you just have to do the same 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.469
 when you install steel jaqueado 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.309
 you select the game that is below the installer select it you press 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:20.039
 many times x and ready but I at the moment I do not want to leave plundered miter 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.119
