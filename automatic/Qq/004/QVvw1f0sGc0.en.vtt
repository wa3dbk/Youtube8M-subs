00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.730 

one<00:00:00.359> of<00:00:00.450> the<00:00:00.510> aspects<00:00:00.930> of<00:00:00.989> photography<00:00:01.140> that's

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
one of the aspects of photography that's

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.730 
one of the aspects of photography that's
always<00:00:01.949> intrigued<00:00:02.490> me<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.540> sense<00:00:03.840> that<00:00:03.990> a

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
always intrigued me is the sense that a

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
always intrigued me is the sense that a
camera<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.970> time<00:00:06.569> machine<00:00:07.220> it's<00:00:08.220> able<00:00:08.550> to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
camera is a time machine it's able to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.150 
camera is a time machine it's able to
freeze<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> moment<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.660> time<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.260> freeze<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> face

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
freeze a moment in time to freeze a face

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.810 
freeze a moment in time to freeze a face
to<00:00:11.490> freeze<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.210> place<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.670> transport<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
to freeze a place and transport it to

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.490 
to freeze a place and transport it to
somewhere<00:00:15.269> else<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.660> world<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.260> some

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
somewhere else in the world and some

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.349 
somewhere else in the world and some
other<00:00:16.770> time<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.820> look<00:00:17.970> into<00:00:18.210> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
other time I can look into a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.290 
other time I can look into a
daguerreotype<00:00:18.690> or<00:00:19.699> into<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.150> other

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
daguerreotype or into one of the other

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.410 
daguerreotype or into one of the other
photographs<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.609> I'm<00:00:23.609> looking<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.150> an<00:00:24.269> object

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
photographs and I'm looking at an object

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660 
photographs and I'm looking at an object
yes<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.260> I'm<00:00:25.350> also<00:00:25.590> looking<00:00:26.010> back<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.640> time

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
yes but I'm also looking back in time

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.210 
yes but I'm also looking back in time
the<00:00:27.449> face<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.900> see<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> daguerreotype<00:00:28.949> was

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the face I see in the daguerreotype was

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
the face I see in the daguerreotype was
looking<00:00:30.179> into<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> camera<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:31.050> hundred<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
looking into the camera a hundred and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
looking into the camera a hundred and
fifty<00:00:31.830> hundred<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.309> sixty<00:00:32.669> years<00:00:32.910> ago<00:00:32.969> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
fifty hundred and sixty years ago and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.870 
fifty hundred and sixty years ago and
he's<00:00:33.930> looking<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.469> me<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.370> see<00:00:35.640> him

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
he's looking at me now and I can see him

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.330 
he's looking at me now and I can see him
looking<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.420> me<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:37.950> spooky

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
looking at me it's a little bit spooky

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
looking at me it's a little bit spooky
at<00:00:38.670> first<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.590> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> end<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.030> become

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
at first but in the end you you become

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.880 
at first but in the end you you become
absorbed<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.989> them<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.440> begin<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.770> wonder

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
absorbed in them and you begin to wonder

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
absorbed in them and you begin to wonder
about<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.550> people<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> images<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.719> who

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
about the people in the images and who

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.369 
about the people in the images and who
they<00:00:46.020> were<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:47.370> their<00:00:47.550> lives<00:00:47.789> were<00:00:48.120> like

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
they were and what their lives were like

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.950 
they were and what their lives were like
most<00:00:49.379> photographs<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.160> paper<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.360> film

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
most photographs are on paper or on film

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.439 
most photographs are on paper or on film
but<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.590> daguerreotype<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.370> actually<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
but the daguerreotype was actually on a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.290 
but the daguerreotype was actually on a
mirror<00:00:55.410> surface<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> silver<00:00:56.940> plate

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
mirror surface it was a silver plate

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.990 
mirror surface it was a silver plate
that<00:00:58.020> was<00:00:58.260> polished<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> mirror<00:00:59.100> finish<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that was polished to a mirror finish and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.779 
that was polished to a mirror finish and
the<00:01:00.510> image<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:01.109> captured<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.219> surface<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the image was captured on the surface of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.509 
the image was captured on the surface of
the<00:01:02.969> mirror<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.989> most<00:01:04.290> mirrors<00:01:04.799> we're

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the mirror and like most mirrors we're

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.859 
the mirror and like most mirrors we're
very<00:01:05.700> comfortable<00:01:05.880> looking<00:01:06.479> at<00:01:06.600> mirrors

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
very comfortable looking at mirrors

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.810 
very comfortable looking at mirrors
we've<00:01:07.049> seen<00:01:07.290> them<00:01:07.439> all<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> time<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
we've seen them all the time but the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
we've seen them all the time but the
really<00:01:09.299> uncanny<00:01:09.900> thing<00:01:10.260> about<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.740> Garrett

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
really uncanny thing about it to Garrett

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.850 
really uncanny thing about it to Garrett
type<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.720> you<00:01:12.720> look<00:01:12.960> into<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
type is you look into this and you

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.850 
type is you look into this and you
recognize<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.700> being<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.090> mirror<00:01:15.860> but

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
recognize that as being a mirror but

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
recognize that as being a mirror but
instead<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.580> own<00:01:17.610> face<00:01:18.000> looking<00:01:18.390> back<00:01:18.600> at

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
instead of your own face looking back at

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.520 
instead of your own face looking back at
you<00:01:19.020> there's<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.409> face<00:01:19.619> from<00:01:20.180> 160<00:01:21.180> years<00:01:21.420> ago

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
you there's a face from 160 years ago

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.890 
you there's a face from 160 years ago
looking<00:01:22.530> back<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.159> who<00:01:24.090> came<00:01:24.299> first<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
inventing photography is an issue that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.780 
inventing photography is an issue that
will<00:01:27.570> never<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> resolved<00:01:28.590> I've<00:01:28.740> been<00:01:29.700> at

publish<00:01:55.979> pretty<00:01:56.969> much<00:01:57.149> immediately<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.869> think

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
publish pretty much immediately I think

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.130 
publish pretty much immediately I think
that<00:01:58.649> they<00:01:58.829> were<00:01:58.969> totally<00:01:59.969> stunned<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:01.110> find

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that they were totally stunned to find

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.749 
that they were totally stunned to find
out<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:01.950> somebody<00:02:02.189> else<00:02:02.490> working

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
out that there was somebody else working

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.300 
out that there was somebody else working
on<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> same<00:02:03.360> thing<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.869> inventing<00:02:04.860> process

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
on the same thing and inventing process

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.210 
on the same thing and inventing process
at<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> same<00:02:05.820> time<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.810> I'll<00:02:07.469> say<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.039> I

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
at the same time but I I'll say this I

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.360 
at the same time but I I'll say this I
think<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:09.119> Tolbert<00:02:10.190> invented<00:02:11.190> photography

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
think that Tolbert invented photography

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.440 
think that Tolbert invented photography
I<00:02:12.090> think<00:02:12.959> Daguerre

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
I think Daguerre

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.490 
I think Daguerre
conjured<00:02:15.450> up<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:16.460> form<00:02:17.460> of<00:02:17.610> magic<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.900> created

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
conjured up a form of magic that created

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.730 
conjured up a form of magic that created
images<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.370> were<00:02:21.200> different<00:02:22.200> than<00:02:22.500> anything

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
images that were different than anything

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.700 
images that were different than anything
else<00:02:23.010> you've<00:02:23.280> ever<00:02:23.370> seen
