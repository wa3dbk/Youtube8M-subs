00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.610
 and I dare I find you for a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 little video while editing today 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.910
 since in fact I want you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 talk about this lipstick if that's the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.740
 lipstick from the collection that has 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.699
 released kate moss this is the lipstick 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.630
 lasting finish in shades 107 is in 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.010
 did I said that I wanted you in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.410
 talk I really wanted to test it and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 see him 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 they have very very pretty hue I 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.640
 would not like to say nonsense seven or 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.969
 eight 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.890
 I reconfirm writing anyway they 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.030
 have a promise I 'm already going 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 try to test a little bit all 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.760
 their promises that they 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.670
 promise 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.629
 eight hours of holding so it seems to me 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.070
 here I want to keep all day I 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.090
 will not do it again is the goal of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.920
 this video is really not 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.360
 put back lipstick at all tested 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.010
 throughout these days and see the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.480
 result what remains to me on the lips 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.699
 tonight so that's it already 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
 about 10 minutes even though I 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.399
 will apply the time to prepare the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.559
 video I 'm done a little for them 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.090
 hair anyway and so so that's it 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.470
 ten minutes of applications but I 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.299
 nothing I have not eaten since 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.590
 so here we are going to test together for 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.240
 everyone these days this little 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.470
 lipstick it's gone for eight 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.960
 hours of video so there I am in my 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.619
 I'm coming back from a little cappuccino 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.350
 at a friend's house 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.290
 and we can see that you do not have so much 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.700
 moved so here I drank normally 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.990
 I have not necessarily been careful there 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 was red anyway on the cup 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.159
 but here I think it still holds 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.290
 still not bad so we continue 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.380
 our little one is throughout this 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380
 day 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.899
 I found after my lunch so I 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.369
 drunk I ate you can see that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.890
 the inside of the lips is a small 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.750
 little attenuated but I still find 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.399
 that for the moment it's okay it's not the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.100
 disaster it remains portable can 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.720
 still going out 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.759
 I think he's still holding 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.619
 well for the moment so we continue this 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.729
 little test and we'll see a little more 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.729
 late in the day what it gives 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.539
 here I find you he is 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.319
 almost 18 hours after a small 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.360
 to taste a glass of water having blablater a 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.640
 little bit on the phone that's what 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.200
 rest of my lipstick so we see 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.180
 although it's emptying more and more 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.890
 the bottom lip but I find when 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.040
 even that it holds pretty much without 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.900
 retouch again without having anything 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.640
 nothing to bring back or what on 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.739
 making a little bit careful brood 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.310
 that's okay listen, I'm going on and we're 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.959
 speak again in a few hours 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.790
 and here I finished so my meal from 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.500
 evening so I think I want nothing 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.970
 eat now I'll be able to 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.959
 it's the end of the day it's 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.470
 almost 20 hours small checkup so this 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.549
 test this lipstick but we can 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.090
 to say that in minutes he still 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.859
 welcome i am quite surprised beyond 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.739
 maintaining the quality of the 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.790
 lipstick or color that 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.359
 that's really good 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.950
 that they stay pretty pretty so I'm valid 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.510
 still I validate this lipstick 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.130
 I find them I find it very well in 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.109
 terms of outfit it is well the color 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.360
 is very pretty so I think I'm going 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.190
 to get into a 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.780
 in another in another color and 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.250
 so I do not really know how much they 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.530
 have shades if they have not bad and 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.130
 they really have a nice palette of 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.130
 colors 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.570
 so here I can really for him 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.490
 recommend we tested together 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.650
 today this red to her I 'm going 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.090
 apply at 8 o'clock this morning and it is 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.920
 20 hours so we have more than eight hours 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.660
 outfit now I found it nice 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.700
 this little test video maybe I 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.010
 would do for other for other 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.500
 products tell me if you liked it 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.500
 sure and then that's it but I leave you 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:14.180
 old v2 rocket iii there were good friends 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:18.950
 but no 3 2 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.950
 here they made me very much agree
