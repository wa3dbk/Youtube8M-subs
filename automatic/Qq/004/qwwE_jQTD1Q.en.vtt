sling<00:01:38.159> very<00:01:38.850> very<00:01:39.060> lightweight<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.990> very

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
sling very very lightweight but very

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.600 
sling very very lightweight but very
very<00:01:40.439> strong<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:41.009> well<00:01:41.189> when<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.490> actually

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
very strong as well when I'm actually

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190 
very strong as well when I'm actually
going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.390> edge<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
going to go to the edge with this and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.929 
going to go to the edge with this and
put<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> fish<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.340> rather<00:01:44.549> than<00:01:44.729> taking

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
put the fish in it so rather than taking

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.700 
put the fish in it so rather than taking
the<00:01:45.060> fish<00:01:45.270> out<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> water<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> net<00:01:46.259> I'm

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the fish out the water in the net I'm

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.990 
the fish out the water in the net I'm
going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> take<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> out<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.729> makes<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
going to take it out in this it makes it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.090 
going to take it out in this it makes it
much<00:01:48.210> easier<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.689> carry<00:01:49.020> them<00:01:49.140> over<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.710> then

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
much easier to carry them over and then

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.039 
much easier to carry them over and then
put<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.369> straight<00:01:50.549> onto<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> mat<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.689> I'll<00:01:51.780> do

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
put it straight onto the mat so I'll do

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.230 
put it straight onto the mat so I'll do
that<00:01:52.079> now

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.249 

okay<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.299> I'm<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> edge

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
okay so I'm going to get in the edge

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.800 
okay so I'm going to get in the edge
because<00:01:58.649> I've<00:01:58.740> got<00:01:58.890> waterproof<00:01:59.130> shoes<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.810> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
because I've got waterproof shoes on and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.539
