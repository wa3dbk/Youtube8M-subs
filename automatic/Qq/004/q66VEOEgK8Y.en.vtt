actually has a slight disadvantage in
this<00:01:08.790> matchup<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:10.049> closer<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
this matchup because you're closer to

this matchup because you're closer to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the trees much more likely to get shot

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.690 
the trees much more likely to get shot
yes<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:13.049> you're<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.340> more

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
yes if you're in the back for you more

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700 
yes if you're in the back for you more
likely<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.090> run<00:01:15.450> into<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.750> shackle<00:01:16.380> shot<00:01:16.530> there

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
likely to run into a shackle shot there

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.020

but<00:01:17.210> other<00:01:18.210> things<00:01:19.100> I'm<00:01:20.100> looking<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.820> looking

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
but other things I'm looking at looking

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.090 
but other things I'm looking at looking
at<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.840> other<00:01:21.960> build<00:01:22.200> focus<00:01:22.590> fire<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
at the the other build focus fire do you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.020 
at the the other build focus fire do you
think<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.340> should<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.520> looking<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
think you should be looking to get that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.210 
think you should be looking to get that
at<00:01:24.240> level<00:01:24.450> 6<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.990> 75<00:01:25.439> minor<00:01:25.710> costs<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.100> at

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
at level 6 it's 75 minor costs now at

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.249 
at level 6 it's 75 minor costs now at
level<00:01:26.340> 1<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> worthwhile<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> still

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
level 1 is it worthwhile or is it still

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.600 
level 1 is it worthwhile or is it still
uh<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:29.310> quite

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
uh not quite

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.999 
uh not quite
I<00:01:29.880> don't<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.259> shackle<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.770> just

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
I don't think so you shackle is just

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.649 
I don't think so you shackle is just
really<00:01:32.369> important<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.390> gives<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
really important to have it gives you a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.719 
really important to have it gives you a
lot<00:01:33.810> more<00:01:33.900> uptime<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> majority<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> your

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
