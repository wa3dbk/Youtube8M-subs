 me that is the meaning of this script as a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.529
 we put some technique or sit down 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.359
 to another vehicle and drive it from ours 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.750

 let's next also . 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.360
 that is, we drive up the contours and cut 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.360
 distance 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.830
 ya echo dude zdarova 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.360
 the next one is given 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.879
 the script for which is necessary that is 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.129
 when you want a lot of technology overtake 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.819
 from place to place to eat once you donâ€™t 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:06.150
 ride you please have 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:08.560

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.299
 peace of mind go where you need 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.299
 so and the last tractor we have left 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:21.209
 now we connect it right counter f 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:25.290
 and reduce the distance 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.060
 now everyone is buzzing in all the whole tractor drivers 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:38.370
 Script will tell you it seems made 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:38.370
 ok so far so we all go 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.830
 Here and for braking there is no they remain if 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.830
 I will miss 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:58.070
 please any will maneuver they 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.070
 repeat with accuracy 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.420
 absolutely any and what if we have them now 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.420
 in the ring 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.959
 This is how Makarov will turn them down. 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.959
 route 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.459
 and leave 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.610
 no, everything is fine 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.100
 let's go to the farm on our that is 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.650
 ottarabanil them as they say in the garage 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:36.740
 by the way what is health like and how are they 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:40.600
 cross the road ok and you 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.600
 I see a customer something 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.760
 then suddenly it hurts oh oh 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.810
 them along with the brakes something not very 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.810
 well it turns out well ka again 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.080
 I have everything fine script works 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.830
 remarkably simple 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.910
 and here and so off us that is you 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:32.640
 come you need what to do 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:34.440
 start pushing f they all have keys 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.840
 iffara strangely the hotel should have been 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:43.340
 stop so okay and then what are we 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.340
 do press h 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:06:00.139
 and they ride will not ride wait a 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:06:05.949
 why am I still written everything is clear 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.949
 rice shift shift and h and f 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.130
 or shift and rain 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.820
 but 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:30.020
 yes trees and why i am disconnected 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.020
 listen all right I pinch the contour 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.020
 if 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.850
 but everything is perfectly figured right 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:05.750
 shift clamp already waiting 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:08.120
 continues and f to stop me all 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:12.340
 Everything is fine, I just tupanula 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.230
 little guys and so that is all 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.670
 collectors 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.670
 topic is not necessary to manage 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.180
 we got into another hitch continuing 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.389
 valid that is the tractor is not 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:33.389
 acts we clamp also shift with and 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:33.389
 everything 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.470
 and so on with the rest of the goods 

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:42.490
 there's these drivers have gone 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:45.909
 tom and is generally on mike to my 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:48.159

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:49.599
 firstly useful that is they can 

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:51.490
 enjoy really enjoy 

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:54.729
