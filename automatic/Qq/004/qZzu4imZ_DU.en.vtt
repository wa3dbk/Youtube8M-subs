at<00:00:29.919> this<00:00:30.009> mortar<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.400> mortar<00:00:30.820> level<00:00:31.029> 8<00:00:31.150> has

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
at this mortar the mortar level 8 has

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.900 
at this mortar the mortar level 8 has
750<00:00:32.110> hit<00:00:32.470> points<00:00:32.829> and<00:00:32.980> it<00:00:33.250> takes<00:00:33.430> this<00:00:33.579> dragged

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
750 hit points and it takes this dragged

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.810 
750 hit points and it takes this dragged
in<00:00:34.090> just<00:00:34.810> barely<00:00:35.290> three<00:00:35.950> hits<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.520> it

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
in just barely three hits and it

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.310 
in just barely three hits and it
actually<00:00:36.940> takes<00:00:37.270> up<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.510> mortar<00:00:37.810> pretty<00:00:38.170> much

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320

on<00:00:38.530> two<00:00:38.800> hits<00:00:38.829> so<00:00:39.220> I'm<00:00:39.399> assuming<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:40.420> the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
on two hits so I'm assuming that the

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.229 
on two hits so I'm assuming that the
dragon<00:00:40.899> is<00:00:40.960> pretty<00:00:41.170> much<00:00:41.260> doing<00:00:41.850> 370<00:00:42.850> damage

you guys can see right here this is what

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.460 
you guys can see right here this is what

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
as you can see here it absolutely

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.020 
as you can see here it absolutely
smeared<00:01:35.110> them<00:01:35.350> off<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:35.950> screen<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:36.760> that's

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
smeared them off the screen so that's

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.370 
smeared them off the screen so that's
gonna<00:01:37.150> be<00:01:37.240> pretty<00:01:37.420> good<00:01:37.720> as<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:37.990> replacement

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
for the Lightning spell next up we have

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.340 
for the Lightning spell next up we have
the<00:01:40.120> earthquake<00:01:40.630> spell<00:01:40.870> which<00:01:41.050> is<00:01:41.170> actually

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
the earthquake spell which is actually

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.540 
the earthquake spell which is actually
really<00:01:41.620> good<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.010> weakening<00:01:42.400> your

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
really good and weakening your

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.670 
really good and weakening your
opponent's<00:01:43.030> defenses<00:01:43.540> also<00:01:44.290> from<00:01:44.470> what<00:01:44.590> I'm

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
opponent's defenses also from what I'm

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.530 
opponent's defenses also from what I'm
aware<00:01:44.890> of<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:45.280> think<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:45.730> it<00:01:45.850> does<00:01:45.970> times<00:01:46.270> for

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
aware of I think that it does times for

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.450 
aware of I think that it does times for
damage<00:01:46.960> on<00:01:47.140> walls<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:47.770> this<00:01:47.920> will<00:01:48.040> be<00:01:48.160> also<00:01:48.310> a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
damage on walls so this will be also a

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.620 
damage on walls so this will be also a
really<00:01:48.670> good<00:01:48.790> way<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:48.970> taking<00:01:49.480> out<00:01:49.600> your

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
really good way and taking out your

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.900 
really good way and taking out your
opponent's<00:01:50.200> high<00:01:50.380> level<00:01:50.740> walls<00:01:50.950> next<00:01:51.670> up<00:01:51.790> we

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
opponent's high level walls next up we
