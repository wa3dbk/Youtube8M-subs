00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.150 

Bob<00:00:10.480> came<00:00:10.690> here<00:00:10.870> has<00:00:11.049> a<00:00:11.080> laser-guided<00:00:11.469> system

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
Bob came here has a laser-guided system

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.900 
Bob came here has a laser-guided system
here<00:00:12.369> basically<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:14.349> two<00:00:14.529> solutions<00:00:14.910> that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
here basically have two solutions that

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.300 
here basically have two solutions that
gives<00:00:16.119> that

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.250 

so<00:00:24.310> really<00:00:24.820> all<00:00:24.940> the<00:00:25.210> operator<00:00:25.540> has<00:00:25.689> to<00:00:25.930> do<00:00:26.050> is

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
so really all the operator has to do is

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.190 
so really all the operator has to do is
I'll<00:00:26.439> prescribe<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:27.189> machine

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
I'll prescribe the machine

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.460 
I'll prescribe the machine
and<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.620> lasers<00:00:29.040> do<00:00:29.160> all<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> work

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
and the lasers do all the work

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:40.240 
and the lasers do all the work
dead<00:00:30.980> on<00:00:31.130> accuracy<00:00:31.550> on<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.000> grade

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
did it the old system

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.930 
did it the old system
for<00:01:27.070> motors<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.870> 15<00:01:29.290> guys<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:30.010> do<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.160> 70,000

it took four days to do that in the past
and<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.490> they've<00:01:38.729> using<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> laser<00:01:39.450> creator

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
and now they've using the laser creator

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.179 
and now they've using the laser creator
with<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.770> guy<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.340> Rasheeda
