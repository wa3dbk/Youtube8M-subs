00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
improvements in this generation of

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.550 
improvements in this generation of
Genesis<00:00:49.790> compared<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:50.960> previous<00:00:51.290> city

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
Genesis compared to the previous city

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.979 
Genesis compared to the previous city
right<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:52.989> from<00:00:53.989> a<00:00:54.200> chassis<00:00:55.010> standpoint<00:00:55.989> there

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
right so from a chassis standpoint there

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.130 
right so from a chassis standpoint there
were<00:00:57.140> improvements<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:58.100> help<00:00:59.090> with<00:00:59.300> vehicle

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
were improvements to help with vehicle

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.560 
were improvements to help with vehicle
dynamics<00:01:00.710> cornering<00:01:01.430> response

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
dynamics cornering response

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.229 
dynamics cornering response
also

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
also

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.160 
also
to<00:01:05.840> help<00:01:06.079> improve<00:01:06.439> ride<00:01:07.159> comfort<00:01:07.759> and<00:01:08.390> just

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
to help improve ride comfort and just

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.190 
to help improve ride comfort and just
the<00:01:09.290> overall<00:01:09.680> dynamics<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.549> car<00:01:10.759> so<00:01:11.720> for

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
the overall dynamics of the car so for

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.719 
the overall dynamics of the car so for
this<00:01:12.350> v8<00:01:13.149> we've<00:01:14.149> gone<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:15.729> continuously

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
this v8 we've gone to a continuously

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.840 
this v8 we've gone to a continuously
damping<00:01:17.680> control<00:01:19.210> shock<00:01:20.210> absorber<00:01:20.750> that<00:01:21.850> is

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
damping control shock absorber that is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.380 
damping control shock absorber that is
always<00:01:23.770> adjusting<00:01:24.770> based<00:01:25.159> on<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.700> road<00:01:25.909> input

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
always adjusting based on the road input

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.279 
always adjusting based on the road input
you<00:01:27.289> also<00:01:27.470> have<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.950> opportunity<00:01:28.189> to<00:01:29.289> switch

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
you also have the opportunity to switch

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.910 
you also have the opportunity to switch
from<00:01:30.679> a<00:01:30.799> normal<00:01:31.220> mode<00:01:31.460> which<00:01:31.850> is<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.119> little<00:01:32.539> bit

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
from a normal mode which is a little bit

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.340 
from a normal mode which is a little bit
softer<00:01:33.920> more<00:01:34.159> compliant<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.659> sporty<00:01:36.320> ER

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
softer more compliant to a sporty ER

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.789 
softer more compliant to a sporty ER
that<00:01:37.310> gives<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.030> little<00:01:38.209> bit<00:01:38.420> more<00:01:40.119> fun<00:01:41.119> or

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
that gives you a little bit more fun or

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.520 
that gives you a little bit more fun or
aggressive<00:01:42.799> driving<00:01:43.690> capabilities<00:01:44.690> but

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
aggressive driving capabilities but

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.010 
aggressive driving capabilities but
still<00:01:45.860> without<00:01:46.069> being<00:01:46.549> harsh<00:01:47.420> and

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
still without being harsh and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.820 
still without being harsh and
uncomfortable<00:01:49.179> tied<00:01:50.179> to<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:50.590> we've<00:01:51.590> gone

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
uncomfortable tied to that we've gone

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.240 
uncomfortable tied to that we've gone
from<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.659> electoral<00:01:53.659> hydraulic<00:01:54.470> steering

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
from the electoral hydraulic steering

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.330 
from the electoral hydraulic steering
system<00:01:55.789> that<00:01:56.240> was<00:01:56.420> on<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.659> previous<00:01:57.080> car<00:01:57.380> to

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
system that was on the previous car to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.120 
system that was on the previous car to
this<00:01:59.920> rack-mounted<00:02:02.170> MDPs<00:02:03.170> electronic

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
this rack-mounted MDPs electronic

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.389 
this rack-mounted MDPs electronic
steering<00:02:04.549> system<00:02:05.049> so<00:02:06.049> with<00:02:06.289> that<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:07.280> know

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
steering system so with that you know

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.449 
steering system so with that you know
you<00:02:07.459> should<00:02:07.939> see<00:02:08.149> an<00:02:09.080> even<00:02:09.619> more<00:02:10.810> precise

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
you should see an even more precise

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.860 
you should see an even more precise
good<00:02:14.030> steering<00:02:14.329> fuel<00:02:14.769> from<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.950> car<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.870> some

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
good steering fuel from the car and some

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.160 
good steering fuel from the car and some
good<00:02:18.079> responsiveness<00:02:19.480> then<00:02:20.480> also<00:02:20.900> there<00:02:21.079> were

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
good responsiveness then also there were

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.660 
good responsiveness then also there were
areas<00:02:21.439> where<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:23.090> improve<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
areas where they improve the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.280 
areas where they improve the
capabilities<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:26.060> powertrain<00:02:26.569> mounting

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
capabilities of the powertrain mounting

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.099 
capabilities of the powertrain mounting
so<00:02:28.040> we've<00:02:28.250> gone<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.870> fully<00:02:29.870> electronic

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
so we've gone to fully electronic

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.379 
so we've gone to fully electronic
powertrain<00:02:33.109> mounts<00:02:33.620> which<00:02:34.370> give<00:02:34.909> you<00:02:35.120> more

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
powertrain mounts which give you more

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.039 
powertrain mounts which give you more
dynamic<00:02:36.200> damping<00:02:37.069> characteristics<00:02:38.049> also

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
dynamic damping characteristics also

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.500 
dynamic damping characteristics also
helps<00:02:39.469> with<00:02:39.590> mph<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.670> ride<00:02:41.569> comfort<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.560> then

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
helps with mph and ride comfort and then

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.949 
helps with mph and ride comfort and then
many<00:02:44.510> outright<00:02:45.079> our<00:02:45.790> NVH<00:02:46.790> improvements<00:02:47.659> to

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
many outright our NVH improvements to

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.259 
many outright our NVH improvements to
the<00:02:48.079> car<00:02:48.319> including<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.040> fully<00:02:49.790> enclose

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
the car including the fully enclose

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.220 
the car including the fully enclose
underbody

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
underbody

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.580 
underbody
and<00:02:51.590> then<00:02:52.159> some<00:02:53.260> enhancements<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.470> edge

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
and then some enhancements in the edge

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.830 
and then some enhancements in the edge
of<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.829> part<00:02:55.099> of<00:02:55.189> it<00:02:55.280> just<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.639> keep<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.510> cabin

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
of the part of it just to keep the cabin

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.480 
of the part of it just to keep the cabin
more<00:02:57.739> quiet<00:02:58.269> isolated<00:02:59.269> from

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
more quiet isolated from

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.940 

it<00:03:01.970> seemed<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.480> previous<00:03:02.810> generation

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
it seemed like the previous generation

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.810 
it seemed like the previous generation
had<00:03:03.950> there<00:03:04.130> was<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.310> little<00:03:04.550> bit<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.730> a

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
had there was a little bit of a

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.510 
had there was a little bit of a
disconnect<00:03:05.150> between<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:06.290> suspension<00:03:06.980> and

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
disconnect between the suspension and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.260 
disconnect between the suspension and
the<00:03:08.030> rest<00:03:08.240> of<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.420> car<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.380> this<00:03:09.920> car

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
the rest of the car and this car

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.790 
the rest of the car and this car
I<00:03:11.330> know<00:03:11.630> there<00:03:11.780> was<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.900> little<00:03:12.020> bit<00:03:12.170> more<00:03:12.350> of<00:03:12.470> it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
I know there was a little bit more of it

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.880 
I know there was a little bit more of it
integration<00:03:14.520> all<00:03:15.420> different<00:03:15.930> engineering

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
integration all different engineering

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.300 
integration all different engineering
teams<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.210> make<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.480> car<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:19.440> complete<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
teams to make this car a complete and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.250 
teams to make this car a complete and
work<00:03:20.520> all<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.060> citizens<00:03:21.360> work<00:03:21.660> together<00:03:21.840> was

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
work all the citizens work together was

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.470 
work all the citizens work together was
was<00:03:22.710> I<00:03:22.860> think<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.160> case<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.240> case

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
was I think the case that is the case

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.500 
was I think the case that is the case
and<00:03:24.900> actually<00:03:25.050> we<00:03:25.530> even<00:03:25.950> had<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.760> cooperation

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
and actually we even had the cooperation

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.920 
and actually we even had the cooperation
of<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.980> couple<00:03:29.820> engineers<00:03:30.030> from<00:03:30.450> Lotus

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
of a couple engineers from Lotus

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.120 
of a couple engineers from Lotus
engineering<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:32.430> would<00:03:32.700> come<00:03:32.880> over<00:03:33.300> at<00:03:34.130> key

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
engineering that would come over at key

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.000 
engineering that would come over at key
points<00:03:35.400> for<00:03:36.030> different<00:03:36.690> releases<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:37.830> the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
points for different releases for the
