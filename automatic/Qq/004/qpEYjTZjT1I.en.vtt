it<00:03:36.970> was<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.480> was<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.630> really<00:03:37.959> cool<00:03:38.230> thing<00:03:38.980> to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
it was it was a really cool thing to

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.949 
it was it was a really cool thing to
have<00:03:39.190> happen<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.180> first<00:03:40.540> hour<00:03:40.720> especially

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
have happen and first hour especially
