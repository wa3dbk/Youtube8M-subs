00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.850

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.979
 we do not bite mat rebeaud 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.279
 in itself but that's it 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.959

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.019
 Bogota - the planet 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.279
 voice over the map unesco blog 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.929
 this monopoly 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.230
 this first flight in the contest of the height a box 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.269
 he misses a lot 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.929

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.969
 holders in which hands excavators like others had 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:39.990
 not m 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.450
 to the file menu and mourad a bit likely that's called a step in 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.600
 the interest of all 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.240
 in a world 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.000
 in the world 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 my race for populism in eight countries 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.340

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.970
 unique in europe 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.350
 so these babies 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.570
 I will surely less than repeat the words of the pope 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.730
 the podium from little to next 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.150
 I am sure that of a keystone 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.620
 the group decided to change the mode to talk about him 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.610
 we are above we are busy to take part in the vote 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490
 at the time his most practical co-pilot 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.540
 dudley minimal 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.299
 all 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.129
 but our forums 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.609

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.719
 the lack a lot of birds 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.869
 therefore possible to describe it 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.519
 all this group is missing a lot 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.059
