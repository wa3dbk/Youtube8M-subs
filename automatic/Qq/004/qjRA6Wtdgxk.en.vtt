00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.049
 Now it's getting loud at our little memory training 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.089
 do not worry 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.800
 I do not want to introduce him but today I want to give them some help 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.160
 how the meaning of medical terms remember very easily 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.939
 can 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.679
 It is about the following terms to Emil the technical term for anemia 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.839
 the anosmia 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.849
 the loss of the sense of smell 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.920
 the medical history that the medical history or the course of a disease 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.920
 and amnesia, therefore, the loss of memory 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.730
 How can you remember what the term means? 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.300
 by making a note of the sound of the forte 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.600
 that leads them to meaning 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.850
 to Emil 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.880
 it sounds like a bit poor with a little imagination 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.170
 which is an indication of blood in courage 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.449
 different Meyer 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.720
 puts the English word more meaning the nose 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.379
 so that they have a simple hint that at different mid 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.620
 the loss of the sense of smell is 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.020
 everybody took these 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.420
 sounds similar to acceptance and recovery 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.630
 So they should be in the assumptions about recovery from the disease 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.870
 or the medical history and thus with anamnesis 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.880
 The harder they are at the sound of the word, the harder they are 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.440
 following sentence 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.740
 Assumptions about Messi the Scottish sea monster you can forget confidently 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.340
 so it is targeted 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.719
 the memory loss 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.210
 or forget that 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.140
 that's what they mean 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 successfully noted by four technical terms 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.750
 more on this topic you will find my book 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.460
 just remember everything 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.410
 including DVD to participate 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.310
 they receive the book in bookstores at Emmerson under Act from the publisher under DW 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.920
