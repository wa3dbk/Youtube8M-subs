00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
really quick was my approach to bulking

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.720 
really quick was my approach to bulking
or<00:00:42.629> gaining<00:00:43.020> muscle<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.680> whatever<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> if<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
or gaining muscle or whatever and if you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.220 
or gaining muscle or whatever and if you
watch<00:00:44.850> my<00:00:44.879> old<00:00:45.180> videos<00:00:45.510> you'll<00:00:45.750> notice<00:00:46.050> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
watch my old videos you'll notice that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.430 
watch my old videos you'll notice that
I've<00:00:46.469> made<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.129> lot<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> gains<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.989> know<00:00:49.200> I'm

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
I've made a lot of gains and I know I'm

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.590 
I've made a lot of gains and I know I'm
really<00:00:49.680> white<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.250> here's<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.610> approach<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
really white but here's my approach to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.369 
really white but here's my approach to
gaining<00:00:52.289> muscle<00:00:53.129> my<00:00:53.579> theory<00:00:54.030> or<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:54.750> idea<00:00:55.110> is

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
gaining muscle my theory or my idea is

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
gaining muscle my theory or my idea is
I'm<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> professional<00:00:56.760> bodybuilder<00:00:57.270> one

two<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.620> never<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.250> plan<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.520> doing<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.000> I

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
two I never really plan on doing it I

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.330 
two I never really plan on doing it I
lift<00:01:00.570> weights<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.590> best<00:01:01.829> me<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
lift weights to be the best me that I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.270 
lift weights to be the best me that I
can<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:03.270> challenge<00:01:03.660> myself<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.920> progress

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
can be to challenge myself to progress

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.030 
can be to challenge myself to progress
and<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.390> an<00:01:06.479> individual<00:01:07.110> sport<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

summer<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.450> might<00:01:48.570> gain<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.079> more

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
summer you might gain a little bit more

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.740 
summer you might gain a little bit more
muscle<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.950> your<00:01:50.250> bulk<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:51.090> you'll<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
muscle on your bulk but you'll have to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
muscle on your bulk but you'll have to
cut<00:01:52.020> longer<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.890> longer<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
cut longer and the longer you're in the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.700 
cut longer and the longer you're in the
deficit<00:01:54.030> there's<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.990> good<00:01:55.320> chance<00:01:55.560> that

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
deficit there's a good chance that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.260 
deficit there's a good chance that
you'll<00:01:55.979> end<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.250> losing<00:01:56.520> some<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.030> muscle

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you'll end up losing some of that muscle

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.109 
you'll end up losing some of that muscle
so<00:01:57.450> let's<00:01:58.290> take<00:01:58.530> me<00:01:58.770> who<00:01:59.280> tries<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.700> gain<00:01:59.850> 1

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
so let's take me who tries to gain 1

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.420 
so let's take me who tries to gain 1
pound<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.450> month<00:02:00.659> my<00:02:01.380> fat<00:02:01.619> gain<00:02:01.829> will<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.009> slower

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
pound a month my fat gain will be slower

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.060 
pound a month my fat gain will be slower
so<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.509> will<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.930> diet<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.590> little<00:02:04.920> bit

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
so I will have to diet just a little bit

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.880 
so I will have to diet just a little bit
less<00:02:05.939> or<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> lot<00:02:06.780> less<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.500> someone

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
less or actually a lot less then someone

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.650 
less or actually a lot less then someone
that<00:02:08.039> bulks<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> long<00:02:09.119> time<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.539> goes

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
that bulks for a long time and goes

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.600 
that bulks for a long time and goes
overboard<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:10.739> what<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.890> mean<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.370> kind

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
overboard you see what I mean it's kind

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.670 
overboard you see what I mean it's kind
of<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:12.030> scale<00:02:12.390> give<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.930> take

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
of like a scale give and take

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.399 
of like a scale give and take
either<00:02:13.920> gained<00:02:14.219> a<00:02:14.519> lot<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:15.000> muscle<00:02:15.450> or<00:02:16.200> not<00:02:16.379> a

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
either gained a lot of muscle or not a

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.380 
either gained a lot of muscle or not a
lot<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.980> little<00:02:17.129> bit<00:02:17.340> more<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:17.909> get<00:02:18.120> fatter

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
lot but a little bit more and get fatter

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.020 
lot but a little bit more and get fatter
but<00:02:18.959> then<00:02:19.109> on<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.260> other<00:02:19.319> side<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.609> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
but then on the other side you have to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.229 
but then on the other side you have to
cut<00:02:21.599> for<00:02:22.439> a<00:02:22.829> longer<00:02:23.250> period<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.609> time<00:02:23.879> and

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
cut for a longer period of time and

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.259 
cut for a longer period of time and
ultimately<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.680> end<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:26.549> most<00:02:26.730> efficient

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
ultimately in the end the most efficient

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.740 
ultimately in the end the most efficient
way<00:02:27.359> is<00:02:27.659> probably<00:02:28.409> just<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.310> gain<00:02:29.879> one<00:02:30.389> pound<00:02:30.420> a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
way is probably just to gain one pound a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.110 
way is probably just to gain one pound a
month<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.349> me<00:02:31.469> that's<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:32.159> 200<00:02:32.969> or

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
month and for me that's like a 200 or

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.360 
month and for me that's like a 200 or
300<00:02:33.569> calorie<00:02:33.870> surplus<00:02:34.079> but<00:02:34.799> anyway<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.159> thought

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
300 calorie surplus but anyway I thought

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.220 
300 calorie surplus but anyway I thought
I'd<00:02:35.489> give<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.700> guys<00:02:35.909> just<00:02:36.510> my<00:02:36.689> opinion<00:02:37.109> on

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
I'd give you guys just my opinion on

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.599 
I'd give you guys just my opinion on
that<00:02:37.409> and<00:02:37.709> if<00:02:37.859> you<00:02:37.920> don't<00:02:38.040> want<00:02:38.159> to<00:02:38.219> watch<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.879 
that and if you don't want to watch the
rest<00:02:38.639> of<00:02:38.879> the<00:02:38.969> video<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.840> don't<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.139> to<00:02:40.349> but

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
rest of the video you don't have to but

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.110 
rest of the video you don't have to but
this<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.519> my<00:02:41.670> room

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
but I forgot to say I still live at home

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.039 
but I forgot to say I still live at home
yeah

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
yeah

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.990 
yeah
I'm<00:02:52.379> 21<00:02:52.799> years<00:02:52.829> old<00:02:53.069> but<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.370> go<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.579> school<00:02:53.879> like

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
I'm 21 years old but I go to school like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.819 
I'm 21 years old but I go to school like
five<00:02:54.269> minutes<00:02:54.419> away<00:02:54.659> so<00:02:55.139> if<00:02:55.319> I<00:02:55.409> were<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.560> go<00:02:55.799> out

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
five minutes away so if I were to go out

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.059 
five minutes away so if I were to go out
and<00:02:56.010> get<00:02:56.430> an<00:02:57.180> apartment<00:02:57.799> one<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.980> would

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
and get an apartment one it would

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.220 
and get an apartment one it would
probably<00:02:59.250> be<00:02:59.609> really<00:03:00.060> far<00:03:00.329> away<00:03:00.599> from<00:03:00.659> school

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
probably be really far away from school

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.429 
probably be really far away from school
and<00:03:01.669> two<00:03:02.669> I<00:03:02.969> would<00:03:03.689> just<00:03:03.810> have<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.079> pay<00:03:04.230> money

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
and two I would just have to pay money

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.289 
and two I would just have to pay money
to<00:03:04.680> live<00:03:04.859> like<00:03:05.159> five<00:03:05.400> minutes<00:03:05.849> away<00:03:05.939> from<00:03:06.000> home

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
to live like five minutes away from home

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.569 
to live like five minutes away from home
and<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.859> doesn't<00:03:07.859> make<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:07.980> lot<00:03:08.129> of<00:03:08.189> sense<00:03:08.370> to

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
and that doesn't make a lot of sense to

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.149 
and that doesn't make a lot of sense to
me<00:03:08.700> but<00:03:09.180> anyway<00:03:09.480> here's<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:09.840> room<00:03:10.139> this<00:03:10.829> is
