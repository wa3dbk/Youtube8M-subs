00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and then the key in this move is when

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.320 
and then the key in this move is when
you<00:00:55.350> start<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> start<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:57.240> you

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
you start is the way you start when you

you start is the way you start when you
start<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:57.960> sure<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.380> you're

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
doing the right stuff if you start right

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.420 
doing the right stuff if you start right
everything<00:01:01.380> else<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.710> goes<00:01:01.890> smoothly<00:01:02.160> from

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
everything else just goes smoothly from

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.969 
everything else just goes smoothly from
there<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.090> started<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.450> wrong<00:01:03.690> way<00:01:03.979> if

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979

there if you started the wrong way if
I'm<00:01:05.159> gonna<00:01:05.250> happen<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.850> focus<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.329> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
I'm gonna happen so focus on the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.480 
I'm gonna happen so focus on the
beginning<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.350> how<00:01:07.650> does<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.950> start<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
beginning so how does it start then the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.690 
beginning so how does it start then the
one<00:01:08.820> couch<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.750> an<00:01:09.960> actual<00:01:10.380> sidestep<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.549> like

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
one couch is an actual sidestep so like

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.010 
one couch is an actual sidestep so like
if<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.450> way<00:01:12.509> I'm<00:01:12.899> gonna

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
if I'm going this way I'm gonna

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.440 
if I'm going this way I'm gonna
obviously<00:01:13.259> step<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:13.860> my<00:01:13.979> left<00:01:14.009> so<00:01:14.790> NZ<00:01:15.180> stuff

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
obviously step with my left so NZ stuff

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 
obviously step with my left so NZ stuff
with<00:01:15.600> my<00:01:15.720> left<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.170> lift<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.280> that

with my left and lift my right and that
happens<00:01:18.170> immediately<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.590> mean<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> same

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
happens immediately I mean the same

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.880 
happens immediately I mean the same
second<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.420> those<00:01:21.690> two<00:01:21.930> moves<00:01:22.200> together

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
second so all those two moves together

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.250 
second so all those two moves together
and<00:01:23.040> actually<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:24.090> count<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.870> the<00:01:25.050> count

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
and actually one count that's the count

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.719 
and actually one count that's the count
number<00:01:25.620> one<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.550> our<00:01:26.900> in<00:01:27.900> our<00:01:28.020> combos<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:29.580> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
number one in our in our combos so as I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
number one in our in our combos so as I
take<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> step<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> side<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:31.409> sure<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
take that step to the side I'm sure the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.020 
take that step to the side I'm sure the
list<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:31.979> fancy<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.520> guys<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:32.909> my

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
list of my fancy so you guys can see my

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.390 
list of my fancy so you guys can see my
footwork<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.290> same<00:01:34.560> step<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.010> going<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.250> be

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
footwork so the same step is going to be

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.420 
footwork so the same step is going to be
flat<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:36.740> I'm<00:01:37.740> gonna<00:01:37.890> left<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.609 
big step I'm making it just a little
bigger<00:01:48.780> than<00:01:48.869> probably<00:01:49.229> should<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.470> right

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
bigger than probably should be right

so again relax arms to you for now take
a<00:01:56.909> step<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.450> lift<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.960> if<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:59.010> were<00:01:59.130> still

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
a step and lift and if you were still

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.590 
a step and lift and if you were still
struggling<00:01:59.670> with<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.820> make<00:02:00.299> sure<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.479> focus

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
struggling with that make sure you focus

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600 
struggling with that make sure you focus
on<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.990> part<00:02:01.229> first<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.650> kind<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> practice

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
on that part first just kind of practice

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.910 
on that part first just kind of practice
it<00:02:02.760> and<00:02:02.850> bring<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.240> practice<00:02:04.170> bring<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.799> in

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it and bring it in practice bring it in

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.700 
it and bring it in practice bring it in
just<00:02:05.490> keep<00:02:05.700> doing<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.180> till<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.869> get<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.500> once

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
just keep doing it till you get it once

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.899 
just keep doing it till you get it once
you<00:02:07.799> feel<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.189> got<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.519> it's<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.879> a

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
you feel like you got it it's like a

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.270 
you feel like you got it it's like a
sport<00:02:09.269> in<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:09.810> true<00:02:09.959> -<00:02:10.289> those<00:02:11.069> are<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
sport in that's true - those are the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.559 
sport in that's true - those are the
same<00:02:11.489> thing<00:02:11.730> again<00:02:11.939> as<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.209> keep<00:02:12.360> walking

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
same thing again as you keep walking

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.820 
same thing again as you keep walking
this<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.530> 3<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.099> this<00:02:14.189> is<00:02:14.640> 4<00:02:15.060> ok<00:02:15.689> so<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.620> lift

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
this is 3 and this is 4 ok so the lift

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.979 
this is 3 and this is 4 ok so the lift
is<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.189> count<00:02:17.430> two<00:02:17.640> slide<00:02:17.909> is<00:02:18.269> another<00:02:18.629> count

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
is one count two slide is another count

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.479 
is one count two slide is another count
and<00:02:19.200> let's<00:02:19.379> keep<00:02:19.500> walking<00:02:19.739> with<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.159> sideways

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
and let's keep walking with it sideways

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.260 
and let's keep walking with it sideways
for<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> practice<00:02:21.810> ok

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
for a practice ok

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.880 
for a practice ok
one<00:02:22.870> two<00:02:23.740> three<00:02:24.550> four<00:02:25.510> five<00:02:26.440> six<00:02:27.310> seven<00:02:28.210> eight

one two three four five six seven eight

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.620 
one two three four five six seven eight
okay<00:02:29.890> do<00:02:30.460> an<00:02:30.580> exactly<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.090> same<00:02:31.240> thing<00:02:31.420> on<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
okay do an exactly the same thing on the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.620 
okay do an exactly the same thing on the
other<00:02:31.660> side<00:02:31.840> stepping<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:33.370> lift<00:02:33.730> together

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
other side stepping and lift together

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.700 
other side stepping and lift together
step<00:02:35.560> lift<00:02:35.890> together<00:02:36.700> step<00:02:37.660> lift<00:02:37.990> together

step lift together step lift together

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.570 
step lift together step lift together
step<00:02:39.700> lift<00:02:40.090> together<00:02:40.870> okay<00:02:41.680> what<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.400> feel

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
step lift together okay what you feel

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.130 
step lift together okay what you feel
like<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.730> guys<00:02:42.910> got<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.330> make<00:02:43.630> sure<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.900> speed

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
like you guys got it make sure you speed

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.200 
like you guys got it make sure you speed
it<00:02:44.260> up<00:02:44.320> from<00:02:44.530> there<00:02:44.710> so<00:02:45.640> he's<00:02:45.790> gonna<00:02:45.940> look<00:02:46.090> like

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
it up from there so he's gonna look like

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.360 
it up from there so he's gonna look like
this<00:02:46.390> if<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.660> goes<00:02:46.810> back<00:02:47.050> five<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.920> six<00:02:48.160> and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
this if it's goes back five and six and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.550 
this if it's goes back five and six and
seven<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.850> eight<00:02:49.000> one<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.960> two<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.500> three

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
seven and eight one and two and three

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.070 
seven and eight one and two and three
and<00:02:50.950> four<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.460> five<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:51.880> six<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.600> seven<00:02:52.690> and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
five and six and seven eight it took it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.030 
five and six and seven eight it took it
a<00:02:58.180> little<00:02:58.870> trickier<00:02:59.260> if<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.530> were<00:02:59.650> trying<00:02:59.830> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
a little trickier if you were trying to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.130 
a little trickier if you were trying to
move<00:03:00.190> fast<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:00.670> well<00:03:01.120> we're<00:03:01.750> trying<00:03:02.050> to

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
move fast and well we're trying to

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.660 
move fast and well we're trying to
switch<00:03:02.410> fast<00:03:02.740> from<00:03:02.950> side<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.190> side

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
switch fast from side to side

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.800 
switch fast from side to side
it's<00:03:03.940> really<00:03:04.150> what<00:03:04.270> you're<00:03:04.360> gonna<00:03:04.480> need<00:03:04.630> this

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
it's really what you're gonna need this

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.380 
it's really what you're gonna need this
which<00:03:05.320> is<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.650> last<00:03:05.860> step<00:03:06.240> that<00:03:07.240> you're

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
which is the last step that you're

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.780 
which is the last step that you're
taking<00:03:07.720> before<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.260> switch<00:03:08.560> try<00:03:09.400> not<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.700> take

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
taking before to switch try not to take

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.530 
taking before to switch try not to take
it<00:03:09.970> flat<00:03:11.400> step<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:12.610> this<00:03:12.910> cuz<00:03:13.210> that's<00:03:13.420> not

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
it flat step like this cuz that's not

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.210 
it flat step like this cuz that's not
kind<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:13.960> slowed<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.260> down<00:03:14.410> just<00:03:14.860> switch<00:03:15.070> of

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
kind of slowed you down just switch of

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.190 
kind of slowed you down just switch of
the<00:03:15.250> other<00:03:15.490> side<00:03:15.760> instead<00:03:16.510> what<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.870> would<00:03:17.020> do

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
the other side instead what you would do

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.620 
the other side instead what you would do
is<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.890> would<00:03:17.920> lift<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.880> then<00:03:19.120> bring<00:03:19.450> your

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
is you would lift and then bring your

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.360 
is you would lift and then bring your
foot<00:03:19.870> here<00:03:20.050> on<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.320> toe<00:03:20.500> individually<00:03:21.160> and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
foot here on the toe individually and

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.610 
foot here on the toe individually and
that's<00:03:21.700> gonna<00:03:21.910> make<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.270> next<00:03:22.510> step<00:03:22.620> really

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
that's gonna make the next step really

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.710 
that's gonna make the next step really
quick<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.310> other<00:03:24.550> side<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.330> what<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.510> mean

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
quick to the other side so what I mean

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.660 
quick to the other side so what I mean
like<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.990> is<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:26.950> if<00:03:27.070> I'm<00:03:27.220> going<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.550> the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
like that is this so if I'm going to the

down like this if you're travelling to

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.540 
down like this if you're travelling to
the<00:05:55.690> left<00:05:55.960> you<00:05:56.289> move<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.589> left<00:05:56.770> arm<00:05:57.099> if<00:05:57.430> you

travel to the right people the right arm

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.749 
travel to the right people the right arm
so<00:05:59.680> would<00:05:59.800> look<00:05:59.949> like<00:06:00.069> this<00:06:00.310> 5<00:06:00.610> &amp;<00:06:00.879> 6<00:06:01.089> &amp;<00:06:01.360> 7<00:06:01.479> &amp;<00:06:01.930> 8<00:06:02.110> &amp;

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
so would look like this 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp;

3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 excellent ok so those
are<00:06:13.479> just<00:06:13.539> ideas<00:06:13.810> but<00:06:14.319> before<00:06:14.529> she<00:06:14.680> gets<00:06:14.889> to<00:06:15.009> be

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
are just ideas but before she gets to be

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.649 
are just ideas but before she gets to be
creative<00:06:15.580> so<00:06:15.669> I<00:06:15.789> set<00:06:16.029> up<00:06:16.060> a<00:06:16.180> little<00:06:16.360> bit<00:06:16.509> do

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
creative so I set up a little bit do

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:17.969 
creative so I set up a little bit do
whatever<00:06:16.810> you<00:06:17.050> want<00:06:17.229> with<00:06:17.349> your<00:06:17.469> arms<00:06:17.770> and

whatever you want with your arms and
have<00:06:18.940> fun<00:06:19.089> with<00:06:19.300> it<00:06:19.449> so<00:06:19.750> that's<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.139> side<00:06:20.379> step

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
have fun with it so that's the side step

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:25.589 
have fun with it so that's the side step
that's<00:06:21.969> the<00:06:22.150> side<00:06:22.419> walking<00:06:23.289> hip<00:06:24.039> lifts<00:06:24.879> okay<00:06:25.449> I

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
that's the side walking hip lifts okay I

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.600 
that's the side walking hip lifts okay I
use<00:06:26.050> this<00:06:26.199> a<00:06:26.259> lot<00:06:26.349> in<00:06:26.529> my<00:06:26.650> combinations<00:06:27.460> and

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
use this a lot in my combinations and

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.730 
use this a lot in my combinations and
choreographies<00:06:28.270> so<00:06:28.930> hopefully<00:06:29.409> this<00:06:29.560> was<00:06:29.710> a

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
choreographies so hopefully this was a

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.930 
choreographies so hopefully this was a
