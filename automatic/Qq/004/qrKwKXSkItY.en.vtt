00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.750

 Thank you very much. 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.620

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.230
 Friendship was very happy very well. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.640
 Let's continue our conversation to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.739
 People spoke in the last video of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.640
 parts customization and I talked about 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.250
 some labels that you can 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.699
 put the part on is this painting you 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.780
 can sign can not sign your 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.850
 works a frame you sign 11 one 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.960
 painting you did in Bolivia 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.409
 wood 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.479
 It 's cool because sometimes 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.450
 customer wants to show someone and this 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.430
 anyone interested in union is an artist 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.549
 camila camargo who speak but call on 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.470
 end is easier to record your name is if 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.950
 Do you work with fabric also works? 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.299
 with fabric I use is this kind of 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.780
 The label will not be visible either 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.020
 So I had my name embroidered right, and one 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 embroidered on lurex and has a luster is well 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.460
 so cool in mine on the cushions in the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.560
 curtains in the kitchen and kitchen cloths 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.100
 I had trip all this leading up 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.259
 stitching I do by applying the label and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.140
 when I go to make carton or parts 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.140
 I put my tag on wood 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 Golden 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.399
 I do not know if I think it will reflect there. 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:06.479
 people but only to give you read gave 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.420
 so it can be golden it can be silver 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.160
 depending on the lock I choose 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.620
 combined time in third that combines 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.920
 more with gold 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.540
 but with silver so I 'm always 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.159
 I do not think I give a 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.680
 greater professionalism 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.080
 people notice in our soil taking care of the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.959
 milk whim trying to do so 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.569
 experience begins to customize 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.209
 signing the papers is 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.930
 This makes you more professional and well. 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.140
 cool senator to personalize your pieces 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.680

 in so many captains do not know what you peace 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.750

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.620

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.910
 In the first video I mentioned all the 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.430
 possibilities to make money but I 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.010
 I did not tell you about the virtual store. 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.150
 To say that right now because it is 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.569

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.859

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.120
 shows how many people viewed your 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.880
 posting is true if you do not have the fan 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.070
 You try to create a kiss for 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.880
 People are going to enjoy it there. 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.340
 It's Christmas and that's when you look, I had a 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.940

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.979
 only 40 people like the people 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.260
 they will see, it will matter, people will know 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.970
 What are you doing? 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.190

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.360
 You do what works best for you. 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.240

 Photo will talk about assignment by photo I 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.090
 I'm voting like this, I do not want to talk about

 serious people the importance of a photo 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.650
 well taken 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.479
 You do not need to have a camera. 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.530
 professional 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:26.710
 you just need to have a sense of light 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.830
 okay and put take a picture with the faith 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.650
 focus can not be deflated does not 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.580
 legal and students have to favor their 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.599
 job 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:42.970
 the best time to take a picture is 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:46.389
 afternoon in a place you do not have 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.729
 shadow and that there is no sun always that 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.800
 golden thing is white and gold is 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.849
 pretentious this can not happen 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.970
 your job, right? 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.820
 your colors and choose your work 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.349
 being clear then the light of day 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.380
 better than you have 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:04.479
 It is without influence of sun and without shadow 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.960
 then imagine one of four hours of 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:14.160
 afternoon 4 and 6 so it has not started yet 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:17.730
 It's getting dark in the afternoon and it's a clear day in the afternoon. 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.270
 in 11 places of preference where 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:23.280
 surrounding walls and table are clear 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.850
 white, preferably because you have 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.490
 some 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.710
 the reflection will not reflect the courage of 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.800
 catch a beautiful clear day and touch your 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.670
 piece in a blue wall, no color goes 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.640
 interfere 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:38.550
 so everything is clear and if you have too 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.520
 the possibility of creating a mini studio 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.520
 at home with the help of one and see the 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.560
 help of a box of forage 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.290
 inside to make an infinite background 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.240
 you bowing to a cardboard you 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.660
 bending sent SEFAZ background 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.780
 infinite right then all this will 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.790
 Professionalize more ta photos of good 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.490

 a virtual store on facebook 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:12.390
 Then search and call it store né 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.220
 you pay a small fee and all 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.770
 your friends have access to people can 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.700
