00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
 hello to all I am what you in child and I come to show an analysis to the 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.150
 crash bandicoot characters games and so on 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.299
 well let's start with the games in the first place is the crash bandicoot 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.020
 one for playstation 1 which I thought was a very good game since the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.800
 story and the levels were very well developed the story begins 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.480
 when the doctor or cortex with his assistant or your verve were trying to 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.630
 mutating animals with Ebola and yet cortex required someone to 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.060
 will lead the whole group and that is why he believes back but something goes wrong in the 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.400
 experiment and crash leaves a window towards an island 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.430
 but crash had fallen in love with a van dyk or called paula so the very 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.100
 assholes decided to travel the three islands to go rescue her 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.230
 this game was one of the first for the playstation and for its year of 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.930
 launch that was 1996 was not bad 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.020
 the bosses that appeared were easy to beat 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.020
 first you fought against Paco patón a pattern that only hit you with a 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.100
 cane and I turned to see if in one of those you shut up and you hit the balls and 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.860
 all you had to do was kick him in the back of the neck as it was his 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.950
 weak point 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.550
 Then I was re 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.120
 a crazy dog ​​that the only way to beat it was with explosions of 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.060
 very famous tnt behind in the end is that at first I found it difficult but 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.810
 you realize that it always jumps to the same places and that's when you have to 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.740
 calculate the fucking time to do the exploration 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.310
 then there is ko to the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.450
 a koala that threw rocks at you in a crystal mine the only thing 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.520
 worry was his dance so horny that he was doing that when he threw 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.600
 rocks the very stupid never hit you and it was enough for him to come back is the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.540
 same stroke and without aiming 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.200
 after pinstripes is' potorro a class of rat with a machine gun 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.660
 here you had to cover that you do not bore like a cheese and once you 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.680
 you were bullshit you gave him your classic tornado attack almost as harmful 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.270
 that a kick said not to laugh I must admit that of the bosses that we have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.680
 past the one that gave me the most battle was rich peru 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.570
 since he was the only one who took a life from me xd 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.260
 Now one of the bosses that I was scared the first time I saw him 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.929
 I refer to my river trust and it is that at the beginning of facing them first 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.919
 what do you say is go fuck 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.519
 but things change when he finishes throwing his last possible eagerness 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.949
 didactic is there when you take a position and it becomes a monster 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:22.029
 worse that can cause psychological traumas and you play it as a child and 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:26.249
 since every tornado attack does not work against pp it takes like ten lives to know 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.689
 that what you had to do was the tornado but in your head 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.910
 and finally we have the best boss in quotes 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.080
 I mean neocortex since you finish climbing up to your airship and what 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.120
 The only thing you have to do is dodge their shots and the greens return them with 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.800
 your attack returned until it has no life bars and decomposes its 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.209
 vehicle 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.870
 the truth is that I do not find many faults to this game 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.720
 since to be the first thing that will be so original, the only thing that does not 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.890
 I liked how complicated it was to get the gems since if you died 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.970
 revived at a check point and all your boxes went to hell and something else 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.290
 would be to save the game since the party ace the balls in getting 20 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.049
 lives I kept if the next day I went back to draw 4 in that case better use 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:11.959
 a code 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.789
 and another thing that has to be added is that you can send cortex to hell if 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:20.079
 you got all the gems since there is a level where if you get that 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.309
 all the gems are against one and escape but as I said before the gems 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:29.199
 they are very difficult to get so you better kick your ass to 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.919
 cortex xd the last thing I will add to finish talking about this good 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.759
 game is that I do not think he eliminated a level that will follow that and periquin 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.930
 since it was very difficult to pass and go that's true 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.349
 since just seeing it I imagine that I did not have it even though I have 80 lives and one 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.529
 expired side every time he performs 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:51.799
 however this level can be judged clear only with a press code 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.779
 This has been the first part of this collection of games behind 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.169
 soon to come up in the second part comment and vote and if you have 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.919
 some other information let me know I say goodbye to you goodbye
