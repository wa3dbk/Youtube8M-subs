00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello to all I explained today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.790
 how to make spring rolls of munster 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.830
 will need the brick sheet and the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:18.740
 master so here at first 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:23.460
 we will open our master cut in two 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 and here we will cut a slice of 1 cm 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.849
 about 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.800
 like this then we will take 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.399
 our brick sheet 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:43.170
 is rendered Frande a sheet it will 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.559
 delicately like these the floors of the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.340
 paper stays on the post then we go 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.949
 take our master slice on it 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.629
 puts on the edge of the sheet 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.680
 we will roll a first time as 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.300
 these a second time and there is flap 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.420
 the left side then folds the side 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.610
 right we always maintain and there we 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.150
 rolls so as to form the nem as 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.229
 this then we go to cooking ourselves 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.900
 let's put some oil in a 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.830
 stove and wait for it to heat up when 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.090
 the oil is hot 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.200
 we plunge our attention is not even 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.070
 burn we take the opportunity to prepare a 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.840
 absorbent paper on our plate and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.450
 a time they cook on this side 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.250
 here we go back the same where 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.530
 that they are well gilded and left 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.110
 cook on the other side once he 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.780
 is golden brown of each phase we remove 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.110
 gently to position it on the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.110
 absorbent paper 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.380
 the excellent coated like those here the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.380
 season with a little bit of salt 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:12.270
 of weight and so we get our same 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.270
 from master to see you soon goodbye
