00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.460
 the history of provolone valpadana begins 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.140
 in the mid- nineteenth century when the unity of Italy 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.059
 allowed provola producers 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.039
 southern caciocavalli to emigrate towards 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.589
 the Po valley and in that land 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.360
 to produce historically bound cheeses 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:41.030
 to their regions of origin 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:44.400
 [Music] 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.320
 thus a singular synthesis is realized 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.150
 between north and south of the peninsula which 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.989
 allowed the creation of a new one 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.140
 tradition 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.580
 from the meeting of distant cultures 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.830
 tradition that was codified in 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.200
 production disciplinary that protects it 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.059
 the ancient productive processes and that has 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.700
 found in the recognition of 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.290
 protected designation of origin 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:13.510
 further safeguard of its respect

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.440
 the provolone production area 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.990
 valpadana dop that is born exclusively 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.440
 dairy produced by frison and 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.480
 valle del po today includes 11 provinces 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.430
 the original and sinuous forms of this 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.410
 Spun paste cheese make it 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.840
 easily identifiable at first sight 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.570
 but the taste that allows 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.000
 appreciate the quality and flavors that a 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.040
 depending on the seasoning they vary from 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.040
 sweet to savory to spicy 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.140
 my family produces cheese for three 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.300
 generations 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:59.860
 the grandfather was awarded the diploma 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.900
 home in 1933 and at least 60 years 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.380
 we produce this prestigious cheese 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.070
 the provolone that over time has had the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.520
 there is recognition as a god product 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.640
 that we always try to produce 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.380
 maintaining the characteristics unchanged 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.760
 peculiar to this product therefore the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.200
 bond to the territory and above all the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.610
 characteristic of manual skill that 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.910
 distinguishes this tool 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.350
 Provolone cheese is extraordinary 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.470
 belongs to the product family 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.360
 of string cheese together with 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.460
 mozzarella with scamorza with la 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.370
 certainly provola when he arrived in 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.040
 Po valley and found milk 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.290
 the environment is absolutely suitable for 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.570
 also take on much larger forms 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.240
 much more important and full-bodied is 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.310
 become provolone and this 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.060
 practically after unification 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.459
 of Italy with 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.519

 family from the fifties yes 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.920
 dedicates to the production of this 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.049
 cheese is important to emphasize that 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.540
 the characterizing element is linked to 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:16.769
 territory is linked to the phase of 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.519
 Serum rennet grafting and 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.329
 I would also say to the spinning phase e 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.250
 shaping that one more phase 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.250
 purely manual 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.160
 a feature that distinguishes 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.530
 our production is the fact of 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.180
 be for at least twelve years a 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.850
 cheese that is produced 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.890
 absolutely no added preservatives 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:46.890
 neither in nor out

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.060

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.610
 place of honor on the tables of 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.140
 Italians in the kitchen offers many 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.030
 possibility for combinations and 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.830
 preparations thanks to his 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.380
 features that allow it to 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.750
 melt and spin with ease an 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.730
 user-friendly ductile product that 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.600
 enriches the table with its flavor 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:18.829
 and its genuineness
