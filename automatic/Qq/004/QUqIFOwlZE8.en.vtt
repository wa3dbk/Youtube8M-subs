this<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.439> my<00:00:19.710> version<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.520> let's<00:00:20.550> get<00:00:20.970> started

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
this is my version so let's get started

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.540 
this is my version so let's get started
as<00:00:21.810> always<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.380> use<00:00:22.410> white<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> base<00:00:23.220> color

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.220 
as always I use white for the base color
simply<00:00:24.210> because<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.600> makes<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.930> rainbow

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
