00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.479
 and well then come to another video 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.809
 tutorial and now let's see how 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:13.910
 we can record even more data in a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.470
 dvd or in a cd concept werner explained 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.030
 this program is free you can 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.610
 free download in lithium that stops 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.620
 the description and well let's do it with 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.600
 this program as well as seeing exposes in 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.850
 the initial screen we can create discs 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.640
 of audio data record iso images 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.450
 clean a rewritable disc 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.490
 obviously the data you have or copy 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.300
 your audio or data discs 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.610
 good in essence what has been 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.370
 erase disks will simply put the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.990
 select it and then I will 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.180
 they will erase their will clean what they have if it is 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.800
 rewritable as it says here to copy the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.240
 disc is for copying discs from 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.770
 audio data discs here in the 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.090
 mystery I will focus on the three 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.310
 first 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.810
 let's put data disc create images and 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.290
 about the data disks I'm this one from 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.880
 blah blah blah blah let's accept 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.340
 good as it tells us here and the screen 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.770
 of the program we could drag and 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.540
 drop the files here but good yo 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.380
 I recommend that you do it with that 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.079
 by the add button 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.720
 that is there and you browse the folders 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.930
 and you put them 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.900
 the files you want we select 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.020
 one and here I will tell you how much this 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.670
 file and then if you have the disk inserted 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.620
 will tell you if it fits or not if you see that the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.720
 limit bar exceeds it and it 's because it does not 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.270
 there is space because there is no space and there is no 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.100
 more remedy than converting the format of 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.890
 video you have tutors the same channel for 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.740
 that or you can just look for another 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.320
 way to put it in a larger disk 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.950
 good a pendrive for whatever 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.620
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.720
 give it to record 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.010
 and here it will tell us if we want to leave the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.980
 open disk if we see it finalized it 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.530
 puts more data and the advanced the truth 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.119
 is that one these gentlemen 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.130
 if you leave it open that michelle 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.380
 pleasantly if it's not futile it's not going to 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.429
 serve nothing and well simply you 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.429
 you go to the button 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.510
 and the time it takes and as it is now 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.819
 let's say we create the disk of 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.560
 audio for it the process is still 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.160
 again the same 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.190
 it's easy how to look for music and 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.130
 directly then do I do not know how to take the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.530
 songs you give to open and the program 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.260
 the add to this obviously different 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.090
 that the type of previous disk that what 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.250
 What we did was record three types of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.140
 file now for a music base and what 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.050
 what it does is create a disk as if it were 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.460
 it's music 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.130
 and lets you say put time 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.230
 intermediate between track and track and good 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.730
 well here you see in the lower bar the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.190
 track number and more or less the time 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.170
 that occupy relationships of time that is 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.210
 the duration of the track the weight that 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.160
 have the bitrate so on and so what 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.170
 same by reading to record and 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.900
 that's just the option to clean 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.689
 is for 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.579
 to delete the compilation and delete it 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.420
 so if you want to erase us from a 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.120
 disk 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.549
 you will not record and ready 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.440
 then the window will appear that 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.480
 tells you what speed thanks you want the 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.819
 name that is what you want if you want 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.950
 pauses between tracks or not if not like that 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.180
 you want here and if you want here and you give 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.890
 to a long indefinite break 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.420
 they follow the process reaction of ages 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.209
 although it's not really necessary for the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.310
 music is to turn off the computer if you want 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.500
 after a recording and obviously 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.090
 If you want to close the disk or not 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.549
 to add more boleros later 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.500
 another thing is that you want to put music in 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.549
 half of which you already had that is no longer 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.689
 can do so he thought that in the 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.239
 order 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.560
 and finally record the image and only that 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.689
 It allows us to do good, above all 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.609
 for the most basic what I usually ask 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:01.290
 the people then is to record the 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.389
 images and are from video games by 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.909
 example or of programs we can not 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:10.139
 run virtually with diamond tools 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:13.169
 with him with alcohol but good if 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.790
 you want to do if we say with a cd or 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.700
 because it requires doing it with a CD 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.530
 you do in recording image 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.120
 and select the image you want 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.150
 record in the search of our disk 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.150
 hard 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.550
 then you can choose these methods of 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.080
 recording that good I think I 've 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.510
 chosen automatically is the best thing that 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.280
 it does 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.030
 the same if you want to install the disk not 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.810
 eject it as is 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.390
 is that it does not have much mystery that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.640
 get a converter that we do not live 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.950
 of an image in the margin that does what 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.630
 is positive in the program and is already 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.370
 simply here this section ends 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.930
 tutorial this program really useful no 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.250
 to be able to worth anything 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.110
 you want and most importantly and totally 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.300
 free if you are interested in these 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:01.460
 tutorials subscribe to the like and we 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.460
 we see in the next tutorial thank you
