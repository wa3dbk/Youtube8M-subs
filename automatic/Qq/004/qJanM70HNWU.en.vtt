00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.920 
per second you're actually showing
during<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.130> slo-mo<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
during the slo-mo so if you want it to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.950 
during the slo-mo so if you want it to
be<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> hundred<00:01:44.250> percent<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.630> so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
be at a hundred percent this is one so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.179 
be at a hundred percent this is one so
this<00:01:46.140> means<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.040> be

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
this means that it's going to be

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.760 
this means that it's going to be
basically<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.000> normal<00:01:48.420> speed<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.350> move<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
basically at normal speed if you move it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.380 
basically at normal speed if you move it
down<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.090> gonna<00:01:51.149> be

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
down here then you can see it's gonna be

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.200 
down here then you can see it's gonna be
15<00:01:51.960> percent<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.560> normal<00:01:53.189> speed<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.060> we're

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
15 percent of normal speed so we're

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.240 
15 percent of normal speed so we're
gonna<00:01:54.299> leave<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:54.840> at<00:01:55.140> 15%<00:01:56.040> or

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
gonna leave it right there at 15% or

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.999 
gonna leave it right there at 15% or
0.15<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.210> then<00:01:57.630> down<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.649> slow

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
0.15 and then down here we have the slow

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.609 
0.15 and then down here we have the slow
mode<00:01:59.369> video<00:01:59.729> ramp<00:02:00.240> volume<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.049> all<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.409> is

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
mode video ramp volume and all this is

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.950 
mode video ramp volume and all this is
is<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> volume<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.090> slow<00:02:03.329> mode<00:02:03.570> portion

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
is the volume for the slow mode portion

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.749 
is the volume for the slow mode portion
of<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.530> video<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.219> move<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> all<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
of the video so you can move it all the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.969 
of the video so you can move it all the
way<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.149> 5<00:02:06.420> times<00:02:06.719> or<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.649> leave<00:02:07.829> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
way up to 5 times or you can leave it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.919 
way up to 5 times or you can leave it
down<00:02:08.009> here<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.640> he's<00:02:09.179> saying<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
down here and he's saying that the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.780 
down here and he's saying that the
developers<00:02:10.440> saying<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.950> around<00:02:11.280> 2<00:02:11.550> is

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
developers saying that around 2 is

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.490 
developers saying that around 2 is
normal<00:02:12.300> volume<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:12.989> leave<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.260> right

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
normal volume so you can leave it right

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.880 
normal volume so you can leave it right
there

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
there

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.080 
there
and<00:02:14.040> that's<00:02:14.400> where<00:02:14.550> I'm<00:02:14.610> gonna<00:02:14.700> leave<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:14.970> for

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and that's where I'm gonna leave it for

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.760 
and that's where I'm gonna leave it for
this<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.660> now<00:02:15.810> let's<00:02:15.960> go<00:02:16.050> ahead<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.410> jump<00:02:16.620> into

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
this so now let's go ahead and jump into

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.920 
this so now let's go ahead and jump into
the<00:02:17.070> photos<00:02:17.550> here<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:18.420> you're<00:02:18.600> going<00:02:18.750> to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the photos here and now you're going to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
the photos here and now you're going to
notice<00:02:19.290> all<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.740> videos<00:02:20.070> have<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.940> slo-mo

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
notice all the videos have that slo-mo

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.970 
notice all the videos have that slo-mo
emblem<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:21.960> there<00:02:22.200> when<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> showed<00:02:22.950> you

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
emblem on there when I showed you

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.670 
emblem on there when I showed you
earlier<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.790> didn't<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.570> toggling<00:02:25.530> that

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
earlier that it didn't so toggling that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.050 
earlier that it didn't so toggling that
on<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.280> give<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> ability<00:02:26.730> to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
on is going to give you the ability to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.390 
on is going to give you the ability to
make<00:02:27.450> all<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:28.140> older<00:02:28.560> videos<00:02:28.590> even<00:02:29.190> the

make all of your older videos even the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.610 
make all of your older videos even the
ones<00:02:29.550> you've<00:02:29.670> already<00:02:29.760> recorded<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.590> slo-mo

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
ones you've already recorded in slo-mo

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.590 
ones you've already recorded in slo-mo
and<00:02:31.830> if<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.100> tap<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> video<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.180> you're

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
and if we tap on a video then you're

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.240 
and if we tap on a video then you're
gonna<00:02:33.720> get<00:02:34.020> these<00:02:34.230> bars<00:02:34.590> up<00:02:34.800> here<00:02:34.830> in

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
gonna get these bars up here in

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.010 
gonna get these bars up here in
everything<00:02:35.700> between<00:02:36.090> these<00:02:36.300> two<00:02:36.510> black<00:02:36.780> bars

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
everything between these two black bars

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.750 
everything between these two black bars
which<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.410> can<00:02:37.560> slide<00:02:37.860> through<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.640> your

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
which you can slide through with your

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.970 
which you can slide through with your
fingers<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.360> going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.020> be<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.320> slo-mo<00:02:40.800> so

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
fingers are going to be in slo-mo so

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.200 
fingers are going to be in slo-mo so
everything<00:02:41.370> right<00:02:41.580> there<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.910> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.150> be

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
everything right there is going to be

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.820 
everything right there is going to be
slo-mo<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:42.960> all<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.320> be<00:02:43.440> normal

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
slo-mo this is all going to be normal

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.610 
slo-mo this is all going to be normal
speed<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.430> let's<00:02:45.120> go<00:02:45.270> ahead<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.570> play<00:02:46.380> this

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
speed so let's go ahead and play this

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.710 
speed so let's go ahead and play this
just<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.640> show<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.850> guys<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.450> does

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
just to show you guys that this does

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.290 
just to show you guys that this does
work<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:54.959> didn't<00:02:55.170> do<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> very<00:02:55.470> good<00:02:55.590> job<00:02:55.740> on

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
work so I didn't do a very good job on

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.430 
work so I didn't do a very good job on
placing<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.450> slo-mo<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.020> maybe<00:02:58.140> I'll<00:02:58.320> do<00:02:58.410> a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
placing that slo-mo but maybe I'll do a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.290 
placing that slo-mo but maybe I'll do a
little<00:02:58.590> bit<00:02:58.709> better<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.760> one<00:02:59.970> let's<00:03:00.150> make

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
little bit better on this one let's make

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.490 
little bit better on this one let's make
this<00:03:01.160> right<00:03:02.160> here<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.870> all<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.080> want<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.290> do<00:03:04.380> is

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
this right here so all you want to do is

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.840 
this right here so all you want to do is
slide<00:03:04.740> those<00:03:05.010> two<00:03:05.310> black<00:03:05.580> bars<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:08.670> should

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
slide those two black bars that should

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.410 
slide those two black bars that should
be<00:03:08.970> good

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
be good

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.550 
be good
let's<00:03:09.660> play<00:03:09.870> that

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.920 

so<00:03:18.190> not<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.459> coolest<00:03:18.700> slow-mo<00:03:19.300> videos<00:03:19.660> that

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
so not the coolest slow-mo videos that

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.960 
so not the coolest slow-mo videos that
I've<00:03:20.110> ever<00:03:20.290> done<00:03:20.590> but<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.250> just<00:03:21.520> wanted<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.850> show

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
you how this works and you can change up

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.090 
you how this works and you can change up
the<00:03:24.880> speed<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.750> what<00:03:26.200> you're<00:03:26.350> playing<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:26.950> let

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
the speed and what you're playing so let

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.470 
the speed and what you're playing so let
me<00:03:27.160> go<00:03:27.280> ahead<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.520> do<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.640> real<00:03:28.090> quick<00:03:28.330> as

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
me go ahead and do that real quick as

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.470 
me go ahead and do that real quick as
well<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:30.040> let's<00:03:30.280> change<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.700> slow-mo<00:03:31.180> right

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
well so let's change the slow-mo right

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.710 
well so let's change the slow-mo right
to<00:03:31.780> let's<00:03:32.530> go<00:03:32.650> half<00:03:32.920> speed<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:34.330> it's<00:03:34.450> gonna<00:03:34.540> be

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
to let's go half speed so it's gonna be

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.780 
to let's go half speed so it's gonna be
a<00:03:34.750> little<00:03:35.020> bit<00:03:35.140> quicker<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.680> we'll<00:03:36.340> go<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.489> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
a little bit quicker and we'll go to the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.990 
a little bit quicker and we'll go to the
last<00:03:37.540> video<00:03:38.050> that<00:03:38.260> we<00:03:38.560> were<00:03:38.709> just<00:03:38.950> at<00:03:39.190> just<00:03:39.850> to

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
last video that we were just at just to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.930 
last video that we were just at just to
kind<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.270> give<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.480> guys<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:41.200> look<00:03:41.950> at<00:03:42.280> what

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
kind of give you guys a look at what

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.660 
kind of give you guys a look at what
this<00:03:43.090> does<00:03:46.770> so<00:03:47.770> you<00:03:47.830> can<00:03:48.010> see<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:48.340> actually

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
this does so you can see it's actually

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.580 
this does so you can see it's actually
quite<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:48.910> bit<00:03:49.180> quicker<00:03:49.510> than<00:03:50.080> it<00:03:50.230> was<00:03:50.410> before

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
quite a bit quicker than it was before

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.530 
quite a bit quicker than it was before
and<00:03:50.950> that's<00:03:51.100> just<00:03:51.370> due<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.850> slow<00:03:52.090> mo<00:03:52.300> rate

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
and that's just due to the slow mo rate

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.229 
and that's just due to the slow mo rate
which<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.900> can<00:03:53.080> change<00:03:53.350> in<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.070> settings<00:03:54.489> so

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
which you can change in the settings so

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.880 
which you can change in the settings so
this<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.600> actually<00:03:55.870> pretty<00:03:56.019> exciting<00:03:56.590> for<00:03:56.769> the

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890
