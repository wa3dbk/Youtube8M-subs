00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:02.850
 yes people 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.300
 In particular, I was just now just show how to kill with animals 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.440
 because most people wanted to be written also try our language 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.989
 we most can not seem to talk 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.610
 So we did not realize very quickly 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.150
 up here 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.640
 I am specially for the played 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.779
 Minute as descriptions too 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.230
 then you have this Fortuna then you have 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.760
 Bolelli north one 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.380
 and she is Bernd Jansen 2 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.700
 Brandt come out 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.000
 then the PCs Reichs and PC built the Pixar 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.250
 the benefit 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.360
 15 folders 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.290
 This may cause extraction 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.380
 and that feed the Pixar PCI Picardie round 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.579
 and quite important advises the expert Tell that is not quite right 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.480
 Sor Extraction complicated 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510
 staffing 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.510
 We can delete these files 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.750
 Hommels that you can not anymore 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.310
 specified Julien implies Heinen-esser from file creates this 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.860
 East shines 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.080
 Now all classes are inside 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.010
 Erik Massmann warrior 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.260
 Prevention must look for itself 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.550
 Sillian 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.170
 so closes - goals 9 so that now exaggerated SSPE 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.390
 the Dusseldorfer used Reinert you can take round shop 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.390
 Melua ball or number enter Finnish what is 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.310
 so also better will be such a complicated one 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.360
 that would mean 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.510
 Save as 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.130
 which is is always and ever the first part stands 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.000
 I have to find Bristol better tomorrow 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 2 0 2 percent 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.540
 to save 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.640
 the last honor 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.260
 would have to click this is his whole 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.860
 first of all, sees go 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.140
 what we decide 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.140
 and now even how to squeeze on these great 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.410
 now 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.650
 for the 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.650
 Armor full of gear and to say 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.219
 they are about 1 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.609
 Wulff not 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.369
 Now the file still wanted the Irish in this place from others 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:20.959
 quote again 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.739
 Add layer 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.090
 and how do they look in the ten percent is all a bit easier 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.420
 already heard a lot 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.119
 Said these pledges but it is feasible 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:34.159
 Owner important is always difficult sometimes Hester I do now 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.609
 not this tool is used 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:37.949
 times 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.889
 our lesson 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.069
 the field is also nice to see 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.119
 Mark Herrmann 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.140
 Renovations 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.140
 Contours continue and saturation 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:55.829
 It looks very nice 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 and all we do is just pull it again 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.299
 levels 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.109
 Citigroup 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.829
 it is important that it makes sense because 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.329
 he is actually always 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.329
 so that here "Müller now rules 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.919
 and give the right one for the individual 1 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.259
 Save as 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.259
 finds his tax r 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.759
 and now that's important 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.509
 the xte 5 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.649
 that is what he will look like 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:30.579
 OK 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.559
 to save 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.399
 these files 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.179
 in turn 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:39.389
 Murray said Schröder 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.319
 would have to be in Romania now 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.969
 Bon more

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.239
 Time for me now is a problem "I would have the thing with me now 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:08.680

 created 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.419
 this copy machine will be 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.479
 then throw the European elections 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.599
 before we do that

 as always 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.700
 Epstein off 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.450
