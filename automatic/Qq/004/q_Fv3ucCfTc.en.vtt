DNT and in today's video we're working
on<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> tree<00:00:13.950> bomb<00:00:14.160> ma'am<00:00:14.670> alright<00:00:15.480> what's<00:00:15.630> a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
on a tree bomb ma'am alright what's a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.269 
on a tree bomb ma'am alright what's a
tree<00:00:15.900> bomb<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.289> thing<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.619> kills<00:00:17.160> people

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
tree bomb it's a thing that kills people

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.640 
tree bomb it's a thing that kills people
and<00:00:17.760> actually<00:00:18.480> that's<00:00:18.600> our<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.199> tiny<00:00:19.439> but

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
and actually that's our the tiny but

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.200 
and actually that's our the tiny but
switches<00:00:20.070> kind<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.340> came<00:00:20.520> from<00:00:20.670> i<00:00:20.850> was<00:00:20.970> putting

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
switches kind of came from i was putting

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.509 
switches kind of came from i was putting
this<00:00:21.359> thing<00:00:21.420> together<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.529> at<00:00:22.859> first<00:00:22.949> i<00:00:23.400> had

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
this thing together so at first i had

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.250 
this thing together so at first i had
you<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:24.000> what<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.300> thought<00:00:24.510> was<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.660> great<00:00:24.930> idea

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
you know what I thought was a great idea

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.939 
you know what I thought was a great idea
just<00:00:25.980> put<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.599> piston<00:00:27.599> push<00:00:28.590> limit

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
just put you know a piston push limit

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
just put you know a piston push limit
blocks<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.670> know<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.849> where<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.150> can't<00:00:30.359> push

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
blocks you know to where it can't push

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.749 
blocks you know to where it can't push
any<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:30.960> power<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> piston<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.340> any<00:00:32.489> point

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
any more power the piston at any point

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.340 
any more power the piston at any point
when<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.030> break<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.510> it'll<00:00:33.780> push<00:00:34.110> up

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
when you break it it'll push up

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.920 
when you break it it'll push up
apparently<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.370> has<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.790> updated<00:00:36.300> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
apparently not it has to be updated so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
apparently not it has to be updated so
scrapped<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> idea<00:00:38.000> there's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> smaller

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
scrapped that idea there's a smaller

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.660 
scrapped that idea there's a smaller
ones<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:40.020> there<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.680> there<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:41.250> example<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
ones up there out there for example to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.639 
ones up there out there for example to
have<00:00:41.790> an<00:00:41.879> upside<00:00:42.180> down<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.570> switch<00:00:42.809> which<00:00:43.500> are

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
have an upside down but switch which are

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.410 
have an upside down but switch which are
cool<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.950> their<00:00:44.129> tiny<00:00:44.309> only<00:00:45.030> problem<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.300> I

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
cool in their tiny only problem that I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.930 
cool in their tiny only problem that I
have<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> Blake

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
have with them is that you have to Blake

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.060 
have with them is that you have to Blake
break<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.840> final<00:00:49.079> block<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.710> you're<00:00:49.920> like

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
break the final block so you're like

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.529 
break the final block so you're like
mine<00:00:50.280> mine<00:00:50.670> nothing<00:00:51.059> happens<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
mine mine nothing happens if that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.100 
mine mine nothing happens if that
happens<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.559> something<00:00:52.980> happens<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> with

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
happens then something happens so with

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.979 
happens then something happens so with
mine<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> clock<00:00:56.039> pretty<00:00:56.309> much

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
mine I just one with a clock pretty much

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.200 
mine I just one with a clock pretty much
this<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.230> part<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.340> optional<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.059> going

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
this up part here is optional just going

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
this up part here is optional just going
to<00:01:00.270> break<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> clock<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> doesn't<00:01:01.530> keep<00:01:01.680> on

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to break the clock so it doesn't keep on

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.119 
to break the clock so it doesn't keep on
going<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.210> down<00:01:03.979> but<00:01:04.979> yeah

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
going up and down up and down but yeah

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.429 
going up and down up and down but yeah
let's<00:01:06.080> bring<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> blow<00:01:08.689> all<00:01:09.689> right<00:01:09.930> let's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
let's bring it to blow all right let's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.570 
let's bring it to blow all right let's
break<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:13.880> let's<00:01:14.880> give<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.210> little<00:01:15.360> little

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
break that let's give it a little little

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:24.320 
break that let's give it a little little
place<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:19.850> mmm<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.360> go<00:01:22.820> yeah<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.119> I'll

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
place to be mmm there we go yeah so I'll

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.550 
place to be mmm there we go yeah so I'll
just<00:01:24.360> basically<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.930> these<00:01:25.110> onesies<00:01:25.500> were

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
just basically do these onesies were

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
just basically do these onesies were
actually<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.670> will

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
actually and then this one will

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.749 
actually and then this one will
definitely<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:27.990> activated<00:01:28.610> everything<00:01:29.610> else

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
definitely get activated everything else

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.249 
definitely get activated everything else
was<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:29.970> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> explode<00:01:31.110> by<00:01:31.259> association

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
was just kind of explode by association

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
was just kind of explode by association
alright<00:01:34.259> good<00:01:34.409> we're<00:01:34.650> good<00:01:34.770> yeah<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.670> with

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
alright good we're good yeah so with

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
alright good we're good yeah so with
this<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.180> pretty<00:01:36.540> much<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.960> mind<00:01:37.229> any<00:01:37.470> block

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
this one pretty much just mind any block

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.999 
this one pretty much just mind any block
that's<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> middle<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.470> pushes<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
that's in the middle and it pushes and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.319 
that's in the middle and it pushes and
then<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.400> goes<00:01:41.490> silent<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
then it goes silent you're like what the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
then it goes silent you're like what the
crap<00:01:42.509> was<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:43.860> start<00:01:44.130> mining<00:01:44.340> you

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
crap was that and they start mining you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.830 
crap was that and they start mining you
like<00:01:44.820> I'll<00:01:45.380> screwed<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.220> yes<00:01:47.490> yes<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.659> let's

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
like I'll screwed so yes yes so let's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.870 
like I'll screwed so yes yes so let's
build<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:50.100> pretty<00:01:50.369> much<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:50.820> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
build it so pretty much we're going to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
build it so pretty much we're going to
go<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:52.350> doesn't<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
go with the it doesn't have a be a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.350 
go with the it doesn't have a be a
sticky<00:01:53.220> piston<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.700> normal<00:01:53.939> pissed<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.240> go

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
sticky piston just normal pissed and go

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.380 
sticky piston just normal pissed and go
up<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:55.049> two<00:01:55.470> three<00:01:55.890> four<00:01:56.189> five<00:01:56.390> six

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
up like one two three four five six

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.969 
up like one two three four five six
seven<00:01:58.670> sure<00:01:59.670> seven<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> will<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.500> this

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
seven sure seven and then I will do this

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.260 
seven sure seven and then I will do this
as<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.490> 8th<00:02:03.210> block<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:04.070> then<00:02:05.070> 9<00:02:05.399> 10<00:02:05.939> 11<00:02:05.969> 12<00:02:06.659> 13

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
as the 8th block and then 9 10 11 12 13

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.699 
as the 8th block and then 9 10 11 12 13
so<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.420> your<00:02:09.599> trees<00:02:09.929> are<00:02:10.289> not<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> be

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
so if your trees are not going to be

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.000 
so if your trees are not going to be
this<00:02:10.860> tall<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.520> know<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:11.819> just

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
this tall you know then just

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.470 
this tall you know then just
kind<00:02:12.129> of<00:02:12.189> adjust<00:02:12.489> for<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.700> basically<00:02:13.330> what

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
kind of adjust for that basically what

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.729 
kind of adjust for that basically what
happens<00:02:13.750> here<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.080> there's<00:02:14.560> too<00:02:14.680> many

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
happens here is that there's too many

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.470 
happens here is that there's too many
blocks<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.310> piston<00:02:15.670> can't<00:02:15.879> push<00:02:16.120> which<00:02:16.360> is

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
blocks to the piston can't push which is

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.199 
blocks to the piston can't push which is
exactly<00:02:16.659> what<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.319> want<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.790> then<00:02:18.939> build<00:02:19.120> a

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
exactly what we want and then build a

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.270 
exactly what we want and then build a
clock<00:02:19.420> any<00:02:20.049> clock<00:02:20.260> will<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:20.680> if<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.129> have<00:02:21.220> a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
clock any clock will do if you have a

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.149 
clock any clock will do if you have a
favorite<00:02:21.670> clock<00:02:21.879> go<00:02:22.299> with<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.860> let<00:02:23.860> me<00:02:23.950> tell

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
favorite clock go with that let me tell

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:30.030 
favorite clock go with that let me tell
you<00:02:24.280> how<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.400> do<00:02:25.390> your<00:02:25.420> clocks<00:02:28.019> all<00:02:29.019> right<00:02:29.200> so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
you how to do your clocks all right so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.710 
you how to do your clocks all right so
at<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.250> point<00:02:30.519> this<00:02:31.090> thing<00:02:31.269> isn't<00:02:31.390> going<00:02:31.659> to

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
at this point this thing isn't going to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.330 
at this point this thing isn't going to
be<00:02:31.780> able<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.049> push<00:02:32.230> until<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.769> break<00:02:33.069> one<00:02:33.129> of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
be able to push until I break one of

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.830 
be able to push until I break one of
these<00:02:33.840> see<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.670> any<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.150> our<00:02:37.540> any<00:02:37.690> of

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
these see that so any of our any of

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.539 
these see that so any of our any of
those<00:02:37.989> will<00:02:38.230> work<00:02:38.260> what<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:38.799> mean<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.430> sense

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
those will work what I mean in the sense

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.699 
those will work what I mean in the sense
of<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.760> trees<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.329> birches<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.319> don't<00:02:41.500> think

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
of the trees is birches I don't think

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.380 
of the trees is birches I don't think
real<00:02:41.890> five<00:02:42.099> high<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:42.909> might<00:02:43.540> look<00:02:43.689> suspicious

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
real five high so might look suspicious

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.280 
real five high so might look suspicious
everything<00:02:46.390> else<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.690> pretty<00:02:46.870> much<00:02:46.930> get<00:02:47.170> to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
everything else you pretty much get to

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.949 
everything else you pretty much get to
go<00:02:47.819> alright<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:49.030> then<00:02:49.180> we'll<00:02:49.299> do<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.450> tiny<00:02:49.750> bud

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
go alright so then we'll do the tiny bud

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.990 
go alright so then we'll do the tiny bud
switch<00:02:50.139> i<00:02:50.500> doesn't<00:02:51.099> have<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.400> be<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.549> sticky

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
switch i doesn't have to be a sticky

switch i doesn't have to be a sticky
piston<00:02:52.180> either<00:02:52.510> again<00:02:52.840> let's<00:02:53.590> reiterate<00:02:53.829> that

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
piston either again let's reiterate that

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.170 
piston either again let's reiterate that
and<00:02:54.549> then<00:02:55.359> block<00:02:55.870> here<00:02:56.170> block<00:02:56.440> here<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.430> keep

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
and then block here block here and keep

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.610 
and then block here block here and keep
in<00:02:58.299> mind<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:58.510> probably<00:02:58.629> don't<00:02:58.989> need<00:02:59.139> sticky

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
in mind you probably don't need sticky

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.899 
in mind you probably don't need sticky
piston<00:02:59.889> because<00:03:00.099> all<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.489> stuff<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.760> going

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
piston because all this stuff is going

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.140 
piston because all this stuff is going
to<00:03:00.940> get<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.180> blown<00:03:01.810> up<00:03:02.099> um<00:03:03.099> alright<00:03:03.819> perfect

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
to get it blown up um alright perfect

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.309 
to get it blown up um alright perfect
and<00:03:04.540> then<00:03:05.200> just<00:03:05.379> dust<00:03:05.739> here<00:03:06.420> all<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:08.109> have<00:03:08.200> to

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
and then just dust here all you have to

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.080 
and then just dust here all you have to
do<00:03:08.470> is<00:03:08.620> just<00:03:08.650> reverse<00:03:09.069> redstone<00:03:09.609> torch<00:03:09.849> guys

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
do is just reverse redstone torch guys

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.449 
do is just reverse redstone torch guys
that's<00:03:10.329> it<00:03:10.540> that's<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.379> then<00:03:12.129> just<00:03:12.280> give

that's it that's it and then just give

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.899 
that's it that's it and then just give
it<00:03:12.549> enough<00:03:12.790> room<00:03:14.040> towards<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.519> know<00:03:15.639> going<00:03:15.849> to

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
it enough room towards you know going to

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.740 
it enough room towards you know going to
be<00:03:16.060> able<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.510> house<00:03:17.139> some<00:03:17.379> TNT<00:03:18.329> alright<00:03:19.329> so

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
be able to house some TNT alright so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.089 
be able to house some TNT alright so
what<00:03:20.440> I'm<00:03:20.500> going<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.680> do<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:20.859> because<00:03:21.010> I'm

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
what I'm going to do is because I'm

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.819 
what I'm going to do is because I'm
going<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.280> make<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> redstone<00:03:21.639> torch<00:03:21.849> tower

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
going to make a redstone torch tower

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.849 
going to make a redstone torch tower
we'll<00:03:23.829> just<00:03:23.949> use<00:03:24.099> a<00:03:24.129> repeater<00:03:24.519> here<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:25.859> then

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
we'll just use a repeater here and then

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.250 
we'll just use a repeater here and then
we'll<00:03:27.400> just<00:03:27.579> place<00:03:27.819> TMT<00:03:28.389> all<00:03:28.750> around<00:03:29.049> these

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
we'll just place TMT all around these

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.449 
we'll just place TMT all around these
areas<00:03:30.599> it<00:03:31.599> needs<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.959> sit<00:03:32.169> somewhere<00:03:32.470> make

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
areas it needs to sit somewhere make

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.129 
areas it needs to sit somewhere make
sure<00:03:33.489> you<00:03:33.669> don't<00:03:33.730> put<00:03:33.940> any<00:03:34.060> behind<00:03:34.480> this<00:03:34.780> bud

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
sure you don't put any behind this bud

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.390 
sure you don't put any behind this bud
switch<00:03:35.319> Upham<00:03:35.739> because<00:03:36.040> then<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.310> will

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
switch Upham because then it will

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.220 
switch Upham because then it will
activate<00:03:36.699> the<00:03:36.940> bud<00:03:37.090> switch<00:03:37.209> then<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.959> have<00:03:38.109> to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
activate the bud switch then you have to

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.809 
activate the bud switch then you have to
redo<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:39.840> alright<00:03:40.840> like<00:03:41.319> that<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:42.790> that

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
redo it alright like that like that

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.879 
redo it alright like that like that
pretty<00:03:43.629> much<00:03:43.810> just<00:03:43.959> stuff<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:44.470> thing<00:03:44.680> full

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.460 
here and now what you want to do is you
know<00:04:03.790> pretty<00:04:03.970> much<00:04:04.090> just<00:04:04.299> put<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.569> piston<00:04:05.139> here

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
know pretty much just put a piston here

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.210 
know pretty much just put a piston here
to<00:04:06.400> break<00:04:06.609> the<00:04:06.930> clock<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.709> what's<00:04:09.069> going<00:04:09.190> to

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
to break the clock so what's going to

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.379 
to break the clock so what's going to
happen<00:04:09.519> is<00:04:09.639> this<00:04:09.760> is<00:04:09.879> going<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.090> just<00:04:10.209> kind<00:04:10.359> of

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
happen is this is going to just kind of

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.839 
happen is this is going to just kind of
go<00:04:10.540> downwards<00:04:11.049> like<00:04:11.229> so<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.919> then<00:04:12.459> whetstone

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
go downwards like so and then whetstone

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.170 
go downwards like so and then whetstone
torched<00:04:13.209> our<00:04:13.650> vertical<00:04:14.650> down<00:04:14.949> to<00:04:15.220> eventually

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
torched our vertical down to eventually

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.670 
torched our vertical down to eventually
just<00:04:16.359> make<00:04:16.659> sure<00:04:16.810> that<00:04:16.959> thing<00:04:17.109> gets<00:04:17.260> turned<00:04:17.560> on

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
just make sure that thing gets turned on

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.390 
just make sure that thing gets turned on
so<00:04:18.609> like<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:19.320> reps<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.500> torch<00:04:20.799> see<00:04:21.280> this

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
so like that reps and torch see this

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.690 
so like that reps and torch see this
one's<00:04:21.579> on<00:04:21.760> does<00:04:22.599> now<00:04:22.630> it's<00:04:23.050> off<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:24.250> what<00:04:24.580> we

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
one's on does now it's off and what we

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.219 
one's on does now it's off and what we
wanted<00:04:24.969> to<00:04:25.030> do<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.270> we<00:04:25.450> wanted<00:04:25.659> to<00:04:25.750> be<00:04:25.870> off<00:04:26.020> in

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
wanted to do is we wanted to be off in

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.159 
wanted to do is we wanted to be off in
the<00:04:26.320> first<00:04:26.530> place<00:04:26.680> anyways<00:04:27.810> so<00:04:28.810> something

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
the first place anyways so something

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.560 
the first place anyways so something
like<00:04:29.200> this<00:04:29.440> is<00:04:29.650> fine<00:04:29.919> if<00:04:30.849> you<00:04:31.090> can<00:04:31.240> tell<00:04:31.450> this

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.089 
like this is fine if you can tell this
is<00:04:31.690> completely<00:04:32.169> different<00:04:32.320> from<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.800> torched

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
is completely different from the torched

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.279 
is completely different from the torched
our<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.400> had<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.849> other<00:04:34.060> tree<00:04:34.750> farm<00:04:34.960> because<00:04:35.110> it
