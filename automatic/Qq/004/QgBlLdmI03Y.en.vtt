00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.200 
well like I said I was uh I'm going to

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.040 
well like I said I was uh I'm going to
recycle<00:00:05.560> my<00:00:05.830> gray<00:00:06.040> water<00:00:06.279> and<00:00:06.759> I<00:00:07.750> built<00:00:08.440> this

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
recycle my gray water and I built this

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.770 
recycle my gray water and I built this
this<00:00:11.050> makeshift<00:00:12.030> rudimentary<00:00:13.030> survival

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
this makeshift rudimentary survival

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.340 
this makeshift rudimentary survival
water<00:00:14.019> filter<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:15.700> a<00:00:15.759> year<00:00:16.090> ago<00:00:16.350> basically

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
water filter about a year ago basically

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.220 
water filter about a year ago basically
the<00:00:17.800> sand<00:00:18.130> and<00:00:18.460> charcoal<00:00:18.940> and<00:00:19.359> rocks<00:00:19.660> and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
the sand and charcoal and rocks and

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.400 
the sand and charcoal and rocks and
stuff<00:00:20.920> like<00:00:21.340> that<00:00:21.609> but<00:00:22.300> one<00:00:22.750> thing<00:00:22.779> I<00:00:23.019> added

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
stuff like that but one thing I added

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.200 
stuff like that but one thing I added
was<00:00:24.369> a<00:00:24.400> small<00:00:25.890> aquarium<00:00:26.890> filter<00:00:27.670> one<00:00:28.060> of<00:00:28.119> those

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
was a small aquarium filter one of those

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.900 
was a small aquarium filter one of those
rip<00:00:28.420> tea<00:00:28.570> filters<00:00:29.039> kind<00:00:30.039> of<00:00:30.160> panel<00:00:30.490> like<00:00:30.670> and<00:00:30.849> I

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
rip tea filters kind of panel like and I

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.580 
rip tea filters kind of panel like and I
put<00:00:31.119> it<00:00:31.210> at<00:00:31.330> the<00:00:31.420> bottom<00:00:31.599> near<00:00:31.929> the<00:00:32.050> outlet<00:00:32.199> and

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
put it at the bottom near the outlet and

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.889 
put it at the bottom near the outlet and
it's<00:00:32.710> got<00:00:32.950> bio<00:00:33.670> mesh<00:00:34.000> filtration<00:00:34.690> and

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
it's got bio mesh filtration and

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.010 
it's got bio mesh filtration and
activated<00:00:35.410> charcoal<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:36.510> basically<00:00:37.510> the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
activated charcoal and basically the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.430 
activated charcoal and basically the
reason<00:00:38.290> why<00:00:38.379> I'm<00:00:38.500> filtering<00:00:38.860> my<00:00:38.980> grey<00:00:39.190> water

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
reason why I'm filtering my grey water

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440 
reason why I'm filtering my grey water

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
that for for that kind of sustenance and

like<00:01:06.369> that<00:01:06.580> for<00:01:07.320> wildlife<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:10.470> anyway<00:01:11.470> I'm

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
like that for wildlife so anyway I'm

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.890 
like that for wildlife so anyway I'm
going<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:12.130> filter<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:13.060> reuse<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.780> to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
going to filter this and reuse it to

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.609 
going to filter this and reuse it to
take<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.110> bath<00:01:15.010> later<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:16.750> put<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:17.530> through

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
take a bath later and or put it through

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.399 
take a bath later and or put it through
the<00:01:17.740> Berkey<00:01:18.100> now<00:01:18.759> you<00:01:19.270> might<00:01:19.450> say<00:01:19.720> why

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
the Berkey now you might say why

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.600 
the Berkey now you might say why
wouldn't<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.799> just<00:01:20.860> pour<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.369> into<00:01:21.490> the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
wouldn't you just pour it into the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.520 
wouldn't you just pour it into the
Berkey<00:01:21.970> well<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:23.530> soap<00:01:23.860> creates<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.729> film<00:01:25.030> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
Berkey well see soap creates a film and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.289 
Berkey well see soap creates a film and
I<00:01:26.530> don't<00:01:27.310> know<00:01:27.460> this<00:01:27.610> for<00:01:27.820> sure<00:01:27.850> but<00:01:28.180> I'm

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
I don't know this for sure but I'm

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.880 
I don't know this for sure but I'm
afraid<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.600> film<00:01:29.020> might<00:01:29.290> be<00:01:29.380> problematic

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
afraid that film might be problematic

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.490 
afraid that film might be problematic
for<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.970> berkey<00:01:31.329> water<00:01:31.360> filter<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.170> that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
for the berkey water filter and that

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.660 
for the berkey water filter and that
would<00:01:32.619> really<00:01:32.799> suck<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.340> compromise

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
would really suck to compromise

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.670 
would really suck to compromise
something<00:01:34.210> like<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.570> in<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.840> raw<00:01:34.990> situation

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
something like that in a raw situation

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.429 
something like that in a raw situation
and<00:01:36.130> way<00:01:36.909> I<00:01:36.939> figure<00:01:37.329> it<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:38.110> with<00:01:38.200> all<00:01:38.320> these

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
and way I figure it and with all these

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.800 
and way I figure it and with all these
rocks<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.070> sand<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:39.939> coal<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.540> then<00:01:40.659> that

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
rocks and sand and coal and then that

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.289 
rocks and sand and coal and then that
that<00:01:41.560> low<00:01:41.680> activated<00:01:42.280> carbon<00:01:42.640> filter<00:01:42.970> down<00:01:43.119> at

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
that low activated carbon filter down at

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.749 
that low activated carbon filter down at
the<00:01:43.390> bottom<00:01:43.540> will<00:01:44.140> probably<00:01:44.680> remove<00:01:45.040> all<00:01:45.520> of

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
the bottom will probably remove all of

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.270 
the bottom will probably remove all of
that<00:01:45.790> soap<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:47.500> although<00:01:47.829> that's<00:01:48.009> going

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
that soap because although that's going

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.620 
that soap because although that's going
to<00:01:48.340> be<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.460> particulate<00:01:49.119> it's<00:01:49.299> not<00:01:49.450> really

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
to be a particulate it's not really

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.050 
to be a particulate it's not really
going<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.840> be<00:01:49.899> a<00:01:49.930> micron<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:50.880> worst<00:01:51.880> case

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
going to be a micron and worst case

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.600 
going to be a micron and worst case
scenario<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.509> could<00:01:52.750> just<00:01:52.899> boil<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.320> but<00:01:53.950> that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
scenario I could just boil it but that

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.550 
scenario I could just boil it but that
would<00:01:54.729> require<00:01:54.970> additional<00:01:55.509> energy<00:01:56.200> inputs

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
would require additional energy inputs

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.170 
would require additional energy inputs
it's<00:01:57.490> almost<00:01:57.729> done

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
it's almost done

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.880 
it's almost done
trickling<00:01:58.750> everything<00:01:59.170> down<00:01:59.380> I'm<00:01:59.710> gonna

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
trickling everything down I'm gonna

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.260 
trickling everything down I'm gonna
pause<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.340> camera<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:00.790> wait<00:02:00.939> for<00:02:01.149> it<00:02:01.240> to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
pause the camera and wait for it to

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.969 
pause the camera and wait for it to
trickle<00:02:01.570> down<00:02:01.689> and<00:02:01.840> I'll<00:02:02.590> show<00:02:02.799> you<00:02:02.890> the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
trickle down and I'll show you the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.000 
trickle down and I'll show you the
results<00:02:05.040> well

and<00:02:23.240> let<00:02:23.330> me<00:02:23.360> know<00:02:23.450> that's<00:02:23.900> that's<00:02:24.260> something

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
and let me know that's that's something

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.470 
and let me know that's that's something
important<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.010> know<00:02:25.160> right<00:02:25.940> there<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:26.360> what<00:02:26.450> I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
important to know right there but what I

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.449 
important to know right there but what I
have<00:02:26.720> done<00:02:26.990> what<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.380> have<00:02:27.590> accomplished<00:02:28.130> am<00:02:28.310> i

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
have done what I have accomplished am i

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.510 
have done what I have accomplished am i
I<00:02:28.760> believe<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.540> got<00:02:30.440> all<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.680> dirt<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:31.160> skin

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
I believe I I got all the dirt in skin

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.220 
I believe I I got all the dirt in skin
flakes<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.270> stuff<00:02:32.600> like<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:33.020> out<00:02:33.050> there

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
flakes and stuff like that out there

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.550 
flakes and stuff like that out there
those<00:02:33.980> leaves<00:02:34.280> are<00:02:34.610> probably<00:02:35.330> just<00:02:35.630> settled

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
those leaves are probably just settled

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.090 
those leaves are probably just settled
in<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.739> bottom<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.280> tank<00:02:37.810> here<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.650> so

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
in the bottom of this tank here and so

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.830 
in the bottom of this tank here and so
therefore<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.670> can<00:02:40.880> probably<00:02:41.060> use<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.510> as<00:02:41.630> bath

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
therefore I can probably use it as bath

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.520 
therefore I can probably use it as bath
water<00:02:42.170> or<00:02:42.530> even<00:02:42.680> dishwater<00:02:43.190> again<00:02:44.530> probably

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
water or even dishwater again probably

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.310 
water or even dishwater again probably
be<00:02:45.620> better<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.920> use<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.280> as<00:02:46.400> bath<00:02:46.610> water<00:02:48.940> so

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
be better to use it as bath water so

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.540 
be better to use it as bath water so
basically<00:02:51.320> I<00:02:51.440> won't<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.739> bathing<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.280> my<00:02:52.400> own

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
basically I won't be bathing in my own

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.670 
basically I won't be bathing in my own
filth<00:02:52.910> all<00:02:53.480> over<00:02:53.840> again<00:02:53.930> it's<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.350> little<00:02:54.470> bit

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
filth all over again it's a little bit

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.759 
filth all over again it's a little bit
green<00:02:54.950> but<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.360> soap<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.750> uses<00:02:57.170> is<00:02:57.380> kind<00:02:57.709> of

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
green but the the soap I uses is kind of

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.100 
green but the the soap I uses is kind of
green<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:59.090> obviously<00:02:59.239> couldn't<00:02:59.750> get<00:02:59.989> the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
green so I obviously couldn't get the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.800 
green so I obviously couldn't get the
soap<00:03:00.320> out<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:02.090> won't<00:03:02.300> be<00:03:02.390> going<00:03:02.690> through

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
soap out so and won't be going through

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.900 
soap out so and won't be going through
the<00:03:02.900> Burton<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.190> said<00:03:04.370> guys<00:03:04.519> if<00:03:04.730> y'all

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
the last thing I want to do is clog it

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.910 
the last thing I want to do is clog it
that<00:03:10.070> berkey<00:03:10.400> water<00:03:10.900> filter<00:03:11.900> probably<00:03:12.769> be

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
that berkey water filter probably be

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.800 
that berkey water filter probably be
better<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.370> get<00:03:13.820> one<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.060> those<00:03:14.150> monolithic

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
better to get one of those monolithic

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.470 
better to get one of those monolithic
filters<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.350> aren't<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:15.829> picky<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:17.090> lot

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
filters that aren't so picky that a lot

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.180 
filters that aren't so picky that a lot
of<00:03:17.600> you<00:03:17.690> guys<00:03:17.870> have<00:03:18.200> been<00:03:18.350> telling<00:03:18.920> me<00:03:19.160> I

of you guys have been telling me I
should<00:03:19.489> get<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.970> they're<00:03:20.150> about<00:03:20.299> 50<00:03:20.630> bucks<00:03:20.810> so

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
should get and they're about 50 bucks so

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.080 
should get and they're about 50 bucks so
I'm<00:03:21.200> gonna<00:03:21.320> add<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.739> my<00:03:21.769> list<00:03:21.910> now<00:03:22.910> let's

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
I'm gonna add that to my list now let's

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.699 
I'm gonna add that to my list now let's
see<00:03:23.239> what<00:03:23.360> else<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.660> put<00:03:23.840> on<00:03:23.930> my<00:03:24.049> list<00:03:24.079> so<00:03:24.500> far<00:03:26.709> so

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
see what else I put on my list so far so

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.130 
see what else I put on my list so far so
far<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.310> put<00:03:28.700> on<00:03:28.820> there<00:03:29.000> small<00:03:29.329> generator<00:03:29.780> since

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
far I put on there small generator since

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.720 
far I put on there small generator since
my<00:03:30.230> car's<00:03:30.500> in<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.709> shop<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:31.250> would<00:03:31.430> be<00:03:31.579> my

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
my car's in the shop that would be my

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.449 
my car's in the shop that would be my
alternate<00:03:32.239> generator<00:03:32.660> right<00:03:32.870> there<00:03:33.400> but<00:03:34.400> I

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
alternate generator right there but I

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.890 
alternate generator right there but I
also<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:34.760> don't<00:03:34.880> have<00:03:35.060> an<00:03:35.239> inverter<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:37.900> I'm

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
also I don't have an inverter so I'm

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.199 
also I don't have an inverter so I'm
going<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.260> get<00:03:39.350> a<00:03:39.380> solar<00:03:39.650> USB<00:03:40.190> charger<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.820> you

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
going to get a solar USB charger and you

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.610 
going to get a solar USB charger and you
might<00:03:41.390> say<00:03:41.600> well<00:03:41.750> why<00:03:41.930> don't<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.200> just<00:03:42.410> run

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
might say well why don't you just run

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.199 
might say well why don't you just run
that<00:03:42.829> off<00:03:42.980> with<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.250> small<00:03:43.489> generator<00:03:43.910> all

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
that off with a small generator all

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.220 
that off with a small generator all
those<00:03:44.450> devices<00:03:44.780> well<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.850> guess<00:03:47.780> I<00:03:47.900> could<00:03:48.079> do

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
those devices well it I guess I could do

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.430 
those devices well it I guess I could do
that

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
that

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.050 
that
while<00:03:48.739> I'm<00:03:48.890> running<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.250> generator<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.880> keep

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
while I'm running the generator to keep

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.910 
while I'm running the generator to keep

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
use it during that time you know only

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.900 
use it during that time you know only
plan<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.650> run<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.829> small<00:03:58.100> generator<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.730> keep

stuff<00:04:05.690> like<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.140> conserve<00:04:06.440> fuel<00:04:06.470> in<00:04:06.980> it

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
stuff like that to conserve fuel in it

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.729 
stuff like that to conserve fuel in it
really<00:04:07.970> be<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.120> waste<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:09.400> charge<00:04:10.400> USB<00:04:10.820> devices

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
really be a waste to charge USB devices

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.830 
really be a waste to charge USB devices
to<00:04:12.739> burn<00:04:13.040> gasoline<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.730> do<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:14.030> just

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
to burn gasoline to do that just

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.960 
to burn gasoline to do that just
wouldn't<00:04:15.080> be<00:04:15.170> efficient<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.650> my<00:04:15.769> mind

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
wouldn't be efficient in my mind
