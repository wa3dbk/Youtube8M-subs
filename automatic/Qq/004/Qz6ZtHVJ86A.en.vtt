most<00:00:01.920> muskie<00:00:02.370> lures<00:00:02.639> are<00:00:02.760> made<00:00:02.939> with<00:00:03.120> metal

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
most muskie lures are made with metal

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.289 
most muskie lures are made with metal
tails<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.350> that's<00:00:04.440> great<00:00:04.799> except<00:00:05.279> when<00:00:06.180> you

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
tails and that's great except when you

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.540 
tails and that's great except when you
bend<00:00:06.569> them<00:00:06.779> they<00:00:07.500> get<00:00:07.710> out<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.980> position<00:00:08.429> you

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
bend them they get out of position you

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.730 
bend them they get out of position you
can<00:00:08.730> get<00:00:08.940> up<00:00:09.030> just<00:00:09.210> perfect<00:00:09.750> make<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> few<00:00:10.260> casts

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
can get up just perfect make a few casts

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.160 
can get up just perfect make a few casts
and<00:00:10.860> they<00:00:10.950> can<00:00:11.130> bend<00:00:11.550> or<00:00:11.790> or<00:00:12.240> even<00:00:12.420> break<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
and they can bend or or even break and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.670 
and they can bend or or even break and
then<00:00:13.259> you've<00:00:13.410> got<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.679> start<00:00:13.920> all<00:00:14.099> over<00:00:14.130> again

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
then you've got to start all over again

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.170 
then you've got to start all over again
which<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.859> why<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.520> made<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.510> blocker<00:00:18.990> plopper

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
which is why I made this blocker plopper

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.570 
which is why I made this blocker plopper
with<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> rubber<00:00:21.600> tail<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.769> never<00:00:23.100> gets<00:00:23.369> out

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
with a rubber tail so it never gets out

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.509 
with a rubber tail so it never gets out
of<00:00:23.789> tune<00:00:24.350> let's<00:00:25.350> make<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> tail<00:00:26.010> I'll<00:00:26.220> show<00:00:26.460> you

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
of tune let's make a tail I'll show you

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.859 
of tune let's make a tail I'll show you
how<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:28.910> started<00:00:29.910> out<00:00:30.060> by<00:00:30.300> making<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
how to do it I started out by making a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.750 
how to do it I started out by making a
tail<00:00:31.199> shape<00:00:31.590> out<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:33.200> sculpey<00:00:34.200> clay<00:00:34.610> baking<00:00:35.610> it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
tail shape out of sculpey clay baking it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
tail shape out of sculpey clay baking it
I<00:00:37.340> then<00:00:38.340> poured<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> mold<00:00:39.440> using<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
I then poured a mold using this as a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.220 
I then poured a mold using this as a
master<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.700> note<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.940> there's<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> little

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
master and note that there's a little

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
master and note that there's a little
metal<00:00:43.820> brass<00:00:44.820> tube<00:00:45.660> running<00:00:46.050> through<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.640> make

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
metal brass tube running through it make

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
metal brass tube running through it make
one<00:00:47.820> out<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.969> rubber<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> insert

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
one out of rubber I'm going to insert

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.299 
one out of rubber I'm going to insert
this<00:00:49.620> brass<00:00:49.920> tube<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.710> pour<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:53.039> rubber

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
this brass tube and just pour my rubber

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.819 
this brass tube and just pour my rubber
around<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.329> before<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.680> make

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
around it but before I do that to make

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.459 
around it but before I do that to make
it<00:00:55.860> cure<00:00:56.160> faster<00:00:56.730> I'm<00:00:57.149> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.570> eat<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.320> my

it cure faster I'm going to eat up my
mold<00:00:59.270> in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.719> microwave<00:01:01.289> while<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.920> mixing

the<00:01:02.399> rubber

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.550 

we<00:01:11.190> can<00:01:11.340> dye<00:01:11.550> this<00:01:11.610> stuff

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
we can dye this stuff

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.780 
we can dye this stuff
just<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.670> tiny<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.950> don't<00:01:16.950> want<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.399> compromise

just a tiny bit don't want to compromise
the<00:01:18.030> quality<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> rubber<00:01:19.500> by<00:01:19.740> too<00:01:19.799> much

fast<00:01:37.119> or<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.450> also<00:01:37.570> makes<00:01:37.899> it<00:01:37.990> for<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.380> little

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
fast or it also makes it for a little

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:50.100 
fast or it also makes it for a little
bit<00:01:38.770> better<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:42.280> this<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:48.630> I've<00:01:49.630> poured<00:01:49.960> this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
bit better for this in I've poured this

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.410 
bit better for this in I've poured this
in<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.530> I'm<00:01:50.619> squeezing<00:01:51.039> it<00:01:51.310> around<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:52.210> make

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
in and I'm squeezing it around to make

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.630 
in and I'm squeezing it around to make
sure<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:53.380> get<00:01:53.530> all<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.890> air<00:01:54.039> bubbles<00:01:54.069> out

sure that I get all the air bubbles out
of<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:54.909> once<00:01:55.810> I've<00:01:56.020> done<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.229> I'll<00:01:56.649> finish<00:01:56.890> it

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
of it once I've done that I'll finish it

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:05.580 
of it once I've done that I'll finish it
off<00:02:01.560> pour<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.709> rest<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.099> tail<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:05.409> our

sometimes a little bit difficult because

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.370 
sometimes a little bit difficult because
I've<00:02:11.750> made<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.020> big<00:02:12.470> big<00:02:12.740> paddle<00:02:13.250> tail<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.810> both

the rubber and the molding material are
pretty<00:02:17.990> flexible<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.180> maybe<00:02:20.180> quite<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.600> bit<00:02:20.750> of

pretty flexible so maybe quite a bit of

trick<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.000> just<00:02:23.210> kind<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.540> work<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:26.680> stretch<00:02:27.680> it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:43.530 

rotates<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.710> go

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.020 

I'll<00:02:43.959> just<00:02:44.230> trim<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:44.950> off<00:02:45.129> quickly<00:02:47.819> I've<00:02:48.819> had

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
I'll just trim it off quickly I've had

00:02:49.030 --> 00:03:11.069 
I'll just trim it off quickly I've had
to<00:02:49.150> leave<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.540> tail<00:02:49.840> section<00:02:50.110> long

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.470 

we'll<00:03:12.079> slide<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:12.889> on<00:03:14.079> it's<00:03:15.079> just<00:03:15.379> like<00:03:15.560> that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
we'll slide this on it's just like that

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.580 
we'll slide this on it's just like that
I'm<00:03:17.480> going<00:03:17.659> to<00:03:17.719> make<00:03:17.870> this<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.109> little<00:03:18.439> bit

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
I'm going to make this a little bit

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.959 
I'm going to make this a little bit
tighter<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.689> it<00:03:20.689> has<00:03:20.900> less<00:03:21.139> chance<00:03:21.170> to

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:21.969 
tighter so that it has less chance to

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.030 
tighter so that it has less chance to
distance<00:03:22.969> to<00:03:23.150> bend<00:03:23.469> I'll<00:03:24.469> do<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.829> by<00:03:25.010> just

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
distance to bend I'll do that by just

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.039 
distance to bend I'll do that by just
flattening<00:03:25.879> this<00:03:26.090> off<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.359> little<00:03:26.540> bit<00:03:26.900> on<00:03:27.019> a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.849 
belt sander
I<00:03:28.069> might<00:03:28.969> even<00:03:29.090> sand<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> little<00:03:30.049> bit<00:03:30.290> more

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
I might even sand this a little bit more

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:49.270 
I might even sand this a little bit more
flush<00:03:31.159> to

and once this has been fitted it's a
fairly<00:03:52.500> simple<00:03:52.800> matter<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.370> taking<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.970> pair<00:03:54.660> of

fairly simple matter of taking a pair of
