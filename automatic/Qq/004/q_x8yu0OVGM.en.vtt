00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.590
 market 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.510
 I'm here 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:37.020

00:06:47.840 --> 00:07:00.960
 this year i have me i i will go to 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:02.790
 every time I know it makes me that 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:08.280
 did three weeks that i have 0 gilles in 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:12.360
 done it's very crowded people 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:16.680
 so basically wants to be the basic 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.490
 of sauce and s was zeyd and never fished 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.780
 but not too much 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:24.990
 and that's why I try to make 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:26.270
 variants and it falls on seille and 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:30.450
 why z 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:33.479
 why zeyd because that was what 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.460
 attracted chief of armies that's because 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.510
 that actually on you on you there was 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.380
 a word called z 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:42.870
 at the beginning of the game but it's a word that 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.990
 is it's a word that no longer exists 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.990
 now
