got clipper to flush the goldfish

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:47.449 
got clipper to flush the goldfish
interestingly<00:01:42.209> titled<00:01:44.389> dsiware<00:01:46.340> again<00:01:47.340> these

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
interestingly titled dsiware again these

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.039 
interestingly titled dsiware again these
titles<00:01:47.850> may<00:01:48.060> vary<00:01:48.359> depending<00:01:48.569> on<00:01:48.810> where

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
titles may vary depending on where

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.529 
titles may vary depending on where
you're<00:01:49.200> located<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> world<00:01:50.209> so<00:01:51.209> probably

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
you're located in the world so probably

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.510 
you're located in the world so probably
aware<00:01:51.749> i'm<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.959> the<00:01:52.049> UK<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.709> it's<00:01:52.920> usually<00:01:53.279> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
aware i'm in the UK and it's usually a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.870 
aware i'm in the UK and it's usually a
little<00:01:53.609> bit<00:01:53.849> different<00:01:54.209> from<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.539> US<00:01:55.349> version

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
little bit different from the US version

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.620 
little bit different from the US version
so<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:56.939> Virtual<00:01:57.329> Console<00:01:58.159> should<00:01:59.329> have<00:02:00.329> trip

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so in Virtual Console should have trip

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.559 
so in Virtual Console should have trip
wild<00:02:00.929> in<00:02:01.049> which<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> has<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.419> again<00:02:03.419> these

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
wild in which it has and again these

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.440 
wild in which it has and again these
prices<00:02:04.049> vary<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.679> 12<00:02:05.459> pounds<00:02:05.789> 70<00:02:06.240> that's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
prices vary that 12 pounds 70 that's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.499 
prices vary that 12 pounds 70 that's
equivalent<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.499> about<00:02:07.700> three<00:02:08.700> dollars<00:02:08.849> 50<00:02:09.420> or

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
equivalent to about three dollars 50 or

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.290 
equivalent to about three dollars 50 or
so<00:02:10.009> again<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> price<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.520> usually<00:02:11.880> very<00:02:11.910> as

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so again the price is usually very as

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.090 
so again the price is usually very as
well<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.690> quite<00:02:12.930> often<00:02:13.170> cheaper<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.860> US

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
well it's quite often cheaper in the US

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.690 
well it's quite often cheaper in the US
if<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:17.150> was<00:02:17.900> for<00:02:18.080> looking<00:02:18.320> DSiWare<00:02:21.580> take<00:02:22.580> it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
if it was for looking DSiWare take it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.380 
if it was for looking DSiWare take it
down<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.180> kaboom<00:02:24.670> we've<00:02:25.670> seen<00:02:25.970> some<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.300> these

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390
