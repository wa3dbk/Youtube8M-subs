00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.109
 hello friends another game with blacks this 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.040
 time against black wins pint that is 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.040
 argentina from israel 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.790
 it means that it never wins 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.700
 Well, I need to win you because I have 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.369
 a bad bad streak those games that do not 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.730
 they just fit in because he already has some 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.070
 how many still be trying 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.690
 wait and win 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.220
 I feel bad that I have touched him 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.220
 but there is no other 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.420
 you're theoretical and now normally 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.620
 to a castling 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.690
 fell from 174 you were new to me 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.840
 I met one horse 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.930
 these new what idea has this move 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.880
 I do not see any 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.630
 so I see no reason not to continue with 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.210
 what I always do and that this thing of 854 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.480
 uije 3 is drowning very strange this 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.409
 man 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.670
 I am playing the usual 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.070
 and he is playing the strangest 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.770
 this f 3 and caballé g 4 is very rare 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.810
 yorgos whenever he's over 5 iván row 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.189
 6 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.649
 and as the column charges diagonally and almost 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.689
 it was always good to see my pieces 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.070
 how they start acting in the franc and 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.940
 the horses together I made a video 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.680
 recently from the fourth round of baku 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.040
 where I talk about these horses united and 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.940
 the faithful horse f4 f3f 3 this is very 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.520
 rare 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.520
 I have never seen by h 5 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.620
 this worse is a very important pawn 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.600
 because it can cost the center because 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.980
 I should eat less but for that 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.320
 I have to take the horse then I go 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.150
 Juarez 5 and I do not know if I'll regret 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.270
 but it is that a central pawn is a pawn 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.170
 central so if I later regret 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.689
 Well, now 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.740
 but all abroad but spend a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.360
 time training the tower 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.430
 and I think it would not be a bad idea 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.160
 eliminate this horse you end up in the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.190
 center 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.850
 it's almost always better to eliminate them and 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.850
 take off pressure from above 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.570
 good friends now you understand more 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.710
 and my next move is bishop 04 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.890
 attacking the pawn of 5 and gold but 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.840
 the guy locked me 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.800
 now nature is attacked but nothing 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.810
 defend me 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.670
 and the end is a bit weird I do not have 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.440
 food 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.750
 but otherwise my position is very 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.240
 well I like 4 opening this 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.240
 diagonal and I like horse efe 5 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.360
 I also like 4 also to eat 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.360
 this pawn 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.400
 I think the priority is to get the one 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.019
 be agile 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.849
 if I can not have problems with this 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.750
 angel so I will try with this 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.580
 pawn as soon as possible 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.090
 well we will do through the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.180
 playing tower of 4 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.040
 two 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.379
 you when that increase 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.400
 I'm going to leave, I'm going to defend the 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.500
 pawn n4 and in this way 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.239
 I do four defending the bishop and then 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.579
 and peru wall the rest I open this 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.060
 diagonal but set yourself as your move of 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.069
 g3 g4 I'm not an expert the Sicilian I know 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.790
 that if the French one improves and nevertheless 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.549
 applying some basic principles 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.590
 I have been quite good 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.390
 garfield we have already said that I do not 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.390
 matter but west to the end 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.090
 this pawn does not matter to lose it if I get 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.800
 next contracted and now I'm going to do 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.940
 a play that I hope will surprise you 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.620
 what is tower b 2 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.930
 let's see how he manages this entry 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.790
 from the tower I'm planning efe four 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.350
 knights of five and I advance you my 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.020
 plan 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.540
 efe 4 to the front 4 horse f 5 and even 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.710
 counted republic by efe five fact was 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.710
 a very interesting arrangement 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.760
 of the tower 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.760
 but we're going to change it not michael and it 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.280
 comedy at the end I can run well from to 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.960
 two and if he eats drama 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.820
 gave me this pawn and I do not plan to refuse 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.900
 now if I stop fast because at last 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.900
 of four is the threat now 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:28.030
 I'm not interested in losing this gentleman 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.410
 so let's see how we manage 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.790
 this but just like the horse I eat 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.190
 shuar fit is almost favorable for me 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.940
 so let's put my tower in play 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.940
 down the column 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.919
 for what 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.919
 dangerous I do not have 18 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.849
 I will repeat it better this way 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.820
 comprises of 616 until my tower here 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.350
 Have I done something wrong 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.350
 but hey it's done 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.950
 I was hired from 6 now play tower 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.750
 two 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:21.360
 and if I get down I have horses from the area 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.790
 possible but I think the advantage as the 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.740
 horse 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.220
 I like your bishop this in principle 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.880
 interesting towers that one looks very well 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.880
 change the ladies 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.180
 with the fourth reich or not for the mate 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.710
 I think the prudent thing here is to do very 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.460
 good 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.040
 quick to make a hiding place and so I can 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.920
 put the seventh tower and combine it with 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.420
 the bishop of 4 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.760
 and this has to be very good I think 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.590
 what are you friend calls 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.590
 from berwyn you never want 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.870
 the loose game is isolated the truth 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.870
 efe 3 horse f4 not understood anything 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:09.169
 it seems to me that he has abandoned if he abandons 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.599
 from here below, this game has been 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.229
 quite simple really treats us 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.300
 a lot to analyze 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.069
 Well, I've done one has done another if 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.969
 there is someone around here who wanted to 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.969
 play now is the time
