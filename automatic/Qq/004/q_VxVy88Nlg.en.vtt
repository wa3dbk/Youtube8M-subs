and I'm thrilled I think it has done I
had<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> little<00:00:25.080> bit<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.439> blip<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:26.119> the<00:00:27.119> UK<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
had a little bit of a blip in the UK and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.779 
had a little bit of a blip in the UK and
the<00:00:28.019> Welsh<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.529> China<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.400> which<00:00:29.670> is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the Welsh in China you know which is

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.189 
the Welsh in China you know which is
understandable<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.390> stand<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> game<00:00:30.990> now

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
understandable the stand of the game now

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
understandable the stand of the game now
but<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.650> think<00:00:32.009> when<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.189> win<00:00:32.340> an<00:00:32.460> events<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
but I think when you win an events and

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.750 
but I think when you win an events and
beating<00:00:33.719> beating<00:00:34.230> Higgins<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> final<00:00:35.160> it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
beating beating Higgins in the final it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.400 
beating beating Higgins in the final it
was<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.149> was<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> massive<00:00:36.600> thing<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.960> me<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> name

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
was it was a massive thing for me a name

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.950 
was it was a massive thing for me a name
yeah<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> suppose<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.390> him<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.629> took<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
yeah I suppose it's up for him I took a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.610 
yeah I suppose it's up for him I took a
lot<00:00:40.110> from<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:44.420> well<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
lot from that well you can but the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.490 
lot from that well you can but the
problem<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:48.079> Jeremy<00:00:49.079> Jones<00:00:49.230> wasn't
