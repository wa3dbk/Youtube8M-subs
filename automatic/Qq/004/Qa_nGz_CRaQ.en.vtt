00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
because he picked that aurelien and

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.200 
because he picked that aurelien and
actually<00:01:15.860> first<00:01:16.159> pick<00:01:16.460> for<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.729> Wolves<00:01:17.119> he

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
actually first pick for the Wolves he

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.580 
actually first pick for the Wolves he
thought<00:01:17.390> I'm<00:01:17.570> gonna<00:01:17.810> go<00:01:17.990> up<00:01:18.110> against<00:01:18.409> wicked

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
thought I'm gonna go up against wicked

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.200 
thought I'm gonna go up against wicked
tell<00:01:18.860> me<00:01:18.950> why<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:19.100> had<00:01:19.310> quite<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.850> hard<00:01:20.060> time

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
tell me why I had quite the hard time

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.109 
tell me why I had quite the hard time
versus<00:01:20.509> him<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.619> personally<00:01:22.490> I'd<00:01:22.580> say<00:01:22.820> I

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
versus him so personally I'd say I

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.460 
versus him so personally I'd say I
really<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.509> probably<00:01:23.869> one<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.320> best

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
really is probably one of the best

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.649 
really is probably one of the best
chance<00:01:24.740> against<00:01:25.009> kale<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.270> med<00:01:26.420> service

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
chance against kale so the med service

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.120 
chance against kale so the med service
in<00:01:26.810> her<00:01:26.930> favor<00:01:27.200> which<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.590> why<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:27.740> wanted<00:01:28.070> to

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
in her favor which is why I wanted to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.190 
in her favor which is why I wanted to
lane<00:01:28.369> swap<00:01:28.580> as<00:01:28.729> well<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.090> that's<00:01:29.539> also<00:01:29.810> why<00:01:30.049> we

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
lane swap as well and that's also why we

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.380 
lane swap as well and that's also why we
went<00:01:30.350> into<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.770> tactic<00:01:31.159> we<00:01:31.280> did<00:01:31.520> because<00:01:32.090> of

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
went into the tactic we did because of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.289 
went into the tactic we did because of
that<00:01:32.509> pig<00:01:32.890> now<00:01:33.890> you're<00:01:34.100> all<00:01:34.250> very<00:01:34.299> analytical

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549
