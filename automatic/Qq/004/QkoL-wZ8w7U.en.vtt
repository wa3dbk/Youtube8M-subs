00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.560
 when carlos searched for jari 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.180
 we initially wanted to do something 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.050
 different from what was being done by 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.849
 there 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.880
 within the proposals that people 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.400
 presented to them chose that they 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.310
 most liked was that in here 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.589
 exploring the parametric design is the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.930
 parametric drawing is a generated drawing 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.420
 from your computer down 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.880
 parameters of which some are children 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.820
 others are variables in these parameters 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.820
 generates an image were some forms 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.170
 the idea of this project was to transform the 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.530
 which was a simple siding in a work of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.530
 urban art 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.010
 and this was an opportunity for 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.190
 transform this space so that it 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.080
 be part of the interacting context 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.410
 with the city and dialogue with 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.410
 passers-by 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.660
 initially began to think how it would 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.210
 cutting these parts right and we started 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.119
 to see that depending on the drawing 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.810
 it generates more successful time already less 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.810
 waste 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.530
 so we started to develop a 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.820
 drawing that had 100% of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.820
 integral use 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.659
 our concern was also to create a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.549
 effect for anyone who was walking 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.250
 sidewalk she almost has almost no 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.250
 a straight line with it is basically a 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.009
 organic form is not a form that 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.009
 you possibly found nature 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.320
 basically its origin is natural there 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:13.580
 contrasts how this city is totally 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:17.030
 artificial result people got very 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.459
 happy because I was generating less 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.790
 waste we were already very wasteful 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.790
 around 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.019
 at least in this artistic work 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.500
 avoid generating the maximum performance 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.500
 possible
