00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.960

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.520
 discharged and everything else to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:58.030

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:58.030
 such is the tape recorder kenwood kmm 357 sd and 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:08.650
 On the forum Megan 2 dot ru was found 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.470
 man with nickname niks who 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:16.460
 makes such wonderful ones 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:21.229
 adapters to make friends with radio 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.720
 shift paddles volume and 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.530

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.650
 how is all this done by myself this one 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.950
 adapter adapter comes with 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:40.610
 some set of wires which 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.770
 cut into the wires for the radio for 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.900
 recorders 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:50.799
 now we look by the way this 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.630
 The adapter on ebay is in the area 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.950

 Now let's see how this whole thing 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:13.880
 works in practice yes by the way a few words 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.840
 cassette player reads flac format 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:22.250
 so the quality of music is on par 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.940
 standard speaker pulls well here 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.140

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:54.489

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.489
