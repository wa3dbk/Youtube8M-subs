00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all friends of androidblog.it 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.049
 today we see how much together 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 actually worth the 13 camera 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.710
 megapixel samsung galaxy s 5 one 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.619
 camera that amazes us in not a few 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.270
 situations but in others the sharden a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.310
 we wish to discover together in this 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 video that I had mounted with some photos 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.150
 how much the camera actually is worth 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.150
 of samsung galaxy s 5 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.210
 just saw some photos we can 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.370
 define almost panoramic since 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.980
 the wide range of action in which they act 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.020
 as we say as a click with the 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.720
 size now that goes to see a little 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.760
 instead how it behaves in the photographs 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.120
 meeting says they have always been 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.720
 a tough spot for all smartphones 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.720
 current and praise 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.380
 so backlit photographs 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.619
 they are rather realized 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.960
 flight from this thanks 65 that sometimes 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.240
 does some whim with the mass 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.939
 lemon fire we have also made 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.189
 photography the shots he makes 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.049
 this galaxy be 5 inside 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.310
 closed environments we have closed 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:15.709
 also analyzed with natural light is 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.060
 artificial light in the coming months 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.060
 shoes we're going to see together 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.999
 as you have seen in our exchanges of 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.099
 photographs taken in a closed environment 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:52.099
 with natural light leave a little 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.569
 obviously want this the situation 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.269
 improves when i have to 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.219
 use an artificial light that like 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.010
 you have seen our shots give us 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.680
 in the photos much better now 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.419
 let's go and see another one instead 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.760
 typology another type of shots 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:10.760
 that many other synthetic we have 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.760
 in fact now the macros that are perhaps 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.840
 the photographs that is out of five manages to 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.840
 return in my own way 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.220
 we don't do it 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.180
 or indeed the macros are the ones that 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.950
 they are made better by 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.739
 this galaxy sicilia another typology 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.380
 instead of macros if we so wish 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.420
 define it is the picture selective smoke 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.840
 not very selective which is a modality 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.540
 introduced by samsung on its galaxy s 5 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.819
 which makes it possible to take two 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.019
 subjects in first and second floor and 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.329
 then in post production through 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.980
 the smartphone app itself is 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.180
 You can choose which two subjects 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.340
 to focus 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.810
 let's see together this selective focus e 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.410
 two shots taken with the camera 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.410
 front 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.820
 now we were selling state instead of which 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.010
 shoes we made in the environment 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.200
 a flash really closed with the flash 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.700
 very powerful really very interesting 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.070
 in almost every situation 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.100
 as long as we don't say or 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.800
 the interest of going to shoot in 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.800
 depth then using the flash 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.020
 in this type of flash situation yes 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.750
 does his job but can't 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.670
 wait for some kind of result but 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.130
 all in all we can consider ourselves 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.060
 satisfied to see some now 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.290
 shots that we made with flash 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.890
 no flash for a while to come 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.890
 differences 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.150
 to conclude what we have one 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.070
 13 megapixel camera capable of 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.220
 capture ultra-high-quality photographs 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.350
 video resolution up to the suns 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.350
 receive four field then 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.180
 ultra modern then new rinse 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.730
 format that we are experiencing in this 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.190
 period that to look also on 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.020
 our youtube channel to see a 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.710
 bit of self at rest record high 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.440
 resolution 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.450
 a camera that makes almost every 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.480
 situation even at night 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.280
 realizes scarce waste from 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.160
 take pictures of subjects you could do 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.590
 in the foreground and take the photos 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.290
 really very good especially in 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.970
 function of the size of the vision 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.400
 of the photos we have in the shots 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.370
 qualitatively many days that 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.290
 we can even print a gandino 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.120
 billboards if you have any other 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.650
 I demand high speed part about the 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.680
 camera of this device not 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.550
 feel free to write us for android dogg 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.550
