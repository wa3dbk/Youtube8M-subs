ever<00:01:06.200> load<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> griebel<00:01:07.770> into<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> machine

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
ever load the griebel into the machine

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.130 
ever load the griebel into the machine
all<00:01:08.729> right<00:01:09.060> now<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> he's<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.990> can

what happens first when I pull down on

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.609 
what happens first when I pull down on
the<00:01:15.659> high<00:01:16.049> density<00:01:16.560> liquid<00:01:16.890> injector<00:01:17.369> ah

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
the high density liquid injector ah

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
the high density liquid injector ah
looks<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.189> something<00:01:20.540> as<00:01:21.540> you

combination alright let's pull down on
the<00:01:29.100> high<00:01:29.280> density<00:01:29.670> liquid<00:01:29.939> injector<00:01:30.329> again

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the high density liquid injector again

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.200 
the high density liquid injector again
and<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.840> what<00:01:30.869> happens<00:01:30.960> oh<00:01:31.820> well<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> appears

here on the space-time predictive

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.399 
here on the space-time predictive
generator<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.250> I'm<00:01:38.549> actually<00:01:39.409> creating

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
generator that I'm actually creating

we'll turn the nominal warp field

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.870 
we'll turn the nominal warp field
oscillator<00:01:59.310> ah<00:02:00.680> created<00:02:01.680> lava

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
