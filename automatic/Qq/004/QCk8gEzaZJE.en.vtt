I took all that off I got two clamps off

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.010 
I took all that off I got two clamps off
the<00:03:26.400> blaster<00:03:26.850> threw<00:03:27.330> those<00:03:27.450> on<00:03:27.660> because<00:03:27.840> you

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.400 
Hogs and do the same thing I did to my
Banshee<00:04:11.250> wheels<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.700> do<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> blue<00:04:12.600> inside<00:04:13.140> with

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
Banshee wheels and do a blue inside with

Banshee wheels and do a blue inside with
a<00:04:13.440> yellow<00:04:13.860> outer<00:04:14.040> ring<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.550> already<00:04:14.760> bought<00:04:14.910> the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
a yellow outer ring I already bought the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.370 
a yellow outer ring I already bought the
paint<00:04:15.270> so<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.570> it's<00:04:15.810> going<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:15.990> look<00:04:16.080> great

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
paint so that it's going to look great

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.500 
paint so that it's going to look great
but<00:04:16.680> I'm<00:04:16.770> not<00:04:16.890> going<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.100> paint<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.489> at<00:04:18.299> least

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
but I'm not going to paint it at least

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.910 
but I'm not going to paint it at least
that<00:04:18.690> one<00:04:18.900> until<00:04:19.140> I<00:04:19.350> get<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.680> tire<00:04:19.890> valve

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
that one until I get the tire valve

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.979 
that one until I get the tire valve
fixed<00:04:20.489> because<00:04:21.180> they're<00:04:21.540> going<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.720> take<00:04:21.870> it

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
fixed because they're going to take it

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.150 
fixed because they're going to take it
off<00:04:22.080> there<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.350> scratch<00:04:22.560> up<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.800> paint<00:04:23.010> so

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
off there and scratch up the paint so

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.680

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
I'm going to start painting that one the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.120 
I'm going to start painting that one the
rears<00:04:24.960> I'm<00:04:25.260> putting<00:04:25.530> these<00:04:25.680> tires<00:04:25.950> because

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
rears I'm putting these tires because

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.010 
rears I'm putting these tires because
they're<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:26.400> good<00:04:26.490> shape<00:04:26.669> on<00:04:26.880> my<00:04:26.910> Banshee<00:04:27.390> I

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
they're in good shape on my Banshee I

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.150 
they're in good shape on my Banshee I
as<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.169> said<00:04:28.470> these<00:04:28.590> are<00:04:28.650> 2011<00:04:29.400> 9s<00:04:29.910> I'm<00:04:29.970> putting

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
as I said these are 2011 9s I'm putting

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.430 
as I said these are 2011 9s I'm putting
2211<00:04:32.160> 9s<00:04:32.520> on<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.759> and<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.690> tread<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.110> not<00:04:34.289> as

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
2211 9s on it and the tread is not as

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.619 
2211 9s on it and the tread is not as
much<00:04:34.620> as<00:04:34.770> this<00:04:34.949> but<00:04:35.819> it<00:04:35.849> should<00:04:35.970> make<00:04:36.330> up<00:04:36.479> for

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:36.629 
much as this but it should make up for

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.330 
much as this but it should make up for
the<00:04:36.720> torque<00:04:36.990> difference<00:04:37.349> of<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.560> 2000<00:04:38.039> 1/2

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the torque difference of the 2000 1/2

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.149 
the torque difference of the 2000 1/2
I'll<00:04:38.849> explain<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.530> probably<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.620> another

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
I'll explain that probably in another

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.210 
I'll explain that probably in another
video<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:42.139> I'm<00:04:43.139> gonna<00:04:43.259> put<00:04:43.470> those<00:04:43.590> on<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.949> make

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
video and I'm gonna put those on it make

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.290 
video and I'm gonna put those on it make

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
it a bit tall and put these on my bed

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.760 
it a bit tall and put these on my bed
sheet<00:04:45.690> paint<00:04:45.900> these<00:04:46.050> yellow<00:04:46.319> and<00:04:46.470> black<00:04:46.560> for

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
sheet paint these yellow and black for

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.559 
sheet paint these yellow and black for
my<00:04:46.860> Banshee<00:04:47.250> it's<00:04:47.729> got<00:04:47.879> a<00:04:47.909> new<00:04:48.060> chain<00:04:48.330> on<00:04:48.539> it

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
my Banshee it's got a new chain on it

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.990 
my Banshee it's got a new chain on it
but<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.810> got<00:04:48.930> oil<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.610> because<00:04:50.610> right<00:04:50.789> now<00:04:50.879> it's

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
but I got oil it because right now it's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.279 
but I got oil it because right now it's
a<00:04:51.030> bad<00:04:51.180> shave<00:04:51.479> I'm<00:04:51.690> probably<00:04:51.870> gonna<00:04:52.050> paint<00:04:52.199> the

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.080 
a bad shave I'm probably gonna paint the
swing<00:04:52.530> I'm<00:04:52.710> not<00:04:52.949> sure<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.460> already<00:04:53.729> did<00:04:53.879> the<00:04:53.970> oil

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
swing I'm not sure I already did the oil

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.240 
swing I'm not sure I already did the oil
flush<00:04:54.479> on<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:54.870> it's<00:04:55.199> got<00:04:55.349> oil<00:04:55.379> it's<00:04:55.979> got<00:04:56.129> an

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
flush on it it's got oil it's got an

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.390 
flush on it it's got oil it's got an
aluminum<00:04:56.400> oil<00:04:57.060> tank<00:04:57.620> as<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.770> can<00:04:58.889> see<00:04:59.069> I<00:04:59.340> just

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
aluminum oil tank as you can see I just

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.219 
aluminum oil tank as you can see I just
put<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.759> new<00:04:59.909> filter<00:05:00.120> on<00:05:00.479> it<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.780> smoked<00:05:01.139> a

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
put a new filter on it and smoked a

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.719 
put a new filter on it and smoked a
little<00:05:01.500> bit<00:05:01.620> after<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.949> oil<00:05:02.159> change<00:05:02.430> but<00:05:02.669> you

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
little bit after the oil change but you

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.850 
little bit after the oil change but you
know<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:03.150> probably<00:05:03.810> got<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.199> run<00:05:04.289> thicker<00:05:04.560> oil

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
know I probably got to run thicker oil

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.559 
know I probably got to run thicker oil
or<00:05:05.159> valve<00:05:05.610> seals<00:05:05.880> are<00:05:06.000> not<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.180> hard<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.449> do

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
or valve seals are not that hard to do

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.559 
or valve seals are not that hard to do
in<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.750> bike<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.080> this
