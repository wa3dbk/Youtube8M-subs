 its performance in any case we do 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.039
 dreaming of budding swimmers especially 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.840
 swimmers from elsewhere at the club de colomb de 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.820

 vincent piffeteau same soul or the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.800

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.500

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.309
 Florent manaudou would have other assets 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.329
 that his four gold medals is a 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.489
 handsome 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.229
 are not concrete meters of height 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.710
 and 100 kg that's a lot but if it's 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.360
 that makes me win so much it's 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.909
 a god of annahj we can say that like 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.640
 these tightening not that serve the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.380
 reference then by is inevitable but 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.430
 this summer it's very florent which is 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.979

 fans of the doves club 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.509
 more seriously how does that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.399
 you feel after his four medals 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.189
 gold at the berlin european championships 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.179
 do you say mission accomplished 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.950
 mission accomplished for this year it's 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.050
 sure it was the goal to win everything 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.000
 which is a bit of a dream but who is 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.769
 become reality after the first 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.810
 medal at the relay the 2nd at 50 pap I 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.250
 started to arrive from the four and that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.360
 went really well finished is 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.769
 what you are a little bit 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.950
 come down from our cloud or is it 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.360
 you enjoy it you savor I 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.040
 prefers to enjoy it a little bit 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.959
 during the holidays and as soon as I 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.400
 would dive back into the water goal 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.050
 world championship so we said 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.360
 four gold medals is what there is 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.530
 has one that shines more to your eyes than one 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.170
 you enjoy more than others 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.269
 precisely are all about equal 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.340
 but it's true that the 100 me hold me a 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.470
 little to heart is the test that I 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.180
 knew the least and that I learned 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.099
 only this year it's a bet for 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.500
 you it was a bet with my coach 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.430
 and the bet is successful 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.860
 there was the european championships 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.569
 you leave with the gold on the 100 m which 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.340
 is the queen discipline you say when 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.450
 even I guess it'll be a tiny 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.069
 little harder at the world championship 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.090
 but it's sure that the best 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.190
 are 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.050
 american brazilian americans and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.300
 french so in europe 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.680
 it's good to have won the mission 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.030
 was accomplished but next year 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.140
 will be a bit more complicated from 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.459
 way to do as they say it's 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.440
 that's it but it's still a year for 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.989
 center one of the competitions we have you 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.290
 seen there instantly on these images you 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.040
 is both extremely concentrated and 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.290
 at the same time we do not have the impression 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.400
 you are under pressure how you 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.980
 pass this alchemy 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.660
 I think I take a lot of 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.370
 pleasure 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.960
 these moments according m homo I come in 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.510
 competition and I want to win by taking 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.310
 fun and here I was really 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.930
 stressed in my life I managed to keep 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.240
 this calm which I manage to keep this case 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.310
 I said it by introducing you 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.900
 has an impressive build a master 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.720
 99 99 kg almost the same size as 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.100
 teddy riner with 40 pounds less 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.090
 what is the result of a training 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.020
 intensive 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.380
 you work how many hours per 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.800
 day I work about five hours 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.720
 per day of 3:30 in the water and one hour 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.840
 and half bodybuilding so it's safe 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.250
 that it forms a physical and three times 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.740
 an hour and a half of muscu per week 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.250
 it makes the weight rise after 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.050
 a few years 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.230

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.600
 manaudou florent when they do not swim 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.940
 pretty much like all the young people of my 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.770
 age I like a little bit out with 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.140
 my friends go on vacation it's a little 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.520

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.440
 little video game when I'm at
