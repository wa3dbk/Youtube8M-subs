 orange 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.549
 to let 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.529
 a game 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.650
 a dream 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.510
 debut 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.770
 only a break this habit 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.780
 best player from reality and fiction 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.200
 with the photographer Thomas Wrede from MÃ¼nster his millions of States to one 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 real landscapes and composed 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.760
 and it's just one of my artistic concepts 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.090
 that he would put things together through the deb team 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.760
 I myself am a percent who does not belong together and thus theirs 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.840
 Create creation 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.840
 and what else does it think? Does it even fit? 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
 the work on a picture usually takes several weeks 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.800
 where he can put his ideas into practice is one of the most important questions 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.470
 The search for the suitable landscape Scott Thomas Wrede again and again 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 Northern Germany led 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.649
 Often, of course, barren landscapes 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.050
 Claire landscapes where do not disturb other things 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.780
 and percent 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.910
 who as well as here in the teaser pile of sand which also has to be modulated 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.860
 the one of four selected if it still belongs to this fir and if that too 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.020
 a lot of value or you need somehow and elevators made of stucco 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.020

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.000

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000

 Rothgang 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.230
 The 47-year-old wants to find the right words 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.370
 Does he bring all his gear? The motive has to come from one 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.250
 taken very specific perspective allowing a few snow residues 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.679
 becomes an ice landscape 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.459
 sometimes it takes hours of electricity from Vreden to be satisfied with the light 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.769
 is 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.069
 On the one hand, this is a natural expression of longing for one 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.449
 beautiful romantic 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.639
 scenic with very few resources percent fell 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.400
 At the same time, how much we drive would have to make the young people fun 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:39.129
 That means that I keep these small areas of January foxes 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.379
 or staging a landscape in the snowdrift and not knowing exactly 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.529
 where they can find 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.679
 2 Muslims uses a plate camera for recording 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.889
 leave his large-scale prints of up to two by two feet fifty 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.889
 makes itself in this quality only with such a camera 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.839
 The necessary depth of field can also only with a special and the 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.839
 Reach depth 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.779
 usually when photographed in the close range of nine little punk 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.999
 Weaknesses the human eye can only one point 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.639
 focus 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.969
 through the lens 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.439
 for me it's a great depth percent getting sharp and this is 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.439
 arises first 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.899
 the pictures are created long before in his head 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:42.309
 in a sketchbook Telekom Austria of all his ideas 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:46.309
 then set out in search of the appropriate models for his pictures 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.749
 In his Munster Alzeyer he hoards hundreds of tree 1 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.180
 the amazing thing is again and again 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.249
 the goal 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:01.019
 Small structures partly look just like the big structures 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.379
 the NADA of wishes says Thoma 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.149
 who wants to understand the mountain percent 

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:11.469
 has to study the stone these little things are in one 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.469
 created small stone which has always been in the mountains 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:20.709
 Weinen toy manufacturer was allowed to Thomas Wrede once for 5000 euros his 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.740
 order models 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.270
 so that he can implement his ideas 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.500
 but often finds the vergehe for still houses or rarities only in 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.819
 Internet 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.919
 In his studio in the north many of the models are once again looking for them 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.919
 correspond to his ideas 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.630
 Of course, the models are so archetypes of the modern because they are so completely 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.080
 clear and sudden are for some prince to stand for a particular 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.219
 you can do it at home 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.869
 but at the same time they help the proportion of landscape leaves percent 

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.810
 right light to back so far 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.870
 the simple no landscaping stands 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.870
 becoming a local landscape becomes another 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.509
 The houses are often many times larger on the large-format prints 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.509
 bigger than the sim card 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:11.369
 So he does not like the pictures in his exhibitions 

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:12.569
 considered 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.469
 the part of the ideal place 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.419
 so that the game with reality can unfold its effect
