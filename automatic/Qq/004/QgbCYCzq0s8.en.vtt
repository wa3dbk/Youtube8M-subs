00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.879
 Talk to me, beauty. Welcome to one more. 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.839
 video of the channel decided to bring you the 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:17.320
 test is enough to have x 640 and fc-6 300 that 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.730
 Assassin's Creed 4 is offered. 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.250
 come on let's see that in four 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.960
 settings I put the resolution 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.910
 Unfortunately I'll have to do it on 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.310
 native resolution of my monitor that the 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.270
 law 101 960 straight 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.609
 here I put in valley ray in texture 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.960
 I also put in hype the maximum anti 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:40.210
 aliasing I put in the drip the spade 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.399
 or quality I put in the normal 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.829
 here I put on the high that 's business 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.159
 reflection of the quality of reflection 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.499
 the thymus is attached in the occlusion of 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:55.719
 environment I put the gabriel more hype is 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:58.329
 the maximum here also I put in hi 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.159
 I called this part from here. 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.530
 it seems that the smoke and see if it is 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.080
 disabled 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.930
 I can comment with you here the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.880
 shadow is one of the things that forces 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.880
 video card so I voted for normal 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.080
 and the anti aging I'm going to put on and 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.730
 I'll call you and see later. 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.380
 some difference 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.180
 I particularly think that it is 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.890
 playing cool game 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.570
 So I'll leave this ours. 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:30.790
 remote configuration feature 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.230
 Mandela that 28 30 fps once in a while falls 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.630
 a little bit more that also 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.270
 understands the other game half a paradox 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.420
 so you do not need a fps so 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.430
 tall do not see beauty and look how it is 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.090
 there being a stage in gal no cars 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.860
 turning the law 9096 by 107 is 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 quiet 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.510
 He left only to reconcile I'm in 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.990
 part of the forest that is a bit 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.980
 heavy but so I play where I started 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.170
 the game itself 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.540
 I played before in the part of a 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.409
 nilde to you that something heavier than 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.390
 whereas this part 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.310
 then you will, I'll go over here 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.960
 the part of the ship 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.640
 I do not know if I'm going to spend in this video I 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.790
 I'm going to spend a next video to do 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.569
 two videos is put in the same 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.720
 so the event of 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.840
 graphical configuration from here and not 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.840
 complete your part for you 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:40.180
 I played the game right left the port 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:42.100
 playing in ours is not drug must have 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.830
 some bush so something does not fall 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.080
 so fit the bad guy but how am I 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.410
 seeing as organized around the map to 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.140
 average of about 30 fps and 25 which Minimum 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.739
 I found it for now but to settle 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.890
 playable and and without any channel on 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:03.069
 beauty processor and then back with the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.440
 video is in the navigation part and there 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.370
 Are you going to take a look at how you're going to stay? 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.290
 this part of all navigation are already 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.350
 It's running really cool because it's going to change. 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:19.450
 This game certainly felt good. 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:29.890
 running here now stood at 22 because 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:33.010
 it seems some new round part more 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.980
 a little here for you but soon 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:42.130
 I left soon and went back there in the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:47.010
 water that accept all this for the beauty 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.010
 have to rise to environmental for what 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:56.830
 there that part now where he went 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:02.500
 he also went to Caracas on the lines 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.500
 and so I did not want to go up 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:11.540
 welcoming the water is as if it is becoming 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.790
 running well that same win a game 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:19.130
 have to stop a little to power with 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:22.100
 so the active visit had not played 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.660
 in the middle ambinete game then it is not 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.150
 here playing make a game play later 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.500
 I'm going to start a step where he came 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.810
 here for you but I really liked the 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.300
 game thanks game everything very beautiful 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.810
 nice lift 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.639
 The game was in the champion to buy 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.310
 Because I found the game very well. 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.289
 designed and this now has navigation 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:52.430
 Dude, it's really cool, it 's really cool. 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.660
 this crazy to get reach the moon 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.900
 from the fight I wanted to show 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.789
 It 's still quiet for you. 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.830
 easy fight and now give a little beat 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.870
 interesting to show a scene like this 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.930
 that I want you to see also how 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:14.960
 It's being 30 Fessy that 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.539
 although also music that I wanted to hear 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.729
 o The amount of frames per second 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.020
 that I think I can play 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:26.000
 this game is over 30 is normal 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.900
 the generous feicorte offer and I await 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.900
 anxiously to arrive 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.000
 really have none on we want 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.940
 by the means 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.470
 Although I do not know the purple I believe 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.450
 recognize the investment in which 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:46.100
 take the history of football it goes 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:50.120
 turn killer, thus eliminating 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:54.040
 close to us means more or 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.040
 fewer recipients of August 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.160
 So I'm going to split this video into 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.310
 two parties will put the first part 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.470
 pushes away when placing the league 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.420
 sale because I did not get the 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.030
 Your part and I wanted to bet this video. 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.950
 today and will be divided into two parts 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.770
 Who liked the video by clicking? 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.320
 joinha are favorites and wait for more 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.570
 tpi efficiency tests because I do not 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.570
 I'm going to change the board and I can not get the money. 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.360
 it's short so i plan to do 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.640
 quite a review what it's becoming 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.100
 a factor that from a boat in the 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.410
 next tai chi channel video goes 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.140
 be tai chi and like to be registered and 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:41.420
 four in the navigation beauty a hug to 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.420
 all and until the next video was worth
