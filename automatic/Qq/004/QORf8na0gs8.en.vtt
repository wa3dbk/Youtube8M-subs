00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.790
 the new iphone 5 s is now on sale 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.400
 a few days ago in Spain 'and a 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.290
 presence we have been able to prove one year 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.689
 More apple has managed to overcome its 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.020
 own ribbon taking it to a level that 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.820
 nobody expected the 64 bits the 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.220
 External differences with the iphone 5 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.170
 they are almost priceless and only the most 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.449
 observers will be able to differentiate simple 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.160
 seen a model of other mild 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.860
 color differences the metal ring 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.379
 of the touch haiti and the double-tone flash 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.970
 which is now more elongated perhaps by 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.979
 that the most requested model is the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.589
 golden that is unique to this new 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:43.570
 model the spatial gray color that we have 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.059
 chosen to test looks better than the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.979
 black graphite of the iphone 5 the chassis of 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.049
 aluminum is subject to a process of 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.120
 Improved hoisting addon that allegedly 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.250
 will be much better at rubbing and 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.839
 wear that the previous model though 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.970
 such a delicate finish invites us to 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.100
 use a sheath the feeling in the 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.110
 Naked iphone hand is so good that 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.600
 It's worth taking it with nothing though 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.850
 everything depends on the taste of each 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.570
 entering into matter the heart of the new 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.729
 5 that is your processor to 7 the first of 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.940
 64 bits on any mobile device 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.920
 against what many believe the 64 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.590
 bits serve much more than managing 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.930
 more than 4 gigs of memory that is not the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.060
 case then this iphone only has one giga 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.070
 of ram memory its increase in the number 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.380
 of records and the size of them 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.420
 as well as its greater capacity in calculations 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.090
 much more complex they make their 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.100
 performance is much superior by opening the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.080
 door to a host of new apps with 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.550
 desktop quality maybe in use 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.830
 diary is not different from iphone 5 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.899
 but the capacity that already explodes in 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.580
 some apps like dj allowing the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.380
 Real-time tuning of a song 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.569
 with another to make the transitions 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.610
 perfect in real time or the 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.729
 graphical possibilities of infinity blade 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.440
 3 or real racing 3 make clear only one 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.509
 small advance of what will be able to 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.720
 do this new processor too 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.530
 present on the ipad and ipad mini of 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.259
 retina screen 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.560
 also graphically supports the standard 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.450
 opengl s 3.0 that increases the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.230
 possibilities taking the graphics to 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.200
 quality 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.849
 after dinner all that power comes from 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.500
 the hand of a major improvement in the 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.659
 processor energy efficiency 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.000
 that makes you take a step forward in the 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.370
 autonomy and allows us to overcome the day 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.980
 comfortably unthinkable thing in models 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.750
 previous among other factors the fact 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.580
 of deriving the continuous records of 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.920
 the terminal sensors to the new 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.530
 m 7 motion processor helps 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.329
 this fact the camera is another of the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.120
 characteristics that the new 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.010
 64-bit processor thanks to it 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.200
 we have a high speed mode that 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.390
 allows us to record videos at 120 frames 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.790
 per second it makes gusts up to 10 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.890
 pictures per second or increase the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.410
 focusing speed very noticeably from 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.030
 almost instantaneous way we can see and 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.010
 edit the slow motion effect in 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.540
 real time in the terminal itself what 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.920
 which becomes something pretty 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.769
 fun to play and try 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.510
 possibilities the camera now rides a 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.069
 sensor slightly larger than that of 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.170
 its predecessor what makes 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.810
 keeping the 8 megapixels of the model 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.430
 Previous this new iphone 5 s is 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.560
 become one of the terminals that 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.690
 better behave indoors thanks 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.920
 also to its dual tone flash that 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.319
 achieves tones 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.900
 and a much more color temperature 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.970
 natural in photographs with flash the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.580
 screen and resolution remain faithful 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.940
 at 4 inches and 326 points for 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.690
 inch with a resolution of 1,136 x 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.280
 640 in aspect ratio 16 9 though 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.860
 are far outweighed by the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.510
 competition the real difference is minimal 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.340
 between terminals and having a 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.260
 device that is held comfortably 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.030
 with your hand and fit correctly 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.489
 our pockets is still 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.019
 important for many the touch aid and is 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.540
 another of the protagonists of this new 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.069
 iphone 5s which will allow us 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.840
 unlock the phone with greater 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.910
 security and speed of which 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.980
 we obtained by entering the code of 4 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.860
 digits the recognition of the footprint 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.660
 it's very reliable and it's just being little 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.580
 demanding with the position of our finger 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.650
 and being able to do it from any 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.480
 angle or position the reading is not 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.190
 through optics capturing an image 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.260
 as many sensors did so far 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.989
 but by measuring the electrical conductivity 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.900
 of our micro grooves in the layer 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.609
 subte mica under your own skin by 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.590
 that we can put your finger on any 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.790
 position and the saved data for 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.980
 verification are 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.990
 much more secure for this we can 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.670
 set up to a maximum of 10 fingers 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.500
 in security settings and 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.240
 assistant will allow us to put our 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.430
 footprint in all possible positions 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.890
 to ensure that the measurements are 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.690
 correct thanks to the biometric sensor 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.000
 we can both unlock the phone 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.680
 how to validate purchases or downloads of 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.380
 applications in the app store or the 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.150
 content of the itunes store if you come 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.430
 of the iphone 5 the changes that you will notice are 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.410
 few at first sight and maybe not you 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.340
 it's worth making the change but with 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.500
 the passing of days 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.600
 You will see that your user experience will go 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.700
 winning whole and that everything goes beyond 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.220
 of simple numbers and technical aspects 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.700
 this iphone 5 that and his older brothers 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.130
 ipad and ipad mini with retina display are 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.010
 a bet on a new step in the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.750
 applications for mobile devices 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.640
 an open door and a bet towards 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.280
 exponentially increase the 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.050
 possibilities and capabilities and only the 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.290
 time and the developments that are made 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.360
 for these they will really show us what 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.870
 that these new devices will be 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.620
 able to do so iphone 5 s 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.850
 returns to position among the best 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.850
 once again
