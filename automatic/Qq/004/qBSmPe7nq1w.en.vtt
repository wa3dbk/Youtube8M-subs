TT sports and enhanced howdy space frame

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.520 
TT sports and enhanced howdy space frame
technology<00:03:11.670> where<00:03:12.659> our<00:03:12.750> engineers<00:03:13.170> have<00:03:13.230> come

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
technology where our engineers have come

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.080 
technology where our engineers have come
up<00:03:13.709> with<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:13.859> new<00:03:14.069> way<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.310> set<00:03:14.609> up<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.760> body

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
up with a new way to set up the body

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.990 
up with a new way to set up the body
significantly<00:03:16.019> reducing<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> way<00:03:16.790> I'm<00:03:17.790> often

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
significantly reducing the way I'm often

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.339 
significantly reducing the way I'm often
being<00:03:18.299> asked<00:03:18.599> that<00:03:18.629> question<00:03:18.840> when<00:03:19.139> as<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
being asked that question when as the

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.809 
being asked that question when as the
TTS<00:03:19.739> coming<00:03:20.099> today

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
TTS coming today

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.610 
TTS coming today
my<00:03:21.030> standard<00:03:21.540> answer<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.989> we're<00:03:22.260> launching

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
my standard answer is we're launching

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.369 
my standard answer is we're launching
the<00:03:22.709> TT<00:03:23.040> today<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:23.879> the<00:03:24.000> TT<00:03:24.329> offers<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.139> many

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
the TT today but the TT offers so many

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.199 
the TT today but the TT offers so many
elements<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:26.099> we<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.400> still<00:03:26.639> introduce<00:03:26.910> on

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
elements that we can still introduce on

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.119 
elements that we can still introduce on
a<00:03:27.239> later<00:03:27.480> stage<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.139> we're<00:03:28.709> investigating

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
a later stage and we're investigating

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.580 
a later stage and we're investigating
and<00:03:29.639> thoroughly<00:03:30.030> at<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.269> moment<00:03:30.629> and<00:03:30.780> you

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
and thoroughly at the moment and you

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.860 
and thoroughly at the moment and you
know<00:03:31.739> me<00:03:31.949> I'm<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> big<00:03:32.459> tea<00:03:32.669> tea<00:03:32.849> fan<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.389> I'd

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
know me I'm a big tea tea fan and I'd

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.360 
know me I'm a big tea tea fan and I'd
like<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.079> make<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.590> offer<00:03:34.739> as<00:03:34.980> broad<00:03:35.250> as

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
like to make the offer as broad as

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.780 
like to make the offer as broad as
possible<00:03:35.569> so<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:37.349> TTS<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.370> definitely

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
possible so the TTS is definitely

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.660 
possible so the TTS is definitely
something<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.120> we're<00:03:39.329> looking<00:03:39.359> at
