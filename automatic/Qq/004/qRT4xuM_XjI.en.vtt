00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.149
 Y 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.170
 good hands' storage rooms today I bring you a 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.850
 new mode called carpenter slow and we 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.220
 will serve to be able by the triangle will 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.920
 in minecraft but first I want to show you 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.259
 a little thing I want to apologize for the 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.759
 bell that I put yesterday a campazo as 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.720
 the wool thank you Mr. Ivan 71 35 for 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.020
 tell me that I had put a bell 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.630
 I had put 9 blocks in 91 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.430
 rope units to make a win and 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.100
 it had already gone clear I was not going to 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.989
 leave because it is not and it occurred to me 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.120
 say that they had eliminated the crafter 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.120
 drna I'm so sorry 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.019
 it was a bestial campaign and thanks to 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.960
 carlos 154 I have here the name for 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:57.960
 give us the crafter of the rope or cable 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.360
 minecraft 13 w 18 ao 18 p 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.030
 the one that can make the cable now with 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.979
 four of rope and one ball of the m here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.610
 in the middle many thanks to both of you for 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.560
 check yourself and for and for helping me and we're going to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.300
 continue with the mode is worth the difference 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.040
 between this block and this block the 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.960
 You can find a part that is not 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.500
 can put fire to one of the two is 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.369
 how good one is a block of carpenter 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.729
 n disguised rack and good can 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.979
 change by any type of texture and 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.320
 the only difference between these two is 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 that unlike this one that does not go 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.270
 with the water this one is going away and going to give 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.200
 the two blocks okay let's put here 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.840
 this to remove the water well and we're going to 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.119
 erase this and this is one of the other 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.150
 examples are valid that can be done with it 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 carpenter slow I fell 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.680
 the 10 who voted or I do not think so 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.380
 good does not matter 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.420
 it's pretty cool because you can 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.400
 do almost anything with the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.470
 triangles works pretty much like 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.450
 a staircase but rather more complete 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.310
 You see you can use any 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.690
 texture of any block that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.459
 let's use practically because I do believe 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.310
 which is almost almost any what is 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.810
 you can use even the oven has not 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.740
 tried but you could also try 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.730
 even the oven is not worth less 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.560
 bad that he has tried it and I have not said 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.670
 any almost any vale we are going to 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.160
 leave it in almost any 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.960
 there is a bad point that I did not like 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.790
 now the house has not taught him that he is 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.470
 I'm not going to say I'm going to say it's weird 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.250
 because it's a little strange we have 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.410
 here 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.120
 the carpenter we have here the block 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.800
 carpenter we can use it as a 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.390
 staircase both forward as if 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.210
 we put on the roof it will look like this 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.550
 we can also use it as a 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.580
 Total cornerback has many functions 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.910
 but to edit it we would have to go to 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.760
 survival mode and give it shift press more 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.760
 the left click or the click to paste 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.310
 to be able to give you the forms that we 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.670
 we want we can put almost any 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.790
 way really to do is that 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.130
 we can do a lot of things besides 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.880
 I will also teach an example of a 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.180
 island with more polygons than normal in 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.150
 the public island was not what I call it 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.110
 It's pretty cool because there is something left 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.489
 strange when you get to something like that and 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.610
 those days where the squares are worth 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.650
 it's all polygon it 's pretty good the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.560
 east-west rowing tree I have not stayed 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.550
 a little bit I'm up this his suffered 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.720
 a cucumber here we have another kind of 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.750
 trees is pretty good as 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.670
 decoration and well this is what what 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.709
 we can add any type 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.250
 of texture and I tell you that it is not necessary 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:01.010
 that is of earth or of sand like 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.840
 more examples than me here and also if 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.299
 we break them will give us good 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.420
 in survival mode if we break it we will 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.579
 give both the slow carpenter and the 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.190
 block that we used to for 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.709
 disguise it so nothing is up here 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.079
 the mod you see is very very very simple 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.459
 and see you in the next video if you 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.609
 has liked in the favorite X and until 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.609
 then
