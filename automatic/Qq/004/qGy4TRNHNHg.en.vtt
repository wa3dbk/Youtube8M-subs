00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello 2011 of www.stefanome.it 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.980
 Today I do some sort of unboxing 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.019
 more than unboxing some technical news 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.269
 on my new hydrodynamic founder for 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.969
 squid fishing think of squid 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.070
 yes, but keep in mind also fishing 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.020
 abolished all the fish that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.850
 it is also trolling fast 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.160
 You obviously already have this founder 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.350
 seen in my video of the brain ai 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.420
 calamari then I will not dwell too much 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.140
 on how they work and what else video 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.550
 only some advice for those who should 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.059
 buy it for how to use it as 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.710
 mount it with quick release and I'll describe you 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.290
 the latest changes and improvements that are 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.059
 been done then you keep in mind 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.399
 which you can normally set with one 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.469
 turn it into one of these three into one of 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:55.350
 these holes the mother and in this hole 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.480
 here another another another 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.100
 carabiner that will then carry over if 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.109
 the release clip if you want 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.180
 use it as a classic founder 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.189
 of the dynamic but since this 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.140
 founders of the very normal dynamic not 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.960
 is i show you how to put it to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.070
 Quick release quickly without having 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.080
 problems then I advise you 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.320
 especially the trailed squid 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.509
 thorough also quite important 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.150
 10 to 20 25 meters that this does not have 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.759
 afraid to go down to use the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.420
 last penultimate hole penultimate hole 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.189
 you will get one in this case 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.079
 sky to Allen because I found these 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.430
 however there are screws in stainless steel 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.420
 very normal 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.159
 in this case it is a m3 measure with 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.090
 the hospital that moves it I look for it here it is 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.670
 here the lazy man had hidden himself 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.189
 as with his bolts then vi 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.869
 procure these sell them in such a lot 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.549
 pile and no problem 1 release 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.829
 rapid ariosto using those of the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.620
 fabric because they are rigid and work 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.300
 very 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.950
 well they cost very little because you knew 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.900
 that we are from Genoa 15 recall of 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.640
 save on everything 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.040
 so once with a tweezer 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.500
 you have modified the opening of the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.400
 you will go to the fabric hook 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.600
 apply believe you do everything 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.700
 in front of the camera is not 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.680
 very easy taking in this 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.310
 direction here because then he will pull like that 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:25.230
 the neighbor the put that we took 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:29.170
 here it is inserted you will go to insert 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.940
 in the hole you want nikkei 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.260
 I obviously repeat here I have a 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.570
 brugola unfortunately I found these but 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.670
 you can find them as art with with one 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.570
 normal head 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:49.870
 go fix the momentum of kane e 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.850
 positioned in the direction of the water 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.550
 this is what a straight put 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.330
 she doesn't like who you prefer not 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.989
 changes absolutely nothing was 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.459
 still a little narrow ok we have 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.380
 prepared our hard founder 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.510
 because then you will see that remaining rigid 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.910
 you really take it off the hook 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.830
 really quickly ok so you 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.150
 I show this system that you have 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.480
 seen in the video so I'm not at 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:29.880
 replay anything with the dacron vi 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.880
 I show 1 and 12 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.660
 ok of course here date will no longer be 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:40.239
 long you will leave it at least still 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.720
 ten centimeters to then be able to then 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.760
 be able to slip this into the release ok e 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.140
 you will succeed podium when it arrives in 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.040
 boat in a manner to say the least 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.040
 embarrassing from how simple it is 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.490
 this is let 's say the system with which it is 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.270
 net release spoke to him veil made to see 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.400
 in hand quickly to tell you a 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.220
 another thing of this release another 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.390
 improvement I've made since the last video 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.850
 and these little cuts are these 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.290
 noodles here in time what you need 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.800
 what is invented is forming me 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.580
 I practically invented nothing 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.590
 talking to a fisherman that 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.410
 approved you tested them you know what 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.510
 I'd like to have the chance to 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.930
 make them directional and therefore divergent 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.790
 and I'd also like to change 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.320
 the trim when afloat in mona 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.050
 because you keep in mind that I have 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.880
 designed this tool because not 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.830
 come out on the water jumps like 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.710
 so many other plastic competitors 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.300
 I'm around, but let go of the tension 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.340
 on the cane but does not jump on the water in 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.350
 so that I do not tear the squid 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.120
 if you want it to come up in a manner 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.370
 embarrassing out of the water as it does 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.770
 for example, he does not want to advertise 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.570
 a brand that starts with k and le di 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.030
 plastic what do you do 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.300
 bent here there are practically gods 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.850
 marked just made on purpose to make the 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.610
 fold the flaps behind then if 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.160
 you want it to diverge bend one into the sun in 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.860
 down depending on the parts you are 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.340
 part that you want different instead if 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.350
 you want it to come up faster or 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.040
 less quickly inclined both 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.290
 the flaps behind that suffice here is enough 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.090
 just a plier now you don't 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.240
 let me show you this here is new me 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.430
 personally I won't bend them for why 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.410
 I prefer to keep them straight with one 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.020
 caliper simply just take it 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.910
 when with a parrot and bend it 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.910
 up or down seconds 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.800
 how you want this to come about is how much 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.230
 I wanted to remind you that they originate 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.030
 i am in the am the year stainless and they report 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.800
 strongly the writing they will also be for 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.140
 stefano adami ok 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.910
 I hope I have done something useful and 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.139
 you like that you managed to go there to 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.610
 fish have good results 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.330
 Raid your photos both up 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.419
 facebook that on twitter as you want e 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.699
 keep up to date on the catches that 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.509
 do with my evil tool for i 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.550
 squid 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.550
 ok thanks guys the next hello
