00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
on my face next we are adding one cup of

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:04.649 
on my face next we are adding one cup of
grated<00:01:56.979> carrot<00:01:58.979> and<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.869> handful<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:03.659> orange

juice<00:02:04.720> soaked<00:02:05.409> raisins<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:09.099> guess<00:02:09.789> at<00:02:09.970> this

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
juice soaked raisins I guess at this

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.509 
juice soaked raisins I guess at this
point<00:02:10.299> you<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:10.989> use<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.290> spatula<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:14.220> soaked<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
point you can use a spatula I soaked the

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.030 
point you can use a spatula I soaked the
reasons<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.299> orange<00:02:16.780> juice<00:02:17.079> because<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.829> gives

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
reasons in orange juice because it gives

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.199 
reasons in orange juice because it gives
a<00:02:18.099> nice<00:02:18.310> tang

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
a nice tang

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
if you do not have orange juice you can

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.430 
if you do not have orange juice you can
actually<00:02:21.370> use<00:02:21.819> regular<00:02:22.420> water<00:02:22.629> I<00:02:22.989> just<00:02:23.230> want
