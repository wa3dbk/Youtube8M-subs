because<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.769> ridiculous<00:02:32.769> how<00:02:33.129> long<00:02:33.400> they

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
because this is ridiculous how long they

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.970 
because this is ridiculous how long they
have<00:02:34.120> done<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.989> me<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.349> how<00:02:35.769> long

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
have done this to me and how long

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.650 
have done this to me and how long
they've<00:02:36.160> been<00:02:36.310> giving<00:02:36.549> me<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.760> runaround<00:02:36.970> and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660
