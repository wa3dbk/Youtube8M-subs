00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.650
 crucified and a sun 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.200
 what happens here but above all 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
 10 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.680
 you are a lion 1270 10 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.300
 I'm not a script 1270 10 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.890
 70 70 10 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.289
 [Music] 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.110
 It was given to me 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.920
 What do you say or tell me it's a boy 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.920
 and you love me 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.630
 [Music] 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.240
 hi youtube today I come to you with a 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.710
 tutorial on how to download the sims 3 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:10.710
 good family, let's start 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:13.710
 [Music] 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 first open your internet browser 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 in this case for me the google chrome 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.430
 then we go to google and 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.260
 we wrote download the little 3 sims 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.029
 family 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:35.029
 [Music] 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:02:12.009
 and I like that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:02:12.009
 [Music] 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.370
 they collided with the car they welcomed us to a 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.370
 dead but the car is fine 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.890
 then we took two links which are 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.350
 Interchangeable bone if it begins to 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.910
 lose one of downloads from another page 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:38.740
 [Music] 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.430
 and they give him play in downloader and he 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:50.799
 will begin to download alone 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:54.890
 [Music] 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.629
 I'm like once downloaded they're going to 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.360
 the folder where it was saved and 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:04.280
 The following sims mail folder will appear 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.620
 within them are files and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.770
 one is and they only ride in unity against 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.209
 that 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.209
 [Music] 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.620
 after they go to disk it will be local g 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.670
 [Music] 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.340
 they press the installation and install them 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.240
 I already have it installed so I'll give it 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.240
 in canceling it 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.290
 ah 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.200
 I was also at the florist 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:52.390
 a new woman once installed is 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.540
 direct to the craft folder within 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.720
 she found three files the 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.500
 they copy and paste them in local disk bar 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.310
 of program files or program files 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.989
 electronic arts game in and they stick it 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.349
 afterwards they will be able to play it without 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.540
 no good problem later on in 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.900
 a few more videos I will show you the game 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.900
 as in chapters well that has been all 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.520
 I hope you have served them until soon 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.830
 and he says goodbye with a very good program 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.729
 that a rat arrives fucked and I turn off the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.729
 computer x 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.739
 [Music] 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:50.640
 we are not talking about food 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.640
 [Music] 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.860
 damn rat with eternal 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.020
 but not
