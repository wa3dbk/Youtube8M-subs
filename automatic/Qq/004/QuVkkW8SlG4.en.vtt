already and this is my new rope so I'm
going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.029> go<00:00:24.990> measure<00:00:25.170> them<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.800> cut

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070

going to go measure them out and cut
this<00:00:26.189> new<00:00:26.340> rope<00:00:26.519> off<00:00:28.099> right<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
this new rope off right here when I

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.970 
this new rope off right here when I
stretch<00:00:30.119> these<00:00:30.330> ropes<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.750> where<00:00:31.439> my<00:00:31.679> braid

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
stretch these ropes out where my braid

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.310 
stretch these ropes out where my braid
starts<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.520> my<00:00:32.640> old<00:00:32.820> rope<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.200> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
starts on my old rope I just have it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
starts on my old rope I just have it
marked<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.250> come<00:00:35.489> pull<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> ropes

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
marked and so I just come pull the ropes

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.990 
marked and so I just come pull the ropes
out<00:00:36.590> mark<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.770> new<00:00:38.010> rope<00:00:38.250> where<00:00:38.610> my<00:00:38.760> braid

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
out mark this new rope where my braid

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.819 
out mark this new rope where my braid
where<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.660> my<00:00:39.690> braid<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> start<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.590> then

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
where I want my braid to start and then

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.290 
where I want my braid to start and then
that<00:00:41.070> way<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.489> come<00:00:41.670> down<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.030> cut<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that way I can come down here and cut it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.290 
that way I can come down here and cut it
off<00:00:43.160> I'm<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.370> cut<00:00:44.550> my<00:00:44.670> rope<00:00:44.820> off<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.270> just

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
off I'm going to cut my rope off I just

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.910 
off I'm going to cut my rope off I just
want<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> give<00:00:45.809> myself<00:00:46.020> plenty<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.500> room<00:00:46.710> I

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
want to give myself plenty of room I

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.619 
want to give myself plenty of room I
don't<00:00:47.309> want<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> cut<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.730> off<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.030> right<00:00:48.180> here

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
don't want to cut it off just right here

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.600 
don't want to cut it off just right here
too<00:00:49.020> short<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> braid<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
too short because I have to braid it and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.950 
too short because I have to braid it and
so<00:00:50.730> that's<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> shrink<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.780> lot<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
so that's going to shrink up a lot of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
so that's going to shrink up a lot of
your<00:00:52.110> rope<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.860> I'll<00:00:53.010> come<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.399> down<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
your rope so I'll come on down here a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.420 
your rope so I'll come on down here a
little<00:00:54.719> further<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.350> cut<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.980> off<00:00:56.100> somewhere

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
little further and cut it off somewhere

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.970 
little further and cut it off somewhere
down<00:00:56.820> around<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.710> plenty

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
down around here so that I have plenty

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.889 
down around here so that I have plenty
of<00:00:59.100> room<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.460> braid<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.850> rope<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.629> tie<00:01:00.840> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of room to braid that rope up and tie it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.410 
of room to braid that rope up and tie it
in<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.230> knot

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
in a knot

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:11.220 
in a knot
sawed<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.570> down

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.590 

the<00:01:12.230> reason<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:13.040> cut<00:01:13.670> my<00:01:13.850> rope<00:01:14.090> off<00:01:14.330> and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
the reason that I cut my rope off and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.620 
the reason that I cut my rope off and
braid<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.080> is<00:01:15.230> because<00:01:15.710> I<00:01:15.950> feel<00:01:16.520> like<00:01:16.580> if<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.330> can

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
braid it is because I feel like if I can

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.430 
braid it is because I feel like if I can
loosen<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:19.250> rope<00:01:19.520> up<00:01:19.730> right<00:01:20.030> here<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.900> tie<00:01:21.170> on

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
loosen that rope up right here to tie on

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.400 
loosen that rope up right here to tie on
to<00:01:21.740> my<00:01:21.920> easy<00:01:22.190> now<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.730> can<00:01:23.330> have<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:23.810> coil<00:01:24.110> lay

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
to my easy now I can have this coil lay

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.800 
to my easy now I can have this coil lay
more<00:01:24.710> naturally<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.460> feel<00:01:26.090> like<00:01:26.300> if<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.570> don't

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
more naturally I feel like if you don't

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.420 
more naturally I feel like if you don't
cut<00:01:27.020> your<00:01:27.170> rope<00:01:27.380> off<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:27.800> you<00:01:27.950> just<00:01:27.980> try<00:01:28.310> to

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
cut your rope off and you just try to

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.060 
cut your rope off and you just try to
tie<00:01:28.730> it<00:01:28.790> on<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.360> anything<00:01:30.020> you're<00:01:30.710> going<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.920> be

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
tie it on to anything you're going to be

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.070 
tie it on to anything you're going to be
changing<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.060> way<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.570> rope<00:01:32.780> feels

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
changing the way that that rope feels

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.390 
changing the way that that rope feels
it's<00:01:33.320> going<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.560> naturally<00:01:33.979> be<00:01:34.100> wanting<00:01:34.370> to

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
it's going to naturally be wanting to

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.240 
it's going to naturally be wanting to
pull<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.910> inside<00:01:35.330> or<00:01:35.630> or<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.800> outside

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
pull to the inside or or to the outside

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.250 
pull to the inside or or to the outside
however<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.850> however<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.600> try<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.900> tie<00:01:39.200> it

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
however you however you try to tie it

but<00:01:39.979> however<00:01:40.370> if<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:41.170> cut<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.200> rope<00:01:42.620> and

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
but however if you cut that rope and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.740 
but however if you cut that rope and
braid<00:01:43.190> this<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:43.729> that<00:01:43.910> it's<00:01:44.060> loose

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
braid this so that it's loose

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.530 
braid this so that it's loose
this<00:01:45.560> keeps<00:01:45.830> this<00:01:46.100> more<00:01:46.369> natural<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.210> keeps<00:01:47.450> a

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
this keeps this more natural it keeps a

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.930 
this keeps this more natural it keeps a
more<00:01:47.690> natural<00:01:48.140> coil<00:01:48.470> in<00:01:48.680> your<00:01:48.800> hand<00:01:49.070> now<00:01:49.880> the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
you can you can separate these and just

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.090 
you can you can separate these and just
braid<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:56.630> up<00:01:56.780> if<00:01:57.050> you<00:01:57.110> have<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.440> three<00:01:57.800> strand

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100
