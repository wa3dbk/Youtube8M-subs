nice scene you would be interested in
good<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.140> seafront<00:01:37.500> area<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:38.340> are

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
good in the seafront area there are

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.880 
good in the seafront area there are
people<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.390> virtually<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.470> time<00:01:40.710> on

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
people here virtually all the time on

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
people here virtually all the time on
daylight<00:01:41.250> hours<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.970> many<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> evening

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
daylight hours and many of the evening

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.510 
daylight hours and many of the evening
hours<00:01:42.960> there<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.350> people<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:43.740> bad<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
hours there are people are bad so it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.490 
hours there are people are bad so it
becomes<00:01:44.759> much<00:01:45.119> safer<00:01:45.659> for<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> young<00:01:46.110> people

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
becomes much safer for the young people

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.649 
becomes much safer for the young people
themselves<00:01:46.590> there's<00:01:47.490> less<00:01:47.790> likelihood<00:01:48.299> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
themselves there's less likelihood of
