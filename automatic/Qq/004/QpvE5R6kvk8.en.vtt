 hi my name is Olya and today I did 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.330
 for you with altai goat down because 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.330
 bookish cozy lands and 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.590
 the creator of this tag is the girl on the shaft 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.770
 finance and she is passing the baton to this 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.400
 Tag 3 types in which I have this current and 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.110
 saw 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.090
 and I liked him so much that I 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.210
 decided it would be great to translate it 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.830
 into Russian into our russian youtube and 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.879
 this is probably a free translation 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.370
 adapted to our mentality because 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.330
 that there is a question about apple cider 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.830
 about which I for example did not hear at all and 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.410
 I had to work a little on the third 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.820
 to make it more appropriately look like this 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.820
 we are in Russian in the asset 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.480

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.580
 what book gives you a warm feeling 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.010
 for me this book ray bradbury wine from 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.830
 dandelions and summer 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.680
 I read it becomes very warm 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.750
 I somehow tried to start re-reading 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.490
 but in the end I did not have enough time and I 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.009
 it seems that it was somewhere in the winter 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.009
 time and it is incredibly warming 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.640
 autumn storms wind howls and rain 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.010
 bangs ritu on your book

 or genres that you like to read in 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.270
 a rainy day for some reason it seems to me that 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.250
 in rainy weather I would love to 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.770
 reread great gatsby francis 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.720
 scott fitzgerald but more recently in 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.170
 train Unid was raining and I started 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.590
 to read 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.520
 daniel aki for flowers for elgernon and me 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.650
 it seems that it also fits 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.320
 bad weather I pronounced correctly 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.760
 Do you call the book the first time for everything 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.760

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.010

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.990

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.940
 I want to change places and I never 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.780
 which book heroes do I associate with 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.630
 of all 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.630
 difficult fate and i like being myself 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.109
 hot apple mulled wine which is not 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.140
 advertised book you would like 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.120
 see top sellers or hot 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.650
 a novelty I would be in the top of sales 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.569
 see 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.540
 arthur conan doyle and his sherlock holmes 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.200
 and not on dictum cumberbatch than on 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.019
 the cover 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.239
 although I have nothing against him 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.150
 It seems to me that I would be at 1 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.750
 nicer if this book was bought and 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.060
 read 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.389
 not because there is advertised 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.389

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.870
 cold and steam tangled which 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.000
 nasty book cover would you like 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.069

 unpleasant but nonetheless if i 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.579

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.690

 autumn is associated with apple pie 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.940
