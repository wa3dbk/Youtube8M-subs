 cat bed tv and this tori to the enclave 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.719
 Ok, they 're tired of taking the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.949
 schools that opponents will 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.560
 running running running running 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.650
 running running with it so ok if 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 This is the end of the techniques of their 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.550
 teams do not matter the same way the three 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.980
 are playing and beat them to the side and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.719
 the central defenders are with this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 market the question beck and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.790
 attack will not be Spanish government option 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.010
 that means up until the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.469
 little team attacks is ours but because 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.440
 for example the real Madrid situation and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.230
 left marcelo s voice over there is the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.500
 Brazil always sees like a madman to attack 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.110
 ok and meet the others let's get you to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.300
 defense but rather avoided 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.180
 counterattacks in the first zone of the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.239
 rent and scored the goals of rushing 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.580
 soc good new the second four tutorials 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.799
 I'm bayan at the cost of the actress class 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.290
 custom practices and the bonga 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.780
 team pressure the coach of 30 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.330
 know a value between 15 and 30 rock 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.000
 aggressiveness or daycare as sometimes 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.770
 also that it is setting between 1 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.860
 hour between 51 and come was in shock 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:33.000
 while the third opponent width 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 team tingüí in 3 50 55 and minimum 12 35 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.130
 Ok I'm maximizing other locks 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.659
 stimuli is a previous step because 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.810
 This will shut down your defenders. 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.520
 less aggressive to get up 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.220
 back waiting for the opponent is to set the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.040
 play instead of stopping it is the servant 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.030
 how crazy am I gay and preventing the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.540
 opponent 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.579
 and their defenders behind and in the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.840
 third party depends on this 3,100 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.719
 example 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.829
 calm down and at the right time is 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.920
 viana player but running back and 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.900
 here 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.390
 long would simply like to have a 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.010
 third car soc and the huge 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.840
