00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940 

hey<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.659> and<00:00:01.140> here<00:00:01.620> and<00:00:01.860> I<00:00:03.290> had<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.560> little

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
hey guys and here and I had a little

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.629 
hey guys and here and I had a little
dream<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.730> couple<00:00:06.120> nights<00:00:06.359> ago<00:00:06.919> that<00:00:07.919> involved

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
dream a couple nights ago that involved

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.870 
dream a couple nights ago that involved
TNT<00:00:09.269> cannons<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.040> guys<00:00:11.340> have<00:00:11.610> seen

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
TNT cannons and so you guys have seen

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.740 
TNT cannons and so you guys have seen
this<00:00:12.269> cannon<00:00:12.809> which<00:00:13.230> has<00:00:13.500> Steven<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.219> use

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
this cannon which has Steven a use

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.460 
this cannon which has Steven a use
design<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.640> so<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> had<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> dream<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.630> doubling

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
design and so I had a dream of doubling

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.599 
design and so I had a dream of doubling
the<00:00:19.650> TNT<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:21.320> instead<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.470> using<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
the TNT and instead of using it for a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.630 
the TNT and instead of using it for a
say<00:00:26.609> tnt<00:00:27.330> cannon<00:00:27.380> let's<00:00:28.380> use<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> player

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
say tnt cannon let's use it for a player

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.840 
say tnt cannon let's use it for a player
cannon<00:00:30.330> because<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.289> far<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.949> many<00:00:32.189> cannons

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
cannon because so far not many cannons

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.940 
cannon because so far not many cannons
have<00:00:33.570> been<00:00:33.780> invented<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.410> shoot<00:00:34.649> players

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
have been invented to shoot players

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
have been invented to shoot players
across<00:00:35.610> most<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.780> them<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.170> been<00:00:37.380> up<00:00:38.420> but<00:00:39.420> my

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
across most of them have been up but my

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.430 
across most of them have been up but my
previous<00:00:40.320> version<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.899> quite

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
previous version now one was not quite

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.090 
previous version now one was not quite
powerful<00:00:44.309> enough<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.230> built<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.829> one

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
powerful enough so I built this one

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.360 
powerful enough so I built this one
twice<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.940> TNT<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.899> pick<00:00:49.140> more<00:00:50.100> than<00:00:50.129> one

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
twice the TNT you can pick more than one

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.319 
twice the TNT you can pick more than one
direction<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.270> shoot<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.789> so<00:00:53.789> let's<00:00:54.120> just

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
direction to shoot in and so let's just

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.290 
direction to shoot in and so let's just
get<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.989> see<00:00:55.199> how<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> works<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
get on to see how it works so you have a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.689 
get on to see how it works so you have a
block<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> lever<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.489> you

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
block here with the lever on it as you

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.380 
block here with the lever on it as you
can<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.510> reach<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.780> from<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.440> angles

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
can see you can reach it from all angles

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
can see you can reach it from all angles
even<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.680> hitbox<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
even this one because the hitbox is a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.570 
even this one because the hitbox is a
bit<00:01:05.549> wider<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.590> what<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.040> when<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
bit wider and what you do is when you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.990 
bit wider and what you do is when you
flick<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> lever<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.830> torch<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.580> invert

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
flick the lever that torch will invert

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.660 
flick the lever that torch will invert
so<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.750> will<00:01:12.930> turn<00:01:13.110> off<00:01:13.409> which<00:01:14.220> will<00:01:14.460> allow

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
so it will turn off which will allow

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.399 
so it will turn off which will allow
this<00:01:15.060> torch<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.750> turn<00:01:15.960> on

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
this torch to turn on

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.340 
this torch to turn on
and<00:01:17.499> if<00:01:18.219> this<00:01:18.729> torch<00:01:19.090> is<00:01:19.270> on<00:01:19.539> it<00:01:19.869> will<00:01:20.079> power

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
and if this torch is on it will power

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.550 
and if this torch is on it will power
this<00:01:20.740> block<00:01:21.039> which<00:01:21.700> will<00:01:21.999> provide<00:01:22.630> power<00:01:22.929> here

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
this block which will provide power here

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.789 
this block which will provide power here
loops<00:01:24.189> around<00:01:24.399> with<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.179> total<00:01:25.689> of<00:01:25.840> four<00:01:26.200> tix<00:01:26.560> of

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
loops around with a total of four tix of

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.870 
loops around with a total of four tix of
delay<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:28.299> here<00:01:29.140> runs<00:01:29.649> up<00:01:29.859> this<00:01:30.100> vertical<00:01:30.670> wire

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
delay up here runs up this vertical wire

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.399 
delay up here runs up this vertical wire
and<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:32.049> powers<00:01:32.409> this<00:01:32.859> row<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.219> Pistons<00:01:34.409> okay

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
and the powers this row of Pistons okay

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.709 
and the powers this row of Pistons okay
now<00:01:35.649> at<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:35.950> same<00:01:36.189> time<00:01:36.959> that<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.880> power<00:01:40.299> it

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
now at the same time that this power it

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.240 
now at the same time that this power it
this<00:01:41.439> block<00:01:41.799> has<00:01:42.039> power<00:01:43.679> this<00:01:44.679> redstone<00:01:45.099> is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
this block has power this redstone is

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.969 
this block has power this redstone is
powered<00:01:45.849> has<00:01:46.359> one<00:01:46.689> tick<00:01:46.869> of<00:01:47.020> delay<00:01:47.319> runs<00:01:47.619> up<00:01:47.799> a

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
powered has one tick of delay runs up a

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.819 
powered has one tick of delay runs up a
separate<00:01:48.490> instant<00:01:49.299> wire<00:01:49.539> instant<00:01:50.379> vertical

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
separate instant wire instant vertical

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.789 
separate instant wire instant vertical
wire<00:01:51.039> up<00:01:51.729> here<00:01:52.390> which<00:01:52.569> has<00:01:52.750> another<00:01:53.319> tick<00:01:53.679> of

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
wire up here which has another tick of

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.069 
wire up here which has another tick of
delay<00:01:54.129> so<00:01:54.189> that's<00:01:54.579> two<00:01:55.090> ticks<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.539> delay<00:01:55.840> for

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
delay so that's two ticks of delay for

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.010 
delay so that's two ticks of delay for
this<00:01:56.110> line<00:01:56.500> runs<00:01:57.310> over<00:01:57.640> here<00:01:57.969> with<00:01:58.719> another

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
this line runs over here with another

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.859 
this line runs over here with another
two<00:01:59.379> ticks<00:01:59.679> so<00:02:00.369> you've<00:02:00.789> got<00:02:00.819> a<00:02:01.030> total<00:02:01.390> for<00:02:01.629> tix

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
two ticks so you've got a total for tix

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.350 
two ticks so you've got a total for tix
here<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:04.360> line<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:05.289> Pistons<00:02:06.039> from<00:02:06.909> here

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
here so this line of Pistons from here

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.300 
here so this line of Pistons from here
up<00:02:07.479> should<00:02:08.470> be

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.270 

should<00:02:11.730> extend<00:02:12.239> at<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.630> same<00:02:12.870> time<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:13.470> this

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
should extend at the same time as this

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.800 
should extend at the same time as this
one<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:16.170> that's<00:02:16.500> basically<00:02:16.830> how<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.340> works

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
one so that's basically how it works

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.740 
one so that's basically how it works
thanks<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.080> my<00:02:19.290> dream<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:20.099> guess<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.239> dream

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
about weird stuff I know but here we go

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:34.720 
about weird stuff I know but here we go
so<00:02:27.599> same<00:02:28.260> launching<00:02:28.830> style<00:02:31.250> fill<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.489> Pistons

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
so same launching style fill the Pistons

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.220 
so same launching style fill the Pistons
herpaderp<00:02:35.730> being<00:02:36.660> bored<00:02:36.930> right<00:02:37.230> now

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230

that ladder thing it's a trick I learned
most<00:03:04.260> people<00:03:04.650> don't<00:03:04.890> realize<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.280> when

most people don't realize that when
you're<00:03:05.760> going<00:03:06.000> down<00:03:06.180> ladders<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.690> can<00:03:06.840> just

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
you're going down ladders you can just

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.070 
you're going down ladders you can just
shift<00:03:07.349> off<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.010> side<00:03:08.390> fall<00:03:09.390> down<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.930> then

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
shift off to the side fall down and then

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.809 
shift off to the side fall down and then
go<00:03:10.230> back<00:03:10.410> onto<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.890> lightest<00:03:11.250> right<00:03:11.519> before

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
go back onto the lightest right before

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.610 
go back onto the lightest right before
you<00:03:11.910> hit<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.090> ground<00:03:12.239> oh<00:03:12.660> no<00:03:13.200> it's<00:03:13.349> just<00:03:13.440> a

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
you hit the ground oh no it's just a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.520 
you hit the ground oh no it's just a
little<00:03:13.890> trick<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.250> learned<00:03:14.519> in<00:03:14.790> RF<00:03:15.359> w<00:03:15.540> well<00:03:16.230> i

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:31.280 

we<00:04:22.430> know<00:04:24.710> ok<00:04:26.930> so<00:04:28.160> we're<00:04:29.160> refilling<00:04:29.760> again<00:04:30.290> due

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
now let's actually go into survival mode

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.589 
now let's actually go into survival mode
as<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:57.190> can<00:04:57.340> see<00:04:57.520> I've<00:04:57.699> got<00:04:57.759> diamond<00:04:58.360> armor

as you can see I've got diamond armor

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.010 
as you can see I've got diamond armor
prepared<00:04:59.020> for<00:04:59.169> you<00:04:59.319> just<00:04:59.949> for<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.550> oh<00:05:01.020> that

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
prepared for you just for you oh that

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.180 
prepared for you just for you oh that
sounded<00:05:02.319> a<00:05:02.440> bit<00:05:02.470> awkward<00:05:03.130> but<00:05:03.759> here<00:05:04.449> we<00:05:04.599> go

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
sounded a bit awkward but here we go

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:13.170 
sounded a bit awkward but here we go
pull<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.310> lever

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.310 

see<00:05:13.900> now<00:05:14.259> this<00:05:14.560> is<00:05:15.509> where<00:05:16.509> I<00:05:16.570> actually<00:05:16.780> wanted

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
see now this is where I actually wanted

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.100 
see now this is where I actually wanted
to<00:05:17.380> end<00:05:17.590> up<00:05:17.770> so<00:05:18.550> let's<00:05:18.789> go<00:05:19.120> back<00:05:19.150> into<00:05:19.539> creative

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
to end up so let's go back into creative

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.070 
to end up so let's go back into creative
mode<00:05:20.320> and<00:05:22.139> you<00:05:23.139> can<00:05:23.350> see<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:24.090> went<00:05:25.090> all<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:26.050> way

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
mode and you can see I went all the way

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.550 
mode and you can see I went all the way
over<00:05:26.860> here<00:05:26.889> so<00:05:27.669> you<00:05:27.759> do<00:05:28.240> actually<00:05:28.509> fly<00:05:29.169> up<00:05:29.440> a

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
over here so you do actually fly up a

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.620 
over here so you do actually fly up a
little<00:05:29.830> bit<00:05:30.009> and<00:05:30.190> you<00:05:30.580> don't<00:05:30.789> take<00:05:31.000> much

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
little bit and you don't take much

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.100 
little bit and you don't take much
damage<00:05:32.199> on<00:05:32.440> landing<00:05:33.300> because<00:05:34.300> you<00:05:34.660> don't<00:05:34.870> fly

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
damage on landing because you don't fly

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.610 
damage on landing because you don't fly
out<00:05:35.139> more<00:05:35.620> than<00:05:35.800> three<00:05:36.130> blocks<00:05:37.470> so<00:05:38.470> that's<00:05:39.100> the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
out more than three blocks so that's the
