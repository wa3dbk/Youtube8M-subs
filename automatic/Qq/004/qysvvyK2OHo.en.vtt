00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.400
 well here we are with the crabs 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:10.900
 blue and are eating ripe 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.450
 we are preparing these crabs 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.250
 to take out the science fair and 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.200
 technology let's see how we are doing now 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.990
 we have prepared them for a 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.559
 time and as you can see here this is 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.829
 the corral where we have them 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:33.700
 feeding that there are some visits in 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:37.210
 internal gaps and internal gaps 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.230
 and burrows as he held that box 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.260
 and that they love to get there 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.899
 as we see 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.059
 to this crab and here you can see in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.620
 the mouth so they call it time that 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.159
 this crab can see him a plate 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.159
 mature 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.340
 territorialist sun stagnates from a 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.010
 side 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.990
 to another removing the space are 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.840
 now hydrating in the pool 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.070
 as we see the crabs 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.090
 and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.250
 as I repeat, you can appreciate the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.250
 mouth a bit a piece of ripe 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.350
 this is the general view 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.590
 gives the tailpiece we have here to 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.420
 through the house and to drain we have 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.140
 here a river 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.070
 the month but you can see 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.680
 but do not touch me there's down here 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.680
 here comes the la and here is my house 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.110
 and the lord is hidden and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:50.060
 this is my house with plants 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:53.530
 of all kinds as you can see it does not 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.550
 let's make one last shot 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.240
 d 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.010
 with our channel and we like to live here 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.430
 in the corrals they can stay a lot 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.950
 time one year two years 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.610
 I was lucky the other time there will move a 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.290
 crab here in January when it was not 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.770
 time of change 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.110
 so 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.510
 appreciate you 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.520
 and this is going to be part of the series of 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.220
 science and technology that we are going to include 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.220
 to put in another type of cage 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.540
 you can appreciate we are going to make a 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.540
 take from above 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.330
 a certain 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.330
 happy
