00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.389
 your biker my channel 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.460
 this likes online shutters 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.470
 somewhat realistic and above all 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.619
 each is spectacular and exciting 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.119
 year at battlefield and call of duty out 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.650
 electronics doctor wants changes there 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.150
 bring with titanfall 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.470
 that is perhaps less realistic 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.820
 but just as exciting and 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.820
 spectacular as a competitor 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.570
 live it go commentary 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.710
 that is because the makers of the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.199
 crude formula of the traditional 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.180
 online show so what have been released in 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.109
 In many ways the item is full 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.269
 familiar 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.070
 13 of 6 players are taking it online 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.780
 each other in with shift is a ten 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.309
 minutes 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.049
 the difference lies in the titans 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.450
 the game takes its name from that 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.220
 indeed literally fall from the sky 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.810
 it's like players start as a pilot 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.070
 as a soldier walking on it 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.960
 battlefield runs 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.729
 Kills provide points that you can use 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.979
 your him time can earn on you 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.750
 request slammed down 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.640
 then it becomes fun you can board 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.159
 of time and we climb to the weather 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.509
 to suddenly look very different you can 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.090
 then enjoy a sturdy steel 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.679
 cover any heavy weapons 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.720
 the pilots around you are suddenly like 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.280
 You fly on the wall with the largest 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.690
 ease for mussel 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.119
 if you get to know them get team 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.399
 because that 's the great thing about being on board 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.319
 titan you are suddenly much stronger but 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.810
 as a pilot you are certainly not powerless 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.429
 pilots have a jetpack 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.159
 can run along walls at the top 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:51.720
 they are therefore very fast and mobile 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.720
 and therefore difficult for titans to hit 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.810
 more important are the levels 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.680
 build next where pilots can 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.720
 take shelter 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.740
 at the top you can perfect from that height 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.740
 time and research into 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.280
 even better is it on top of a titan 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.230
 jump at a time and out of your own 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.870
 team you can ride a bit 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.760
 is especially useful when your cat Spot 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.400
 It is more fun to be at a hostile time 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.410
 and you can insist that you succeed 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.910
 open a flap on the mac and and 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.950
 shoot in time and out 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.530
 switch without the driver slightly 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.090
 so can be a pilot against 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.500
 maybe a fly on the wall 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.709
 but the one that flies in common 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.709
 stabbing 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.540
 that pilot are fast and manoeuvrable 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.980
 chicks that actually but then on 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.570
 a very different way 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.430
 during have namely a dash and that 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.430
 makes fights usually turn out 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.680
 on the political power and building the knife 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.140
 emerge much firing and 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.000
 the new DC quickly find coverage again 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.340
 The great thing is that the world for pilots 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.230
 and titans look very different for that 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.790
 paulus consists of dangerous open 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.500
 spaces and buildings that provide shelter 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.080
 and we can put clothes up here 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.970
 for during its same open space 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.980
 the trenches in it and fight with the 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.260
 different time and for both parties 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.209
 The levels are well constructed the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 battle of pilots and titans is hectic 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.380
 exciting and especially nice and fast 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.850
 old-fashioned fast even you used to quake 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.250
 iii has played the tension 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.720
 recognize who is familiar with the game 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.020
 well cared for and the biggest 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.020
 attraction 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.150
 oddly enough, everything around it is actually 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.890
 not very striking 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.989
 see the levels and not spectacular and 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.190
 a bit boring from that actually 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.410
 for the whole game money 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.200
 it is made with the source engine and 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.209
 it dates from the time of half life 2 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.069
 that makes everything a bit dull for it 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.319
 the appearance you should not Titanfall 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.489
 and it's more that little 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.440
 is spectacular 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.269
 we also see the weapons pretty standard it 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.030
 the only innovative weapon is the smart 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.220
 the pistol of the pilot is well used 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.109
 you have a guaranteed kill 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.060
 that has been taking a while and it is difficult 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.190
 are fast none 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.070
 it does prevent his car in their 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.510
 our pistol overpowerd taste is what us 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.320
 there were one more of this kind 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.639
 unique water is what the game is about 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.889
 it your party charlie wat canada 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.889
 a fortiori would think I am here 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.400
 I can help 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.569
 Sorry 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.270
 you think the makers is more on 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.950
 to count is that there is little and especially 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.150
 what standard game form opinions are 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.220
 included 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.170
 Trisha it's just in team deathmatch 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.300
 hardpoint, the teams fight over occupied 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.590
 hold three points and for capture 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.360
 the flag doesn't even have another one for me 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.590
 name to find better 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.630
 there is another game with only 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.640
 titans and one with only pilot because 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.830
 both are actually pretty boring 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.990
 get worse in the campaign 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.940
 makers always indicated that in advance 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.380
 has a story in titan full while 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.150
 the game is primarily a pure de 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.130
 multiplayer shooter liked 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.680
 that is indeed in a campaign 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.390
 this would be 9 missions for each of the two 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.190
 warring parties 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.470
 we can be very brief about it 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.120
 story is the number words and the 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.800
 campaign is nothing 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.450
 the campaign is completely online in you 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.730
 plays the same maps in the same 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.260
 game forms as in the rest of the game 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.480
 the only thing is that you are during the campaign 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.070
 some things free who in the rest 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.120
 family you want to use a new one 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.120
 model actually started 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.400
 really quite apart 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.150
 a bit of a form of walking from July 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.150
 as the pooh 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:16.019
 explore titanfall so some negatives 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.759
 the campaign makes no reference to game forms 

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:19.739
 are predictable and appearance is 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.849
 how boring and not as detailed as we are 

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:22.469
 would like 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.419
 however, the gameplay does not make much 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:26.459
 Everything good 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.439
 Paul and Titans are just fun to be with 

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:30.719
 and the gameplay is fast 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:32.819
 hectic and addiction I think so well 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:34.679
 balanced and forgiving 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.749
 towards new players what the for them 

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:39.269
 to ensure that I do not fall into 

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:40.049
 a hardcore fans that only that doctor 

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:42.539
 still want to play 

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:44.429
 titanfall is simply good for fast 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:46.289
 everyone accessible and especially a lot 

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:49.819
 pleasant and well-balanced 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.819
 supplement to the established order
