00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.030 
around with some painting techniques
that<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.960> learned<00:01:48.990> from<00:01:49.259> Marion<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.920> her

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
that I learned from Marion on her

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160 
that I learned from Marion on her
Ustream<00:01:50.520> channel<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.720> painted<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
Ustream channel and so I painted the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.569 
Ustream channel and so I painted the
glimmer<00:01:52.439> mist<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.770> these<00:01:52.890> flowers<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.399> hope

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
glimmer mist on these flowers I hope

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.639 
glimmer mist on these flowers I hope
they<00:01:53.670> turned<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.000> really<00:01:54.149> cool<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.990> it's

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
they turned out really cool and it's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.819 
they turned out really cool and it's
made<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:56.130> pocket<00:01:56.310> here<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:58.320> holds

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
made a little pocket here that holds

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.520 
made a little pocket here that holds
this<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.689> journaling<00:02:00.689> book<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.350> guess

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
this little journaling book and I guess

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.380 
this little journaling book and I guess
you<00:02:01.619> could<00:02:01.770> put<00:02:01.829> some<00:02:02.189> little<00:02:02.340> tiny<00:02:02.939> pictures

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you could put some little tiny pictures

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.030 
you could put some little tiny pictures
in<00:02:03.600> there<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.290> thought<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> cute<00:02:04.920> little

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
in there but I thought a cute little

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
in there but I thought a cute little
journal<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.579> be

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
journal would be

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.540 
journal would be
and<00:02:06.360> then<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> nice<00:02:07.350> picture<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.220> go<00:02:08.340> right

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and then a nice picture can go right

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.330 
and then a nice picture can go right
here<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.240> this<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> tattered<00:02:10.800> angels<00:02:11.100> chip

much<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.400> it<00:05:41.430> so<00:05:41.520> I<00:05:41.639> just<00:05:41.699> did<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.000> little<00:05:42.120> bit<00:05:42.360> of

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
much to it so I just did a little bit of

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.740 
much to it so I just did a little bit of
masking<00:05:43.530> on<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:44.370> corners<00:05:44.789> with<00:05:44.819> a<00:05:45.090> Tim<00:05:45.449> Holtz

mask<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.710> I<00:05:46.770> just<00:05:46.949> went<00:05:47.099> over<00:05:47.280> it<00:05:47.370> with<00:05:47.400> some

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
mask and I just went over it with some

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.050 
mask and I just went over it with some
cream<00:05:48.720> d<00:05:48.900> chocolate<00:05:49.800> I<00:05:49.979> believe<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.729> it<00:05:50.820> just

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
cream d chocolate I believe and it just

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.150 
cream d chocolate I believe and it just
it<00:05:51.690> kind<00:05:51.810> of<00:05:51.960> matched<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.349> paper<00:05:52.590> really<00:05:52.860> well

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.640 
it kind of matched the paper really well
so<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:54.060> didn't<00:05:54.360> distort<00:05:54.599> the<00:05:54.780> paper<00:05:54.990> color<00:05:55.289> too

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650

so it didn't distort the paper color too
mad<00:05:55.889> too<00:05:56.370> much<00:05:56.550> it<00:05:57.180> looks<00:05:57.330> really<00:05:57.599> nice<00:05:57.720> and<00:05:58.050> it

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
and I couldn't figure out how to

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.730 
and I couldn't figure out how to
incorporate<00:07:21.639> it<00:07:22.210> inside<00:07:22.719> the<00:07:23.020> mini<00:07:23.259> it<00:07:23.529> didn't

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740 
incorporate it inside the mini it didn't

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.769 
incorporate it inside the mini it didn't
quite<00:07:23.830> fit<00:07:23.919> on<00:07:24.279> the<00:07:24.370> pages<00:07:24.789> and<00:07:25.000> so<00:07:25.569> I<00:07:25.629> thought

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:25.779 
quite fit on the pages and so I thought

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.149

I'd<00:07:25.960> just<00:07:26.050> go<00:07:26.199> ahead<00:07:26.349> and<00:07:26.439> use<00:07:26.529> it<00:07:26.560> and<00:07:26.800> put<00:07:27.069> it

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:27.159 
I'd just go ahead and use it and put it

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:30.779 
I'd just go ahead and use it and put it
on<00:07:27.219> the<00:07:27.370> back<00:07:28.060> page<00:07:28.330> so<00:07:28.750> so<00:07:29.589> that's<00:07:29.889> my<00:07:30.159> last

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789 
on the back page so so that's my last

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:33.659 
on the back page so so that's my last
page<00:07:31.240> so<00:07:31.779> there's<00:07:32.319> my<00:07:32.529> mini<00:07:32.800> for<00:07:33.099> my<00:07:33.219> sister
