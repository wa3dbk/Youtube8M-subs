all the way that's an interesting

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.789 
all the way that's an interesting
question<00:02:39.939> because<00:02:40.239> not<00:02:41.230> just<00:02:41.260> been<00:02:41.560> telling

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
question because not just been telling

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.199 
question because not just been telling
me<00:02:41.859> a<00:02:41.890> little<00:02:41.980> bit<00:02:42.129> about<00:02:42.219> telepathy<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.090> I'm

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
me a little bit about telepathy and I'm

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.309 
me a little bit about telepathy and I'm
gonna<00:02:43.359> have<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.540> do<00:02:43.629> some<00:02:43.780> research<00:02:43.900> before<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
gonna have to do some research before I

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.179 
gonna have to do some research before I
get<00:02:44.470> back<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.769> on<00:02:44.799> that<00:02:44.890> one<00:02:47.189> Instagram

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
get back to you on that one Instagram

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.429 
get back to you on that one Instagram
and<00:02:48.670> then<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.239> uploads<00:02:49.629> on<00:02:49.780> Twitter<00:02:50.019> anyway<00:02:50.379> so

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
and then it uploads on Twitter anyway so

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.069 
and then it uploads on Twitter anyway so
I<00:02:50.650> guess<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.129> defeats<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.819> question<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:53.019> it

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
I guess that defeats the question but it

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.990 
I guess that defeats the question but it
