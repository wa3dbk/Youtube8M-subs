00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.480
 it's a normal day 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.869
 the day off 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.470
 but if you pay attention 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.650
 happen even on normal days without doing special things so berger per 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.730
 is about to do everything on a world trip suddenly let go hunting 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.340
 among other things, so on energy when each other in good step 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.290
 The lucky ones meet at Rotterdam Central at four o'clock 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.320
 Investors took profits except neighbors to say everything that needs to be said 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.680
 to become 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 but 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.930
 so lay 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.750
 how can you see the head 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.750
 although he himself might work better with it 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.360
 in such a broken overhead line 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.270
 the direct gigantic domino effect as a result 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.280
 through the rail network of the entire Netherlands 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.010
 comes under pressure in one fell swoop 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.760
 so it is an ordinary day 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.760
 suddenly a very special one 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 radio monte carlo 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.340
 while there normally 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.150
 as soon as this director controls the national administration 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.340
 lbc the registration 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.090
 when you come from 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.870
 all train traffic is monitored here 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.310
 so we will certainly not let this go 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.790
 mood in train traffic it will take ten minutes to inventory everything 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.240
 Before they invest the region all train traffic to and from Utrecht class 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.170
 it is important that things get back on track as quickly as possible and get a lot more 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.689
 Armenteros the net then one of the trains that is now standing still 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.529
 but it is not the only one with a problem 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.619
 he had his son in my room demanding series 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.169
 it's not the first time that happens counts 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.949
 but this time 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.529
 he puts his son in love or train 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:27.689
 terrain 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.349
 only from 7 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.349
 However, it has more confidence in the NS stated in its ex 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.359
 in the meantime, the occr is being consulted diligently with a few tips 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.919
 only 61 prorail and everywhere 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.639
 also supports prorail indicates that something goes wrong a forecast how long it will last 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.819
 will last for this reason refuse cadence the trains should be as soon as possible 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.439
 be restored 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.750
 monitor the customer 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.590
 meanwhile, reminds everyone that Lady Gaga will have a big concert tonight 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.079
 gives in ahoy 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.109
 so not only should the problems be solved 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.189
 remain the successor to the job 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.539
 although various 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.259
 we decided to tailor the utrecht 0 3 scenario 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.959
 utrecht will be relieved in time 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.889
 from and to the city itself will mainly be shuttled 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.709
 also like a lot of sandra 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.639
 divide and rule 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.379
 the neighborhood is already wrong 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.339
 assumes the personal responsibility of a certain tradition 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:29.749
 msc is 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:31.929
 regional government and its 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:36.479
 ferwerda in the netherlands five hours with divide and rule by the 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.809
 different centers to jointly process the best solution 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.669
 everyone gets their own contribution 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.669
 I have to make a success anyway 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:51.879
 a few chevy the two airbags orphaned he put the plan back on in turn 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.059
 his colleagues 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.329
 responsible for the implementation of the plans on this monitor 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.379
 in the EFSF 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.769
 the figures are the result 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.879
 psv eindhoven 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.949
 put the luggage in Utrecht 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.719
 and be able to handle the extra influx of passengers 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.239
 jet airways in Amsterdam have to make a difficult decision 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.469
 given the traffic flow 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.239
 keep it going 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.599
 Ultimately, the intercity from Alkmaar to Amsterdam was central to 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.069
 in that case some local politics 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.879
 I hope they get very solid 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.879
 much more sony by which destination can reach 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.689
 there will be consultations again in two hours 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.729
 to see what the state of affairs is meanwhile becomes blackbird with a minute 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.729
 restless 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.789
 but how apple sometimes looks like monday 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.900
 it can always be even worse 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.830
 This is how machinist Marcel just found a seat the mechanic of 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.710
 the entrance to the site option screens 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.449
 the air pressure runs out 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.889
 making marcel ben now with his train also a route corner of holland 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.699
 Rotterdam trend 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.250
 Even more works from thermal in Rotterdam were agreed 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.159
 that the engineer only gets ten minutes to keep the problem at bay 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.090
 meanwhile make the employee account for the equipment 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.900
 to be on the safe side though, no complaining anyway 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.919
 if sandra ask if everything is there despite the pressure 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.669
 still under control 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.849
 because that is it 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.210
 the stall's son is present in that stranded train 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:31.939
 coincidence 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:35.879
 but we are a small country and everything that happens in one place influences 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:37.309
 the other 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:39.680
 in the meantime the world is moving 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.999
 she is against racer 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:46.050
 this he can not say much more about the situation tielt sent 

00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:47.110
 became 6 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.110
 so on this extraordinary day is not everything 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.500
 at the fair in utrecht 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.680
 also gets veronica 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.020
 who is responsible for the staff 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.259
 a phone call that he minded 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.400
 at the collision involving the moped rider 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.540
 cheerfulness itself worked on the train 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.979
 they did being made characters 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.719
 anyway immediately sought a daycare replacement 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.039
 the driver a conductor 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.219
 difficult for the church to figure out another national situation 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.610
 where the available drivers are now 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.409
 in fact only those who are now on the trains know exactly 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:20.719
 place 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:24.089
 put the game lead in the shoes 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.659
 actually should have had a break 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.719
 she puts a corner of critical situations 9 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:33.409
 she thinks he would, but she really feels good to get rid of it 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:37.069
 h meanwhile another bank is starting 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.710
 go ahead negotiate this is the time to act I have ever 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.379
 said the later interrogations that is disappointing 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.719
 marcel brands the employee is in good shape 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:53.779
 that the fault is not full of prince 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.930
 at the track section will continue to vote the bottleneck turnouts that are through 

00:06:57.929 --> 00:06:59.160
 colleagues 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.229
 let us know that we already have a replacement train ready 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.119
 to make the passengers better 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:08.119
 meanwhile dannielle tries to comfort the boy 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.869
 Fortunately 

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:12.949
 because his father is going to be very sorry 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.569
 so he is not where the train is in fact quickly on the spot 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.270
 whom they called yesterday 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.900
 it's an all explained everyone has struggled when he can again 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.029
 to drive 

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:27.029
 to go to such a house everything goes according to plan again 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:30.520
 it's too late now 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.999
 there are trains and delays 

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.999
 unfortunately not necessary 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.610
 end well 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.610
 seen already 

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:46.580
 unfortunately 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.409
 it's too late 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:51.409
 what is that 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.719
 if not real enthusiasts 

00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:58.429
 and so becomes an ordinary day 

00:07:58.429 --> 00:08:00.129
 very ordinary people 

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:02.159
 not just for special day 

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:04.419
 very special 

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:06.119
 lucio hard work 

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.809
 revolve around everything in this small country
