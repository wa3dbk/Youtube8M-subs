00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.580
 Ten years ago, I continued or heard of Weekend, or I know one 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.370
 that has 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.760
 the book appeared the only thing that bothers the customer and had a subtitle 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.799
 Toddler he puts marketing 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.619
 also played for me 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.309
 to talk to one but no more 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.150
 where he directed more Batista said Kleibrink replaced marketing was over 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.929
 with funny 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.529
 as then, the marketing department is best at pinning people up 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.320
 in sales 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.110
 so that finally learns what's really going on outside Pak 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.949
 graduation 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.710
 since ever a Bentley talked 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.960
 Everything looks a little different ten years later 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.830
 But we are reporting a few things 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.039
 from what's here 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.310
 have also implemented with the companies 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.180
 and have made the market leader one of them 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.069
 Customer satisfaction one of the fuel rods of the past decade 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.150
 I've been saying Photo Frey for a long time because I wanted her 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.120
 Father Morgana of the nineties 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.170
 and millions 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.749
 were given away because of that 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.030
 why I clientele again a mirage 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.560
 A satisfied customer reports about what happened in the past 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.540
 knows 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.350
 they are there to fulfill 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.670
 and not happening 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.930
 That's exactly what the father was 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.930
 and suddenly 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.950
 are all a bit angry 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.630
 the provider says I've done everything he wanted 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.140
 very nice under contact 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.510
 what does not happen? 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.850
 they have to go on two steps 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.010
 It can even be extremely dangerous for customer satisfaction 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.500
 This has never been done before, but that is the first step 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.530
 but now advanced sausage which must go two steps further 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.320
 F-youth is no longer about it and Ubuntu was to make peace 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.560
 Theft to the delight their customers one of the ferries ladies and gentlemen 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.440
 that is our job satisfactory is boring but you still have one 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.460
 Go further 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.070
 The tour is about how to amaze their customers - this is the only chance 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 Welcome to the Deep negative Jebril fast 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.840
 and were blown around the ears from left and right and amazed again 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.170
 goes very fast 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.340
 According to one BOM make the coloring underneath and as a behavior at all 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.310
 as well as very fast 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.719
 in a positive sense 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.650
 how amazing we are to our customers 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.120
 and believe me "That's fast in Germany 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.440
 who of them has recently been a great goal in Hamburg 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.399
 work their displeasure Stuttgart clear 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.399
 Hopsten had missed so loud 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.789
 another question the Wikipedians had had 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.849
 but nevertheless the registered one did not announce here how much humans at it 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.379
 told about it 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.379
 at the gates of the euro 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:32.460
 with the losers 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.389
 a question 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.699
 a panda 2 Â» 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.779
 when they met their life partner's life partner 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.779
 how many people have told me about it 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:53.969
 there it was Barbara 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.969
 one said no end 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:58.669
 dat b 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.669
 Valves match up with one just fine 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.759
 I was one of very similar to being clearer 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.360
 because that was accused also without event 800 participants 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.869
 at a very close to a microphone said Heinen 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:21.119
 I was the naive one who goes to him and says why not 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.119
 I let then I was married 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:32.559
 now have what action needed again 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:34.620
 I put the rest in front of the door 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.479
 Shaun Deeb 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.659
 Of course, it does not baffles people 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.549
 purely tells Janis 10 20 30 40 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.109
 this one could master 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.309
 So far, they have brought this into this world 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:50.379
 Valentes Rehnert said 3 a baffled whopping 10 20 13 40 and me 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.059
 would like the book city to have pressure that they have an automatic 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.729
 The attraction is that people come to them by themselves and it works 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:57.699
 easy 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.610
 Driving bans and not even yourself 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.880
 intimately counterpart in their distress come in and agree only three seconds 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.650
 Do not double Chen before the floor 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.129
 but I know how the culture has that judgment 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.769
 dapd i love that 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.129
 yes i love you now old culprit 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.349
 and now at a time when arrived in Berlin there keep up 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.509
 below the evening I arrive at Otto Warburg Pincus Stress gave from France 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.779
 submitted 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.979
 He makes the door go to the bottom 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.979
 and said good evening Mr. glad 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.229
 often called a meter high so gone again puts 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.860
 somehow slowly offered to switch the joy but your zusammenpacken 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.210
 Per cent "Who knows me knows that I am still in the picture 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.520
 So he does not like that 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.949
 So when I went in and damned 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.749
 Google Buzz said Aigner 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.889
 and I had a name badge here then you also have approx 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.650
 At the airport one also said that he was very happy 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.530
 Fabian Bender to be the older brother Kenny announced in the country is the 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.069
 Rapper has 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.639
 Wallauer Lasers theme 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:01.900
 Backwater on 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.210
 if he is still a topic of bafflement 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.100
 because i'm at the desk i'm sorry i'm severely punished i need to go back 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.569
 I have to get back in questions the story needs to be in the year 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.930
 How did you know which one of the two days I liked? 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.710
 just do not sell and wait everywhere now 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.449
 and he simply said first 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.970
 I went there at half-hourly pace the dead point mentioned 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.800
 who is not in the hotel but is registered 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.560
 Albert has always paid less for the names, secondly he says 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.630
 I got her suitcase behind the house 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.830
 and on the suitcase is in the name 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.139
 Difference looking forward to 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.780
 and I'm done with the event that reports the association holds Nani 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.509
 amazement 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.150
 So sometimes there is a star 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.590
 sometimes it is a bit harder to take the bed one has 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.360
 Idea with people if they are positively surprised they will always only 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.270
 One thing in the head are the politics that talk about and that grow exactly 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.750
 probably want to grow there because in the future just think about it 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.430
 the animals could please amaze and when the out 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.580
 astounded customers then also make baffled partners 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.310
 then he will be right where we can say in the future a lot of money 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.340
 is to earn 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.229
 with Jonas headed as a nationwide 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:10.400
 not in this form to Porsche
