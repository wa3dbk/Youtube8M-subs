got this rigid 345 flaring tool kit then
I<00:00:41.040> started<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.370> enjoy<00:00:41.550> making<00:00:41.879> brake<00:00:42.270> lines

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809

three<00:00:46.980> different<00:00:47.070> cars<00:00:47.489> full<00:00:48.030> systems<00:00:48.539> with

three different cars full systems with
this<00:00:48.870> tool<00:00:49.309> still<00:00:50.309> works<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:50.789> well<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
this tool still works as well as of

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.560 
this tool still works as well as of
doing<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.480> got<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.280> I<00:00:53.539> really<00:00:54.539> think

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
doing when I got it and I really think

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.670 
doing when I got it and I really think
it's<00:00:54.750> worth<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.899> money<00:00:55.579> this<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> got<00:00:57.000> for

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's worth the money this one I got for

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.150 
it's worth the money this one I got for
about<00:00:58.680> seventy<00:00:59.309> five<00:00:59.460> eighty<00:01:00.329> dollars

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
tool itself and the little buttons for

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.260 
tool itself and the little buttons for
producing<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> flares<00:01:16.939> give<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> quick

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
producing the flares give you a quick

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.200 
producing the flares give you a quick
demonstration<00:01:18.479> how<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> works

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
demonstration how it works

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.960 
demonstration how it works
take<00:01:21.210> your<00:01:21.360> length<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.659> tube<00:01:22.729> slide<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> into

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
take your length of tube slide it into

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.140 
take your length of tube slide it into
the<00:01:24.119> appropriate<00:01:24.869> hole<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> clamp<00:01:26.759> here

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.990 

we<00:01:31.150> place<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:32.220> by<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.280> height<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.700> button

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
we place it by the height of the button

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.650 
we place it by the height of the button
on<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:35.190> 3/16<00:01:36.190> which<00:01:36.340> just<00:01:36.490> happens<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.760> be<00:01:36.820> you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
on the 3/16 which just happens to be you

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.330 
on the 3/16 which just happens to be you
use<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.990> lower<00:01:38.170> step<00:01:38.560> down<00:01:38.770> at<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.070> button

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
use the lower step down at the button

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.680 
use the lower step down at the button
now<00:01:39.640> if<00:01:39.730> you<00:01:39.790> can<00:01:39.910> see<00:01:40.120> that<00:01:40.300> particularly

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
now if you can see that particularly

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:52.200 
now if you can see that particularly
well<00:01:44.490> put<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.880> vise<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:51.060> always<00:01:52.060> try

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
well put this in the vise I always try

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.340 
well put this in the vise I always try
to<00:01:52.240> use<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.510> vise<00:01:52.660> with<00:01:52.690> this<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:53.080> think<00:01:53.140> that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
to use the vise with this I think that

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.140 
to use the vise with this I think that
you<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.710> get<00:01:53.860> away<00:01:53.979> with<00:01:54.430> just<00:01:54.460> using<00:01:54.910> the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
you can get away with just using the

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.090 
you can get away with just using the
clamp<00:01:55.420> on<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.680> tool<00:01:56.890> but<00:01:57.690> it's<00:01:58.690> nice<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.100> have

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
clamp on the tool but it's nice to have

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.890 
clamp on the tool but it's nice to have
the<00:02:00.250> extra<00:02:00.280> hand<00:02:00.760> if<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.150> voice<00:02:01.330> essentially

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
the extra hand if the voice essentially

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:17.360 
the extra hand if the voice essentially
provides<00:02:13.200> inside<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.620> small<00:02:15.520> comb<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.360> you

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
provides inside is a small comb that you

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
provides inside is a small comb that you
lightly<00:02:18.370> tighten<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:19.120> locate<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.140> then

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
lightly tighten to locate this and then

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.290 
lightly tighten to locate this and then
you've<00:02:23.260> lined<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.770> this<00:02:23.950> clamp<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.700> fully<00:02:25.000> lock

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
you've lined in this clamp to fully lock

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.130 
you've lined in this clamp to fully lock
down<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.660> just<00:02:31.720> start<00:02:32.050> to

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
down like that and you just start to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.090 
down like that and you just start to
turn<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.489> will<00:02:33.640> turn<00:02:33.790> fairly<00:02:34.299> easily

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
turn and this will turn fairly easily

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:44.600 
turn and this will turn fairly easily
until<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.720> bottoms<00:02:37.720> up<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:41.190> which<00:02:42.190> point<00:02:42.430> stops

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
until it bottoms up to which point stops

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.030 
until it bottoms up to which point stops
right<00:02:45.610> back<00:02:45.850> up

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
right back up

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.110 
right back up
-<00:02:48.849> cleaners<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.450> button<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:50.849> have<00:02:51.849> very<00:02:52.030> small

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
- cleaners the button I have very small

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.479 
- cleaners the button I have very small
finger<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:52.959> find<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.319> easier<00:02:53.709> normal

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
finger so I find this easier normal

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.030 
finger so I find this easier normal
people<00:02:55.209> were<00:02:55.269> doing<00:02:55.569> just<00:02:56.439> poke<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.860> out

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
people were doing just poke that out

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.729 
people were doing just poke that out
with<00:02:57.159> your<00:02:57.189> finger<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.349> sense<00:02:59.590> this
