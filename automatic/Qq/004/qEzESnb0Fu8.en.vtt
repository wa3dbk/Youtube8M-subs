now let's step back and look at that in

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.690 
now let's step back and look at that in
a<00:00:41.969> bit<00:00:42.120> more<00:00:42.270> detail<00:00:42.950> your<00:00:43.950> tax<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.550> much

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
side of the boat remember the faster you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.390 
push the tiller over the faster the tack
so<00:01:18.750> slow<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.650> give<00:01:19.799> yourself<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.250> much

out to keep the boat balanced remember

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.499 
out to keep the boat balanced remember
to<00:01:46.710> tuck<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.159> foot<00:01:47.520> under<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.970> foot<00:01:48.210> strap

to tuck your foot under the foot strap

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.060 
to tuck your foot under the foot strap
as<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.320> don't<00:01:49.530> want<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.799> fall<00:01:49.950> overboard

as you don't want to fall overboard
now<00:01:52.790> let's<00:01:53.510> look<00:01:53.630> at<00:01:53.780> tacking<00:01:54.140> from<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.350> crews

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
now let's look at tacking from the crews

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.830 
now let's look at tacking from the crews
point<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:54.979> view<00:01:55.159> as<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:56.120> boat<00:01:56.270> starts<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.690> turn

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
point of view as the boat starts to turn

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.600 
point of view as the boat starts to turn
into<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.260> wind<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.860> crew<00:01:58.100> begins<00:01:58.250> moving

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
into the wind the crew begins moving
