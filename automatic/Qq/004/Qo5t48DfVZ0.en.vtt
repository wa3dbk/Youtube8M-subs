without the need to go online a big

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.220 
without the need to go online a big
consequence<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.180> now<00:00:21.600> mods<00:00:21.960> are

is<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> really<00:00:27.000> great<00:00:27.119> news<00:00:27.390> considering<00:00:27.900> how

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
is a really great news considering how

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.650 
is a really great news considering how
many<00:00:28.500> times<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.010> told<00:00:29.519> us<00:00:29.730> no<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.300> not

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
many times a told us no it's not

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
many times a told us no it's not
possible<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.710> developers<00:00:32.279> who<00:00:32.489> tell<00:00:32.669> us<00:00:32.700> how

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
possible the developers who tell us how

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.170 
possible the developers who tell us how
hard<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.780> would<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.050> how<00:00:34.649> almost<00:00:35.180> impossible

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
hard it would be how almost impossible

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840 
hard it would be how almost impossible
impractical<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.100> would<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.520> for

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
impractical and so on it would be for

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
impractical and so on it would be for
them<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.210> actually<00:00:39.450> make<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.050> offline<00:00:40.379> but

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
them to actually make it offline but

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.639 
them to actually make it offline but
