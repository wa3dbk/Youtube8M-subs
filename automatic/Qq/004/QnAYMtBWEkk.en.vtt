Effects<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.359> flash<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.460> we've<00:00:26.609> got<00:00:26.640> here

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
Effects and flash so what we've got here

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.109 
Effects and flash so what we've got here
is<00:00:27.240> wave<00:00:27.599> crashing<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> beach<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.550> not<00:00:29.910> one

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
is wave crashing on a beach it's not one

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.110 
is wave crashing on a beach it's not one
that<00:00:30.269> I've<00:00:30.390> developed<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.260> completion<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that I've developed to completion but it

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.910 
that I've developed to completion but it
is<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.660> nice<00:00:33.780> effect<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.559> I've<00:00:34.649> worked

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
is a really nice effect that I've worked

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979 
is a really nice effect that I've worked
out<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.430> I'm<00:00:35.640> hoping<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.210> use<00:00:36.390> at<00:00:36.570> some<00:00:36.719> point

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
out and I'm hoping to use at some point

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380 
out and I'm hoping to use at some point
one<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.290> my<00:00:37.440> animations<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.790> let's<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.180> play

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
one of my animations so let's just play

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.740 
one of my animations so let's just play
it<00:00:39.450> through<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.989> After<00:00:40.350> Effects<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:41.480> should<00:00:42.480> say

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it through in After Effects I should say

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.630 
it through in After Effects I should say
at<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.020> point<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.530> you've<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:44.010> watched<00:00:44.340> my

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
at this point if you've not watched my

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.510 
at this point if you've not watched my
how<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> use<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> wave<00:00:45.960> walk<00:00:46.200> tool<00:00:46.520> tutorial

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
how to use the wave walk tool tutorial

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.979 
how to use the wave walk tool tutorial
please<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.629> check<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.930> out

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
please do go and check that out

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
please do go and check that out
otherwise<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> make<00:00:50.520> any

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
otherwise this is not going to make any

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.799 
otherwise this is not going to make any
sense<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.989> let's<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.890> move<00:00:53.160> through<00:00:53.809> what

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
sense so let's just move through what

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
sense so let's just move through what
we've<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.590> nice<00:00:56.010> kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.370> wave

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
we've got is this nice kind of wave

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.510 
we've got is this nice kind of wave
squarely<00:00:57.210> getting<00:00:57.570> thinner<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:59.219> kind

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
squarely getting thinner and then kind

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.970 
squarely getting thinner and then kind
of<00:00:59.550> breaking<00:01:00.000> apart<00:01:00.170> as<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.350> moves<00:01:01.379> across<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
of breaking apart as it moves across the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.010 
of breaking apart as it moves across the
screen<00:01:02.539> kind<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.860> crashes<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.040> beach<00:01:06.020> so

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
screen kind of crashes on the beach so

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
screen kind of crashes on the beach so
if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> imagine<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.799> blue<00:01:08.220> area<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:08.760> was

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
if you imagine this blue area here was

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.800 
if you imagine this blue area here was
actually<00:01:09.720> Beach<00:01:10.710> colored<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.450> nice<00:01:12.450> kind<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
actually Beach colored a nice kind of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.130 
actually Beach colored a nice kind of
sand<00:01:13.200> color<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:14.460> area<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.180> would<00:01:15.780> still<00:01:16.020> be

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
sand color this area here would still be

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.820 
sand color this area here would still be
blue<00:01:17.509> it's<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.020> fact<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.530> get

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
blue it's kind of in fact that you get

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.539 
blue it's kind of in fact that you get
where<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.850> wave<00:01:21.860> crashes<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.040> beach<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
where a wave crashes on the beach and

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.149 
where a wave crashes on the beach and
gradually<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> foam<00:01:24.390> dissipates<00:01:25.259> before<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
gradually the foam dissipates before the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.730 
gradually the foam dissipates before the
wave<00:01:26.340> moves<00:01:27.150> back<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.780> sea<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> whole

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
wave moves back out to sea and the whole

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.710 
wave moves back out to sea and the whole
process<00:01:29.270> starts<00:01:30.270> again<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:33.030> how<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.689> done

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
process starts again so how have I done

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.399 
process starts again so how have I done
this<00:01:34.079> let's<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> look<00:01:35.750> what<00:01:36.750> we've<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:37.140> is

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
this let's take a look what we've got is

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.899 
this let's take a look what we've got is
a<00:01:37.470> pre<00:01:38.130> comp<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.750> our<00:01:39.900> main<00:01:40.110> composition

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
a pre comp here in our main composition

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.410 
a pre comp here in our main composition
so<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.299> pre<00:01:42.570> comp<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> rename<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
so this pre comp I'm going to rename it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.490 
so this pre comp I'm going to rename it
we<00:01:45.649> war<00:01:46.880> let's<00:01:47.880> make<00:01:48.119> life<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:49.020> simple

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
we war let's make life more simple

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.920 
we war let's make life more simple
now<00:01:50.070> main<00:01:50.369> comp<00:01:50.729> I'm<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> press<00:01:51.540> Enter

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
now main comp I'm going to press Enter

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.389 
now main comp I'm going to press Enter
and<00:01:52.200> call<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.740> main<00:01:53.579> comp<00:01:54.020> there<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.110> go<00:01:55.399> so

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and call it main comp there we go so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.260 
and call it main comp there we go so
inside<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.180> wave<00:01:57.540> warp<00:01:57.899> pre<00:01:58.500> comp<00:01:59.119> if<00:02:00.119> I

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
inside this wave warp pre comp if I

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
inside this wave warp pre comp if I
double<00:02:00.570> click<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.770> we've<00:02:01.979> got<00:02:02.340> is

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
double click on it what we've got is

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.429 
double click on it what we've got is
this<00:02:04.290> kind<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:05.540> really<00:02:06.540> interesting<00:02:07.200> bit<00:02:07.350> of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
this kind of really interesting bit of

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.640 
this kind of really interesting bit of
animation<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:08.599> we've<00:02:09.599> got<00:02:09.750> shape<00:02:10.080> layer

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.059 

and<00:02:12.709> if<00:02:12.829> we<00:02:12.950> turn<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.549> wave<00:02:13.730> walk<00:02:13.939> effect<00:02:14.390> off

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
and if we turn the wave walk effect off

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.580 
and if we turn the wave walk effect off
what<00:02:16.069> we've<00:02:16.220> got<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:17.629> a<00:02:17.689> shape<00:02:18.049> layer<00:02:18.290> that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
what we've got is a shape layer that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.309 
what we've got is a shape layer that
gradually<00:02:19.189> gets<00:02:19.819> thinner<00:02:20.150> it's<00:02:20.989> just<00:02:21.200> a

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
gradually gets thinner it's just a

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.280 
gradually gets thinner it's just a
rectangle<00:02:22.040> with<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> white<00:02:22.730> fill<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.900> gradually

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
rectangle with a white fill it gradually

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.960 
rectangle with a white fill it gradually
gets<00:02:24.620> super<00:02:25.250> thin<00:02:25.549> like<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:27.610> what<00:02:28.610> I've<00:02:28.730> done

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
gets super thin like so what I've done

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.869 
gets super thin like so what I've done
is<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.569> wave<00:02:30.019> what<00:02:30.260> effect<00:02:30.829> on<00:02:31.159> top<00:02:31.579> of<00:02:31.730> that

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
is a wave what effect on top of that

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.349 
is a wave what effect on top of that
using<00:02:32.540> smooth<00:02:33.019> noise<00:02:33.760> smooth<00:02:34.760> noise<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.239> the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
using smooth noise smooth noise is the

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.030 
using smooth noise smooth noise is the
one<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.629> go<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:36.049> if<00:02:36.230> you're<00:02:36.379> wanting<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.859> much

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
one to go for if you're wanting a much

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.839 
one to go for if you're wanting a much
more<00:02:37.280> natural<00:02:37.970> effect<00:02:38.569> of<00:02:39.099> kind<00:02:40.099> of<00:02:40.189> random

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
more natural effect of kind of random

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.339 
more natural effect of kind of random
smooth<00:02:42.069> flowing<00:02:43.069> curves<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.989> might<00:02:45.230> be

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
smooth flowing curves you might be

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.890 
smooth flowing curves you might be
wondering<00:02:45.500> why<00:02:45.859> it's<00:02:46.069> so<00:02:46.280> pixelated<00:02:46.900> that's

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
wondering why it's so pixelated that's

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.800 
wondering why it's so pixelated that's
because<00:02:48.319> when<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.069> ramp<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.819> wave<00:02:50.510> height

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
because when you ramp the wave height

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.129 
because when you ramp the wave height
and<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.079> wave<00:02:51.139> width<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:51.909> values<00:02:52.909> like<00:02:53.139> two

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
and the wave width up to values like two

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.559 
and the wave width up to values like two
thousand<00:02:54.650> nine<00:02:55.099> hundred<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.940> ninety-three

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
thousand nine hundred and ninety-three

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.819 
thousand nine hundred and ninety-three
in<00:02:57.109> height<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:59.200> 1545<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.409> width

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
in height and 1545 in width

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.490 
in height and 1545 in width
it<00:03:01.819> starts<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.569> pixelate<00:03:03.049> this<00:03:03.349> is

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
it starts to pixelate this is

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.509 
it starts to pixelate this is
essentially<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:05.049> bitmap<00:03:06.049> effect<00:03:06.769> that's<00:03:07.280> being

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
essentially a bitmap effect that's being

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.699 
essentially a bitmap effect that's being
applied<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.849> a<00:03:08.060> vector<00:03:08.359> layer<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.379> that's<00:03:09.530> why

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
applied to a vector layer so that's why

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.259 
applied to a vector layer so that's why
you<00:03:09.769> get<00:03:10.040> these<00:03:10.430> kind<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.730> very<00:03:10.879> blocky

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
you get these kind of very blocky

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.509 
you get these kind of very blocky
results<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.889> your<00:03:13.370> responsibility

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
results and it's your responsibility

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.089 
results and it's your responsibility
when<00:03:14.389> you<00:03:14.599> trace<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:15.049> in<00:03:15.139> flash<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.829> kind<00:03:16.040> of

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
when you trace it in flash to kind of

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.069 
when you trace it in flash to kind of
round<00:03:16.370> those<00:03:16.579> out<00:03:16.819> make<00:03:17.449> the<00:03:17.569> look<00:03:17.780> or

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
round those out make the look or

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:18.879 
round those out make the look or
interesting

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
interesting

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.939 
interesting
so<00:03:19.849> all<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.269> pre<00:03:20.569> comp<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:21.019> is<00:03:21.260> like<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.709> said

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
so all this pre comp is is like I said

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.369 
so all this pre comp is is like I said
it's<00:03:22.220> that<00:03:22.549> fill<00:03:22.970> gradually<00:03:23.540> getting<00:03:23.720> smaller

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
it's that fill gradually getting smaller

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.580 
it's that fill gradually getting smaller
and<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:26.090> wave<00:03:26.389> warp<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.900> smooth<00:03:27.260> noise

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
and this wave warp of smooth noise

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.689 
and this wave warp of smooth noise
passing<00:03:28.549> through<00:03:28.849> it<00:03:30.310> what<00:03:31.310> I've<00:03:31.400> done<00:03:31.519> is

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:31.699 
passing through it what I've done is

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.270 
passing through it what I've done is
I've<00:03:31.819> posterized<00:03:32.389> time<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:33.049> twelve<00:03:33.739> frames<00:03:34.099> a

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
I've posterized time to twelve frames a

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.339 
I've posterized time to twelve frames a
second<00:03:34.730> because<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.419> is<00:03:35.599> quite<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.840> complex

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
second because this is quite a complex

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.640 
second because this is quite a complex
bit<00:03:36.769> smooth<00:03:37.639> flowing<00:03:38.060> animation<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.930> felt<00:03:39.530> that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
bit smooth flowing animation I felt that

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.339 
bit smooth flowing animation I felt that
it<00:03:39.799> needed<00:03:40.040> 12<00:03:40.760> frames<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.209> second<00:03:41.599> but<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.169> can

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
it needed 12 frames a second but you can

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.430 
it needed 12 frames a second but you can
play<00:03:42.590> about<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:43.239> make<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.479> more<00:03:44.720> or<00:03:44.930> less<00:03:45.079> if

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
play about and make it more or less if

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.780 
play about and make it more or less if
you<00:03:45.590> like<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:47.150> direction<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.930> minus<00:03:48.290> three<00:03:48.790> so

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
you like the direction is minus three so

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.379 
you like the direction is minus three so
it's<00:03:50.000> just<00:03:50.180> giving<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.659> slight<00:03:51.790> slant<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:53.269> the

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
it's just giving a slight slant to the

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.819 
it's just giving a slight slant to the
animation<00:03:53.900> if<00:03:54.139> I<00:03:54.290> jog<00:03:55.010> it<00:03:55.159> round<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.669> can<00:03:55.790> see

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
animation if I jog it round you can see

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.020 
animation if I jog it round you can see
that<00:03:57.829> you<00:03:57.919> get<00:03:58.069> different<00:03:58.280> results<00:03:58.489> depending

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
that you get different results depending

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.439 
that you get different results depending
on<00:03:59.449> what<00:03:59.900> direction<00:04:00.079> you<00:04:00.590> use<00:04:00.919> the<00:04:01.790> wave<00:04:02.000> speed

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
on what direction you use the wave speed

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:07.420 
on what direction you use the wave speed
is<00:04:02.690> really<00:04:03.319> slow<00:04:03.650> it's<00:04:04.250> minus<00:04:05.560> 0.1<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.280> it's

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
is really slow it's minus 0.1 so it's

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.289 
is really slow it's minus 0.1 so it's
traveling<00:04:07.879> to<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.209> left<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:09.639> point<00:04:10.639> one<00:04:11.000> is

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
traveling to the left and point one is

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.460 
traveling to the left and point one is
really<00:04:12.019> quite<00:04:12.260> slow<00:04:12.560> but<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:14.290> but<00:04:15.290> that's

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
really quite slow but the but that's

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.080 
really quite slow but the but that's
appropriate<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.190> this<00:04:16.310> animation<00:04:16.909> because

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
appropriate to this animation because

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.500 
appropriate to this animation because
these<00:04:18.049> types<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.799> waves<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.849> crashing<00:04:20.329> on<00:04:20.419> the

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
these types of waves of crashing on the

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.350 
these types of waves of crashing on the
beach<00:04:20.539> are<00:04:20.930> quite<00:04:21.320> slow

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
beach are quite slow

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.719 
beach are quite slow
we've<00:04:23.360> got<00:04:23.599> pinning<00:04:24.020> all<00:04:24.229> edges<00:04:24.800> that's<00:04:25.490> just

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
we've got pinning all edges that's just

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:26.590 
we've got pinning all edges that's just
what<00:04:25.880> worked<00:04:26.120> up

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
what worked up

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.360 
what worked up
I<00:04:26.630> swear<00:04:26.870> I've<00:04:26.960> fiddled<00:04:27.110> around<00:04:27.320> with<00:04:27.590> it<00:04:27.800> and

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
I swear I've fiddled around with it and

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.340 
I swear I've fiddled around with it and
we've<00:04:28.520> got<00:04:28.640> no<00:04:28.880> phase<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.720> an<00:04:29.870> anti-aliasing

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
we've got no phase and an anti-aliasing

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.050 
we've got no phase and an anti-aliasing
quality<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.340> high<00:04:31.990> put<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.080> on<00:04:33.170> low<00:04:34.060> doesn't

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
quality of high put it on low doesn't

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.430 
quality of high put it on low doesn't
really<00:04:35.210> make<00:04:35.420> that<00:04:35.450> much<00:04:35.600> difference<00:04:35.720> but

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
really make that much difference but

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.670 
really make that much difference but
it's<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.830> girl<00:04:37.070> hi

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
it's the girl hi

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.340 
it's the girl hi
so<00:04:39.680> that's<00:04:40.100> this<00:04:40.370> wave<00:04:40.700> whop<00:04:41.000> pre-comp<00:04:41.720> so

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
so that's this wave whop pre-comp so

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.890 
so that's this wave whop pre-comp so
this<00:04:42.560> pre<00:04:42.800> comp<00:04:43.040> has<00:04:43.250> that<00:04:43.630> shape<00:04:44.630> layer

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
this pre comp has that shape layer

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.820 
this pre comp has that shape layer
getting<00:04:45.530> smaller<00:04:45.970> much<00:04:46.970> thinner<00:04:47.300> like<00:04:47.540> that

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
getting smaller much thinner like that

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.620 
getting smaller much thinner like that
then<00:04:48.830> in<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.010> main<00:04:49.280> composition<00:04:49.730> I've<00:04:50.270> used

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
then in the main composition I've used

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.700 
then in the main composition I've used
this<00:04:51.500> wave<00:04:52.310> wall<00:04:52.580> pre<00:04:53.030> comp<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:54.320> I've<00:04:54.470> put

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
this wave wall pre comp and I've put

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.570 
this wave wall pre comp and I've put
this<00:04:54.800> royal<00:04:55.190> blue<00:04:55.430> solid<00:04:56.210> underneath<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.580> so

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
this royal blue solid underneath it so

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
this royal blue solid underneath it so
that<00:04:58.790> it<00:04:58.910> looks<00:04:59.120> more<00:04:59.900> interesting<00:04:59.930> and<00:05:01.600> what

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
that it looks more interesting and what

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.200 
that it looks more interesting and what
I've<00:05:02.720> done<00:05:02.930> is<00:05:03.110> I've<00:05:03.260> made<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:03.740> layer<00:05:04.010> 3d<00:05:04.850> you

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
I've done is I've made this layer 3d you

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.600 
I've done is I've made this layer 3d you
can<00:05:05.420> see<00:05:05.570> this<00:05:05.750> little<00:05:05.960> box<00:05:06.710> here<00:05:07.040> shows<00:05:07.580> that

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
can see this little box here shows that

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.760 
can see this little box here shows that
this<00:05:07.820> layer<00:05:08.060> is<00:05:08.090> 3d<00:05:08.810> if<00:05:09.290> you<00:05:09.410> don't<00:05:09.590> know<00:05:09.710> how

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
this layer is 3d if you don't know how

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.950 
this layer is 3d if you don't know how
to<00:05:09.890> use<00:05:10.010> 3d<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.580> After<00:05:10.820> Effects<00:05:11.090> check<00:05:11.600> out<00:05:11.750> my

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
website extabit comm and I've just put

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.570 
website extabit comm and I've just put
it<00:05:17.540> a<00:05:17.720> kind<00:05:18.080> of<00:05:18.200> angle<00:05:18.710> if<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.220> look<00:05:19.400> at<00:05:19.490> the

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
it a kind of angle if you look at the

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.910 
it a kind of angle if you look at the
rotation<00:05:20.240> by<00:05:20.420> pressing<00:05:20.750> R<00:05:20.930> you<00:05:21.560> can<00:05:21.620> see<00:05:21.770> that

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
rotation by pressing R you can see that

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.030 
rotation by pressing R you can see that
the<00:05:21.980> X<00:05:22.160> rotation<00:05:22.460> is<00:05:22.850> minus<00:05:23.300> 51<00:05:23.780> so<00:05:24.740> I've<00:05:24.830> done

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
the X rotation is minus 51 so I've done

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.560 
the X rotation is minus 51 so I've done
that<00:05:25.100> so<00:05:25.520> that<00:05:25.700> we<00:05:25.790> get<00:05:25.940> kind<00:05:26.150> of<00:05:26.180> bird's<00:05:26.420> eye

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
that so that we get kind of bird's eye

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.900 
that so that we get kind of bird's eye
view<00:05:26.630> on<00:05:27.110> this<00:05:27.410> wave<00:05:27.710> as<00:05:28.190> if<00:05:28.370> we<00:05:28.520> were<00:05:28.610> standing

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
view on this wave as if we were standing

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.290 
view on this wave as if we were standing
on<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.270> beach<00:05:29.560> looking<00:05:30.560> down<00:05:30.800> at<00:05:31.010> it<00:05:31.160> so<00:05:32.030> apart

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
on the beach looking down at it so apart

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.480 
on the beach looking down at it so apart
from<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.510> rotation<00:05:33.230> we<00:05:33.890> look<00:05:34.070> at<00:05:34.220> the

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
from the rotation we look at the

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.970 
from the rotation we look at the
position<00:05:35.030> by<00:05:35.210> pressing<00:05:35.390> P<00:05:35.900> there<00:05:36.680> are<00:05:36.710> two

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
position by pressing P there are two

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.120 
position by pressing P there are two
keyframes<00:05:37.660> moving<00:05:38.660> this<00:05:38.810> wave<00:05:39.110> from<00:05:39.590> the

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
keyframes moving this wave from the

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.800 
keyframes moving this wave from the
right<00:05:40.370> hand<00:05:40.520> side<00:05:40.700> of<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:40.880> screen<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.390> the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
right hand side of the screen to the

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.590 
right hand side of the screen to the
left<00:05:42.040> very<00:05:43.040> very<00:05:43.370> slowly<00:05:43.730> so<00:05:44.090> as<00:05:45.050> it<00:05:45.560> thins<00:05:46.070> out

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
left very very slowly so as it thins out

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.170 
left very very slowly so as it thins out
it<00:05:47.600> moves<00:05:47.960> across<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.500> screen<00:05:49.060> so<00:05:50.060> it's

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
it moves across the screen so it's

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.960 
it moves across the screen so it's
really<00:05:50.390> simple<00:05:50.720> it's<00:05:51.380> a<00:05:51.440> nice<00:05:51.680> simple<00:05:52.070> bit<00:05:52.400> of

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
really simple it's a nice simple bit of

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.030 
really simple it's a nice simple bit of
animation<00:05:55.510> using<00:05:56.510> a<00:05:56.600> pre<00:05:56.840> comp<00:05:57.170> and<00:05:57.440> a<00:05:57.740> bit<00:05:57.920> of

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
animation using a pre comp and a bit of

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.300 
animation using a pre comp and a bit of
3d<00:05:58.390> you<00:05:59.390> can<00:05:59.600> of<00:05:59.720> course<00:05:59.990> have<00:06:00.860> it<00:06:01.040> at<00:06:01.130> any

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
3d you can of course have it at any

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.080 
3d you can of course have it at any
angle<00:06:01.430> you<00:06:01.910> want<00:06:02.090> you<00:06:03.050> can<00:06:03.260> spin<00:06:03.680> it<00:06:03.770> round<00:06:04.090> you

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
angle you want you can spin it round you

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.810 
angle you want you can spin it round you
can<00:06:05.710> spin<00:06:06.710> it<00:06:06.800> around<00:06:06.830> any<00:06:07.160> which<00:06:07.550> way<00:06:07.580> you

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
can spin it around any which way you

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.920 
can spin it around any which way you
like<00:06:08.120> to<00:06:08.420> get<00:06:08.600> the<00:06:08.720> effect<00:06:09.050> that<00:06:09.290> you<00:06:09.650> want<00:06:10.930> but

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
like to get the effect that you want but

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.440 
like to get the effect that you want but
this<00:06:12.110> is<00:06:12.230> the<00:06:12.350> one<00:06:12.500> I<00:06:12.530> chose<00:06:13.090> just<00:06:14.090> before<00:06:14.420> a

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
this is the one I chose just before a

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.060 
this is the one I chose just before a
wrap<00:06:14.720> up<00:06:14.930> you<00:06:15.290> might<00:06:15.470> notice<00:06:15.770> that<00:06:15.800> there's<00:06:16.040> a

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
wrap up you might notice that there's a

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.690 
wrap up you might notice that there's a
bit<00:06:16.220> of<00:06:16.310> a<00:06:16.370> drop<00:06:16.700> shadow<00:06:17.000> on<00:06:17.540> this<00:06:18.050> wave<00:06:18.700> that's

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
bit of a drop shadow on this wave that's

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.820 
bit of a drop shadow on this wave that's
because<00:06:20.090> I've<00:06:20.330> put<00:06:20.570> a<00:06:20.630> drop<00:06:20.870> shadow<00:06:21.140> using<00:06:21.500> the

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
because I've put a drop shadow using the

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.100 
because I've put a drop shadow using the
layer<00:06:22.070> styles<00:06:22.640> on<00:06:23.000> there<00:06:25.660> so<00:06:26.660> you<00:06:26.720> can<00:06:26.870> do<00:06:26.960> that

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
layer styles on there so you can do that

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.710 
layer styles on there so you can do that
by<00:06:27.350> right<00:06:27.710> clicking<00:06:27.980> on<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:28.460> layer<00:06:28.970> and<00:06:29.240> going

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
by right clicking on the layer and going

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.860 
by right clicking on the layer and going
to<00:06:29.930> layer<00:06:30.230> styles<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:31.130> choosing<00:06:32.030> one<00:06:32.690> of<00:06:32.720> the

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
to layer styles and choosing one of the

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.260 
to layer styles and choosing one of the
ones<00:06:33.050> from<00:06:33.230> here<00:06:33.560> you<00:06:34.250> might<00:06:34.580> want<00:06:34.610> to<00:06:35.030> turn

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
ones from here you might want to turn

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.320 
ones from here you might want to turn
that<00:06:35.390> off<00:06:35.540> before<00:06:36.200> you<00:06:37.160> render<00:06:37.400> it<00:06:37.700> just<00:06:38.210> so

that off before you render it just so

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.750 
that off before you render it just so
you<00:06:38.450> get<00:06:38.540> a<00:06:38.630> nice<00:06:38.810> crisp

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
you get a nice crisp

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.790 
you get a nice crisp
and<00:06:41.060> then<00:06:41.420> you<00:06:41.540> can<00:06:41.690> add<00:06:41.780> a<00:06:41.810> drop<00:06:42.140> shadow<00:06:42.170> in

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
and then you can add a drop shadow in

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.130 
and then you can add a drop shadow in
flash<00:06:43.220> the<00:06:44.000> reason<00:06:44.270> I<00:06:44.330> put<00:06:44.480> a<00:06:44.510> drop<00:06:44.690> shadow<00:06:45.020> on

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
flash the reason I put a drop shadow on

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.380 
flash the reason I put a drop shadow on
there<00:06:45.500> is<00:06:45.740> because<00:06:46.340> you<00:06:46.850> tend<00:06:47.090> to<00:06:47.150> get<00:06:47.330> that

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
there is because you tend to get that

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.230 
there is because you tend to get that
little<00:06:48.200> drop<00:06:48.710> shadow<00:06:48.920> in<00:06:49.310> reality<00:06:49.910> when<00:06:50.210> you

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
little drop shadow in reality when you

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.920 
little drop shadow in reality when you
see<00:06:50.570> be<00:06:51.050> such<00:06:51.350> a<00:06:51.380> very<00:06:51.800> very<00:06:51.890> thin<00:06:52.400> waves<00:06:53.120> thin

layers water moving over sound so that's

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.750
