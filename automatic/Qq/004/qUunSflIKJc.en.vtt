00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.609
 I went to speak in other languages 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.199
 Oh well, I have to learn in 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.970
 other languages can not stand to talk ô 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.830

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.599

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.980
 well I hope you are doing very well 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.439
 I am a double million 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.420
 today will be very fast and well spent 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.890
 It will be as neat as you are. 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.750
 accustomed to seeing here in the channel but 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.070
 very simple to learn everything at home 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.600
 it was all messed up but while 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.520
 I was making that curtain with my 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.050
 My friend, we all talk here late doing 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.399
 nothing, we're going to make that tan 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.379
 people do not know if it 's true that people 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.579
 Not recorded but right here my partner. 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.870
 who is always behind my camera 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.910
 started to record everything that we were doing 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.620
 doing so I lost six in total to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.570
 you guys are a super fact fact tip 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.010
 quiet to do so did you 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.300
 talk in environments but she is also 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.789
 super cool to put a message 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.489
 a port that does not have ports knows how 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.449
 I do not understand a window either. 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.619
 everything is legal 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.270
 At the end of the video I'll leave some 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.010
 photos to inspire you as 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.950
 you can use this kind of curtain 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.330
 fringes has several ways of doing more 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.010
 I did it in the simplest and most 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.990
 practice everything you had at home then 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.670
 Let's stop the tutorial for mess 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.400
 You see how I'm not so organized. 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 how much does it all look like the first 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.369
 The thing that I did was put a hook. 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.720
 in front of me 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.070
 on one side and the other where I wanted 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.020
 to learn well my day there 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.270
 wall to ceiling and counted the wires 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.220
 with double the height I left a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.710
 family to be able to hit bottom 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.570
 in the end 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.970
 the wire I wore was like a string 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.940
 white technician and then it's only important 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.229
 various purposes of the size you are 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.950
 alone in the middle of each child I'm going 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.290
 explain why she laughed piece of yarn 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.520
 cross 2 x 1 as if it were a step up 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.520
 the fee is just in the tail node 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:06.340
 the average distance you need a 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:11.470
 secopa hook pulls well to look good 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:15.269
 stretching and autonomy and ready 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.269
 now it's just leave first moral children 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.810
 I just passed the rope passing through 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.620
 inside 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.420
 does not need or give a knot that little 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.430
 I gave to mark the middle of each wire 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.450
 so is much easier to just take the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.450
 north launch natural 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.960
 and do it with how many children 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.480
 you want 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:51.100
 in the end it's just hit underneath with the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.100
 scissors and go there it's ready that's just it 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.269
 so basically it's just you hang a 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.160
 movie hang several wires on them hint 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.830
 super easy very easy i hope 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.239

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.840
 stay in the back of the closet by yourself 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.129
