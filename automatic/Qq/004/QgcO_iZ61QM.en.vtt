it's<00:02:16.560> taking<00:02:16.920> time<00:02:17.220> sometimes<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.180> wonder

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
it's taking time sometimes I wonder

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
think is quite important for us not to

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.270 
think is quite important for us not to
forget<00:02:27.930> because<00:02:28.290> there<00:02:28.590> are<00:02:28.680> lots<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.070> good

things in our traditions as well and to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.350

have<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> healthy<00:02:32.370> balance<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.000> good<00:02:33.150> but

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
have a healthy balance is good but

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.270

to something that is quite different uh
it<00:02:49.830> was<00:02:50.160> difficult<00:02:50.670> because<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.180> had<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.570> fight

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
to kind of break all the traditions

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.190 
to kind of break all the traditions
within<00:02:56.910> myself<00:02:57.420> whether<00:02:57.600> it's<00:02:57.750> Indian

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
within myself whether it's Indian

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.460 
within myself whether it's Indian
classical<00:02:58.410> heritage<00:02:59.310> running<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.180> centuries
