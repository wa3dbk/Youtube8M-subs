00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.099
 ingredients and as always in the end by 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.860
 I will leave you in writing so that you 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.050
 you can aim without any problem 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.860
 to use two large eggplants and see 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.780
 people two pieces 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.060
 more or less half a kilo of meat itch 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.740
 natural tomato as you see we have in 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.470
 this boat that this is preserved that 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.170
 we make my house 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.660
 in onion we will use a mean or 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.920
 whole if it's small 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.440
 a pinch of salt a little pepper 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.320
 grated cheese and a little oil of 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.610
 olive simply with this we are going to do 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.610
 a fabulous dish 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.170
 first of all, as you can see, we have cut 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.910
 the aubergines in half we have 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.040
 given some cuts and now we're going to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.530
 put as they are in the tray of the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.200
 We're going to put them in the oven more or 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.010
 minus about 180 degrees with a little 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.500
 more if you want it will be in 15-20 minutes if 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.280
 they will be good for us and we will be able to take them out 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.280
 the meat 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.490
 and now we have taken out of the oven and 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.980
 Now be careful with the help of a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.690
 knife and a spoon we will take them 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.690
 all the meat to the aubergines 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.900
 I have already removed the meat to all 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.210
 eggplants since as you see in the center 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.820
 I have the glass of the blender with half 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.570
 onion cut at the end now I'm going to 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.150
 fill add the meat of the eggplant and 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.770
 like three or four tomatoes the jar of 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.090
 crystal in case you do not have 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.610
 canned tomatoes 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.850
 you can put a natural tomato a 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.420
 beautiful coral now I eat everything here and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.420
 he crushed it 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.729
 here I have some oil in the 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.479
 pan and as soon as it gets hot 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.479
 I add the meat 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.200
 here as you see I have already put the flesh I 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.460
 given a few laps to lose that 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.100
 color to the raw 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.670
 and now I am rich 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.120
 we add the tomato the meat of the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.310
 eggplant 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.310
 and the onion we see 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.920
 of the elements 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.260
 and this now we are mixing 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.959
 now more flat all well 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:52.310
 and let's let it be done that 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.310
 go reducing a few minutes 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.620
 now with all mixed we add that it 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.030
 I forgot 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.030
 a pinch of salt 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.300
 and a pinch of pepper 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.350
 we mix we eat mixing 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.350
 we will be translating 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.270
 although we have to stay a little longer 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.500
 thick so that we do not have problems to 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.500
 the time to fill the veins 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.600
 Now we are going to wait for him to leave us 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.260
 causing it to reduce a bit 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.140
 you have a few minutes that we have it ready 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.450
 to fill the aubergines 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.459
 after a few minutes as you see 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.040
 the filling has reduced a lot 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.230
 lost enough fluid now in this 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.420
 moment can be added if you want 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.420
 I give as an example a little parsley 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.480
 any other herb fresh grass the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.220
 what you like most is simply to mix 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.989
 I already have the fire off and right now 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.989
 we started filling the aubergines 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.720
 good as you see has already filled 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.340
 perfectly the four aubergines has 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.850
 entered the filling perfectly in the 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.210
 four now first of all we're going to 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.910
 put cheese on top if you have two 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.960
 kinds of cheese this for example as 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.139
 you see that it is 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.780
 is striped rosso we propose below 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.490
 and then up 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.340
 up we put another cheese cheese powder 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.030
 will help you more to crust as soon as 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.030
 We have it 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.790
 we go to the kiln oven I have it or 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.880
 It was not hot anymore, but what 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.849
 I have just put joyfully in this 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.979
 case we are not interested 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.770
 we are interested in this oven because 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:07.340
 Eggplants are already baked meat 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.639
 It is made and we are no longer interested 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.780
 the oven simply grill that melts 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.130

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:20.840
 have a few minutes here is we have 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.840

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.360
 cheese we already have our aubergines 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.760
