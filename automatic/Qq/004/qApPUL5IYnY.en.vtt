00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.610
 of colors and textures 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.610
 let's see the benefits 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.180
 sergia we return this work of those who are advancing told that they are 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.320
 working from warhol as you can see the mine we are doing several desks

 the issue as soon as this case ends 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.530
 we are happy relocating them floor porcelain in general 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.370
 in the soldiers we are placing the inside and the outside we have done all 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.910
 the stone washed as we have seen in another note 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.010
 the whole eln the perimeter detail of the Patagonian porphyry 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.810
 We are working with porcelain tiles indoors and outdoors also as 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380
 you can see you combining different colors 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.020
 and we are also working on what he does since the termination 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.490
 the coating and if this housing 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.110
 transcends the tests by a hundred of color and texture so well percent of hours l 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.540
 we call ourselves and a lot 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.520
 traglio that 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.740
 We previously chose it in a color catalog with the client 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.799
 and then we bring it now we bring it really the house so that it sees it not 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.330
 can visualize and can enter to compare if it is really the taste of 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.450
 Regarding color and texture, it mana mana different tests in different 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.439
 parts 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.310
 they were going to how can be seen in the center of color and a lot of protectors like 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.179
 I was telling you 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.479
 We're also 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.820
 the testing of the product for 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.420
 thales aa waterproofing or that protection at the foot of lava 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.390
 can not see and we're also percent annual product that sample 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.870
 to the concrete seen 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.380
 I'm trying to 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.290
 show and prove what it did to the a glossy satin matte finish that 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.800
 that makes one suggest the client and client is going to select 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.889
 I see that the porcelain have typical scenes yes, good as you can see the 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.620
 uncertain trend eagle in this case much used a plate that has 33 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.429
 centimeters by 66 centimeters long 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.050
 this a trend 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.670
 of using increasingly larger plates has already because the industry 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.270
 can achieve plates or trying each time - see if the joint between the 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.690
 same plate not in this case a porcelain of high traffic in this 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.060
 case the same has been selected since the movement in this type of housing 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.780
 so the resistance elaboration of these products is 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.930
 percent alc must be high not true in this case porcelain tile in a country 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.230
 four whether or not the products are classified by their hardness and the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.650
 porcelain of a hardness four of one of the highest in terms of what it does 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.470
 nothing of this type of products to seven before was mikel per week 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.850
 azahar the floor to the ceiling in which the complaints are deposited 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.749
 silvano fact indeed we have had 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:19.869
 when placing to install the tiles in this case are French tk in matted malt 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:24.989
 bright how can they visualize according to aesthetics and 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.289
