00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.550
 here is a huge sony TV made 65 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.830
 inches of diagonal and that's the cuvÃ©e 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.410
 2015 of the w 8 range which is the top of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.630
 full hd range of saunier then on time 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.109
 where all high-end TVs are 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.210
 ultra hd 4k is it worth it 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.960
 to buy a TV that still full hd on 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.670
 you say it right away on a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.740
 diagonal 65 inches 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.809
 the difference between full hd and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.030
 the ultra gelas is really even 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.770
 some distance from the screen on some 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.360
 full hd we're even going closer to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 the screen see the pixels while on 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.100
 the ultra hd the picture is extremely well 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.050
 defined even on huge diagonal 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 like this one so far it's not the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.800
 more important since we mostly go 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.039
 look at the image quality is there 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.989
 for 7w 855 that's the picture quality is 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.329
 absolutely phenomenal she is 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.730
 extremely faithful with a rate of 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.800
 contrast that is going almost up 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.629
 7000 for one with some settings of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.549
 brightness a movie mode that is 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.590
 extremely well mastered with gray 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.560
 very well tuned all the colors are 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.330
 exact we can even add a little 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 saturation with a color mode 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.619
 natural in sony options all 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.970
 by maintaining exemplary fidelity 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.009
 one of the best in the market 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.810
 currently another benefit of staying at 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.670
 full hd is the quality of the retro 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.380
 lighting that is here indirect help 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.000
 direct led allows to have another 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.979
 ultra homogeneous clash in any case our 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.470
 model does not do clouding at all 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.030
 and a very deep black and very homogeneous 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.979
 on the entire surface of the small slab 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.840
 flat the setting is less powerful on 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.119
 the four corners of the slab what in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.009
 actually created a little vignetting effect 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.360
 which could bother some but 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.360
 nothing very serious according to us 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.890
 in conclusion we must always see the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.479
 price of the TV for now the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.670
 official price is announced at 2000 euros 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.289
 the TV is not sold yet 2000 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.060
 it's a bit expensive for full HD 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.439
 even in 65 inches even with such 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.700
 picture quality or but as soon as the price 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.590
 will drop it will become one of 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.460
 market's best deals even if we 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.679
 you the rope 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.729
 it's not an ultra hd tv for 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.590
