00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.200 

which<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.620> programming

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:16.620 

then<00:00:08.140> why<00:00:08.410> celebration<00:00:09.070> and<00:00:09.280> we<00:00:10.059> click<00:00:10.330> Next

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.769 

you<00:00:17.169> can<00:00:17.349> see<00:00:17.500> this<00:00:17.730> modules<00:00:18.730> and<00:00:19.060> you<00:00:19.570> can

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
you can see this modules and you can

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.839 
you can see this modules and you can
choose<00:00:19.990> the<00:00:20.019> one<00:00:20.439> you<00:00:20.710> want<00:00:20.740> to<00:00:21.130> coding<00:00:21.609> and

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
choose the one you want to coding and

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.729 
choose the one you want to coding and
programming<00:00:22.679> so<00:00:23.679> this<00:00:24.429> is<00:00:24.609> srs<00:00:25.119> module<00:00:25.960> as<00:00:26.410> I

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
programming so this is srs module as I

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.970 
programming so this is srs module as I
hrs<00:00:27.699> so<00:00:28.509> we<00:00:29.320> do<00:00:29.500> not<00:00:29.679> have<00:00:29.919> so<00:00:30.279> we<00:00:31.800> will<00:00:32.800> choose

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
hrs so we do not have so we will choose

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.360 
hrs so we do not have so we will choose
one<00:00:33.040> by<00:00:33.670> rhythm<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:36.370> click<00:00:36.610> Next<00:00:38.220> then<00:00:39.220> the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
one by rhythm then click Next then the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
one by rhythm then click Next then the
system<00:00:39.699> will<00:00:40.860> tell<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:42.010> how<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.339> do<00:00:42.729> next

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
system will tell you how to do next

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.660 
system will tell you how to do next
exchange<00:00:44.680> control<00:00:45.339> unit<00:00:45.760> we<00:00:46.659> click<00:00:46.960> Next<00:00:47.670> here

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
exchange control unit we click Next here

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:57.950 
exchange control unit we click Next here
you<00:00:48.820> can<00:00:48.970> see<00:00:51.659> dermal<00:00:52.659> click<00:00:52.869> Next

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.380 

first<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> detainment<00:00:59.190> basic<00:00:59.760> issue<00:00:59.940> by

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
first the detainment basic issue by

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.920 
first the detainment basic issue by
manual<00:01:00.960> input<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.890> cake<00:01:02.100> then<00:01:02.610> program<00:01:03.180> so

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
manual input and cake then program so

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.560 
manual input and cake then program so
then<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.190> you<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.700> exchange<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
then is to see you have to exchange the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.430 
then is to see you have to exchange the
issue<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.610> may<00:01:08.610> click<00:01:08.909> Next<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:13.259> we<00:01:13.290> can

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
issue and may click Next so here we can

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.490 
issue and may click Next so here we can
see<00:01:13.770> program<00:01:14.550> basically<00:01:14.820> control<00:01:15.540> unit<00:01:15.900> it's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
see program basically control unit it's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
see program basically control unit it's
something<00:01:16.710> basically<00:01:17.100> control<00:01:17.550> units<00:01:17.940> you

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
something basically control units you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.859 
something basically control units you
can<00:01:18.149> choose<00:01:18.450> any<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:19.040> bed<00:01:20.040> order<00:01:20.690> orders<00:01:21.690> are

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
can choose any one bed order orders are

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.170 
can choose any one bed order orders are
different<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.590> first<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.030> choose

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
different so you first you can choose

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.399 
different so you first you can choose
any<00:01:24.540> way<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.780> like

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.950 

then<00:01:33.009> click<00:01:33.249> Next

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.200 

the<00:01:38.500> herring<00:01:39.130> has<00:01:39.220> effort<00:01:39.580> that<00:01:39.790> determine

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
the herring has effort that determine

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:55.000 
the herring has effort that determine
basic<00:01:40.630> control<00:01:41.049> unit<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.680> next

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:05.810 

program<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:55.970> this<00:01:56.150> community<00:01:58.630> next

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.310 

so<00:02:06.330> we<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:07.080> do<00:02:07.260> is<00:02:07.590> determine<00:02:08.070> basic<00:02:08.640> unit

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
so we have to do is determine basic unit

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.190 
so we have to do is determine basic unit
at<00:02:10.320> first<00:02:10.710> though<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.580> continue<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.200> this

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
at first though we can continue so this

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.270 
at first though we can continue so this
is<00:02:13.350> only<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.370> demo<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.630> here<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.650> general

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
is only the demo so here is the general

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.850 
is only the demo so here is the general
way<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.490> how<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.060> code<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.540> programming<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
way of how to code in programming the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.740 
way of how to code in programming the
next<00:02:20.220> step<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.790> do<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.209> by<00:02:21.390> yourself

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
next step you can do it by yourself

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.440 
next step you can do it by yourself
because<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.620> different<00:02:23.430> car<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
because of the different car the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.350 
because of the different car the
situation<00:02:24.840> are<00:02:25.500> different<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.360> you

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
situation are different so you can you

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.730 
situation are different so you can you
can<00:02:30.830> select<00:02:31.830> any<00:02:32.250> one<00:02:33.200> about<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.440> situation

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
can select any one about the situation

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.180 
can select any one about the situation
on<00:02:35.370> your<00:02:35.790> side<00:02:36.110> thanks<00:02:37.110> for<00:02:37.320> watching<00:02:37.350> from<00:02:37.920> OB
