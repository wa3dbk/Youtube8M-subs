follow orders from teachers and learning

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.740 
to it's teaching them to socialize with
strangers<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.880> that's<00:02:54.060> that's<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
strangers like that's that's the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.479 
strangers like that's that's the
function<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.440> these<00:02:55.560> these<00:02:56.160> shows<00:02:56.459> they

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
function and these these shows they

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.250 
function and these these shows they
serve<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> similar<00:02:57.360> function<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.050> need

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
serve a similar function and you need

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.020 
serve a similar function and you need
that<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.680> get<00:02:59.130> ready<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.610> get<00:02:59.760> through<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
that to get ready to get through the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.790 
that to get ready to get through the
rest<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.330> primary<00:03:00.750> school<00:03:01.019> high<00:03:01.230> school<00:03:01.560> and

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
rest of primary school high school and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400 
rest of primary school high school and
into<00:03:02.310> college<00:03:02.510> maybe<00:03:03.510> there's<00:03:03.870> also<00:03:04.019> some

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
into college maybe there's also some

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.900 
into college maybe there's also some
sort<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.650> funding<00:03:05.010> problems<00:03:05.370> that's<00:03:05.550> entirely

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
sort of funding problems that's entirely

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.420 
sort of funding problems that's entirely
possible<00:03:06.300> but<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.590> think<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.950> perhaps<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
possible but this I think is perhaps the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.729 
possible but this I think is perhaps the
starkest<00:03:08.760> example<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.600> how<00:03:10.290> our<00:03:10.590> education

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
starkest example of how our education

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.100 
starkest example of how our education
system<00:03:11.550> has<00:03:11.730> been<00:03:11.970> sort<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.209> taken<00:03:12.570> off<00:03:12.690> track

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
system has been sort of taken off track

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.949 
system has been sort of taken off track
by<00:03:13.620> things<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:13.950> No<00:03:14.160> Child<00:03:14.190> Left<00:03:14.519> Behind

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
by things like No Child Left Behind

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.000 
by things like No Child Left Behind
standardized<00:03:15.959> testing<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.470> stuff<00:03:16.709> like<00:03:16.829> that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
standardized testing and stuff like that

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.560 
standardized testing and stuff like that
like<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:17.280> not<00:03:17.370> training<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.940> whole<00:03:18.120> human

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
like it's not training the whole human

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.780 
like it's not training the whole human
it's<00:03:19.049> training<00:03:19.380> them<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.769> be<00:03:19.890> better<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.459> very

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
it's training them to be better in very

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.970 
it's training them to be better in very
specific<00:03:21.060> academic<00:03:21.480> ways<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.290> it's<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:22.829> even

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
specific academic ways and it's not even

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.620 
specific academic ways and it's not even
doing<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.519> well<00:03:23.760> because<00:03:24.150> we're<00:03:24.299> falling

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
doing that well because we're falling

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.569 
doing that well because we're falling
farther<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.019> farther<00:03:25.140> behind<00:03:25.579> European

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
farther and farther behind European

countries Asian countries and things

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.770 
countries Asian countries and things
like<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.470> too<00:03:28.709> specific<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.850> Train

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
like that it's too specific to Train

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.780 
like that it's too specific to Train
small<00:03:31.350> children<00:03:31.709> for<00:03:31.890> college<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.549> just

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
small children for college it just

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.360 
small children for college it just
doesn't<00:03:33.090> seem<00:03:33.239> like<00:03:33.720> that's<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.799> real<00:03:34.950> reason

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
doesn't seem like that's a real reason

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.039 
doesn't seem like that's a real reason
and<00:03:35.640> even<00:03:35.910> if<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.239> it's<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.510> ridiculous

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
and even if it is it's a ridiculous

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.259 
and even if it is it's a ridiculous
reason<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.739> it's<00:03:38.459> not<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.700> shows<00:03:38.940> don't

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
reason and it's not that shows don't

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.850 
reason and it's not that shows don't

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
to learn lines and they have to interact

to learn lines and they have to interact
with<00:03:42.930> each<00:03:43.049> other<00:03:43.170> it's<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.950> know<00:03:44.070> it's<00:03:44.610> just

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
with each other it's you know it's just

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.490 
with each other it's you know it's just
a<00:03:44.850> poor<00:03:45.030> decision<00:03:45.150> yeah<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> silly

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
a poor decision yeah this is a silly

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.140 
a poor decision yeah this is a silly
reason<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:47.040> cancel<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> show<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.670> much<00:03:47.940> better

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
reason to cancel a show a much better

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.180 
reason to cancel a show a much better
reason<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.840> because<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.410> had<00:03:49.590> some<00:03:49.890> vague

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
reason is because it had some vague

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.310 
reason is because it had some vague
reference<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.940> Christianity<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:52.170> you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
reference to Christianity so that you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.930 
reference to Christianity so that you
can<00:03:52.440> get<00:03:52.560> mad<00:03:52.709> at<00:03:52.860> atheist<00:03:53.250> thanks<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.610> lot
