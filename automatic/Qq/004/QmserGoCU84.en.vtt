00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.680 
down with that from a corner and it is a
problem<00:03:05.100> teams<00:03:05.580> will<00:03:05.760> start<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.180> pick<00:03:06.360> up<00:03:06.390> on

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
problem teams will start to pick up on

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.450 
problem teams will start to pick up on
that<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.020> they<00:03:07.260> will<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.530> pile<00:03:07.800> them<00:03:08.010> they

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
that and they will just pile them they

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.310 
that and they will just pile them they
are<00:03:08.490> poor<00:03:08.880> players<00:03:09.240> around<00:03:09.510> him<00:03:09.660> at<00:03:09.900> corners

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
are poor players around him at corners

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.380 
are poor players around him at corners
and<00:03:10.470> they<00:03:10.650> will<00:03:10.800> take<00:03:10.890> advantage<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.580> I

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
and they will take advantage of it and I

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.470 
and they will take advantage of it and I
think<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.900> check<00:03:13.850> it's<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.120> difficult

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
think that check it's so difficult

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.390 
think that check it's so difficult
because<00:03:15.930> he<00:03:16.080> did<00:03:16.290> make<00:03:16.320> some<00:03:16.620> great<00:03:16.800> saves<00:03:17.100> but

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
because he did make some great saves but

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.130 
because he did make some great saves but
you<00:03:17.580> need<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.850> have<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.030> dominate<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.660> box

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
you need to have to dominate that box

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.930 
you need to have to dominate that box
and<00:03:19.470> it's<00:03:19.650> something<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.040> T<00:03:20.340> buccal<00:03:20.700> swab

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940
