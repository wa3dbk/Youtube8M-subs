00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.680

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.570
 all these complaints for you are stories 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:46.010

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.480

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.480
 I was waiting and he did not answer me 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.820

 microwave to take out your shirts yes yes 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.750

 it does not matter, it's not that I'm very angry 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.650
 they told me that you also have a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.440
 collection of trained catrinas and 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.730
 you are selling one by one 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.880
 It turns out that it is very easy to prove that 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:27.720
 you only have those who pay the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.720
 accounts for example 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.350

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.580
 of women taken 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.790
 against hippos the worst of all 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.340
 if it is true that is totally true 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.560
 how long it has been taken is not 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.600
 likely that you can think inside 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:00.660

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.660

 I'm leaving here I'm going to calmly go 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.349
 this company but this company is left 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.349

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.660
