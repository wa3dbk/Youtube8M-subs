they're<00:01:07.270> really<00:01:07.869> easy<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.320> use<00:01:08.590> that<00:01:08.920> way

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
they're really easy to use that way

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.240 
they're really easy to use that way
these<00:01:10.479> particular<00:01:11.020> oars<00:01:11.229> have<00:01:11.619> a<00:01:11.649> break<00:01:12.040> down

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
these particular oars have a break down

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.850 
these particular oars have a break down
shaft<00:01:12.700> on<00:01:12.940> them<00:01:13.090> which<00:01:13.750> load<00:01:14.050> really<00:01:14.380> nice<00:01:14.649> in

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
shaft on them which load really nice in

shaft on them which load really nice in
the<00:01:14.950> airplane<00:01:15.369> I've<00:01:16.149> got<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.570> blade<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:17.050> a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
the airplane I've got the blade is a

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.840 
the airplane I've got the blade is a
separate<00:01:17.590> piece<00:01:17.770> so<00:01:18.039> if<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:18.220> bend<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.580> blade<00:01:18.820> I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
separate piece so if I bend a blade I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.930 
separate piece so if I bend a blade I
can<00:01:19.180> change<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:20.229> out<00:01:20.380> if<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.070> bend<00:01:21.340> one<00:01:21.550> section

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
can change it out if I bend one section

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.400 
can change it out if I bend one section
of<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.149> shaft<00:01:22.420> I<00:01:22.600> can<00:01:22.780> discard<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.289> and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
of the shaft I can discard it and

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.160 
of the shaft I can discard it and
replace<00:01:23.740> that<00:01:23.770> section<00:01:24.460> I<00:01:24.700> can<00:01:25.119> also<00:01:25.450> get<00:01:25.869> one

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
replace that section I can also get one

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.469 
replace that section I can also get one
foot<00:01:26.410> extenders<00:01:27.090> depending<00:01:28.090> on<00:01:28.180> how<00:01:28.330> your

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
foot extenders depending on how your

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.600 
foot extenders depending on how your
boats<00:01:28.690> rigged<00:01:28.990> up<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.350> might<00:01:29.530> need<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.430> run

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
boats rigged up you might need to to run

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.850 
boats rigged up you might need to to run
longer<00:01:30.880> shafts<00:01:31.210> on<00:01:32.080> your<00:01:32.289> oars<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.710> so<00:01:32.770> you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
longer shafts on your oars and so you

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.350 
longer shafts on your oars and so you
can<00:01:32.979> add<00:01:33.130> those<00:01:33.280> extenders<00:01:33.880> on<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.119> makes<00:01:34.270> a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
can add those extenders on it makes a

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.660 
can add those extenders on it makes a
big<00:01:34.509> difference<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.920> couple<00:01:36.460> other<00:01:36.580> things

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
big difference a couple other things

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.850 
big difference a couple other things
this<00:01:37.570> boat<00:01:37.810> has<00:01:38.020> rubber<00:01:38.320> grips<00:01:38.590> on<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
this boat has rubber grips on the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.070 
this boat has rubber grips on the
handles<00:01:39.250> makes<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.580> really<00:01:39.729> easy<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:40.149> not<00:01:40.840> slip

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
handles makes it really easy to not slip

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.050 
handles makes it really easy to not slip
off<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.410> handles<00:01:41.860> if<00:01:42.399> you<00:01:42.520> don't<00:01:42.729> have<00:01:42.910> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
off the handles if you don't have the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.910 
off the handles if you don't have the
rubber<00:01:43.240> grips<00:01:43.539> on<00:01:43.720> there<00:01:43.899> then<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.560> ends<00:01:44.830> of

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
rubber grips on there then the ends of

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.520 
rubber grips on there then the ends of
the<00:01:45.179> handles<00:01:46.179> are<00:01:46.300> just<00:01:46.509> plastic<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.229> they

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
the handles are just plastic and they

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.300 
the handles are just plastic and they
slip<00:01:47.830> really<00:01:48.099> bad<00:01:49.030> with<00:01:49.360> regular<00:01:50.140> gloves<00:01:50.440> so

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
slip really bad with regular gloves so

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.180 
slip really bad with regular gloves so
that's<00:01:51.640> one<00:01:51.880> thing<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.060> be<00:01:52.240> aware<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:53.190> another

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
that's one thing to be aware of another

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.880 
that's one thing to be aware of another
thing<00:01:54.490> is<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.789> color<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.149> your<00:01:55.450> blades<00:01:55.890> I'm

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
thing is the color of your blades I'm

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.219 
thing is the color of your blades I'm
running<00:01:57.220> black<00:01:57.490> blades<00:01:57.940> on<00:01:58.179> this<00:01:58.330> boat<00:01:58.599> and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
running black blades on this boat and

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.339 
running black blades on this boat and
that's<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.310> pretty<00:02:00.910> good<00:02:01.000> color<00:02:01.390> but<00:02:01.690> keep<00:02:02.200> in

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
that's a pretty good color but keep in

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:05.490 
that's a pretty good color but keep in
mind<00:02:02.619> that<00:02:03.569> when<00:02:04.569> you<00:02:04.690> dip<00:02:04.899> these<00:02:05.080> words<00:02:05.319> in

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
mind that when you dip these words in

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.080 
mind that when you dip these words in
the<00:02:05.560> water<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:06.190> black<00:02:06.459> blade<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.910> going<00:02:07.030> to

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
the water that black blade is going to

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.089 
the water that black blade is going to
disappear<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:07.959> if<00:02:08.110> you're<00:02:08.319> trying<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.920> make<00:02:09.069> a

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
disappear so if you're trying to make a

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.250 
disappear so if you're trying to make a
stock<00:02:09.399> on<00:02:09.580> an<00:02:09.670> animal<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.270> see<00:02:10.599> down

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
stock on an animal that you see down

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.990 
stock on an animal that you see down
river<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.920> you're<00:02:12.040> trying<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.280> drift<00:02:12.580> down<00:02:12.760> to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
river and you're trying to drift down to

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.729 
river and you're trying to drift down to
it<00:02:13.120> every<00:02:13.420> time<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:13.750> put<00:02:13.959> your<00:02:13.989> blades<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
it every time you put your blades in the

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.650 
it every time you put your blades in the
water<00:02:14.950> they<00:02:15.190> disappear<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:15.970> from<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.209> animals

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
water they disappear so from the animals

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.570 
water they disappear so from the animals
perspective<00:02:17.290> that's<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.040> lot<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.370> motion

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
perspective that's a lot of motion

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.430 
perspective that's a lot of motion
they're<00:02:19.030> gonna<00:02:19.150> see<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.660> blade<00:02:20.110> disappear

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
they're gonna see that blade disappear

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.220 
they're gonna see that blade disappear
I<00:02:21.530> would<00:02:21.920> probably<00:02:22.210> prefer<00:02:23.210> black<00:02:23.840> blades

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
I would probably prefer black blades

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.890 
I would probably prefer black blades
over<00:02:24.470> yellow<00:02:25.010> though<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.760> yellow<00:02:26.090> blades<00:02:26.720> are

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
over yellow though the yellow blades are

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.770 
over yellow though the yellow blades are
really<00:02:27.200> bright<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:28.250> that's<00:02:29.180> gonna<00:02:29.480> really

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
really bright and that's gonna really

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780 
really bright and that's gonna really
stand<00:02:30.200> out<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.500> an<00:02:30.740> animal<00:02:31.100> that<00:02:31.130> might<00:02:31.460> see

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790

the ones made by Carlisle and they come
in<00:02:58.790> either<00:02:58.940> an<00:02:59.240> 8<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.750> half<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.470> think<00:03:00.980> they

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
in either an 8 and a half I think they

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.520 
in either an 8 and a half I think they
call<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.220> an<00:03:01.430> 8<00:03:01.610> 1/2<00:03:01.820> outfitter<00:03:02.300> blade<00:03:02.600> which

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
call it an 8 1/2 outfitter blade which

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.990 
call it an 8 1/2 outfitter blade which
is<00:03:03.650> 8<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.920> half<00:03:03.950> inches<00:03:04.280> wide<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.850> then

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
is 8 and a half inches wide and then

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.130 
is 8 and a half inches wide and then
you've<00:03:05.120> got<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.360> six<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.780> half<00:03:05.930> inch

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
you've got the six and a half inch

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.840 
you've got the six and a half inch
blades<00:03:06.470> which<00:03:06.740> some<00:03:06.980> people<00:03:07.250> prefer<00:03:07.460> for

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
blades which some people prefer for

blades which some people prefer for
whitewater<00:03:08.350> my<00:03:09.350> preference<00:03:09.830> is<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.130> 8<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.460> a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
whitewater my preference is the 8 and a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.450 
whitewater my preference is the 8 and a
half<00:03:10.640> inch<00:03:10.880> blade<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.570> get<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.750> lot<00:03:12.020> more<00:03:12.460> bang

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
half inch blade you get a lot more bang

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.580 
half inch blade you get a lot more bang
for<00:03:13.490> your<00:03:13.790> buck<00:03:14.000> when<00:03:14.210> it<00:03:14.330> comes<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.870> but

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
for your buck when it comes to but

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.220 
for your buck when it comes to but

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
so on we're not floating whitewater when

so on we're not floating whitewater when
we're<00:03:20.480> float<00:03:20.690> hunting<00:03:20.960> so<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.670> eight<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.030> a

we're float hunting so the eight and a
half<00:03:23.180> inch<00:03:23.420> blades<00:03:23.690> work<00:03:23.930> really<00:03:24.170> well

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
half inch blades work really well

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.260 
half inch blades work really well

one thing you want to make sure you do
on<00:04:01.970> your<00:04:02.180> boat<00:04:02.360> is<00:04:02.600> bring<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.930> spare<00:04:03.200> or

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
on your boat is bring a spare or

on your boat is bring a spare or
normally<00:04:04.400> we<00:04:04.489> have<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.880> or<00:04:05.000> rigged<00:04:05.330> up<00:04:05.510> and

normally we have the or rigged up and

normally we have the or rigged up and
tied<00:04:06.080> along<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.560> side<00:04:06.800> so<00:04:07.130> it's<00:04:07.280> easy<00:04:07.489> to

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
tied along the side so it's easy to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.000 
tied along the side so it's easy to
deploy<00:04:08.120> in<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:08.870> case<00:04:09.110> we<00:04:09.290> took<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:09.590> apart<00:04:09.860> and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010

we stowed it down on the floor of the
