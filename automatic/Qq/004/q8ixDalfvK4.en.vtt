suspected<00:00:39.110> we<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.350> Transport<00:00:41.070> Canada

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
suspected we have Transport Canada

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.119 
suspected we have Transport Canada
during<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.059> test<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.720> our

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
during this test that is our

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.439 
during this test that is our
certification<00:00:44.129> very<00:00:44.430> complex<00:00:44.850> certification

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
certification very complex certification

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.049 
certification very complex certification
test<00:00:45.710> basically<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.949> test<00:00:47.309> consists<00:00:47.730> on

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
test basically this test consists on

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.860 
test basically this test consists on
three<00:00:48.390> parts

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
three parts

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.200 
three parts
it<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> smoke<00:00:50.220> detection<00:00:50.550> smoke

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
it is a smoke detection smoke

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.830 
it is a smoke detection smoke
penetration<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.110> smoke<00:00:52.680> evaluation

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.080 

so<00:00:59.379> during<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.860> detection<00:01:00.309> test<00:01:00.579> what<00:01:00.760> we<00:01:00.940> did

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
so during the detection test what we did

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.240 
so during the detection test what we did
try<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.329> demonstrate<00:01:01.870> it<00:01:02.020> is<00:01:02.260> that<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.829> fire

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
try to demonstrate it is that the fire

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.940 
try to demonstrate it is that the fire
detection<00:01:03.579> system<00:01:04.119> detect<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.199> small

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
detection system detect the small

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.230 
detection system detect the small
quantity<00:01:06.159> of<00:01:06.400> smoke<00:01:07.000> within<00:01:07.810> one<00:01:08.200> minute<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
quantity of smoke within one minute for

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.300 
quantity of smoke within one minute for
that<00:01:10.270> what<00:01:10.570> we<00:01:10.600> try<00:01:10.900> is<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.560> ensured

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
that what we try is that that ensured

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.660 
that what we try is that that ensured
that<00:01:12.549> in<00:01:12.790> case<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.210> fire<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.860> procedures<00:01:15.369> for

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
that in case of fire the procedures for

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.940 
that in case of fire the procedures for
smoke<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:17.040> fire<00:01:18.040> extinguishing<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:20.380> done

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
smoke and fire extinguishing are done

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.420 
smoke and fire extinguishing are done
effectively<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.540> there<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.680> no<00:01:23.920> risk<00:01:24.159> of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
effectively so there is no risk of

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.200 
effectively so there is no risk of
damaging<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.509> it<00:01:25.720> structure<00:01:26.680> any<00:01:27.190> panel<00:01:28.030> or

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
damaging and it structure any panel or

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.800 
damaging and it structure any panel or
wiring<00:01:28.780> or<00:01:29.100> critical<00:01:30.100> system<00:01:30.490> then<00:01:30.970> we<00:01:31.509> we

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
wiring or critical system then we we

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.330 
wiring or critical system then we we
have<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.110> illustrate<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.740> crew<00:01:32.950> has<00:01:33.190> the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
have to illustrate that the crew has the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.070 
have to illustrate that the crew has the
proper<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:34.030> warning<00:01:34.420> messages<00:01:34.780> in<00:01:34.960> the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
proper the warning messages in the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.260 
proper the warning messages in the
cavity<00:01:35.410> so<00:01:35.860> they<00:01:36.160> can<00:01:36.369> proceed<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:36.940> they're

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
cavity so they can proceed and they're

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:46.069 
cavity so they can proceed and they're
from<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:38.369> emergency<00:01:39.369> procedure

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.859 

so<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:46.770> during<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.250> penetration<00:01:47.670> test<00:01:48.090> what

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
so then during the penetration test what

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.940 
so then during the penetration test what
we<00:01:49.020> try<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.289> demonstrate<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:50.429> that<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.570> case<00:01:51.899> of

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
we try to demonstrate is that in case of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.219 
we try to demonstrate is that in case of
large<00:01:52.950> quantity<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.820> large<00:01:54.179> amount<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.840> smoke

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
large quantity a large amount of smoke

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.800 
large quantity a large amount of smoke
in<00:01:55.469> any<00:01:55.770> compartment<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.509> cargo

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
in any compartment like the cargo

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.809 
in any compartment like the cargo
compartments<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:59.219> avionics<00:01:59.460> Bay

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
compartments or the avionics Bay

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.309 
compartments or the avionics Bay
compartments<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:00.659> would<00:02:00.929> have<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.200> demonstrate

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
compartments I would have to demonstrate

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.039 
compartments I would have to demonstrate
there<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.770> no<00:02:02.280> migration<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.270> smoke<00:02:03.600> into

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
there is no migration of smoke into

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.980 
there is no migration of smoke into
occupied<00:02:04.679> areas<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.850> calving<00:02:06.179> or<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.010 
the last part of the campaigning is the
smoke<00:02:44.160> evacuation<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> coffee<00:02:45.090> for<00:02:45.840> that

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
smoke evacuation in the coffee for that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.920 
smoke evacuation in the coffee for that
we<00:02:46.470> try<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.680> demonstrate<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:48.480> emergency

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
we try to demonstrate that the emergency

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.500 
we try to demonstrate that the emergency
procedure<00:02:49.320> for<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.740> smoke<00:02:49.980> evacuation<00:02:50.510> is

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
procedure for the smoke evacuation is

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.100 
procedure for the smoke evacuation is
effective<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:53.010> what<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:53.430> do<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:54.210> inject<00:02:54.600> for

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
effective so what we do is we inject for

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.740 
effective so what we do is we inject for
seven<00:02:55.380> seconds<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.980> smoke<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.640> cockpit<00:02:56.820> so

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
seven seconds to smoke in the cockpit so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.840 
seven seconds to smoke in the cockpit so
the<00:02:57.870> pilot<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.410> totally<00:02:58.860> blind<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.340> cannot

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
the pilot is totally blind and cannot

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.090 
the pilot is totally blind and cannot
see<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.420> flight<00:03:00.630> instrument<00:03:01.140> then<00:03:01.680> here<00:03:01.950> it

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
see the flight instrument then here it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.690 
see the flight instrument then here it
will<00:03:02.130> start<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:03.560> emergency<00:03:04.560> procedure<00:03:05.460> which

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
will start the emergency procedure which

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.140 
will start the emergency procedure which
consists<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.350> pressurization<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
consists on the pressurization of the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.530 
consists on the pressurization of the
aircraft<00:03:09.560> by<00:03:10.560> opening<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.640> bulb<00:03:12.270> that

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
aircraft by opening the bulb that

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.750 
aircraft by opening the bulb that
regulate<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> pressure<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.920> cabin<00:03:14.100> then

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
regulate the pressure in the cabin then

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.640 
regulate the pressure in the cabin then
he<00:03:14.940> will<00:03:15.060> start<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.630> emergency<00:03:16.110> descent<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.620> a

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
he will start the emergency descent to a

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.100 
he will start the emergency descent to a
safe<00:03:16.950> altitude<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:18.030> finally<00:03:18.420> he<00:03:18.570> will<00:03:18.780> he

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
safe altitude and finally he will he

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.220 
safe altitude and finally he will he
will<00:03:19.730> address<00:03:20.730> their<00:03:21.030> condition<00:03:21.510> into<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> high

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
will address their condition into a high

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.030 
will address their condition into a high
flow<00:03:22.530> mode<00:03:22.770> so<00:03:23.160> their<00:03:24.000> conditioning<00:03:24.510> air<00:03:24.690> is

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
flow mode so their conditioning air is

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.090 
flow mode so their conditioning air is
pushing<00:03:26.040> smoke<00:03:26.880> out<00:03:27.150> bore<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.600> aircraft

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
pushing smoke out bore of the aircraft

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.860 
pushing smoke out bore of the aircraft
finally<00:03:29.100> within<00:03:29.460> three<00:03:29.910> minutes<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.450> the

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
finally within three minutes the the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.280 
finally within three minutes the the
pilot<00:03:31.110> will<00:03:31.500> we'll<00:03:31.920> be<00:03:32.130> able<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.900> see<00:03:34.110> all

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
pilot will we'll be able to to see all

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.080 
pilot will we'll be able to to see all
the<00:03:34.470> flight<00:03:34.680> instruments<00:03:35.040> all<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.700> panels

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
the flight instruments all the panels

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.320 
the flight instruments all the panels
and<00:03:36.300> we'll<00:03:37.290> be<00:03:37.470> able<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.100> fly<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.670> aircraft

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
and we'll be able to fly the aircraft

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.360 
and we'll be able to fly the aircraft
normally<00:03:39.960> for<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.590> test<00:03:40.830> we<00:03:40.980> will<00:03:41.160> have

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
normally for this test we will have

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.940 
normally for this test we will have
Transport<00:03:41.880> Canada<00:03:41.970> with<00:03:42.330> us<00:03:42.480> as<00:03:42.660> well<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:43.320> will

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
Transport Canada with us as well we will

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.160 
Transport Canada with us as well we will
have<00:03:44.190> our<00:03:44.220> camera<00:03:44.850> in<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> door<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:46.020> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
have our camera in in the door of the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.170 
have our camera in in the door of the
coffee<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:46.800> we<00:03:46.980> can<00:03:47.190> assess<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
coffee so we can assess that the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.610 
coffee so we can assess that the
operational<00:03:48.930> problem<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.860> enough<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:50.960> that<00:03:51.960> a

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
operational problem is enough and that a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.800 
operational problem is enough and that a
clear<00:03:53.010> procedure<00:03:53.460> of<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> smoke<00:03:54.060> coffee<00:03:54.510> is

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
clear procedure of the smoke coffee is

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.650 
clear procedure of the smoke coffee is
also<00:03:55.230> good<00:03:58.490> so<00:03:59.490> far<00:03:59.760> we<00:03:59.940> are<00:04:00.030> very<00:04:00.210> happy<00:04:00.360> with
