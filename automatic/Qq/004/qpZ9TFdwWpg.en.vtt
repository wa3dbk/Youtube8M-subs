this<00:01:53.079> process<00:01:53.439> of<00:01:53.950> blow<00:01:54.100> drying<00:01:54.280> my<00:01:54.369> hair

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
this process of blow drying my hair

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.520 
this process of blow drying my hair
because<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:55.030> did<00:01:55.329> not<00:01:55.360> want<00:01:55.539> to<00:01:55.810> have<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:55.990> be<00:01:56.380> in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
because I did not want to have to be in

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.670 
because I did not want to have to be in
the<00:01:56.680> bathroom<00:01:56.860> forever<00:01:57.310> is<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:58.240> was<00:01:58.680> constantly

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
the bathroom forever is I was constantly

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.830 
the bathroom forever is I was constantly
combing<00:02:00.130> through<00:02:00.430> my<00:02:00.549> hair<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:01.030> if<00:02:01.149> you're<00:02:01.390> not

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
combing through my hair so if you're not

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.810 
combing through my hair so if you're not
a<00:02:02.170> person<00:02:02.590> who<00:02:02.619> likes<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:03.070> comb<00:02:03.310> or<00:02:03.460> brush<00:02:03.490> your

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
a person who likes to comb or brush your

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.039 
a person who likes to comb or brush your
hair<00:02:03.850> then<00:02:04.330> this<00:02:04.539> might<00:02:04.720> not<00:02:04.840> be<00:02:04.899> the

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
hair then this might not be the

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.899 
hair then this might not be the
technique<00:02:05.530> for<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.890> but<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.280> works<00:02:06.520> for<00:02:06.789> me

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
technique for you but this works for me

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.180 
technique for you but this works for me
and<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.869> makes<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.080> pack<00:02:08.259> process<00:02:08.649> go<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.830> lot

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
and it makes the pack process go a lot

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.430 
and it makes the pack process go a lot
faster<00:02:09.489> so<00:02:10.450> after<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:10.720> got<00:02:10.929> all<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.200> tangles

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
faster so after I got all the tangles

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.970 
faster so after I got all the tangles
out<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:12.569> twisted<00:02:13.569> up<00:02:13.720> each<00:02:13.930> section<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.739> hair

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
out I twisted up each section of hair

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.850 
out I twisted up each section of hair
that<00:02:15.330> way<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.360> could<00:02:16.660> move<00:02:17.019> on<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.470> next<00:02:17.500> and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
that way I could move on to the next and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.400 
that way I could move on to the next and
really<00:02:18.100> just<00:02:18.220> keep<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.549> out<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.850> way

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.960 

there's<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.470> close<00:02:23.739> up<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.100> another<00:02:24.280> section

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
there's a close up of another section

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.699 
there's a close up of another section
this<00:02:25.150> one<00:02:25.299> was<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> little<00:02:25.600> bit<00:02:26.230> dry<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.680> I

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
this one was a little bit dry so I

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.229 
this one was a little bit dry so I
sprayed<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.549> tiny<00:02:27.760> bit<00:02:27.910> with<00:02:28.209> some

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
sprayed it just a tiny bit with some

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.180 
sprayed it just a tiny bit with some
water<00:02:28.569> but<00:02:28.810> again<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.110> was<00:02:29.319> not<00:02:29.500> trying<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.890> soak

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
water but again I was not trying to soak

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.640 
water but again I was not trying to soak
my<00:02:30.220> hair<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.940> just<00:02:31.780> wanted<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.080> make<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.410> easier

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
my hair I just wanted to make it easier

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.440 
my hair I just wanted to make it easier
to<00:02:32.920> comb<00:02:33.160> through<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.670> distribute<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
to comb through and distribute the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.500 
to comb through and distribute the
product<00:02:35.310> focusing<00:02:36.310> on<00:02:36.400> my<00:02:36.519> ends<00:02:37.000> because<00:02:37.180> my

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
product focusing on my ends because my

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.449 
product focusing on my ends because my
ends<00:02:37.810> always<00:02:38.049> seem<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.650> driest<00:02:39.010> they

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
ends always seem to be the driest they

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.759 
ends always seem to be the driest they
are<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.790> oldest<00:02:40.180> part<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.510> your<00:02:40.660> hair<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.680> I

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
are the oldest part of your hair so I

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.400 
are the oldest part of your hair so I
put<00:02:42.069> that<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.510> tango<00:02:43.510> with<00:02:43.660> my<00:02:43.690> fingers<00:02:44.170> for<00:02:44.349> a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
put that in tango with my fingers for a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.949 
put that in tango with my fingers for a
little<00:02:44.680> bit<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:45.940> also<00:02:46.060> wear<00:02:46.299> gloves<00:02:46.630> if

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
little bit you can also wear gloves if

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.020 
little bit you can also wear gloves if
you've<00:02:47.290> got<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.739> snags<00:02:48.160> on<00:02:48.340> your<00:02:48.519> nails<00:02:48.760> or

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
you've got like snags on your nails or

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.860 
you've got like snags on your nails or
something<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:50.820> forgot<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:52.000> use<00:02:52.329> gloves<00:02:52.600> because

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
something I forgot to use gloves because

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.900 
something I forgot to use gloves because
my<00:02:53.230> nails<00:02:53.440> were<00:02:53.560> kind<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:53.980> snagging<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:54.640> in

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
my nails were kind of snagging but in

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.370 
my nails were kind of snagging but in
hindsight<00:02:55.450> that's<00:02:55.870> what<00:02:56.019> I<00:02:56.049> would<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.290> done

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
hindsight that's what I would have done

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.440 
hindsight that's what I would have done
so<00:02:57.160> I'm<00:02:57.280> combing<00:02:57.489> through<00:02:57.850> first<00:02:58.150> with<00:02:58.359> my

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
so I'm combing through first with my

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.530 
so I'm combing through first with my
wide<00:02:58.630> tooth<00:02:58.900> comb<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.739> then<00:03:00.310> use<00:03:00.670> my<00:03:00.970> denman

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
wide tooth comb and I then use my denman

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.840 
wide tooth comb and I then use my denman
brush<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.319> seven<00:03:03.100> row<00:03:03.340> denman

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
brush and this is a seven row denman

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.430 
brush and this is a seven row denman
brush<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:04.269> I<00:03:04.359> got<00:03:05.459> from<00:03:06.459> Sally<00:03:06.790> yes<00:03:07.359> it<00:03:08.290> was<00:03:08.380> a

brush that I got from Sally yes it was a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.979 
brush that I got from Sally yes it was a

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
gift it comes from Sally's so I used

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.890 
gift it comes from Sally's so I used
this<00:03:11.230> den<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.739> brush<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:12.190> lot<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.090> used<00:03:13.690> it

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
this den and brush a lot and I used it

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.390 
this den and brush a lot and I used it
in<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.079> other<00:03:14.230> section<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:14.829> for<00:03:15.040> some<00:03:15.160> reason

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
in the other section but for some reason

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.789 
in the other section but for some reason
I<00:03:15.459> didn't<00:03:15.760> include<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.060> footage<00:03:16.470> then<00:03:17.470> I

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
I didn't include the footage then I

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.200 
I didn't include the footage then I
twisted<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.639> back<00:03:18.850> twisted<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.510> all<00:03:19.660> up<00:03:19.870> and

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
twisted it back twisted it all up and

want to blow dry my hair when it was
really<00:03:28.620> wet<00:03:28.830> because<00:03:29.160> that's<00:03:29.370> how<00:03:29.520> you<00:03:29.610> can

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
really wet because that's how you can

twist that out of the way and then move
on<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.020> other<00:05:35.229> half<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:36.460> you<00:05:36.520> can<00:05:36.639> kind<00:05:36.759> of

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
on to the other half and you can kind of

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.189 
on to the other half and you can kind of
see<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.389> it<00:05:37.539> would<00:05:37.840> have<00:05:37.960> been<00:05:38.020> a<00:05:38.080> really

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
see that it would have been a really

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.320 
see that it would have been a really
nice<00:05:38.379> twist<00:05:38.680> out<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:39.009> guess<00:05:39.490> but<00:05:39.879> it<00:05:40.030> was<00:05:40.150> still

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
nice twist out I guess but it was still

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.119 
nice twist out I guess but it was still
kind<00:05:40.479> of<00:05:40.509> damp<00:05:40.780> so<00:05:41.080> probably<00:05:41.590> look<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:41.979> great

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
kind of damp so probably look that great

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.399 
kind of damp so probably look that great
but<00:05:42.909> same<00:05:43.750> thing<00:05:43.930> with<00:05:44.080> all<00:05:44.229> my<00:05:44.379> other

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
but same thing with all my other

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.439 
but same thing with all my other
sections<00:05:45.039> using<00:05:45.280> my<00:05:45.460> denman<00:05:45.789> brush<00:05:45.819> to<00:05:46.180> smooth

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
sections using my denman brush to smooth

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.689 
sections using my denman brush to smooth
out<00:05:46.569> more<00:05:46.780> tangles<00:05:47.229> and<00:05:47.470> then<00:05:47.979> using<00:05:48.310> that<00:05:48.340> as

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
out more tangles and then using that as

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.290 
out more tangles and then using that as
i<00:05:48.759> did<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.419> tension<00:05:49.960> brush<00:05:50.379> method<00:05:50.979> on<00:05:51.940> low

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
i did a tension brush method on low

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.210 
i did a tension brush method on low
speed<00:05:52.360> the<00:05:52.930> medium<00:05:53.319> heat<00:05:53.530> and<00:05:53.800> then<00:05:54.009> when<00:05:54.190> I

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
speed the medium heat and then when I

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.820 
speed the medium heat and then when I
was<00:05:54.370> done<00:05:54.430> drying<00:05:55.000> it<00:05:55.240> I<00:05:55.360> used<00:05:55.569> a<00:05:55.720> cool<00:05:55.930> shot<00:05:56.139> to

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
was done drying it I used a cool shot to

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.320 
was done drying it I used a cool shot to
close<00:05:57.069> the<00:05:57.219> cuticle

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.809 

and<00:06:00.750> this<00:06:01.020> whole<00:06:01.169> process<00:06:01.379> probably<00:06:02.370> took<00:06:02.610> me

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819 
and this whole process probably took me

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.929 
and this whole process probably took me
from<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.810> start<00:06:04.169> of<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.530> flying<00:06:05.490> leap<00:06:05.759> into

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:05.939 
from the start of the flying leap into

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:07.550 
from the start of the flying leap into
the<00:06:06.180> end<00:06:06.449> of<00:06:06.569> blow<00:06:06.689> drying<00:06:06.930> it<00:06:07.080> probably<00:06:07.439> took

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
the end of blow drying it probably took

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.629 
the end of blow drying it probably took
me<00:06:07.710> about<00:06:07.830> an<00:06:07.949> hour<00:06:09.770> so<00:06:10.770> much<00:06:10.949> faster<00:06:11.400> than<00:06:11.550> the

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
me about an hour so much faster than the

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.969 
me about an hour so much faster than the
last<00:06:11.789> time<00:06:11.939> I<00:06:12.090> used<00:06:12.210> to<00:06:12.419> blow<00:06:12.569> dry<00:06:12.719> my<00:06:12.750> hair<00:06:12.979> but

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
last time I used to blow dry my hair but

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.089 
last time I used to blow dry my hair but
let<00:06:14.669> me<00:06:14.699> know<00:06:14.759> what<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.090> guys<00:06:15.210> think<00:06:16.099> from

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
let me know what you guys think from

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.950 
let me know what you guys think from
here<00:06:17.400> you<00:06:17.580> could<00:06:17.759> do<00:06:17.879> a<00:06:17.909> protective<00:06:18.449> style<00:06:18.750> you

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
here you could do a protective style you

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.990 
here you could do a protective style you
could<00:06:19.139> do<00:06:19.319> an<00:06:19.620> updo<00:06:20.069> you<00:06:20.280> could<00:06:20.430> do<00:06:20.550> all<00:06:20.580> kinds

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
could do an updo you could do all kinds

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.059 
could do an updo you could do all kinds
of<00:06:21.060> stuff<00:06:22.310> you<00:06:23.310> could<00:06:24.289> put<00:06:25.289> it<00:06:25.409> on<00:06:25.500> flexi<00:06:25.860> rods

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
of stuff you could put it on flexi rods

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.939 
of stuff you could put it on flexi rods
and<00:06:26.580> do<00:06:27.000> like<00:06:27.240> one<00:06:27.539> type<00:06:27.810> curl<00:06:28.110> you<00:06:28.650> could<00:06:28.800> do

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
and do like one type curl you could do

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:30.499 
and do like one type curl you could do
anything<00:06:29.340> once<00:06:29.669> your<00:06:29.819> hair<00:06:29.939> is<00:06:30.030> stretched<00:06:30.270> out
