only<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.469> water<00:00:37.710> heaters<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.129> will<00:00:38.280> work

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
only a two water heaters that will work

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.530 
only a two water heaters that will work
out<00:00:38.790> here<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> Bradford<00:00:40.410> white<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
out here there's the Bradford white and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.619 
out here there's the Bradford white and
this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.750> 50<00:00:43.410> gallon<00:00:44.090> it's<00:00:45.090> forty<00:00:45.480> two

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
this is a 50 gallon it's forty two

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
this is a 50 gallon it's forty two
thousand<00:00:46.230> BTUs<00:00:46.890> which<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> bigger<00:00:48.059> size

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
thousand BTUs which is the bigger size

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.350 
thousand BTUs which is the bigger size
and<00:00:49.100> notice<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> clear<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:51.120> easily

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and notice if the clear is really easily

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.900 
and notice if the clear is really easily
right<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.129> only<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> 20<00:00:53.760> inch

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
right here because it's only a 20 inch

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
right here because it's only a 20 inch
wide<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.399> compared<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.579> 22<00:00:57.360> inch<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
wide and compared to a 22 inch of the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.029 
wide and compared to a 22 inch of the
room<00:00:59.210> now<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> other<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.350> road<00:01:01.710> I'll

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
room now the other is the road I'll

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.939 
room now the other is the road I'll
water<00:01:02.399> heaters<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.170> but<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.379> haven't<00:01:04.589> found

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
anybody that stocks those the less than

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.820 
anybody that stocks those the less than
two<00:01:08.670> week<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.240> factory<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.229> delivery

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
two week and factory you know delivery

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.429 
two week and factory you know delivery
I'll<00:01:11.460> keep<00:01:11.700> looking<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.990> Bradford

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
I'll keep looking but this Bradford

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.219 
I'll keep looking but this Bradford
white<00:01:13.619> works<00:01:14.100> pretty<00:01:14.310> good<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.090> mean<00:01:16.080> it's

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
white works pretty good here I mean it's

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.859 
white works pretty good here I mean it's
a<00:01:16.290> nice<00:01:16.500> fit<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.340> direct<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.880> it's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
a nice fit and it's direct that it's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.450 
a nice fit and it's direct that it's
actually<00:01:19.140> running<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:20.630> go<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.780> here

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.510 

so<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.480> exhaust<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.560> coming<00:01:26.620> out<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.490> can

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
so the exhaust is coming out you can

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.080 
so the exhaust is coming out you can
kind<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:27.850> see<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.300> heat<00:01:28.510> waves<00:01:28.780> they're

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
kind of see the heat waves they're

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.370 
kind of see the heat waves they're
coming<00:01:31.090> out<00:01:31.180> of<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.360> round<00:01:31.600> part<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.290> then

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
coming out of the round part and then

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.970 
coming out of the round part and then
it's<00:01:32.740> sucking<00:01:33.220> in<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:34.360> combustion<00:01:34.750> air<00:01:35.110> right

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
it's sucking in the combustion air right

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.750 
it's sucking in the combustion air right
there<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.620> makes<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:39.070> work<00:01:39.370> in<00:01:39.640> the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
there and and that makes it work in the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.940 
there and and that makes it work in the
confined<00:01:40.240> space<00:01:40.479> closet<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.530> couple

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
confined space closet and so a couple

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.150 
confined space closet and so a couple
other<00:01:45.070> things<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.520> want<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.700> show<00:01:45.880> on<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.150> job<00:01:46.360> a

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
other things I want to show on the job a

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:56.210 
other things I want to show on the job a
gas<00:01:48.160> trap<00:01:49.830> also<00:01:53.700> requires<00:01:54.700> vacuum<00:01:55.660> breaker

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
gas trap also requires vacuum breaker

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.859 
gas trap also requires vacuum breaker
actually<00:01:58.080> they<00:01:59.080> have<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.259> mixing<00:01:59.710> valve<00:01:59.950> here

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
actually they have a mixing valve here

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.969 
actually they have a mixing valve here
always<00:02:01.869> should<00:02:02.259> replace<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.800> mixing<00:02:03.160> valve

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
always should replace the mixing valve

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.190 
always should replace the mixing valve
there's<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.040> check<00:02:06.340> valve<00:02:06.720> for<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.750> aquatherm

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
there's a check valve for the aquatherm

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.130 
there's a check valve for the aquatherm
I<00:02:08.649> actually<00:02:09.310> end<00:02:09.459> up<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:09.790> remove<00:02:10.209> on<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.929> newer

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
I actually end up I remove on the newer

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.050 
I actually end up I remove on the newer
aquatherm<00:02:11.590> they<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.130> check<00:02:12.400> valve<00:02:12.430> inside

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
aquatherm they have a check valve inside

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.720 
aquatherm they have a check valve inside
the<00:02:13.209> pump<00:02:13.450> it's<00:02:13.720> really<00:02:14.080> small<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.739> remove<00:02:15.520> that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
the pump it's really small I remove that

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.790 
the pump it's really small I remove that
and<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.120> use<00:02:16.270> this<00:02:16.390> bigger<00:02:16.630> check<00:02:16.930> valve<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.709> the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
and I use this bigger check valve on the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.250 
and I use this bigger check valve on the
outside<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.340> gets<00:02:18.520> actual<00:02:18.880> better<00:02:19.090> flow<00:02:19.540> you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
outside and gets actual better flow you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.650 
outside and gets actual better flow you
get<00:02:20.380> better<00:02:20.590> heat<00:02:20.860> in<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> wintertime<00:02:21.489> and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.220
