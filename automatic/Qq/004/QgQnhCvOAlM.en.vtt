00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
how the skin things going i decided to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.570 
how the skin things going i decided to
try<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.800> bathroom<00:00:23.189> thinking<00:00:23.460> that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
try to do the bathroom thinking that

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.480 
try to do the bathroom thinking that
that<00:00:23.699> would<00:00:23.850> be<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> most<00:00:24.330> true<00:00:24.720> lighting<00:00:25.490> but

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
that would be the most true lighting but

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.859 
that would be the most true lighting but
it<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.699> still<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.970> little<00:00:27.119> shadowy<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.810> I

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
it is still a little shadowy so I

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.429 
it is still a little shadowy so I
apologize<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:30.080> it's<00:00:31.080> been<00:00:31.260> going

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
apologize for that but it's been going

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.260 
apologize for that but it's been going
well<00:00:31.610> that<00:00:32.610> pull<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.989> my<00:00:34.440> nose<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.640> not<00:00:35.850> gone

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
well that pull on my nose it's not gone

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.020 
well that pull on my nose it's not gone
but<00:00:37.079> I'd<00:00:37.350> say<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.800> probably<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.430> about<00:00:38.760> half

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
but I'd say it probably is about half

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
but I'd say it probably is about half
the<00:00:39.270> size<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.690> had<00:00:39.870> been<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.770> given<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> fact

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the size that had been so given the fact

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.160 
the size that had been so given the fact
that<00:00:41.700> professionals<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.719> said<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.960> would<00:00:43.050> be

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that professionals and said it would be

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.770 
that professionals and said it would be
pretty<00:00:43.350> darn<00:00:43.620> hard<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> ever<00:00:44.780> get

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
pretty darn hard for that ever get

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.720 
pretty darn hard for that ever get
filled<00:00:46.020> back<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:47.030> I'm<00:00:48.030> feeling<00:00:48.390> confident<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
filled back in I'm feeling confident in

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.549 
filled back in I'm feeling confident in
my<00:00:50.730> little<00:00:50.940> experiment<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.600> then<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.199> far<00:00:52.410> as

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
my little experiment and then as far as

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.720 
my little experiment and then as far as
my<00:00:52.920> forehead<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.149> said<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.719> prior<00:00:55.730> blog

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
my forehead like I said in my prior blog

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.450 
my forehead like I said in my prior blog
my<00:00:57.710> because<00:00:58.710> I've<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:59.010> such<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.250> short

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
my because I've got such a short

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.389 
my because I've got such a short
forehead<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.570> since<00:01:01.020> i<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.410> teen<00:01:01.620> I've<00:01:02.129> had

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
forehead but since i was a teen I've had

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.700 
forehead but since i was a teen I've had
lines<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.750> guess<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> constant

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
lines because of I guess that constant

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
lines because of I guess that constant
you<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.580> raising<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:07.140> would

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you know I was raising up and I would

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.899 
you know I was raising up and I would
say<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.560> far<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.830> my<00:01:07.979> forehead<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
say as far as my forehead it's kind of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.300 
say as far as my forehead it's kind of
like<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.240> parting<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> Red<00:01:09.840> Sea<00:01:10.310> because

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
like the parting of the Red Sea because

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.210 
like the parting of the Red Sea because
it's<00:01:12.299> smoothing<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.200> lot<00:01:13.530> writes<00:01:13.860> back

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it's smoothing out a lot writes back

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
it's smoothing out a lot writes back
down<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> middle<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.630> side<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
down the middle but then on the side I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.630 
down the middle but then on the side I
still<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.439> some<00:01:16.650> lives<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> don't<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.580> if

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
still have some lives so I don't know if

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
still have some lives so I don't know if
you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.880> tell<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:19.049> how<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.500> like

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you can tell that but see how it's like

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.230 
you can tell that but see how it's like
it's<00:01:19.890> smooth<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:20.880> they're<00:01:21.030> just

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it's smooth here and then they're just

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.510 
it's smooth here and then they're just
still<00:01:21.630> some<00:01:21.869> lights<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.259> either<00:01:22.380> side<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.009> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
still some lights on either side here so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.219 
still some lights on either side here so
that's<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.000> take<00:01:24.150> some<00:01:24.210> time<00:01:24.390> plus<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
that's going to take some time plus you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.679 
that's going to take some time plus you
figure<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.560> constantly<00:01:26.009> still<00:01:26.600> causing<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
figure out constantly still causing the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.039 
figure out constantly still causing the
creases<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.619> my<00:01:29.600> my<00:01:30.600> facial

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
creases because of my my facial

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.850 
creases because of my my facial
expressions<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.659> everything<00:01:33.659> else<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.259> don't

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
expressions but everything else I don't

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.679 
expressions but everything else I don't
know<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.040> can<00:01:35.159> tell<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.790> comparison<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
know if you can tell in comparison to

end up trying to pick them out and then
when<00:02:00.910> i<00:02:00.940> try<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.120> kick<00:02:01.330> them<00:02:01.450> out<00:02:01.510> i<00:02:01.570> end<00:02:01.750> up

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
when i try to kick them out i end up

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.130 
when i try to kick them out i end up
causing<00:02:02.440> like<00:02:02.920> an<00:02:03.760> actual<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:05.110> know

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
causing like an actual you know

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.660 
causing like an actual you know
something<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.530> actually<00:02:05.620> has<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.220> scab<00:02:06.490> over

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
something that actually has to scab over

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.300 
something that actually has to scab over
and<00:02:07.000> then<00:02:07.090> he'll<00:02:07.360> but<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.229> call<00:02:08.500> them<00:02:08.619> seeds<00:02:08.979> and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
and then he'll but I call them seeds and

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.420 
and then he'll but I call them seeds and
it's<00:02:09.760> when<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.000> sebum<00:02:10.420> gets<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.770> hard

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
it's when the sebum gets so hard

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's when the sebum gets so hard
underneath<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.270> skin<00:02:13.540> layer<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:15.580> if

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
underneath the skin layer that it's if

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.180 
underneath the skin layer that it's if
you<00:02:16.270> know<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.690> got<00:02:17.230> past<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.770> point<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.040> it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
you know it got past the point of it

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.500 
you know it got past the point of it
just<00:02:18.280> being<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.580> white<00:02:18.760> head<00:02:18.940> where<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.300> could

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
just being a white head where you could

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.380 
just being a white head where you could
like<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.960> know<00:02:19.990> pop<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.410> out<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.680> sorry<00:02:21.520> to

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
like you know pop it out and sorry to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.500 
like you know pop it out and sorry to
too<00:02:22.900> much<00:02:23.050> info<00:02:23.650> right<00:02:23.800> but<00:02:24.310> um<00:02:24.520> anyway<00:02:25.300> and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
too much info right but um anyway and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.030 
too much info right but um anyway and
then<00:02:25.810> usually<00:02:26.140> have<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.410> prick<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.770> little

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
then usually have like prick a little

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.890 
then usually have like prick a little
hole<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.850> be<00:02:27.970> able<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.450> little<00:02:28.600> seed

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
hole to be able to get the little seed

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.690 
hole to be able to get the little seed
to<00:02:29.080> actually<00:02:29.470> come<00:02:29.650> out<00:02:29.680> since<00:02:30.400> I've<00:02:30.580> been

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
to actually come out since I've been

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.770 
to actually come out since I've been
doing<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:32.160> those<00:02:33.160> are<00:02:33.460> pretty<00:02:33.640> much<00:02:33.880> they

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
doing this those are pretty much they

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.970 
doing this those are pretty much they
never<00:02:34.930> get<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.410> point<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.520> been<00:02:36.970> I

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
never get to that point like I been I

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.440 
never get to that point like I been I
feel<00:02:38.980> like<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.370> feel<00:02:39.730> like<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.060> little<00:02:40.180> see

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
feel like I feel like that little see

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.390 
feel like I feel like that little see
donate<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.840> skin<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.410> by<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.070> next<00:02:42.220> morning

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
donate the skin and by the next morning

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.600 
donate the skin and by the next morning
it's<00:02:43.060> softened<00:02:43.690> up<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.740> can<00:02:44.980> just<00:02:45.280> be

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
it's softened up so that it can just be

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.180 
it's softened up so that it can just be
exfoliated<00:02:46.600> off<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.410> haven't<00:02:47.830> been<00:02:47.920> having

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
exfoliated off so I haven't been having

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.070 
exfoliated off so I haven't been having
to<00:02:48.310> worry<00:02:48.460> about<00:02:48.490> by<00:02:48.790> poking<00:02:49.180> at<00:02:49.330> my<00:02:49.450> skin<00:02:49.750> or

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
to worry about by poking at my skin or

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.270 
to worry about by poking at my skin or
anything<00:02:50.320> like<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:50.770> thought<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:50.980> was

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
anything like that so I thought that was

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.150 
anything like that so I thought that was
really<00:02:51.460> good<00:02:51.670> too<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.660> once<00:02:53.560> again<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:54.040> know

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
really good too so once again you know

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.240 
really good too so once again you know
the<00:02:54.280> recipe<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:55.060> basically<00:02:57.750> 75%<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:59.250> wolves

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
the recipe is basically 75% of wolves

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.630 
the recipe is basically 75% of wolves
are<00:03:00.430> twenty-five<00:03:00.850> percent<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.130> DMSO<00:03:03.130> to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
are twenty-five percent of the DMSO to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.850 
are twenty-five percent of the DMSO to
seventy-five<00:03:04.090> percent<00:03:04.330> water<00:03:04.739> but<00:03:05.739> it's

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
seventy-five percent water but it's

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.990 
seventy-five percent water but it's
funny<00:03:06.070> because<00:03:06.280> actually<00:03:06.790> I've<00:03:06.880> been

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
funny because actually I've been

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.220 
funny because actually I've been
experimenting<00:03:07.360> since<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.870> was<00:03:08.020> seeing

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
experimenting since I was seeing

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.570 
experimenting since I was seeing
progress<00:03:08.440> with<00:03:08.709> my<00:03:08.830> nose<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.190> I'm<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.400> very

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
progress with my nose and I'm a very

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.330 
progress with my nose and I'm a very
impatient<00:03:09.730> person<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:11.380> started<00:03:12.070> just<00:03:12.190> actually

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
impatient person I started just actually

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.290 
impatient person I started just actually
putting<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:12.910> full<00:03:13.209> string<00:03:13.830> DMSO<00:03:14.830> on<00:03:15.070> so<00:03:15.730> I

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
putting this full string DMSO on so I

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.320 
putting this full string DMSO on so I
think<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.840> all<00:03:17.020> depends<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.650> how<00:03:17.940> sensitive<00:03:18.940> of

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
think it all depends on how sensitive of

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.449 
think it all depends on how sensitive of
a<00:03:19.840> skin<00:03:20.080> type<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.500> have<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.070> probably

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
a skin type you have so you probably

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.070 
a skin type you have so you probably
should<00:03:21.670> start<00:03:21.970> with<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.239> percentage<00:03:22.780> and

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
should start with that percentage and

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.580 
should start with that percentage and
then<00:03:23.680> if<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.160> feel<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.550> your<00:03:25.239> skin<00:03:25.630> type<00:03:25.930> can

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
then if you feel that your skin type can

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.670 
then if you feel that your skin type can
take<00:03:27.430> on<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.880> higher<00:03:28.270> string<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.930> that

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
take on a higher string of that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.120 
take on a higher string of that
percentage<00:03:30.160> then<00:03:30.670> go<00:03:31.270> for<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.800> anyway<00:03:32.800> so<00:03:32.890> it's

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
percentage then go for it anyway so it's

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.750 
percentage then go for it anyway so it's
that<00:03:33.820> 7525<00:03:34.810> as<00:03:35.019> far<00:03:35.170> as<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.380> dns<00:03:35.709> oh<00:03:35.890> then<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
that 7525 as far as the dns oh then the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.580 
that 7525 as far as the dns oh then the
MSM<00:03:38.100> liquid

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
MSM liquid

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.140 
MSM liquid
actually<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.069> got<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:40.310> right<00:03:40.430> here<00:03:40.489> cept<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.000> got

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
gel mask and it starts to you know like

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.320 
gel mask and it starts to you know like
kind<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.680> flake<00:04:33.919> off<00:04:34.160> but<00:04:34.580> after<00:04:34.760> it<00:04:35.000> gets<00:04:35.090> dry
