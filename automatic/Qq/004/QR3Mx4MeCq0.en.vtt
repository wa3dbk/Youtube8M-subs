just really like it that's kind of the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.240 
just really like it that's kind of the
same<00:02:48.570> thing<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.959> review<00:02:49.260> about<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.220> I

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
same thing on a review about it so I

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.540 
same thing on a review about it so I
think<00:02:50.610> about<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.090> 0:04<00:02:51.959> revlon<00:02:52.470> matte

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
think about it 0:04 revlon matte

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.570 
think about it 0:04 revlon matte
lipstick<00:02:53.550> they're<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.120> five<00:02:54.390> six<00:02:54.660> dollars

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
lipstick they're like five six dollars

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.600 
lipstick they're like five six dollars
at<00:02:56.580> Ulta<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.410> go<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.590> like<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> jokester

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
at Ulta but if you go to like a jokester

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.070 
at Ulta but if you go to like a jokester
sometimes<00:03:00.060> they're<00:03:00.239> more<00:03:00.420> expensive<00:03:00.959> but

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
sometimes they're more expensive but

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.570 
sometimes they're more expensive but
obviously<00:03:01.470> they<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.800> sales<00:03:02.070> on<00:03:02.250> them<00:03:02.430> and

obviously they have sales on them and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.430 
obviously they have sales on them and
