there<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:09.600> what<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.650> something<00:03:11.010> Kyocera<00:03:11.640> is

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
there it is what is something Kyocera is

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.120 
there it is what is something Kyocera is

smart sonic receiver to see conduction

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.750

it's<00:03:19.050> tissue<00:03:19.260> conduction<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.430> uses

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
it's tissue conduction so uses

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.380 
it's tissue conduction so uses

phone even in under the loudest

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.140 
phone even in under the loudest
conditions<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:28.950> you're<00:03:29.459> not<00:03:29.580> relying<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.030> our

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150

normal<00:03:30.390> speaker<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.690> also<00:03:30.810> makes<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.350> phone

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
normal speaker it also makes the phone

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.020 
normal speaker it also makes the phone
look<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.709> lot<00:03:31.830> sleeker<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.519> makes<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.760> so

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
look a lot sleeker and it makes it so

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.229 
look a lot sleeker and it makes it so
they<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.239> have<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.540> be<00:03:33.870> waterproof<00:03:34.820> so<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:36.209> a

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
they can have it be waterproof so on a

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.550 
they can have it be waterproof so on a
normal<00:03:36.540> Android<00:03:36.810> phone<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.230> your<00:03:37.410> your

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.730 
phone is inoperable underwater when wet
so<00:05:10.729> I<00:05:11.210> guess<00:05:11.389> you<00:05:11.539> can<00:05:11.690> submerge<00:05:12.530> it

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
so I guess you can submerge it

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.320 
so I guess you can submerge it
underwater<00:05:13.070> but<00:05:13.310> you<00:05:13.430> can't<00:05:13.729> necessarily<00:05:13.880> use

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
underwater but you can't necessarily use

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.820 
underwater but you can't necessarily use
it<00:05:14.750> while<00:05:14.930> it's<00:05:15.139> down<00:05:15.289> there<00:05:15.440> so<00:05:15.620> if<00:05:15.680> you're

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
it while it's down there so if you're

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.379 
it while it's down there so if you're
wanting<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.370> swim<00:05:16.700> around<00:05:16.820> with<00:05:17.060> this<00:05:17.210> phone

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
wanting to swim around with this phone

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.640 
wanting to swim around with this phone
in<00:05:17.539> your<00:05:17.600> pocket<00:05:17.780> I<00:05:18.050> don't<00:05:18.229> think<00:05:18.380> that<00:05:18.530> this

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
in your pocket I don't think that this

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.260 
in your pocket I don't think that this
is<00:05:18.830> necessarily<00:05:19.280> gonna<00:05:19.460> be<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.850> option<00:05:20.060> for

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
is necessarily gonna be the option for

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.750 
is necessarily gonna be the option for
you<00:05:20.570> more<00:05:21.530> built<00:05:21.770> or<00:05:22.010> someone<00:05:22.340> who's<00:05:22.460> gonna<00:05:22.610> be

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
firefighter somewhere that their phone

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.020

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
is gonna take a beating definitely good
