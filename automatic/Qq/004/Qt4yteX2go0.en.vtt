00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
this here looper i'm going to try a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.040 
this here looper i'm going to try a
bundle<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.150> different<00:00:27.449> pedals<00:00:28.580> into<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
let's see how they sound and what they

00:00:33.329 --> 00:01:21.140 
let's see how they sound and what they
can<00:00:33.510> do

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.410 

you
