at<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.730> moment<00:02:09.880> I'd<00:02:10.180> pretty<00:02:10.360> much<00:02:10.450> assume

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
at the moment I'd pretty much assume

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.520 
at the moment I'd pretty much assume
it'd<00:02:10.960> work<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:12.220> all<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.520> voices<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.840> yep

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
it'd work and all the voices so yep

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.080 
it'd work and all the voices so yep
that's<00:02:14.560> definitely<00:02:14.950> worth<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.760> try<00:02:17.940> one<00:02:18.940> I'll

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
that's definitely worth a try one I'll

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.510 
that's definitely worth a try one I'll
quickly<00:02:19.300> go<00:02:19.600> over<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:20.590> one<00:02:20.740> called<00:02:20.920> Zeppelin

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
quickly go over is one called Zeppelin

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.520 
quickly go over is one called Zeppelin

may have problems and the final one is

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.330 
may have problems and the final one is
springtomize<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.720> recently<00:03:20.710> been<00:03:20.860> updated<00:03:20.890> to

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
springtomize to recently been updated to

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.530 
springtomize to recently been updated to
work<00:03:21.790> with<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.180> ipad<00:03:22.690> 2<00:03:23.050> on<00:03:23.380> iOS<00:03:23.590> 5<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.540> it

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
work with the ipad 2 on iOS 5 and it

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.300 
work with the ipad 2 on iOS 5 and it
will<00:03:25.630> lay<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.900> do<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.500> lot<00:03:26.710> of<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:26.920> things<00:03:27.160> that

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
will lay to do a lot of the things that

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.060 
will lay to do a lot of the things that
there<00:03:28.270> are<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.420> lot<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.630> other<00:03:29.500> tweaks<00:03:29.920> for

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
there are a lot of other tweaks for

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.570 
there are a lot of other tweaks for
already<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:30.850> for<00:03:31.660> example<00:03:31.720> if<00:03:32.580> you've

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
already so for example if you've

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.070 
already so for example if you've
probably<00:03:33.790> seen<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.090> trick<00:03:34.420> like<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:34.690> where

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
probably seen a trick like this where

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.900 
probably seen a trick like this where
you<00:03:35.200> can<00:03:35.760> add<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:37.080> sort<00:03:38.080> of<00:03:38.110> effect<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.430> shutting

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
you can add a sort of effect to shutting

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.330 
you can add a sort of effect to shutting
down<00:03:40.120> now<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:41.380> would<00:03:41.500> be<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.680> separate<00:03:42.070> week

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
down now that would be a separate week

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.660 
down now that would be a separate week
normally<00:03:42.730> but<00:03:43.020> springtomize<00:03:44.020> adds<00:03:44.530> its<00:03:44.890> into

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
normally but springtomize adds its into

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.760 
normally but springtomize adds its into
that<00:03:46.030> package<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.870> don't<00:03:47.110> need<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.470> lot<00:03:47.740> of

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
that package so you don't need a lot of

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.820 
that package so you don't need a lot of
tweaks<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:49.780> quickly<00:03:50.050> going<00:03:50.290> through<00:03:50.590> some

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
tweaks just quickly going through some

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.770 
tweaks just quickly going through some
of<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.100> things<00:03:51.520> you<00:03:51.640> can<00:03:51.820> do<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.270> can<00:03:52.420> change

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
of the things you can do you can change

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.740 
of the things you can do you can change
animations<00:03:53.530> that's<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.370> TV<00:03:55.090> animation<00:03:55.450> that

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
animations that's the TV animation that

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.540 
animations that's the TV animation that
you've<00:03:55.840> seen<00:03:56.080> there<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:57.220> can<00:03:57.310> choose<00:03:57.520> to

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
you've seen there and you can choose to

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.580 
you've seen there and you can choose to
