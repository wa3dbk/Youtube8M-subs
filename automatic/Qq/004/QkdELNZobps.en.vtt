 her flaws and insulting her so 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.609
 general are first-timers who do not reach 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.319
 year of being shopkeepers in the suburbs 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.870
 to find what in the 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.359
 adventurers who record their lives 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.060
 all what their duck adventures do 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.560
 looking for things in particular these what 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.959
 Shopkeepers are confused with 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.329
 comedians and geeks it differs that 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.639
 they have two avatars the main one 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.769
 he is a man and a woman besides many 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.009
 members of your channel usually 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.349
 are more than ten for the geek zone that 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.360
 find almost in the center you will find 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.580
 to two types of what in the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.280
 comedians and freak eros comedians 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.550
 they make pure comedy very similar to 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.990
 adventurers 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.750
 unlike them to the adventurers 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.060
 is that the comedians things that 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.820
 do or pass are always at home or 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.470
 near where they live with friends 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.590
 members of his family and he only has 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.900
 an avatar and do not live with so many 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.940
 Geeks are exactly the same but 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.430
 they are very fans of the anime and 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.400
 they always use anime characters and 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.800
 comedians may vary by area 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.230
 metropolitan you find three types of 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.480
 what in the creepy pastry that 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.550
 horror stories tell the pipelines 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.800
 they give tutorials to handle 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.200
 programs and they almost do not use avatar and 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.410
 the informatics that give information of 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.450
 X thing or things and finally the area 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.700
 city ​​center the main one of 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.010
 all there are the locos with 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.770
 experience those that take more time and 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.620
 are more advanced from there you find 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.360
 all picky geeks with experience and 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.940
 that if they know how to criticize comedians 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.420
 adventurers there are even some that 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.240
 they do everything that others do 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.720
 but be careful as there are many 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.730
 perverts if we have already had the 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.150
 experience of one who wanted to connect us 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.880

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.830

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.500
 there are too many perverts and of great 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.380
 level in this city there are perverts 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.410
 first-time experienced strippers 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.700
 pedophile attackers read it with them 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:08.510
