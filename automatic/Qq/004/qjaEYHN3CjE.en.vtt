00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.140
 the bicycle is a brilliant invention 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.450
 without the help of foreign energy one is 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.409
 three times faster than a pedestrian 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.549
 but why do you have to go on one 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.279
 uncomfortable saddle sit 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.740
 why do you have to dismount while stopping ? 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.570
 and why do you pedal? 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.769
 actually around in a circle 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.499
 yes why am I really hello? 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.439
 christoph lenz i'm engineer for 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.780
 Energietechnik and I am more enthusiastic 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.720
 cyclists 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.070
 It's been about three years now 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:45.180
 I thought about these questions 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 you could not build a bike 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.390
 you're comfortable enough to sit around 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.150
 Keep track of road traffic 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:02.550
 and low enough not to go down 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:06.720
 have to stop and not feet 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.750
 further away from the ground than necessary on 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.320
 best as you on the desk 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.050
 chair sits and then the pedals after 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 stepping diagonally down 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:24.240
 This bike should be more compact 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.470
 and be more manoeuvrable than usual 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.060
 I have not lived in Berlin for a long time 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.400
 and the berliner says do not go there 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 Not 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:50.590
 and you know what the berlin is right 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:52.590
 [Music] 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 O 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.720
 [Music] 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.760
 [Music] 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.419
 [Music] 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.569
 Yes 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.750
 is not there's not I that 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.269
 concept so I've implemented 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.970
 now five ready to go 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:40.989
 prototypes and I'm already familiar with them 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:45.400
 certainly driven 4000 kilometers 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.660
 and what can I say goes great 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.620
 otherwise I would not be so much further 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.519
 with driven 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.599
 in march 2013 i got the german 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.879
 Patent Office has a utility model on the 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.870
 drive unit granted a few fans 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.879
 the first hour is already there 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.290
 a minute after mine 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:14.019
 Building instructions as a winter project 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.750
 but so to speak individual productions are 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.419
 consuming and expensive and not everyone has 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.450
 a welding machine or a lathe too 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.730
 That's why I'm here, I want that 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.810
 with bike also affordable for people 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.269
 They do not do that outstanding 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.069
 have crafting skills 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:40.970
 the goal of crowdfunding is one 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:44.750
 Small batch production of at least 20 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.620
 sets of special components to the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.230
 Build a needed with bikes 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.120
 with a production of 20 components 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:04:01.120
 you can set the price for the single set 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:05.690
 I need to keep below 500 euros 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.030
 7500 euro and your support this 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.209
 Support can be different 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:16.120
 look from the preorder one 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:19.269
 bikes about the participation in fittings 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.630
 to the symbolic support 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.560
 on the left side of you right 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.530
 is the list of thank you 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.160
 I would like to emphasize here 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:37.600
 the poster and the postcard series the 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.780
 are designed by singer a crazy 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.990
 type and super good 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.990
 let yourself be surprised 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.650
 so skin in with your help will that 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.650
 What
