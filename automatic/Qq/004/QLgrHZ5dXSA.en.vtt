00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 everything feels youtube lb and we are going to 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:11.610
 install the long-awaited cdr effects of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.309
 is the effect of shutdown type tele 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.520
 old and we 're going to install it here in the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.470
 samsung galaxy s advanced to load not 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.090
 I'm lying down the bar 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.090
 notifications to configurations 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.390
 This key tutorial should clarify that it is 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.129
 a tutorial compatible only with one 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.920
 gt version and 9,070 without termination if 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.140
 has some letter is next to the one of 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.930
 him and 9,070 then I do not think it's 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.530
 compatible most compatible with it and 9,070 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.690
 p so do not try on that phone 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.760
 and the second requirement that 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.460
 we need is obviously the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.860
 regiments always have the root and the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.930
 kernel with the double c here is the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:02.680
 cocol with the double c and other 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.860
 another recommendation is to have a version 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.960
 from android that living but apart 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.370
 modified version of this version that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.220
 you need in this version because it is that 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.760
 it needs one that living modifies 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.280
 it is modified even if it is at a minimum 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.080
 detail but it has to be modified if 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.690
 they try the rom they flopped joker 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.950
 there I do not know what might happen but in the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.040
 post says it must be a network 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.920
 modified so this can work 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.810
 and any other type of mods and how 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.340
 we make this good if here in 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.340
 software update you 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.720
 they install a rom file in a sip them 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.720
 will launch in automatic 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.690
 here says this your device was 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.190
 modified 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.040
 there are no software updates 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.170
 available this is what is required 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.110
 that device is modified 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.790
 even the smallest thing that can be 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.820
 so that this and other modes are 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.920
 compatible with the device already in the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.229
 duke in videos I told you how today 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.929
 when you install the game files of 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.030
 that double m and also the how 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.560
 install the kernel with the respective 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.470
 recovery here in the decision is going to 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.920
 set those videos so they see it 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.500
 and they seized a rom 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.140
 and another thing another clarification is that 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.790
 have you an endorsement of your 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.790
 applications because if something comes to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.319
 go out badly they can restore it and if 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.170
 you already want to flash a 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.580
 new network then in the post of htc mania 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.010
 that here I am going to leave 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.270
 there are several modified roms and in 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.970
 any of sharron can be 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.489
 supports this once and I explained 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.340
 this and here is the page should I 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.910
 I left everything I do with the device 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:56.019
 of account here I just downloaded it 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:59.860
 here is the file called gt and 9,079 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:03.790
 1070 jb crt off 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.010
 and well this is the rom file and 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.760
 here is the link page where 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.770
 can this check is that of the effect 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.110
 since htc mania so 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.990
 I release all things is the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.580
 device and we let it see our 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.150
 memory cards 8 x opens to 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.730
 native we go to the sd card folder that is 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.960
 the internal memory we look for the folder 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.370
 of doubling and here it is and 9,070 jb fix 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.930
 all sides here to move 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.930
 ex that impudence 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.629
 and we give here to see here 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.090
 about writing and they give it because I have it 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.940
 and there it is 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.459
 there is already and now what we are going to do 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.110
 is to restart the recovery mode doing 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.860
 the combination of volume buttons to 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.080
 fix power and home or if they already have the 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.180
 traveling from cover and arrow only 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.709
 open this application and the boot kit 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.030
 which I will also leave here below in the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.860
 description and we give to april 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.190
 here he finished installing it just like that 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.930
 they're going to see how they work here 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.280
 to launch the permit to the super fly hotel 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:27.030
 will allow and reboots 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.889
 and we will proceed to install the effect 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.650
 It is recommended that you use 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.100
 flockwork mode since in previous video 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.400
 I told them how to use tea where rpp but 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.470
 the double rp does not work to install 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.419
 this type of bikes or files to the system 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.300
 so we necessarily need the 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.070
 blower mode this version is not touch 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.770
 so they'll have to do it with the 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.130
 buttons have me take the dream of 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.130
 shoulder here 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:58.060
 and now there's 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.190
 I will tell you but princeton very well already 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.980
 we went back then we are going to give 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.020
 second options before they should make a 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.210
 bank give restore here you can do 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.400
 the backup and stories give zero 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.650
 backup the first option that they will make their 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.630
 backup well let's go to the 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.900
 second option that is crystal if it 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.130
 declares with the home button and we give it 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.160
 to the first option that has been made 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.280
 code is to dedicate 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:29.350
 and we look for the file that says 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.290
 this and 9,070 jb crt 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:37.480
 if we all have here and we give 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.480
 install and it 's install with the other 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:44.749
 7 permissions and that's all we give 

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:44.749
 to which is now 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.940
 that's all let me restart the 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.940
 recovery 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.410
 and that's all 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.930
 he is that started we are going to have the 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.330
 effect that of our brothers 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.729
 since as there is no longer there is no mode 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.460
 completely stable and those are areas 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:12.430
 that have this effect and right now 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.350
 initiate we return well here we just 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.310
 enter the team here is optimizing 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:20.530
 applications like hydro and it's supposed 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.560
 that this effect made a white dalvik h 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.509
 they are restricting again and it is 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.340
 optimizing applications so 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.039
 be patient and he is ending 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.500
 do these well here just reviewed 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:34.660
 start the device we are going to 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.360
 to unlock 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.950
 they realize how it should be and 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:44.160
 now it 's magic 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.590
 we open the shutdown button and there it is 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.750
 it just turned off that way the 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.770
 device and that way they have the 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.210
 srt effect in your galaxy you will mans and 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.010
