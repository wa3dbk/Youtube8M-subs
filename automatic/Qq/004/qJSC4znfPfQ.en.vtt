00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.420

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.830
 which will do before you start 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.140
 I will also say that all the information 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.050
 presented and the video will be 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.960
 purely my opinion so she may not 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.269
 match up with yours start with their top 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.550
 armor is the best choice for a warrior to be 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.950
 armor decree chain mail beetle they 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.860
 bib such a set of armor will give 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.260
 you protection in the amount of 60 one unit a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.300
 also bonus attack speed damage 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.390
 Critical speed of movement 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 damage beyond this when attacking the enemy 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 beetles will fly around you each 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.570
 such a beetle will increase 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.430
 the characteristic of your armor by ten 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.140
 percent 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.020
 the maximum number of bugs is three 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.149
 and if you want to live here more 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.670
 theron rather than apply it then replace 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.460
 chainmail bib this kit will give 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.400
 you have seventy-three protection units and here 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.500
 such a bonus in addition to this every 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.750
 4 seconds around you too 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.270
 appear beetle but unlike its 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.600
 fellow on the mail he will reduce 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.430
 damage done to you by 15 percent 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.650
 total beetles can be no more than three 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.170
 and by the way if you want more detail 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.220
 learn about beetle armor look this 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.500
 video further we will consider the weapon of war here 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.079
 your choice will depend on the situation in 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 which you will get if you decide 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.920
 pass any of the pole 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 then a hammer would work well for that 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.200
 paladin and if your goal is 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.140
 any of the bosses most good 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.909
 the weapon will be a flyer as a universal 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.579
 weapons on you will be nice 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.490
 look there a sword and north pole 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.079
 do not forget to reforge your weapon 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.649
 for the best modification 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.780
 and now the tank’s weapons as well 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.209
 tank then he in my opinion should not 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.610
 deal huge amounts of damage to it 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.160
 The primary task is to protect 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.240
 his allies so he needs 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.880
 something that will allow him to live long 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.240
 this is something called vampire knives 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.730
 with them your tank costs practically 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.200
 immortal but time became turn 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.320
 attention to accessories 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.720
 the warrior is not like that I stood him 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.330
 movable thanks to boots and wings 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.890
 well and at the same time gave him damage and not 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.840
 forget as well as weapons 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.180
 modify your accessories 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.660
 the warrior has to rebuild each of them 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.300
 4 percent damage but the tank 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.430
 mobility is not necessary so I chose 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.190
 for him here is a set of accessories 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.030
 and each of these accessories is good 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.920
 to perekovat on 4 units of protection 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.070
 now asil them that fit well 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.690
 this class, I understand that they are enough 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.330
 a lot and most of them are pretty 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.930
 difficult to manufacture but still it 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.930
 worth trying 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.090
 Well, the last thing I have not told 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.520
 these are bottles for their craft will need 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.530
 filler this machine and you can 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.630
 buy from the healer to do 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.060
 any of the eight vials you will 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.740
 need one bottle of water and 5 pieces 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.170
 any ingredient 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.630
 each bottle when used will give 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.200
 your attacks for 15 minutes any of 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.300
 effects 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.310
 they work only on the weapon of the neighbor 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.270
 fight 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:58.050
 simultaneous use of two 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:04:00.780
 vials impossible but on this perhaps 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.180
