00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
could be some debris in there you take

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.690 
could be some debris in there you take
the<00:01:39.119> spark<00:01:39.390> plugs<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.340> it's<00:01:41.340> gonna<00:01:41.490> flow

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the spark plugs out and it's gonna flow

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
the spark plugs out and it's gonna flow
inside<00:01:42.060> it's<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.750> very<00:01:43.290> hard<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> get

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
inside it's going to be very hard to get

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.749 
inside it's going to be very hard to get
her<00:01:43.979> out<00:01:45.590> it's<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.680> good<00:01:46.799> idea<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.130> both<00:01:47.490> throw

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
her out it's a good idea to both throw

00:01:47.759 --> 00:02:23.940 
her out it's a good idea to both throw
with<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.090> air<00:01:49.020> go

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.880 

once<00:02:24.950> again<00:02:25.540> always<00:02:26.540> hold<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:26.990> wrench<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:27.800> it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
once again always hold the wrench so it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.870 
once again always hold the wrench so it
doesn't<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.370> twisted<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:34.190> very<00:02:34.520> easy<00:02:34.730> to

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
doesn't get twisted it's very easy to

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.449 
doesn't get twisted it's very easy to
break<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.680> ceramic<00:02:36.680> top<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.160> spark<00:02:37.430> plug

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
break the ceramic top of the spark plug

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.820 
break the ceramic top of the spark plug
and<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:38.660> going<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:38.959> very<00:02:39.170> hard<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.560> get<00:02:39.709> it

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
and it's going to be very hard to get it

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.390 
and it's going to be very hard to get it
out<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:39.980> there

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
out of there

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.010 
out of there
I<00:02:45.850> would<00:02:46.850> suggest<00:02:47.000> always<00:02:47.480> using<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
I would suggest always using the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.460 
I would suggest always using the
original<00:02:48.140> spark<00:02:48.680> plugs<00:02:49.959> they<00:02:50.959> seem<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.320> be

original spark plugs they seem to be

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.310 
original spark plugs they seem to be

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
the spark plug holes never always put it

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.710 
the spark plug holes never always put it
into<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:14.989> socket<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:16.580> lower<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.120> carefully

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
into the socket and lower it carefully

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.699 
into the socket and lower it carefully
if<00:03:18.080> you<00:03:18.200> drop<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.739> there<00:03:20.140> most<00:03:21.140> likely<00:03:21.590> you

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
if you drop it in there most likely you

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.080 
if you drop it in there most likely you

will bend the tip of the spark plug and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.370 
will bend the tip of the spark plug and
you're<00:03:26.090> going<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.360> throw<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.630> gap<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:27.080> so

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
you're going to throw the gap of so

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.640 
you're going to throw the gap of so

tight<00:04:18.980> yet<00:04:19.390> you<00:04:20.390> have<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.660> tighten<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.340> one

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
tight yet you have to tighten it one

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.730 
tight yet you have to tighten it one
turn<00:04:22.640> test<00:04:23.090> it<00:04:23.300> that's<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.110> point<00:04:24.320> where<00:04:24.650> it

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
turn test it that's the point where it

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.060 
turn test it that's the point where it
bottoms<00:04:25.070> out<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:26.510> pretty<00:04:26.840> much<00:04:26.990> yeah<00:04:27.860> well

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
bottoms out so pretty much yeah well

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.670 
bottoms out so pretty much yeah well
this<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:28.820> old<00:04:28.970> spark<00:04:29.360> plug<00:04:29.570> this<00:04:30.110> washer<00:04:30.500> over

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
this is old spark plug this washer over

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.390 
this is old spark plug this washer over
here<00:04:30.920> it's<00:04:31.820> a<00:04:31.910> crash<00:04:32.300> washer<00:04:33.130> works<00:04:34.130> like<00:04:34.370> a

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
here it's a crash washer works like a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.700 
here it's a crash washer works like a
seal<00:04:34.790> well<00:04:35.570> this<00:04:35.810> spark<00:04:36.080> plug<00:04:36.140> has<00:04:36.350> been<00:04:36.590> in

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
seal well this spark plug has been in

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.990 
seal well this spark plug has been in
the<00:04:36.800> car<00:04:36.980> already<00:04:37.160> so<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.610> washer<00:04:37.970> is

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
the car already so this washer is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.580 
the car already so this washer is
crashed<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.660> new<00:04:38.810> spark<00:04:39.140> plug<00:04:39.320> this

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
crashed and the new spark plug this

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.400 
crashed and the new spark plug this
washer<00:04:39.980> is<00:04:40.010> not<00:04:40.100> going<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.400> be<00:04:40.460> crushed<00:04:40.700> so

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
washer is not going to be crushed so

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.050 
washer is not going to be crushed so
when<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.560> thread<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.190> in<00:04:43.400> all<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.700> way<00:04:43.730> and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
when you thread it in all the way and

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.930 
when you thread it in all the way and
the<00:04:44.450> bottoms<00:04:44.780> out<00:04:44.980> you'll<00:04:45.980> have<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.340> make<00:04:46.520> one

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
the bottoms out you'll have to make one

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.040 
the bottoms out you'll have to make one
more<00:04:47.150> turn<00:04:47.680> for<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:49.040> actually<00:04:49.730> seal<00:04:50.000> do<00:04:50.870> not

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
more turn for it to actually seal do not

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.140 
more turn for it to actually seal do not
over<00:04:51.350> tighten<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.890> don't<00:04:52.460> go<00:04:52.580> crazy<00:04:52.820> on<00:04:53.000> the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
over tighten it don't go crazy on the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.480 
over tighten it don't go crazy on the
torque<00:04:53.420> it<00:04:54.080> needs<00:04:54.500> only<00:04:54.740> one<00:04:54.920> turn<00:04:55.160> if<00:04:55.430> you

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
torque it needs only one turn if you

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.760 
torque it needs only one turn if you
took<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.940> spark<00:04:56.180> plugs<00:04:56.390> out<00:04:56.570> before<00:04:57.020> it's

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
took the spark plugs out before it's

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.070 
took the spark plugs out before it's
going<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.040> need<00:04:58.280> even<00:04:58.400> less<00:04:58.550> than<00:04:58.880> one<00:04:59.030> turn<00:04:59.300> to

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
going to need even less than one turn to

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.240 
going to need even less than one turn to
tighten<00:05:01.570> so<00:05:02.570> this<00:05:02.750> one<00:05:02.960> is<00:05:03.110> in<00:05:05.920> C<00:05:06.920> this<00:05:07.100> one

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
tighten so this one is in C this one

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:16.100 
tighten so this one is in C this one
gentlemen<00:05:07.640> go<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:08.150> hole<00:05:08.300> hold<00:05:08.570> pull

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.679 

oh<00:05:18.500> this<00:05:19.500> one's<00:05:19.710> tight<00:05:20.009> all<00:05:20.189> right

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
oh this one's tight all right

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:22.999 
oh this one's tight all right
it's<00:05:21.689> a<00:05:21.750> bad<00:05:21.930> idea<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.409> over<00:05:22.620> tighten<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
it's a bad idea to over tighten the

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.339 
it's a bad idea to over tighten the
spark<00:05:23.129> box<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:24.509> could<00:05:24.659> damage<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:25.080> threads

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
spark box you could damage the threads

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:26.719 
spark box you could damage the threads
in<00:05:25.469> the<00:05:25.560> head<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.039> then<00:05:26.280> you're<00:05:26.430> gonna<00:05:26.520> have<00:05:26.699> a

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
in the head and then you're gonna have a

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.179 
in the head and then you're gonna have a
very<00:05:27.090> big<00:05:27.330> problem<00:05:29.330> so<00:05:30.500> remember<00:05:31.500> it<00:05:31.860> bottoms

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
very big problem so remember it bottoms

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:35.179 
very big problem so remember it bottoms
out<00:05:32.539> about<00:05:33.539> a<00:05:33.569> turn<00:05:33.930> not<00:05:34.439> even<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.770> full<00:05:34.919> turn

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:35.189 
out about a turn not even the full turn

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.179 
out about a turn not even the full turn
and<00:05:35.639> it's<00:05:35.939> enough<00:05:36.180> now<00:05:36.650> put<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.740> coil<00:05:37.949> pack

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
and it's enough now put the coil pack

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:55.219 
and it's enough now put the coil pack
back<00:05:38.430> in<00:05:38.639> I<00:05:52.430> line<00:05:53.430> it<00:05:53.460> wire<00:05:54.419> harness<00:05:54.840> through

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
back in I line it wire harness through

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:01.999 
back in I line it wire harness through
all<00:05:55.469> the<00:05:55.740> coil<00:05:55.949> packs<00:05:56.539> and<00:05:57.539> clip<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:58.229> on<00:06:01.009> put

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
all the coil packs and clip it on put

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.779 
all the coil packs and clip it on put
the<00:06:02.129> engine<00:06:02.610> cover<00:06:02.819> back<00:06:03.090> on<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:04.669> you're<00:06:05.669> all

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
the engine cover back on and you're all

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.940 
the engine cover back on and you're all
set
