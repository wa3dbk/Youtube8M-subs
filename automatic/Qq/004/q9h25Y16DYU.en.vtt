00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's got its got two studs here little
studs<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.450> placing<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.080> side

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
studs take the placing on that side

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.370 
studs take the placing on that side
that's<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.340> goes<00:01:38.550> in<00:01:38.760> onto<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.180> catch<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.840> say<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
that's of goes in onto a catch I say a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.249 
that's of goes in onto a catch I say a
bit<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.429> recycle<00:01:42.179> shoe<00:01:42.390> buckle<00:01:42.810> and

bit like a you recycle shoe buckle and
now<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.830> can<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:44.039> just<00:01:44.369> tighten<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
now you can actually just tighten the

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.570 
now you can actually just tighten the
hop<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.360> clamp<00:01:45.660> down<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.229> six<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.770> really

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
really simple it's just a little tag

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.740 
really simple it's just a little tag
that<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.370> actually<00:03:07.460> pull<00:03:07.880> that's<00:03:08.270> of<00:03:08.450> pulls<00:03:08.660> a

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
that you actually pull that's of pulls a

that you actually pull that's of pulls a
lever<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.320> get<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.010> out<00:03:10.190> okay<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:12.020> then<00:03:12.110> that

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
lever to get it out okay and then that

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.730 
lever to get it out okay and then that
pulls<00:03:12.980> out<00:03:13.160> yourself<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:14.440> basically<00:03:15.440> this<00:03:15.680> is

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
pulls out yourself so basically this is

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.840 
pulls out yourself so basically this is
the<00:03:17.710> little<00:03:18.710> stamp<00:03:19.220> itself

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850

the little stamp itself
ah<00:03:23.020> okay<00:03:27.520> swats<00:03:28.520> in<00:03:28.730> there<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:31.450> zooming

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:48.830
