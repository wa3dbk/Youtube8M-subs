00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.139
 ten thousand 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.080
 Hello everyone here in strum in this video 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.700
 I want to thank you the famous video of 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.320
 thanks that was due yesterday 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.400
 but yesterday was Easter Monday I had work to do 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.750
 between lunches and things we say that I do not have 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.960
 really had a lot of time then 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.149
 let's do it today is the video you will see 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.470
 below is a video on borderlands why 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.809
 this time I'm playing borderlands 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.790
 among other things, today there is a flash on destiny 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.250
 so I'd say take a look for 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.769
 make laughs and various tank tops and videos of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.199
 Thanks for the ten thousand notes 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.179
 10 thousand people have registered this 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.670
 channel 10 thousand and 200 something actually 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:57.300
 they are on the rise 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.360
 so thank you thank you because 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.290
 you really are really many when 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.400
 I started I did n't really think 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.080
 to reach 10 thousand by April is 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.380
 practically I started towards 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.550
 September with destiny speed 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.500
 we were there 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.430
 we say how it started as I have 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.650
 started playing to be ho 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.150
 started making videos of fact because 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.710
 however, I made videos during the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.600
 beta which was a month before then 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.990
 we are there 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:35.190
 the fact is that we have reached 10 thousand e 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.170
 10 thousand are so many if we want 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.350
 let's have a nice group together 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.619
 let's invade Austria so casola e 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.600
 so thanks to all the ten thousand thanks 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.850
 also obviously at my club and shining 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.229
 without you without precisely the 10,000 in 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.679
 clan would have managed to get to 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.810
 this point because you have me 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.770
 the subscribers supported me all 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.920
 this time and the clan helped me to 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.080
 do what you actually do 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.849
 there was to be done about fate and so on 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.790
 I put that group together the group 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.190
 obviously from the times of the beginning of 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.540
 heads have changed since launch 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.709
 some people are active some 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.050
 people action of revenue people 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.760
 because it was true, maybe people get tired 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.750
 to play and we are still here if 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.250
 not with a close-knit group and so on 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.980
 so perfect so and I thought of various 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.709
 ways to actually thank you like you 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.420
 owes another crime did not seem the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.260
 case because I already did it for 10 for 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.870
 the 5000 excuses and I will make others for sure 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.010
 in the future however for this time for i 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.360

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.040

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.050

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.670
 different by doing a contest ve 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.959
 I had anticipated it 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.090
 contest not within the game then 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.860
 it won't be a crust made with me like I have 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.409
 made in 2005 but it will be a contest for 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.209

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.730
 xbox live 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.010
 obviously since the community is 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.200

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.060

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.359
 the participant 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.879
 but uses to distinguish who participates from 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:12.879
 who only wants to comment and is discreet 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.790
