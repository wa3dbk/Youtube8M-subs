00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.700 

employing<00:00:08.620> my<00:00:08.920> zmr<00:00:09.910> 250<00:00:10.780> for<00:00:10.990> a<00:00:11.020> while<00:00:11.230> now<00:00:11.470> on

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710 
employing my zmr 250 for a while now on

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.350 
employing my zmr 250 for a while now on
I'm<00:00:11.830> not<00:00:11.950> the<00:00:12.190> big<00:00:12.490> fan<00:00:12.790> of<00:00:12.820> the<00:00:13.060> flight

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
I'm not the big fan of the flight

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.470 
I'm not the big fan of the flight
characteristics<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:14.410> the<00:00:14.530> tips<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.940> quickly

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
characteristics to the tips to quickly

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.100 
characteristics to the tips to quickly
forward<00:00:17.170> and<00:00:17.290> back<00:00:17.849> but<00:00:18.849> I<00:00:19.090> had<00:00:19.510> a<00:00:19.570> thought

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
forward and back but I had a thought

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.870 
forward and back but I had a thought
that<00:00:20.380> maybe<00:00:20.590> it's<00:00:21.040> because<00:00:21.250> there's<00:00:21.610> so<00:00:21.759> much

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
that maybe it's because there's so much

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.269 
that maybe it's because there's so much
weight<00:00:22.180> on<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.480> top<00:00:22.630> of<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:22.900> batteries<00:00:23.320> so

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
weight on the top of the batteries so

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.600 
weight on the top of the batteries so
I've<00:00:24.369> actually<00:00:24.489> loaded<00:00:25.060> it<00:00:25.180> up<00:00:25.300> underneath<00:00:25.810> I

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
I've actually loaded it up underneath I

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.069 
I've actually loaded it up underneath I
mean<00:00:27.610> it's<00:00:27.730> got<00:00:27.849> the<00:00:28.630> actual<00:00:28.980> carbon<00:00:30.779> slops<00:00:31.779> in

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
mean it's got the actual carbon slops in

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.750 
mean it's got the actual carbon slops in
there<00:00:32.259> so<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.590> can<00:00:32.739> put<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:33.220> strap<00:00:33.489> on<00:00:33.640> to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
there so you can put the strap on to

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.979 
there so you can put the strap on to
hold<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.090> on<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.370> I<00:00:37.890> actually<00:00:39.449> enjoy<00:00:40.449> flying<00:00:40.809> a

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
hold it on so I actually enjoy flying a

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.830 
hold it on so I actually enjoy flying a
lot<00:00:41.170> more<00:00:41.440> with<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:42.519> weight<00:00:42.760> underneath<00:00:43.480> like

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
lot more with the weight underneath like

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.650 
lot more with the weight underneath like
that<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:45.579> put<00:00:45.670> on<00:00:45.850> these<00:00:46.000> little<00:00:46.120> standoffs

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
that just put on these little standoffs

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.119 
that just put on these little standoffs
instead<00:00:46.960> of<00:00:47.019> those<00:00:47.140> stupid<00:00:47.559> stands<00:00:47.890> just

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
instead of those stupid stands just

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.459 
instead of those stupid stands just
because<00:00:48.699> they<00:00:49.510> were<00:00:49.629> actually<00:00:49.929> cutting<00:00:50.230> into

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
because they were actually cutting into

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.430 
because they were actually cutting into
the<00:00:51.210> ESC<00:00:52.210> wires<00:00:52.510> here<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.719> they're<00:00:55.719> gone<00:00:55.960> I've

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
the ESC wires here so they're gone I've

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.889 
the ESC wires here so they're gone I've
just<00:00:56.559> got<00:00:56.710> these<00:00:56.829> little<00:00:57.629> standoffs<00:00:58.629> now<00:00:58.839> to

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
just got these little standoffs now to

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.779 
just got these little standoffs now to
take<00:00:59.679> some<00:00:59.859> of<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.039> weight<00:01:00.190> if<00:01:00.399> there's<00:01:00.579> a<00:01:00.640> bit

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
take some of the weight if there's a bit

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.130 
take some of the weight if there's a bit
of<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.969> hard<00:01:01.629> landing<00:01:02.109> but<00:01:03.870> basically<00:01:04.870> if<00:01:05.050> you

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
of a hard landing but basically if you

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.810 
of a hard landing but basically if you
lose<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.350> battery<00:01:05.770> it's<00:01:05.950> no<00:01:06.070> big<00:01:06.250> deal<00:01:06.280> anyway

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
lose a battery it's no big deal anyway

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.700 
lose a battery it's no big deal anyway
unless<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.570> goes<00:01:07.750> up<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.050> smoking<00:01:08.290> takes<00:01:08.500> out

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
unless it goes up and smoking takes out

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.810 
unless it goes up and smoking takes out
the<00:01:08.800> whole<00:01:08.950> bit<00:01:09.400> no<00:01:10.240> such<00:01:10.840> as<00:01:10.990> long<00:01:11.730> David<00:01:12.730> guy

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
the whole bit no such as long David guy

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.210 
the whole bit no such as long David guy
fetch<00:01:13.120> around<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.390> bottom<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:15.010> is<00:01:15.100> in

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
fetch around the bottom here it is in

00:01:15.220 --> 00:02:45.780 
fetch around the bottom here it is in
flies

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.849
