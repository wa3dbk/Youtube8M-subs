there anymore I feel like there's still
a<00:02:32.290> strong<00:02:32.500> spec<00:02:32.830> even<00:02:33.400> an<00:02:33.520> arenas<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.480> it's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
a strong spec even an arenas just it's

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.750 
a strong spec even an arenas just it's
kind<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:34.990> like<00:02:35.080> playing<00:02:35.320> sudbrook<00:02:36.190> or<00:02:36.370> combat

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
kind of like playing sudbrook or combat

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.480 
kind of like playing sudbrook or combat
room<00:02:37.110> but<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.200> still<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.380> little<00:02:38.530> bit<00:02:38.680> more<00:02:38.830> I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
room but it's still a little bit more I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.820 
room but it's still a little bit more I
guess<00:02:39.760> viable<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:41.140> point<00:02:41.350> with<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.770> we

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
guess viable the point with it that we

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.680 
guess viable the point with it that we
had<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.100> actually<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.490> free<00:02:42.820> flow<00:02:43.060> we're

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
had is actually just free flow we're

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.210 
had is actually just free flow we're
thinking<00:02:43.990> well<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.440> guess<00:02:44.590> let's<00:02:44.800> head<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.130> a

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
thinking well I guess let's head in a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.540 
thinking well I guess let's head in a
warrior<00:02:45.610> but<00:02:46.260> don't<00:02:47.260> really<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.460> a

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
warrior but don't really go for a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.400 
warrior but don't really go for a
concrete<00:02:48.880> target<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.900> actually<00:02:50.110> works

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
concrete target and this actually works

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.020 
concrete target and this actually works

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
feel and play style is different so you

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.860
