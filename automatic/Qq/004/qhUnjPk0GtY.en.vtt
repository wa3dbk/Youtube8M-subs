00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.540 

I'm<00:00:36.230> going<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.440> divide<00:00:36.650> it<00:00:36.800> in<00:00:36.890> half<00:00:36.920> just<00:00:37.340> like

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
I'm going to divide it in half just like

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.690 
I'm going to divide it in half just like
if<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:37.910> were<00:00:37.940> tying<00:00:38.900> your<00:00:39.080> shoe<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:39.890> pull<00:00:40.580> it

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
if you were tying your shoe and pull it

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.990 
if you were tying your shoe and pull it
through

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
through

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.830 
through
she's<00:00:41.900> got<00:00:42.080> wet<00:00:42.380> hair<00:00:42.620> from<00:00:42.860> her<00:00:43.010> bath<00:00:43.840> and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
she's got wet hair from her bath and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.130 
she's got wet hair from her bath and
that<00:00:44.990> is<00:00:45.310> really<00:00:46.310> helpful<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:50.690> have<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.990> wet

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
that is really helpful to have the wet

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.750 
that is really helpful to have the wet
hair<00:00:51.170> then<00:00:51.830> you're<00:00:51.980> going<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.160> put<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.400> clip<00:00:52.640> on

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
hair then you're going to put a clip on

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.240 
hair then you're going to put a clip on
that<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:53.210> doesn't<00:00:53.240> come<00:00:53.570> undone<00:00:54.130> now<00:00:55.130> I'm

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
that so it doesn't come undone now I'm

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.190 
that so it doesn't come undone now I'm
just<00:00:55.460> going<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:55.700> be<00:00:55.790> grabbing<00:00:56.240> hair<00:00:56.540> at<00:00:56.780> each

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
just going to be grabbing hair at each

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.850 
just going to be grabbing hair at each
part<00:00:58.000> that<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.120> have<00:00:59.330> done<00:01:00.170> on<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.440> left<00:01:00.650> side

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
part that I have done on the left side

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.850 
part that I have done on the left side
so<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:01.280> lines<00:01:01.640> up<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:03.350> I'm<00:01:03.470> not<00:01:03.620> going<00:01:03.800> to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
so that lines up and I'm not going to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:13.000 
so that lines up and I'm not going to
want<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.100> have<00:01:04.250> these<00:01:04.430> in<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:04.790> quite<00:01:05.150> yet

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.649 

hold<00:01:13.610> that<00:01:13.760> with<00:01:13.910> your<00:01:14.030> nose

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.850 

so<00:01:18.170> you're<00:01:18.320> not<00:01:18.380> going<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.560> do<00:01:18.680> anything

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
so you're not going to do anything

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.649 
so you're not going to do anything
special<00:01:19.250> with<00:01:19.430> those<00:01:19.729> ones<00:01:19.969> up<00:01:20.149> front<00:01:20.450> but

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
special with those ones up front but

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:21.880 
special with those ones up front but
you're<00:01:20.810> going<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.020> divide<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:21.409> into<00:01:21.710> half

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
you're going to divide this into half

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.179 
you're going to divide this into half
and<00:01:22.219> then<00:01:22.280> pull<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.450> one<00:01:23.630> into<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.140> from<00:01:24.979> the

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
and then pull that one into it from the

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.249 
and then pull that one into it from the
right<00:01:25.340> side<00:01:25.930> and<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.020> one<00:01:27.170> from<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.500> left

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
right side and this one from the left

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.870 
right side and this one from the left
and<00:01:30.259> again<00:01:30.380> just<00:01:31.039> like<00:01:31.189> you're<00:01:31.369> tying<00:01:31.579> a<00:01:31.759> knot

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
and again just like you're tying a knot

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.819 
and again just like you're tying a knot
in<00:01:32.030> your<00:01:32.060> shoe<00:01:34.060> make<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:35.090> knot<00:01:35.409> then<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:36.649> can

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
in your shoe make a knot then you can

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.550 
in your shoe make a knot then you can
pull<00:01:37.039> this<00:01:37.220> clip<00:01:38.030> out<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.539> add<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:38.960> here<00:01:39.289> so

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
pull this clip out and add it to here so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.100 
pull this clip out and add it to here so
it<00:01:39.679> stays<00:01:39.920> put<00:01:40.159> for<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.399> minute

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
it stays put for a minute

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.340 
it stays put for a minute
put<00:01:42.110> those<00:01:42.229> tails<00:01:42.560> all<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:42.979> way<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:48.229> again

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
put those tails all the way and again

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.730 
put those tails all the way and again
make<00:01:48.679> another<00:01:48.710> part<00:01:50.229> lining<00:01:51.229> up<00:01:51.349> with<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.619> one

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
make another part lining up with the one

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:18.990 
make another part lining up with the one
from<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.039> left<00:01:52.220> side

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.180 

smooth<00:02:20.000> those<00:02:20.210> out<00:02:20.390> if<00:02:20.570> you<00:02:20.600> need<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.190> those

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
smooth those out if you need to those

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.930 
smooth those out if you need to those
tails<00:02:22.550> as<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.940> add<00:02:23.120> them<00:02:23.330> in<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:28.340> then<00:02:28.610> as<00:02:28.760> you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
tails as you add them in and then as you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.960 
tails as you add them in and then as you
get<00:02:29.150> further<00:02:29.810> down<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.320> probably<00:02:30.770> won't<00:02:31.070> want

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
get further down you probably won't want

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.940 
get further down you probably won't want
a<00:02:32.120> larger<00:02:32.960> clip<00:02:34.030> because<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.330> hair<00:02:35.540> gets

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
a larger clip because that hair gets

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.690 
a larger clip because that hair gets
chunkier<00:02:36.950> as<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:37.220> go

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
chunkier as you go

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.460 
chunkier as you go
I<00:02:37.730> might<00:02:38.390> have<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.600> kind<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.810> manipulate<00:02:39.050> those

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
I might have to kind of manipulate those

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.720 
I might have to kind of manipulate those
knots<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.830> little<00:02:40.040> bit<00:02:40.190> because<00:02:40.340> things<00:02:40.640> might

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
knots a little bit because things might

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.940 
knots a little bit because things might
get<00:02:41.120> kind<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.480> twisted<00:02:41.900> up<00:02:44.800> remember<00:02:45.800> how<00:02:45.890> you

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
get kind of twisted up remember how you

00:02:45.950 --> 00:03:04.570 
get kind of twisted up remember how you
want<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.610> lay<00:02:46.760> right<00:02:46.970> for<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.450> I<00:03:03.459> like<00:03:04.459> to

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
want so the lay right for you I like to

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.410 
want so the lay right for you I like to
continue<00:03:04.970> always<00:03:06.430> flipping<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.850> left<00:03:08.090> side

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
continue always flipping the left side

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.710 
continue always flipping the left side
through<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.310> be<00:03:10.430> consistent<00:03:10.790> whatever<00:03:11.540> is

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
through so be consistent whatever is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.180 
through so be consistent whatever is
