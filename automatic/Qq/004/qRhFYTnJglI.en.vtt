00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
footage that we sort of took this for

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.970 
footage that we sort of took this for
our<00:00:16.199> own<00:00:16.350> entertainment<00:00:17.240> but<00:00:18.650> thought<00:00:19.650> some

our own entertainment but thought some

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.200 
our own entertainment but thought some
people<00:00:20.310> might<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.490> interested<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.119> this

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
people might be interested in this

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.390 
people might be interested in this
particularly<00:00:21.779> those<00:00:22.380> people<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.890> come<00:00:23.160> from

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
particularly those people that come from

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
areas where you might not get snow we

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.660 
areas where you might not get snow we
might<00:00:26.550> not<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.910> used<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.210> seeing<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:29.160> this

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
falling at a rate at different different

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700 
falling at a rate at different different
times<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.640> got<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:53.940> heavy<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.649> it<00:00:55.649> was

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
falling at a rate that was faster than

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.479 
falling at a rate that was faster than
the<00:00:57.960> windscreen<00:00:58.559> wipers<00:00:58.920> could<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.280> rid<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the windscreen wipers could get rid of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.360 
the windscreen wipers could get rid of
it<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:01.199> windscreen<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.949> getting

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
it and the windscreen was getting

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.660 
it and the windscreen was getting
frosted<00:01:03.270> faster<00:01:03.750> than<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.250> domestic<00:01:05.250> could

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
frosted faster than the domestic could

be missed it so it was there's a bit

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.550 
be missed it so it was there's a bit
hairy<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> bit<00:01:12.659> hairy<00:01:12.869> driving<00:01:13.290> around<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
hairy it is a bit hairy driving around a

town like this with heavy snow on the
ground<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:17.220> particularly<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.909> Japan<00:01:18.030> because

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
ground is particularly in Japan because

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.940 
ground is particularly in Japan because
the<00:01:18.720> roads<00:01:18.930> were<00:01:18.990> quite<00:01:19.290> often<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.710> narrow

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the roads were quite often really narrow

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.999 
the roads were quite often really narrow
and<00:01:20.450> they<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.659> very<00:01:21.990> deep<00:01:22.259> gutters<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and they have very deep gutters at the

and they have very deep gutters at the
sides<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.700> quite<00:01:24.180> often<00:01:24.479> aren't<00:01:24.630> covered

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
sides that quite often aren't covered

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.390 
sides that quite often aren't covered
just<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.590> big<00:01:26.100> wide<00:01:26.400> open<00:01:26.729> rain<00:01:27.119> gutters<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
just a big wide open rain gutters and

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.649 
just a big wide open rain gutters and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you don't want your wheels going into

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.630 
you don't want your wheels going into
them<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> can't<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> side<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
them so when you can't see the side of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399

the<00:01:32.700> road<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> bit<00:01:33.600> hairy<00:01:33.810> driving<00:01:34.290> down

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the road it's a bit hairy driving down

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.240 
the road it's a bit hairy driving down
these<00:01:34.530> little<00:01:34.799> streets<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:36.740> then<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.100> was

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
these little streets and then it was

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.880 
these little streets and then it was
getting<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.909> heavy<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> roof<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.470> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
getting so heavy on the roof that that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.280 
getting so heavy on the roof that that
when<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> stopped<00:01:41.549> huge<00:01:42.509> amounts<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
when you stopped huge amounts of it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.690 
when you stopped huge amounts of it
would<00:01:43.470> cascade<00:01:43.740> down<00:01:44.159> over<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> windscreen

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
would cascade down over the windscreen

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.240 
would cascade down over the windscreen
so<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.420> couldn't<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.840> anything<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:47.040> yeah

quite the adventure it was and then even
if<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.750> stopped<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> short<00:01:52.649> amount<00:01:52.770> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
if we stopped just for a short amount of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.460 
if we stopped just for a short amount of
time<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.399> built<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:54.000> fast<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.630> we
