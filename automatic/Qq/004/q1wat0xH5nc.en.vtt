 but if you are going to see in this you go after 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.370
 saying this nap was mine 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.600
 good if you're going to win and you're going to have it 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.560
 also from his feeling of 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.949
 participation and maybe you should ask 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.230
 about 100 thousand pesos and your baby comes out 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.220
 it's hard that my interest starts with the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.329
 I've always been cooking since I was little 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.729
 next to my mother 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.769
 at that time I used a stove of that from 

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:43.010
 using it with charges 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:46.429
 I remember that one day I could not see 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.469
 on the card and took a tin of sauce 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.659
 and I climbed on top of the little tica and 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.719
 she was very small she got scared because 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.760
 I thought that I could burn myself and that 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.260
 I had and not mom I want to see what you 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.690

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.210

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.770

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.780
 he says already to make a cake he called me the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.860
 attention and I stayed there all the time 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.920
 watching and I try the plate and my mom 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.890
 I asked your scientist I'm going to 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.979

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.740
 wrong or everything told me oh my god but this 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.990
 girl is surprising me because I 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.869
 I never thought I could do that 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.240
 cake or that was already the age of 11 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.490
 years more or less had and the third time 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 What I did was when I met my 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.280
 Frank, I got it in my pocket 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.560
 when he took out the cake where not if 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.350
 I say look look look what it brings you are 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.900
 designs but he did not talk anymore I was 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.060
 as anxious that you tell me that 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.390
 I wanted to have her move with me already seriously 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.120
 and I remember that he put a friend gates the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.100
 culture and the friend was he told me that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.190
 he was interested and that he wanted 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.489
 I answered the friend tell him about 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.770
 Germany decided that the one that has mouth 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.690
 he sent him to blow because the cake he 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.220
