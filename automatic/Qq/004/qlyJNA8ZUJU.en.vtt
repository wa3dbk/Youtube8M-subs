00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.439 
club 31/12
so<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.160> larger<00:00:59.160> black<00:00:59.489> camp<00:00:59.879> over<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
so it's the larger black camp over to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.160 
so it's the larger black camp over to
the<00:01:00.600> front<00:01:00.870> right<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.379> screen<00:01:01.879> and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
the front right of your screen and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.600 
the front right of your screen and
because<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> cleans<00:01:04.769> out<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.339> damp

because the cleans out of this damp

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.359 
because the cleans out of this damp
should<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.090> very<00:01:06.299> similar<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.409> cleans<00:01:08.130> out

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
should be very similar to the cleans out

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.480 
should be very similar to the cleans out
of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> amp<00:01:08.790> egg<00:01:09.030> super<00:01:09.600> jet<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.650> for
