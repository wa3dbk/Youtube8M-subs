 tribute to the tribute of a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.660
 minute replaced the usual silence 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.350
 by the favorite sound of those who love 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.350
 modality 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.679
 or they joined Kyodo that and 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.200
 victory as the only one was already farewell to 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:10.939
 height of a pilot who misses 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.190
 and those who lived close to him 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.020
 those who were once one of our 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.580
 great supporters of the national level of 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.720
 motorcycling at the national and 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.970
 International 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.820
 I'm not very wanted by everyone. 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.070
 I'm always off the track and to the maximum 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.560
 more than that but that's what got it 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.210
 so in such a short time it is 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.030
 this is always a great loss when 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.190
 we see a person known and friend 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.069
 left continued miguel leon continued 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.190
 in my heart in the same cases not 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.990
 think 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.690
 I found it very very very good a lot 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.240
 important 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.429
 I think he is I think he is 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.110
 I think she's been one was a 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.409
 very good honor 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.959
 I do not have words to explain why 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.960
 without notion and fortunately was a reason 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.540
 sad but 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.210
 I think they are investments that 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.929
 shows the passion they suck 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.500
 It's the union we have and whiskey was the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.040
 music really all this is is because 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.010
