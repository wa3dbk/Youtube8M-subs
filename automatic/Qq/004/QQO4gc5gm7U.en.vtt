00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.260 

I<00:01:14.590> think<00:01:15.590> I<00:01:15.680> need<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:16.190> get<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.610> began<00:01:17.060> working

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
I think I need to get that began working

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.910 
I think I need to get that began working
for<00:01:19.630> see<00:01:20.630> ya<00:01:23.229> she's<00:01:24.229> going<00:01:24.440> through<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.740> will

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
for see ya she's going through the will

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.830 
for see ya she's going through the will
and<00:01:25.220> sometimes<00:01:25.610> she'll<00:01:25.790> say<00:01:25.970> hey<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.300> can't<00:01:26.720> get

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
and sometimes she'll say hey I can't get

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.750 
and sometimes she'll say hey I can't get
across<00:01:27.020> here<00:01:27.350> but<00:01:27.560> but<00:01:28.070> you<00:01:28.159> can<00:01:28.430> with<00:01:28.640> your

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
across here but but you can with your

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.390 
across here but but you can with your
shadow<00:01:29.000> powers<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:29.950> that's<00:01:30.950> kind<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.280> how

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
shadow powers and so that's kind of how

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.249 
shadow powers and so that's kind of how
the<00:01:31.460> relationship<00:01:31.670> works<00:01:32.300> however<00:01:32.840> sometimes

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
the relationship works however sometimes

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.859 
the relationship works however sometimes
as<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.830> said<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:34.310> can't<00:01:35.150> do<00:01:35.300> anything<00:01:35.420> well<00:01:35.810> you

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
as you said I can't do anything well you

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.080 
as you said I can't do anything well you
can't<00:01:36.080> do<00:01:36.200> anything<00:01:36.229> as<00:01:36.710> dawn<00:01:36.920> until<00:01:37.250> DD<00:01:37.759> helps

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
can't do anything as dawn until DD helps

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.300 
can't do anything as dawn until DD helps
you<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:38.570> at<00:01:39.170> one<00:01:39.350> area<00:01:39.470> she<00:01:39.619> actually<00:01:39.860> holds<00:01:40.220> up

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
you so at one area she actually holds up

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.820 
you so at one area she actually holds up
a<00:01:40.430> stick<00:01:40.700> in<00:01:40.909> 3d<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.110> shadow<00:01:42.350> projected

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
a stick in 3d and the shadow projected

can<00:03:23.750> draw<00:03:23.959> on<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.500> makes<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.950> mates

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
can draw on that it makes it mates

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.700 
can draw on that it makes it mates
actually<00:03:25.430> telling<00:03:25.730> things

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
actually telling things

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.950 
actually telling things
easier<00:03:27.710> and<00:03:27.860> more<00:03:27.980> realistic<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:29.420> there<00:03:29.840> any

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
easier and more realistic is there any

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.210 
easier and more realistic is there any
other<00:03:30.110> game<00:03:30.290> mechanics<00:03:30.740> you'd<00:03:30.830> like<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.070> go

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
other game mechanics you'd like to go

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.760 
other game mechanics you'd like to go
over<00:03:31.750> look<00:03:32.750> this<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.170> one<00:03:33.380> other<00:03:33.500> game

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
over look this is one other game

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.550 
over look this is one other game
mechanic<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:35.270> can<00:03:35.480> activate<00:03:35.780> which<00:03:36.410> is

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
mechanic that you can activate which is

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.440 
mechanic that you can activate which is
a<00:03:36.710> dash<00:03:36.950> ability<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.610> that's<00:03:37.850> really<00:03:38.030> just<00:03:38.300> to

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
a dash ability and that's really just to

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.880 
a dash ability and that's really just to
kind<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:38.750> move<00:03:38.900> through<00:03:39.170> space<00:03:39.290> in<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.650> and

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
kind of move through space in it and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.680 
kind of move through space in it and
again<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.100> different<00:03:40.190> way<00:03:40.670> adds<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.540> bit<00:03:41.630> of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
again a different way adds a bit of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.390 
again a different way adds a bit of
complexity<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.650> platforming

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
complexity to the platforming

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.340 
complexity to the platforming
environment<00:03:43.850> but<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:44.690> can<00:03:44.810> also<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.080> can

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
environment but you can also you can

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.530 
environment but you can also you can
move<00:03:45.440> lights<00:03:45.800> in<00:03:46.070> contrast<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:46.940> whenever<00:03:47.330> you

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
move lights in contrast and whenever you

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.480 
move lights in contrast and whenever you
move<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.930> light<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.710> can<00:03:48.860> shift<00:03:49.040> into<00:03:49.190> shadow

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
move a light you can shift into shadow

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.330 
move a light you can shift into shadow
wherever<00:03:50.240> that<00:03:50.390> light<00:03:50.570> hits<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:52.040> can<00:03:52.190> also

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
wherever that light hits you can also

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.330 
wherever that light hits you can also
move<00:03:52.610> objects<00:03:53.060> in<00:03:53.300> 3d<00:03:53.570> which<00:03:54.350> change<00:03:55.070> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
move objects in 3d which change the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.660 
move objects in 3d which change the
shadow<00:03:55.550> landscape<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:57.340> sometimes<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.520> can

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
shadow landscape and sometimes you can

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.120 
shadow landscape and sometimes you can
move<00:03:58.820> point<00:03:59.720> sources<00:04:00.050> of<00:04:00.170> lights<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.770> like<00:04:00.980> an

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
move point sources of lights so like an

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.650 
move point sources of lights so like an
actual<00:04:01.310> light<00:04:01.610> bulb<00:04:01.880> which<00:04:02.090> cast<00:04:02.360> shadows

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
actual light bulb which cast shadows

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.330 
actual light bulb which cast shadows
everywhere<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.740> when<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:03.950> move<00:04:04.130> that

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
everywhere and when you move that

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.040 
everywhere and when you move that
obviously<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:04.910> changes<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.390> entire<00:04:05.510> shadow

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
obviously it changes the entire shadow

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.630 
obviously it changes the entire shadow
landscape<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.740> that<00:04:07.130> you're<00:04:07.250> running<00:04:07.550> on

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
landscape that that you're running on

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.850 
landscape that that you're running on
cool<00:04:08.630> so<00:04:09.050> reference<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.470> something<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.830> said

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
cool so reference to something you said

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.410 
cool so reference to something you said
earlier<00:04:10.010> where<00:04:10.550> it's<00:04:10.850> hard<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.240> make<00:04:11.390> it

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
earlier where it's hard to make it

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.000 
earlier where it's hard to make it
personally<00:04:11.990> relatable<00:04:12.440> when<00:04:12.590> you're<00:04:12.710> saving

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
personally relatable when you're saving

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.590 
personally relatable when you're saving
the<00:04:13.100> universe<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.850> might<00:04:14.000> not<00:04:14.090> be<00:04:14.240> saving<00:04:14.510> the

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
the universe you might not be saving the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.150 
the universe you might not be saving the
universe<00:04:14.810> but<00:04:15.110> you<00:04:15.230> might<00:04:15.380> be<00:04:15.470> saving<00:04:15.800> dd's

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
universe but you might be saving dd's

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.280 
universe but you might be saving dd's
own<00:04:16.370> personal<00:04:16.910> little<00:04:17.090> universe<00:04:17.480> so<00:04:18.050> that's

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
own personal little universe so that's

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.210 
own personal little universe so that's
something<00:04:18.590> you're<00:04:18.710> interested<00:04:18.770> in<00:04:19.130> you

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
something you're interested in you

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.920 
something you're interested in you
should<00:04:19.280> definitely<00:04:19.550> check<00:04:19.880> out<00:04:20.000> contrast<00:04:20.510> how

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
would someone be able to acquire this

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.450 
would someone be able to acquire this
