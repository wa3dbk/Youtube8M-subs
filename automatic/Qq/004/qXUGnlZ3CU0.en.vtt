00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
then all the way up so 12 sounds still

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.210 
then all the way up so 12 sounds still
halfway<00:03:21.040> 12<00:03:22.040> as<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.819> come<00:03:23.030> all<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.420> way<00:03:23.450> up<00:03:24.220> so

halfway 12 as I come all the way up so

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.559 
halfway 12 as I come all the way up so
the<00:03:25.340> whole<00:03:25.489> thing<00:03:25.519> will<00:03:25.819> take<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.060> form<00:03:26.360> and

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
the whole thing will take the form and

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.660 
the whole thing will take the form and
it<00:03:26.840> count<00:03:27.140> instead<00:03:27.860> of<00:03:27.890> taking<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.250> four<00:03:28.489> count

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
it count instead of taking a four count
