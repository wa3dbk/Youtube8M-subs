they<00:02:02.360> were<00:02:02.479> on<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.720> early<00:02:03.170> models<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.710> just

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
they were on the early models and just

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.950 
they were on the early models and just
another<00:02:04.790> look<00:02:05.000> now<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.210> think<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.570> was<00:02:05.689> a<00:02:05.720> screw

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
another look now I think it was a screw

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.460 
another look now I think it was a screw
there<00:02:06.340> but<00:02:07.340> there<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.090> kind<00:02:08.299> of<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.470> plastic

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
there but there is kind of a plastic

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.160 
there but there is kind of a plastic
hook<00:02:09.920> it's<00:02:10.189> just<00:02:10.429> hooks<00:02:10.849> on<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.180> side<00:02:11.420> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
hook it's just hooks on the side and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.490 
hook it's just hooks on the side and
then<00:02:12.409> the<00:02:12.620> tricky<00:02:12.890> screw<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:15.080> actually<00:02:15.379> one

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
then the tricky screw is actually one

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.920 
then the tricky screw is actually one
this<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:16.280> goes<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.610> here<00:02:16.939> so<00:02:17.360> I'll<00:02:17.689> show<00:02:17.870> you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
this it goes in here so I'll show you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.199 
this it goes in here so I'll show you
the<00:02:17.989> glovebox<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.530> minute<00:02:18.830> but<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.370> if<00:02:19.969> I<00:02:20.060> can

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
the glovebox in a minute but if if I can

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.000 
the glovebox in a minute but if if I can
just<00:02:20.329> get<00:02:20.480> some<00:02:20.569> light<00:02:20.840> over<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.319> this<00:02:21.439> side<00:02:21.769> as

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
just get some light over to this side as

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.520 
just get some light over to this side as
well

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.199

some use to you anyway the so this this
bit<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.660> trim<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.260> on<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.890> other<00:02:32.040> side<00:02:32.280> okay<00:02:33.000> so

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
bit of trim on on the other side okay so

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.390 
bit of trim on on the other side okay so
this<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.450> UK<00:02:34.019> Carter<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.709> driver's<00:02:35.250> side

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
this is a UK Carter it's a driver's side

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.890 
this is a UK Carter it's a driver's side
is<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.849> right<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.870> be

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
is on the right so this is to be

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900 
is on the right so this is to be
reversed<00:02:37.290> if<00:02:37.530> your<00:02:37.709> left<00:02:38.340> hand<00:02:38.550> drive<00:02:38.730> of

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
reversed if your left hand drive of

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.150 
reversed if your left hand drive of
course<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.500> exactly<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.860> same<00:02:40.980> on

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
course but the it's exactly the same on

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.619 
course but the it's exactly the same on
the<00:02:41.220> other<00:02:41.280> side<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.790> basically<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.420> trim

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
the other side but basically the trim

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.690 
the other side but basically the trim
comes<00:02:42.840> down<00:02:43.049> here<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.319> then<00:02:43.590> there's<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.860> screw

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
comes down here and then there's a screw

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.670 
comes down here and then there's a screw
underneath<00:02:45.000> holding<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
underneath holding it and on the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.650 
underneath holding it and on the
glovebox<00:02:46.920> side<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.640> exactly<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.180> same<00:02:48.450> so

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
glovebox side it's exactly the same so

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.240 
glovebox side it's exactly the same so
you<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:48.989> get<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> screw<00:02:49.590> underneath<00:02:49.890> there

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
you do we get a screw underneath there

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.039 
you do we get a screw underneath there
which<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.610> need<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.819> take<00:02:51.000> out<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.870> there's

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
which you need to take out so there's

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.110 
which you need to take out so there's
like<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.349> tab<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:53.069> plastic<00:02:53.549> which<00:02:53.700> cuts<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
like a tab of plastic which cuts a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.789 
like a tab of plastic which cuts a
wrapped<00:02:54.420> around<00:02:54.540> that's<00:02:55.319> why<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.560> need<00:02:55.739> to

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
wrapped around that's why you need to

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.170 
wrapped around that's why you need to
have<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.010> out<00:02:56.190> as<00:02:56.340> well<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.819> can<00:02:56.940> need<00:02:57.150> to

have this out as well you can need to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.270 
have this out as well you can need to
move<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.660> manoeuvre<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.319> out<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:59.130> also

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
move that manoeuvre that out you also

move that manoeuvre that out you also
going<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.549> need<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.910> just<00:03:00.120> hook<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.630> edge<00:03:01.170> of

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
going to need to just hook the edge of

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.500 
going to need to just hook the edge of
the<00:03:01.410> glovebox<00:03:01.620> out<00:03:01.980> from<00:03:02.160> there<00:03:02.400> there's<00:03:03.360> also

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the glovebox out from there there's also

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.059 
the glovebox out from there there's also

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
you'll have to sort of as I say unhook

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.449 
you'll have to sort of as I say unhook
it<00:03:33.510> from<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.810> right<00:03:34.049> hand<00:03:34.290> side<00:03:34.530> there<00:03:34.859> left

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
it from the right hand side there left

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.039 
it from the right hand side there left
hand<00:03:35.639> side<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.120> were<00:03:36.209> on<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.720> left<00:03:36.900> hand

hand side if you were on the left hand
drive<00:03:37.200> country<00:03:37.680> but<00:03:38.579> then<00:03:38.700> there<00:03:38.849> are<00:03:38.880> a

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
drive country but then there are a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.900 
drive country but then there are a
number<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.239> things<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.569> unhook<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.079> you've<00:03:40.230> got

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
number of things to unhook so you've got

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.539 
number of things to unhook so you've got
drop<00:03:41.910> box<00:03:42.120> lights<00:03:42.389> here<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.950> can<00:03:44.099> see<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
drop box lights here you can see the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.259 
drop box lights here you can see the
connect<00:03:45.450> type<00:03:46.340> just<00:03:47.340> it's<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.120> little

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
connect type just it's just a little

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.910 
connect type just it's just a little
pinch<00:03:48.569> so<00:03:48.959> it's<00:03:49.079> pretty<00:03:49.260> easy<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.769> get

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
pinch so it's pretty easy just get

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.490 
pinch so it's pretty easy just get
fingers<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.430> pop<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.269> out<00:03:51.420> you've<00:03:52.139> got<00:03:52.290> another

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
fingers in pop it out you've got another

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.780 
fingers in pop it out you've got another
one<00:03:52.590> at<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.829> bottom<00:03:52.889> there<00:03:53.310> that's<00:03:53.549> sort<00:03:53.730> of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
one at the bottom there that's sort of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.140 
one at the bottom there that's sort of
the<00:03:54.299> footwear<00:03:55.049> lights<00:03:55.260> if<00:03:55.440> you've<00:03:55.590> got<00:03:55.739> those

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
the footwear lights if you've got those

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.849 
the footwear lights if you've got those
and<00:03:57.150> then<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.989> yellow<00:03:58.200> connector<00:03:58.680> there

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
and then the the yellow connector there

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.879 
and then the the yellow connector there
is<00:03:59.130> for<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.430> airbag<00:03:59.970> switch<00:04:00.630> what<00:04:01.440> you'll<00:04:01.650> do

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
is for the airbag switch what you'll do

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.509 
is for the airbag switch what you'll do
with<00:04:02.069> that<00:04:02.250> one<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.959> pretty<00:04:04.260> simply<00:04:04.680> just<00:04:05.220> pull

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
with that one is pretty simply just pull

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.770 
with that one is pretty simply just pull
back<00:04:05.549> on<00:04:05.940> this<00:04:06.090> green<00:04:07.519> spring-loaded<00:04:08.519> tab<00:04:08.940> and

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
back on this green spring-loaded tab and

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.710 
back on this green spring-loaded tab and
then<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:11.130> will<00:04:11.280> pull<00:04:11.430> away<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:12.450> see

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
then the that will pull away you see

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.300 
then the that will pull away you see
there's<00:04:12.900> actually<00:04:13.230> there's<00:04:13.950> another<00:04:13.980> foot

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
there's actually there's another foot

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.550 
there's actually there's another foot
well<00:04:14.459> light<00:04:14.639> on<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.299> side<00:04:15.569> as<00:04:15.660> well<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.079> then

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
well light on that side as well and then

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.550 
well light on that side as well and then
you've<00:04:16.650> also<00:04:16.829> got<00:04:17.010> if<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.789> have<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.560> aircon

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
you've also got if you have the aircon

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.170 
you've also got if you have the aircon
feed<00:04:19.889> into<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> glove<00:04:20.489> box<00:04:20.669> which<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.000> think

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
feed into the glove box which I think

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.029 
feed into the glove box which I think
that<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.329> guess<00:04:21.539> they<00:04:21.660> all<00:04:21.750> have<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.889> could

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
that I guess they all have you could

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.170 
that I guess they all have you could
just<00:04:23.220> going<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.400> pull<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.550> pipe<00:04:23.849> off<00:04:24.060> the

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
just going to pull that pipe off the

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.990 
just going to pull that pipe off the
glove<00:04:24.360> box<00:04:24.510> as<00:04:24.720> well<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:26.580> I'll<00:04:26.700> just<00:04:26.820> show

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
glove box as well and and I'll just show

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.580 
glove box as well and and I'll just show
you<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.120> glove<00:04:27.300> box<00:04:27.450> now

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
you the glove box now

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.630 
you the glove box now
okay<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:30.650> just<00:04:31.040> having<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.280> look<00:04:31.340> at<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.520> back

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
okay so just having to look at the back

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.880 
okay so just having to look at the back
of<00:04:31.670> the<00:04:31.820> glove<00:04:32.000> box<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.810> can<00:04:33.020> see<00:04:33.260> how<00:04:33.380> that

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
of the glove box so you can see how that

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.640 
of the glove box so you can see how that
works<00:04:34.310> as<00:04:34.490> well<00:04:34.640> so<00:04:35.420> you<00:04:35.510> can<00:04:35.630> see<00:04:35.870> then<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
works as well so you can see then the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.890 
works as well so you can see then the
bottom<00:04:37.340> right<00:04:37.580> we've<00:04:38.240> got<00:04:38.420> one<00:04:38.450> of<00:04:38.840> the

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
bottom right we've got one of the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.390 
bottom right we've got one of the
footwell<00:04:39.200> lights<00:04:41.920> just<00:04:42.920> trying<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:43.160> see<00:04:43.280> where

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
footwell lights just trying to see where

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.190 
footwell lights just trying to see where
the<00:04:43.490> others<00:04:43.760> are<00:04:44.030> actually<00:04:44.780> because<00:04:45.080> I<00:04:45.170> think

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
the others are actually because I think

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.630 
the others are actually because I think
there's<00:04:45.470> more<00:04:45.560> connectors<00:04:47.890> so<00:04:48.890> then<00:04:49.520> we've

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
there's more connectors so then we've

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.580 
there's more connectors so then we've
got<00:04:49.820> another<00:04:50.720> light<00:04:51.050> I<00:04:51.170> guess<00:04:51.320> that's<00:04:51.500> the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
got another light I guess that's the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.330 
got another light I guess that's the
glove<00:04:51.740> box<00:04:51.920> one<00:04:52.220> there<00:04:52.460> there's<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:54.340> airbag

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
glove box one there there's the airbag

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.090 
glove box one there there's the airbag
switch<00:04:55.700> which<00:04:56.600> shows<00:04:57.530> your<00:04:57.680> moment<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.010> get

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
switch which shows your moment to get

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.420 
switch which shows your moment to get
and<00:04:58.460> then<00:04:59.120> there's<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.890> connector<00:05:00.890> to<00:05:01.040> choose

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
and then there's the connector to choose

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.550 
and then there's the connector to choose
for<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.790> air<00:05:01.880> conditioning<00:05:02.390> so<00:05:02.570> that<00:05:03.140> pulls

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
for the air conditioning so that pulls

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.080 
for the air conditioning so that pulls
off<00:05:03.820> pretty<00:05:04.820> easy<00:05:05.410> you<00:05:06.410> can<00:05:06.590> see<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:07.280> three

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
off pretty easy you can see the three

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.790 
off pretty easy you can see the three
screw<00:05:08.420> holes<00:05:08.450> inside<00:05:09.080> the<00:05:09.230> glove<00:05:09.410> box<00:05:09.560> at<00:05:09.740> the

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
screw holes inside the glove box at the

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.580 
screw holes inside the glove box at the
top<00:05:10.960> three<00:05:11.960> on<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.110> bottom<00:05:12.910> this<00:05:13.910> is<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.590> side

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
top three on the bottom this is the side

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.300 
top three on the bottom this is the side
near<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.860> door<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.460> you<00:05:16.850> can<00:05:16.880> see<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:18.050> the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
near the door and you can see that the

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.740 
near the door and you can see that the
plastic<00:05:19.310> trim<00:05:19.580> panel<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.120> end<00:05:20.240> of<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.420> -

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
plastic trim panel to the end of the -

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.630 
plastic trim panel to the end of the -
clips<00:05:21.410> on<00:05:21.650> there<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:21.980> that<00:05:22.010> needs<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.370> come<00:05:22.490> off

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
clips on there so that needs to come off

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.700 
clips on there so that needs to come off
and<00:05:23.270> then<00:05:23.390> as<00:05:23.510> I<00:05:23.540> say<00:05:23.780> there's<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.500> little

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
and then as I say there's a little

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.010 
and then as I say there's a little
tongue<00:05:25.190> thing<00:05:25.490> which<00:05:25.700> just<00:05:25.730> hooks<00:05:26.660> around<00:05:26.810> the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
tongue thing which just hooks around the

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.230 
tongue thing which just hooks around the
edge<00:05:27.140> there<00:05:27.410> I<00:05:27.650> mean<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.490> tricky<00:05:28.790> screw<00:05:29.060> which

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
edge there I mean the tricky screw which

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.550 
edge there I mean the tricky screw which
I'll<00:05:29.360> try<00:05:29.540> and<00:05:29.630> show<00:05:29.750> you<00:05:29.780> instead<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:30.410> -

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
I'll try and show you instead of the -

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.860 
I'll try and show you instead of the -
you<00:05:30.890> can<00:05:31.670> see<00:05:31.910> there's<00:05:32.150> there's<00:05:32.450> the<00:05:32.690> piece

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
you can see there's there's the piece

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.930 
you can see there's there's the piece
plastic<00:05:33.110> which<00:05:33.470> sort<00:05:33.800> of<00:05:33.830> goes<00:05:34.580> underneath

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
plastic which sort of goes underneath

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.370
