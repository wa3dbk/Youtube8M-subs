 aim while some are perched up on a tristan it's a

 the excesses of this form of discs that are along the tree trunk

 two hours to three hours without moving

 it's still sad but others are hiding behind a parade 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.210
 military 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.630

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:14.669
 able to shoot

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:22.219
 whether it is archery or fizi hunting is above all a matter of 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.090
