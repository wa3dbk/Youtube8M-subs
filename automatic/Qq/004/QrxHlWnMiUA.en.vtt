00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
happened is that the power users are the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.020 
happened is that the power users are the
ones<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.500> bought<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.580> felt<00:01:08.880> that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
ones that bought it and they felt that

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.649 
ones that bought it and they felt that
there<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.240> too<00:01:09.360> many<00:01:09.420> restrictions<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> what

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
there are too many restrictions so what

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.880 
there are too many restrictions so what
we've<00:01:12.780> done<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:12.990> listen<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.770> their

we<00:02:25.310> also<00:02:25.489> have<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> master<00:02:26.239> effect<00:02:26.829> on<00:02:27.829> the<00:02:27.980> main

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
we also have a master effect on the main

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.979 
we also have a master effect on the main
mix<00:02:28.400> which<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.670> called<00:02:28.909> spatial<00:02:29.180> crossover

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
mix which is called spatial crossover

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.210 
mix which is called spatial crossover
which<00:02:30.319> allows<00:02:30.590> us<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.010> set<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.629> stereo<00:02:32.629> width

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
which allows us to set the stereo width

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.649 
which allows us to set the stereo width
above<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.430> below<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> crossover<00:02:35.090> point<00:02:35.269> so

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
above and below a crossover point so

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.750 
above and below a crossover point so
even<00:02:35.689> for<00:02:36.109> instance<00:02:36.439> run<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.799> subs<00:02:37.370> in<00:02:37.519> mono

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760

said<00:02:48.150> Mike<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.560> channel<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.520> can<00:02:51.670> see<00:02:51.820> the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
said Mike to a channel you can see the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.390 
said Mike to a channel you can see the
number<00:02:52.360> one<00:02:52.390> splashing<00:02:53.110> there<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:54.220> means

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
number one splashing there that means

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.610 
number one splashing there that means
you<00:02:54.790> can<00:02:54.940> use<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.240> loopers<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:56.230> can<00:02:56.320> build<00:02:56.500> up

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
you can use the loopers you can build up

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.290 
you can use the loopers you can build up
loops<00:02:56.920> from<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.370> Mike<00:02:57.610> if<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:57.910> want<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.180> on

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
loops from the Mike if you want to on

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.180 
loops from the Mike if you want to on
all<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.660> four<00:02:58.870> channels<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.860> use<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
all of the four channels and use the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.580 
all of the four channels and use the
effects<00:03:00.460> is<00:03:00.580> wrong<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.180> then<00:03:01.870> finally<00:03:02.350> on<00:03:02.500> the

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
effects is wrong and then finally on the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.100 
effects is wrong and then finally on the
DV<00:03:02.860> Paul<00:03:03.100> we've<00:03:03.910> done<00:03:04.120> excellent<00:03:04.630> pairing

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
DV Paul we've done excellent pairing

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.260 
DV Paul we've done excellent pairing
that<00:03:05.800> this<00:03:05.980> one<00:03:06.160> isn't<00:03:06.310> paired<00:03:06.640> at<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:06.910> moment

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
that this one isn't paired at the moment

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.540 
that this one isn't paired at the moment
but<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.570> means<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.990> if<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.290> pair<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> cultivar

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
but it means that if you pair a cultivar

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.480 
but it means that if you pair a cultivar
x-linked<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.600> DD<00:03:10.870> form<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.980> can<00:03:12.160> control

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
x-linked to the DD form you can control

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.890 
x-linked to the DD form you can control
all<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.790> loop<00:03:12.940> functions

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
all the loop functions

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.250 
all the loop functions
so<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.500> can<00:03:15.709> have<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:16.459> slip<00:03:17.390> roll<00:03:17.599> as<00:03:17.900> well<00:03:17.930> on

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
so I can have a slip roll as well on

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.289 
so I can have a slip roll as well on
here<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.739> also<00:03:19.010> change<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.640> beep<00:03:19.790> fractions

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
here and also change the beep fractions

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.990 
here and also change the beep fractions
and<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.200> can<00:03:21.379> also<00:03:21.530> mix<00:03:21.890> between<00:03:22.129> the<00:03:22.459> loops<00:03:22.610> and

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
and I can also mix between the loops and

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.350 
and I can also mix between the loops and
the<00:03:23.209> dry<00:03:23.390> signal<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:24.349> pretty<00:03:24.950> powerful<00:03:25.670> update

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
the dry signal so pretty powerful update

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.569 
the dry signal so pretty powerful update
on<00:03:26.480> DV<00:03:26.720> for<00:03:27.670> db2<00:03:28.670> very<00:03:29.629> quickly<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.319> one

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
on DV for db2 very quickly on this one

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.130 
on DV for db2 very quickly on this one
what<00:03:31.579> we've<00:03:31.760> allowed<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.209> do<00:03:32.450> is<00:03:32.780> chain

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
what we've allowed you to do is chain

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.100 
what we've allowed you to do is chain
the<00:03:33.319> effects<00:03:34.120> db2<00:03:35.120> has<00:03:35.239> always<00:03:35.390> been<00:03:35.720> most

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
the effects db2 has always been most

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.460 
the effects db2 has always been most
pain<00:03:36.379> but<00:03:37.370> now<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:38.329> can<00:03:38.510> run<00:03:38.659> one<00:03:38.900> effect<00:03:39.200> unit

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
pain but now you can run one effect unit

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.069 
pain but now you can run one effect unit
into<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.739> other<00:03:39.890> one<00:03:40.329> so<00:03:41.329> for<00:03:41.510> instance<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.900> can

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
into the other one so for instance I can

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.949 
into the other one so for instance I can
put<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.260> resonator<00:03:43.040> on<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.730> effect<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.810> then

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
put a resonator on this effect and then

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.479 
put a resonator on this effect and then
either<00:03:45.260> delay<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.980> as<00:03:46.129> well<00:03:46.310> and

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
either delay to that as well and

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.970 
either delay to that as well and
anything<00:03:46.849> routed<00:03:47.299> through

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
anything routed through

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.970 
anything routed through
XFX<00:03:49.940> unit<00:03:50.360> now<00:03:50.990> automatically<00:03:51.530> changed

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
XFX unit now automatically changed

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.650 
XFX unit now automatically changed

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
you all sewn up the new effect on db2

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.290 
you all sewn up the new effect on db2
and<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.360> also<00:03:59.480> have<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.870> mastering<00:04:00.290> effect

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
and you also have the mastering effect

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.450 
and you also have the mastering effect
