00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390

nine megapixel pictures at 10 frames per

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.440 
nine megapixel pictures at 10 frames per
second<00:02:18.420> which<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.570> hugely<00:02:19.990> hugely<00:02:20.170> impressive

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
second which is hugely hugely impressive

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.910

so<00:02:22.450> if<00:02:22.810> we<00:02:23.290> are<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.770> take<00:02:23.890> picture<00:02:25.860> there<00:02:26.860> you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
so if we are to take picture there you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.890 
so if we are to take picture there you
go<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.550> was<00:02:27.700> about<00:02:27.880> 10<00:02:28.120> pictures<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.690> one

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
go that was about 10 pictures in one

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.070 
go that was about 10 pictures in one
second<00:02:29.380> very<00:02:29.980> very<00:02:30.310> impressive<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:31.750> can<00:02:31.870> flip

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
second very very impressive we can flip

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.770 
second very very impressive we can flip
through<00:02:32.260> them<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:33.250> see<00:02:33.550> them<00:02:33.730> all<00:02:33.790> there<00:02:34.030> how

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
through them and see them all there how

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.970 
through them and see them all there how
about<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:36.690> we<00:02:37.690> can<00:02:37.900> toggle<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.410> range<00:02:38.710> of

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
about that we can toggle a range of

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.220 
about that we can toggle a range of
resolutions<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.180> indeed<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:40.930> go<00:02:41.110> we

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
resolutions and indeed it can go we

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.110 
resolutions and indeed it can go we
think<00:02:41.440> something<00:02:42.070> like<00:02:42.160> 40<00:02:42.640> frames<00:02:42.880> per

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
think something like 40 frames per

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.880 
think something like 40 frames per
second<00:02:43.510> if<00:02:43.600> we<00:02:43.750> drop<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.290> resolution<00:02:44.740> for

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
second if we drop the resolution for

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.910 
second if we drop the resolution for
720p<00:02:45.640> well<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.750> can<00:02:46.930> also<00:02:47.080> expect<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.800> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
720p well you can also expect on the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.350 
720p well you can also expect on the
sony<00:02:48.160> xperia<00:02:48.340> z<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.800> unlimited<00:02:50.820> burst<00:02:51.820> mode<00:02:52.060> so

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
sony xperia z is unlimited burst mode so

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.330 
sony xperia z is unlimited burst mode so
it<00:02:52.480> won't<00:02:52.690> actually<00:02:52.840> run<00:02:53.140> out<00:02:53.530> stop<00:02:54.130> shooting

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
it won't actually run out stop shooting

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.700 
it won't actually run out stop shooting
