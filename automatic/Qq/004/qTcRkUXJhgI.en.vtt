00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.829

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.579
 It's here for you to see down here is 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.800
 an application here the 13 mega point is 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.289
 just hope it is going to depend only on the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.770
 internet of course as soon as you download 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.320
 you will run it and start the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.030
 installation to the station a little delayed 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.329
 that ends up downloading in the applications 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.590
 some important information 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.120
 but I think I'll show you around now 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.280
 so come on it's already over and that 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 three seconds three mega it also the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.400
 internet sites goes super fast 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.890
 ok great on salvador let's execute it 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.140
 it will extract information from the package 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.750
 because it gives a message there depending on the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.330
 your windows 8 to 15 to allow 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.520
 application installation 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.850
 make the copy of the files 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.799
 is required depending on whether it can be 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.590
 faster slower depending on your 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.750
 equipment as we go 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.170
 waiting here is already in the middle when 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.659
 You 're seeing this one, there's not much. 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.439
 Secret how you can see the staff is 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.760

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.980
 some parts there to facilitate the 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.630
 request is too long and tiring 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.940
 then the staff after making the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.860
 install the application and start the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.390
 download some data that the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.570
 packets of data you can see 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.360
 that this step can take a while 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.310
 depending on internet speed 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.110
