00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 and go back to the races back and I 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.259
 agreement a weekend has you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.089
 I asked for the test regulation and I 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.799
 you said I do not want to talk to see if the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.440
 they change again and they changed it again 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.019
 this time for chevrolet 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.750
 asked nothing flattering the dwarf 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.990
 it is clearly the worst car the chevrolet 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.699
 this really a pity the handling by 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.800
 least from my point of view they are 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.580
 doing with so much back and forth 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.930
 and another and another and another because 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.520
 it is unfortunate 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.620
 but I think they are a little 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.270
 lost it seems to me that it has escaped 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.850
 a little bit of the hands the situation of 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.430
 chevrolet that 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.230
 the category and the people of the technique do not 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.149
 I really believed that the chevrolet was 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.950
 bad that at least we do not have 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.660
 acceleration 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.030
 what is very wrong with the brand that has 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.090
 fallen far short of force and the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.850
 Cherokee at the time of accelerating and good 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.280
 I think they have been a little bit 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.130
 concern now to see only in my 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.040
 I am alone, he is the only chevrolet 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.320
 inside the gold cup and they have given this 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.780
 and apart I am struck by how he deals 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.430
 in the case it is very clear that the sun 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.820
 it is very bad that the worst car of the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.470
 category and what they give us and what 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.720
 analyze see if they give us something like what 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.850
 let's see if we give something and I 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 bothered about compression is not 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.060
 thing that we spend for the other side 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.830
 that really catches my attention and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.020
 now with the change regarding the draw 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.970
 of engines returns the great concern 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 for bikers and gas to try to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.580
 equate everything I do not think it's not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 striking also that is both 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.530
 called attention not so much the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.930
 compression that seemed little like that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.340
 spoke more about out of displacement than 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.340
 it's something that really shows 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.409
 and he went for the compression side 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.520
 that something 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.469
 same not a caress and the subject of 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.149
 I draw the engines not even that or ideas 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.609
 that totally caught my attention 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.560
 may worry more god than you 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.850
 bikers have a lot of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.190
 drivers beyond that is the most 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.260
 successful in recent years I did not 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.150
 worries for nothing the truth that the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.549
 engines of laborito that is who more 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.440
 motors are all very even not 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.450
 it goes through a question that there is one one 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.790
 engine or two engines as they say they are 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.190
 and the rest not the little engines 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.319
 have proven to be the best this and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.750
 they are very even all but the reality 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.250
 that lack of power and there's nothing 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.980
 equate the 100 centimeters it has 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.720
 the forum that naturally of an engine of 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420
 the same displacement before which it will be 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.670
 the challenge that she had 12 14 15 horses 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.290
 more now we are thirty-something and 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.690
 well that's what you see on the track 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.090
 there is turn today only rice if 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.379
 between 12 can accompany you if you 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.170
 will you stay some other chevrolet 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.849
 seeing the panorama and they are going to need 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.890
 a little bit of luck too we are already 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.000
 in a final stage and where we have run 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.400
 so many races 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.260
 disadvantages is that the mattress 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.550
 point and before a failure also I think 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.890
 that if I had had a complete ideal 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.960
 instead staron could be eighth 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.580
 I think rafaela stop by 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.830
 example deprived me of adding twenty of 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.650
 points and would have been eighth but 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.400
 eighth not being the best chevrolet well 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.349
 I do not know I wish I wish 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.680
 but not only for being a chevrolet user 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.329
 for being what the category wants not the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.000
 people want it is the ford fight 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.840
 and chevrolet joy chevrolet is not even 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.840
 close to fight
