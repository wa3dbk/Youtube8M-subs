00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.490
 present my montage that allows the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.230
 automatically switch to reports 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.230
 lower if we brake the output kz2 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.000
 who is to us in practice that 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.620
 expressed by a fairly steep slope 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.289
 suddenly the vehicle has trouble getting on 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.580
 and the lower gear snaps into 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.310
 so that's really its purpose 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.960
 so I will start by showing you 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.960
 a little closer the system 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:42.129
 and here I'm going to start I 'm going to do the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:46.079
 turn of all speeds so there 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.920
 it's speed 4 they'll be a little 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.920
 guest straw is engaged 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.120
 speed 2 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.600
 speed one 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.070
 and after 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.170
 if they take four guests this 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.659
 that a zoom in at a moment to go there 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.470
 you have to squeeze very hard so far to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.500
 that the speed of 4 would be inclined to 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.940
 stop so if there are some 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.950
 crunches it's a bit normal for 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.950
 the moment because you see here 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 so normally the two red pieces 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.369
 who are there that should soon declared if 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.320
 you want with a hole in the middle but 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.880
 I had spent those pieces so 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.979
 I had to tinker a little with my 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.350
 sauce so if we had exactly the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.640
 good pieces like in the box of 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.360
 speeds of nlf 77 and celadon I get 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.569
 I am inspired well if we had that it goes 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.390
 it would go nickel so I'll you 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.940
 quickly presented women but the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.319
 Therefore different parts of lynx back 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.270
 here is the red 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.459
 good I tinkered a little bit a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.670
 reduction here with the motor m 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:08.910
 but that's normal because if I 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.160
 put a motor in live and well it 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.209
 would turn too fast and so suddenly 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.829
 it would crack a little bit all so that 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.170
 go here here is the clutch 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.430
 so it's activated that in the passage 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.890
 speeds is being made 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.560
 so compared to a manual box 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.760
 I had to add that so why so 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.940
 I'm going to show you I'm going first 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.799
 remove the engine why it's in mode 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:42.920
 manual it will be much easier for 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:42.920
 to show you all that 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:56.599
 so during the gear shift sometimes 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:03:00.140
 we end up with the case like that 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.909
 it's in the middle of the passage of speed 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.250
 both are engaged in fact 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.329
 and suddenly his strength and his doing all 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.790
 crack wise 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:15.659
 I even had a coffee room farting like 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.769
 that's why I added that 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.319
 that they bar each time because 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:29.670
 that of course for the video I forgot 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:32.519
 to postpone the blockage so when 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.970
 it's in the middle of the passage of speed 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.340
 it snaps 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.000
 I add reproached the camera that 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.599
 snaps 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.180
 So here it does not go below 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.790
 for in speed but it's going here and 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.980
 it turns in the void like that there is 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.069
 no force exercised and when the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.739
 speed is gone hop it's nickel that 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.590
 go back there and serve within returns 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.319
 it stands out there so far it's not too much 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.459
 difficult to understand 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:08.699
 now what is really the the 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.109
 true system of what I did is 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:14.699
 here so here you have the exit 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:17.400
 principal who is here from there to there and to 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:21.479
 instead of going right in front of it just okay 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.680
 go up and when we force here and ben du 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.449
 blow there is a little energy that goes 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.130
 go through there and so the inside goes 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.139
 engage 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.090
 when he is engaged here he is like 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.870
 that slams 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:40.470
 suddenly the engine will turn and when the 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.050
 engine runs full and ben up 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.320
 he raises at the same time the kz and he will 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.210
 down after so its only that lights up 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.330
 and it goes off automatically 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.120
 so here it is a bit it's a little bit 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.250
 center of 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.210
 of my achievement and after ben it's 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.330
 all that is reinforcement and and others 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:09.120
 so there are really three points in 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.910
 my assembly is the clutch that is 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.700
 very important for a box 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.860
 motorized compared to the manual the 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:22.590
 shift of speed that I remember that 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.420
 I copied on the box nfl 77 and the 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.180
 system with the switch that I have 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.470
 galley to do good bah here I think 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.160
 that I said everything in the video of 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.320
 presentation 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.870
 she will be it will be possible to fly it 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.210
 remotely via a joystick it will take 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.310
 just make a few connections and that 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.330
 will be good good I say goodbye 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.330
 and thank you for reading me
