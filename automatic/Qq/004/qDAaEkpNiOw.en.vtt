00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.990
 The attack of the South was an event in the history of the Republic 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.670
 unparalleled 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.190
 These have practically appeared from the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.620
 nothing and initiated an offensive of unprecedented proportions 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.160
 Terrifying reports of the gross wage swing to the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.530
 complete destruction of the public back 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.100
 the rabbis spread 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 the 1 holds however 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.040
 the slaughterhouses that they first appeared in the outskirts 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.769
 of the team 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.620
 Federal and with whom he is dealing in the evening 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.199
 van Santen here a diplomat convoy with a small space fighter escort 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.530
 the Emperor wanted us to do all the power before the actual attack 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 show his troops 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.710
 the diplomats had just enough time to get back 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.020
 they were destroyed 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.840
 right after that, the scenes started a major attack 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.290
 the allies of the republic in the apparu sector 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.330
 who had already fallen before the republican fleet at all 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.900
 arrived 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 then our allies turned against us 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.520
 This is also what we saw in Boke, an established government, he says 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.400
 used around the clock was suddenly the republican fleet 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 in enemy territory and was attacked from all sides 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.760
 the republic represents every available ship in support of the fleet 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.900
 so that only a few ships will be left 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.070
 in the combination bath has 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.040
 something about it unfortunately again hostile hands 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 without the high degree of HTI even knowing it 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.570
 I'm desperate for the republican fleet's call to flee 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.570
 not to destroy the arm completely 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.189
 in other regions the car Linden headed this are 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.699
 destroyed houses throw all sector blocked those of the provincial road 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.079
 and conquered the valuable resources 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.169
 the republican 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.599
 the goods are getting too full and that's exactly what happened 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.009
 back to the attacks 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:28.389
 officials 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.799
 and members of the Jedi's High Council 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.399
 only two sessions Senate and secure the defense of the galaxy 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.209
 angry Senators voted from the meeting 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.329
 the decision to protest 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.349
 had fasted 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.400
 Porsche should 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.920
 they refused military support for other systems 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.399
 deliver 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.399
 he fights every system for himself 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:59.329
 that may have been the last part of the Emperor's plan he had the 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.329
 Republic upset against itself 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.809
 while the republic was involved in political will, the 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.409
 Imperator sets the time for his troops to attack the core of the galaxy 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.099
 prepare 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.449
 probably everything would have been lost in those early years 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:19.289
 Ben Ainslie the championship round generals of the republic on the orders of the senate 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.759
 They would have waited since they took things into their own hands 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.759
 they could slow down the advance of the Empire 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.519
 the Empire's attack was the best and led uncoordinated 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.519
 Military actions of the history of the galaxy 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.429
 that means that several hundred years alone were necessary to prepare 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.859
 is the topic of my next right
