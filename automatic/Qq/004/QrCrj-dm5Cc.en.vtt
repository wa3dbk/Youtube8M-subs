definitely<00:01:52.280> like<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.550> idea<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:52.910> bright<00:01:53.450> heels

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
definitely like the idea of bright heels

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.180 
definitely like the idea of bright heels
with<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:54.050> since<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.440> is<00:01:54.530> all<00:01:54.770> black<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.010> white

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
with it since it is all black and white

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.180 
with it since it is all black and white
so<00:01:56.090> we<00:01:56.360> have<00:01:56.509> black<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:56.900> white<00:01:57.200> trends<00:01:57.710> but

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
so we have black and white trends but

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.999 
so we have black and white trends but
then<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:58.910> added<00:01:59.360> a<00:01:59.869> necklace<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.530> has<00:02:00.710> pops

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
then we added a necklace that has pops

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.540 
then we added a necklace that has pops
of<00:02:01.220> color<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.759> we<00:02:02.420> matched<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.050> shoes

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
of color and we matched it to the shoes

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.060 
of color and we matched it to the shoes
boom<00:02:04.570> well<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.630> really<00:02:06.050> love<00:02:06.229> coal<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.740> orange
