 and we have to remember the dns that we 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.779
 appears here since this number is going 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.450

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.330

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.100
 web page that we can observe in the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.049

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.630
 and it is also 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.970
 and good friends once configured 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.480
 in the game 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.390
 and we continue 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.120
 when what we have to go is to a 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.120
 center that will encourage us fish 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.349
 here 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.110
 so we go to the second floor 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.850
 but this has 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.850
 keep the second floor with 37 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.510
 you know a person from 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.859
 intermediate 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.569
 we choose 60 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:27.829
 just like the exchanges 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.829
 of departure 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.340
 we enter 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.799
 ah 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.799
 yes 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.200
 and 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.410
 after 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.580
 to check it follower of the thick 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.580
 common feeling 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.340
 this case is not good 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.060
 once we no longer have the secondary 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.280
 and before what we have to do 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.230
 I do not much because we're going 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.140
 I have to be here to be that it does not come out 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:00.000
 that has no life what we have to 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.000
 to do is to implement the computer 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.520
 half the time 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:20.570
 if we left it we had to leave 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:26.530
 our pokémon how to use and what 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.530
 we leave at home I'll leave 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.740
 and salinas 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.510
 if we went home 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.760
 and let's have 112 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.320
 and a lot 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.009
 Y 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.009
 we check a pokémon 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.290
 and he already has his normal life and no longer 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.290
 we can use thank you
