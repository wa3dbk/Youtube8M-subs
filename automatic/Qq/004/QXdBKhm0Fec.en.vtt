actually<00:01:31.829> way<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> get<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.150> well

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
actually way to get to do this as well

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.630 
actually way to get to do this as well
actually<00:01:33.420> um<00:01:33.750> basically<00:01:34.439> he<00:01:34.890> will<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.490> an

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
actually um basically he will do an

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.060 
actually um basically he will do an
attack<00:01:35.970> where<00:01:36.180> he<00:01:36.299> throws<00:01:36.600> rings<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:37.110> theree

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
attack where he throws rings out theree

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.620 
attack where he throws rings out theree
I<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.490> they're<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.090> dummy<00:01:39.420> rings

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I think they're just like dummy rings

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.210 
I think they're just like dummy rings
you<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.350> tails<00:01:40.590> further<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.100> like

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you know so what tails further on like

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.460 
you know so what tails further on like
Sonic<00:01:41.460> Heroes<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:42.659> he<00:01:42.780> does<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.170> he

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
Sonic Heroes but when he does them he

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.999 
Sonic Heroes but when he does them he
will<00:01:43.649> briefly<00:01:44.430> go<00:01:45.060> into<00:01:45.329> lose<00:01:45.750> his<00:01:45.899> super<00:01:46.740> form

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
will briefly go into lose his super form

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.760 
will briefly go into lose his super form
so<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.850> another<00:01:48.119> chance<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> attack

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
so you have another chance to attack

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.929 
so you have another chance to attack
yeah<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:50.130> pretty<00:01:50.250> much<00:01:50.369> how<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
yeah that's pretty much how you do it

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.609 
yeah that's pretty much how you do it
just<00:01:51.119> when<00:01:51.630> he<00:01:51.689> gets<00:01:51.869> out<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.170> form<00:01:52.409> just

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
just when he gets out of that form just

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.069 
just when he gets out of that form just
make<00:01:52.829> sure<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.159> act<00:01:53.340> quick<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> attack<00:01:54.689> I

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
make sure you act quick and attack I

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.630 
make sure you act quick and attack I
haven't<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:55.829> been<00:01:55.860> showing<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.460> great

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
haven't really been showing a great

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
haven't really been showing a great
example<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.600> yeah<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.530> it's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
example of this but yeah that it's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.730 
example of this but yeah that it's
really<00:01:59.369> not<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> hard<00:01:59.790> boss<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.990> comparison<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
really not a hard boss in comparison to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.160 
really not a hard boss in comparison to
the<00:02:01.890> doomsday<00:02:02.369> zone<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.630> Death<00:02:03.810> Egg<00:02:03.960> zone

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the doomsday zone and the Death Egg zone

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.370 
the doomsday zone and the Death Egg zone
this<00:02:04.350> boss<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> pushover<00:02:05.219> he's<00:02:05.490> pretty<00:02:05.729> easy

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
this boss is a pushover he's pretty easy

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.779 
this boss is a pushover he's pretty easy
like<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> said<00:02:07.619> he<00:02:07.680> just<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:08.280> can't<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.550> take

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
like I said he just you can't just take

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.029 
like I said he just you can't just take
quite<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> while<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.780> his<00:02:10.440> attack<00:02:10.800> pattern

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
quite a while because his attack pattern

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.160 
quite a while because his attack pattern
is<00:02:11.310> always<00:02:11.489> random<00:02:12.000> sometimes<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.050> could

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
is always random sometimes you could

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.809 
is always random sometimes you could
have<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.410> dude

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
have this dude

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.130 
have this dude
being<00:02:13.999> in<00:02:14.120> like<00:02:14.269> a<00:02:14.299> minute<00:02:14.659> sometimes<00:02:14.900> you

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
being in like a minute sometimes you

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.089 
being in like a minute sometimes you
could<00:02:15.230> haven't<00:02:15.439> beat<00:02:15.530> him<00:02:15.620> in<00:02:15.680> two<00:02:15.799> minutes

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
could haven't beat him in two minutes

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.250 
could haven't beat him in two minutes
you<00:02:16.219> know<00:02:16.329> you<00:02:17.329> can't<00:02:17.510> really<00:02:17.629> estimator

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.170 

alright<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.439> we've<00:02:21.920> pretty<00:02:22.459> sure<00:02:22.639> than<00:02:22.819> any<00:02:22.939> BM

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
alright so we've pretty sure than any BM

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.690 
alright so we've pretty sure than any BM
now<00:02:23.329> here<00:02:24.290> ad<00:02:24.530> doesn't<00:02:24.799> take<00:02:24.980> too<00:02:25.099> many<00:02:25.249> hits<00:02:25.639> I

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
now here ad doesn't take too many hits I

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.160 
now here ad doesn't take too many hits I
think<00:02:25.879> he<00:02:25.969> pretty<00:02:26.359> much<00:02:26.420> all<00:02:26.810> right<00:02:26.840> this<00:02:27.049> is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
think he pretty much all right this is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.229 
think he pretty much all right this is
the<00:02:27.230> attack<00:02:27.439> right<00:02:27.590> now<00:02:28.810> okay<00:02:30.670> there<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.819> go

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
the attack right now okay there you go

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.119 
the attack right now okay there you go
we'd<00:02:32.930> be<00:02:33.019> in<00:02:33.109> the<00:02:33.200> mid<00:02:33.319> air<00:02:33.469> and<00:02:33.680> that's<00:02:33.950> how

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
we'd be in the mid air and that's how

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.069 
we'd be in the mid air and that's how
you<00:02:34.189> defeat<00:02:34.549> him<00:02:34.579> he's<00:02:34.760> really<00:02:35.180> easy<00:02:35.359> like<00:02:36.049> I

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
you defeat him he's really easy like I

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.110 
you defeat him he's really easy like I
said<00:02:36.319> he<00:02:36.409> can<00:02:36.709> vary<00:02:37.099> on<00:02:37.280> his<00:02:37.400> attack<00:02:37.730> patterns

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
said he can vary on his attack patterns

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.789 
said he can vary on his attack patterns
and<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.480> can<00:02:38.750> take<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.049> quite<00:02:39.379> a<00:02:39.439> while<00:02:39.530> to

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
and it can take you quite a while to

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.369 
and it can take you quite a while to
defeat<00:02:40.099> him<00:02:40.280> if<00:02:40.579> he<00:02:41.299> chooses<00:02:41.540> not<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:41.959> attack

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
defeat him if he chooses not to attack

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.890 
defeat him if he chooses not to attack
you<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.620> with<00:02:43.340> those<00:02:43.430> plasma<00:02:44.030> bombs<00:02:44.689> all

Islands are still floating I really
don't<00:02:59.629> understand<00:03:00.139> that<00:03:00.230> at<00:03:00.409> all<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:02.780> makes

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
don't understand that at all it makes

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.569 
don't understand that at all it makes
sense<00:03:03.230> on<00:03:03.409> Sonic<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:03.889> Tails<00:03:03.919> is<00:03:04.219> run<00:03:04.430> because

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
sense on Sonic and Tails is run because

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.909 
sense on Sonic and Tails is run because
Angel<00:03:05.150> Island<00:03:05.239> is<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.780> sea<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.319> then<00:03:06.769> they

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
Angel Island is in the sea and then they

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.559 
Angel Island is in the sea and then they
bring<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.519> mushroom<00:03:07.879> or<00:03:08.030> back<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.359> it<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
bring the mushroom or back to it and

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.670 
bring the mushroom or back to it and
then<00:03:08.659> it<00:03:08.780> floats<00:03:08.959> back<00:03:09.139> up<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.439> sky<00:03:09.620> but

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
then it floats back up in the sky but

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.129 
then it floats back up in the sky but
this<00:03:10.310> always<00:03:10.790> confused<00:03:11.329> me<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.689> ending<00:03:11.989> did

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
this always confused me this ending did

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.319 
this always confused me this ending did
because<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:13.219> Master<00:03:13.579> Emerald<00:03:13.699> is<00:03:13.939> what<00:03:14.120> keeps

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
because the Master Emerald is what keeps

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.270

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
but if it's not on there then it should

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.770 
but if it's not on there then it should
be<00:03:18.530> in<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.709> sea<00:03:18.919> I<00:03:19.159> don't<00:03:19.939> know<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.329> really

an<00:04:21.949> unfinished<00:04:22.310> Sonic<00:04:22.729> Colors<00:04:22.880> DSL<00:04:23.779> P<00:04:23.930> on<00:04:24.020> my

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
an unfinished Sonic Colors DSL P on my

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.629 
an unfinished Sonic Colors DSL P on my
channel<00:04:24.380> which<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.620> could<00:04:24.800> probably<00:04:25.130> start

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
channel which I could probably start

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.810 
channel which I could probably start
doing<00:04:25.940> again

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
doing again

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.160 
doing again
problem<00:04:27.390> with<00:04:27.450> that<00:04:27.570> though<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:27.810> I've<00:04:28.020> lost

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
problem with that though is I've lost

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.380 
problem with that though is I've lost
but<00:04:28.320> safer<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:28.740> think<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.190> deleted<00:04:29.550> therefore<00:04:30.120> I

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
but safer I think I deleted therefore I

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.850 
but safer I think I deleted therefore I
don't<00:04:30.630> know<00:04:30.810> why<00:04:30.960> heap

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
don't know why heap

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.740 
don't know why heap
yeah<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.640> that<00:04:32.940> will<00:04:33.090> probably<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.390> on<00:04:33.480> hold

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
yeah so that will probably be on hold

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.110 
yeah so that will probably be on hold
for<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.080> little<00:04:34.350> while<00:04:34.680> longer<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.340> definitely

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
for a little while longer I definitely
