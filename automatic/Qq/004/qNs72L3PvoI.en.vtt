00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello and welcome to do it 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.310
 yourself inspiration 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.080
 I want a very special one today 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.019
 make beautiful decorations 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 you need a pair of scissors tape 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:20.369
 on a ruler wire and a nice one 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.800
 loop tape is my masking tape 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.560
 a total of three meters long and 50 cm 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.519
 wide and here in length I have it 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.230
 now folded up so that it is 25 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:37.350
 centimeter camp that I measure 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.460
 Now that I'm here in the middle 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.460
 at five centimeters 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.590
 it has the script 25 each 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.940
 by about 25 cm do not know exactly 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.989
 the centimeter 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.480
 next, I had it all so 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.540
 rolled up and that's why I cut that 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.049
 now here so that on the individual 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.049
 be leaves 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.450
 a small rest stays over 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.450
 right after me here with the others 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.979
 So now I put the two papers 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.620
 lay one above the other 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.750
 you do not see everything exactly 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.750
 the same size but about 25 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:46.500
 if they fit like a 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.500
 accordion together 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.670
 as soon as I put it all together and here 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.860
 in the middle 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.160
 Now I fix the whole thing with one 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.160
 wire 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.860
 So I wrap I hereby am quickly 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.860
 several times tight 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.090
 Next, I tie the loop tape 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.690
 once here in the middle 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.690
 with a knot 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:26.269
 Now I know every single paper 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:30.239
 send this and upwards 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.760
 So here's the top half up 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.220
 the bottom has the same down so 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.489
 that the whole behind awarded in round 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.489
 you have to be careful explaining the circle 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.900
 I do the same here on the 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.180
 other side if you go to stories 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.930
 pulled apart has created such a 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.190
 beautiful rose you can see the rose 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.870
 hang up or use as a table decoration 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.050

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.510

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.080
