playing<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.250> course<00:01:53.460> market<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.659> match

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
playing the course market for this match

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.730 
playing the course market for this match
I<00:01:55.200> think<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.560> dormant<00:01:56.100> has<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.149> exit<00:01:57.750> from

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I think the dormant has to exit from

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.459 
I think the dormant has to exit from
their<00:01:58.950> half<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.090> try<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.329> attack<00:02:00.780> with

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
their half and do to try to attack with

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.590 
their half and do to try to attack with
all<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> powers<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.490> about<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> goals

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
all the powers and about the goals

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.120 
all the powers and about the goals
market<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.439> both<00:02:04.680> teams<00:02:04.950> over

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
market I think that both teams over

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
market I think that both teams over
score<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.850> match<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.479> doesn't<00:02:06.990> matter

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
score in this match it doesn't matter

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.550 
score in this match it doesn't matter
that<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:08.250> game<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.789> really<00:02:09.090> close

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
that the game will be really close

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.440 
that the game will be really close
don't<00:02:10.950> want<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.250> try<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> dominate<00:02:11.910> but

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
don't want to try to dominate but

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.750 
don't want to try to dominate but
Juventus<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:13.349> catch<00:02:13.680> them<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.160> break<00:02:14.400> so

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
Juventus will catch them on the break so

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.690 
Juventus will catch them on the break so
another<00:02:15.090> one<00:02:15.840> point<00:02:16.140> 77<00:02:16.920> for<00:02:17.160> both<00:02:17.370> team<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
another one point 77 for both team to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.089 
another one point 77 for both team to
score<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.209> really<00:02:18.900> good<00:02:19.110> model<00:02:19.440> for<00:02:19.470> me<00:02:19.770> all

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
score as a really good model for me all

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.559 
score as a really good model for me all
right<00:02:20.400> I'm<00:02:20.610> which<00:02:20.819> way<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.270> over<00:02:21.540> under

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
right I'm which way on the over under

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.860 
right I'm which way on the over under
two<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.110> half<00:02:22.230> goals<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.620> going<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.870> think

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
two and a half goals you going I think

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.070 
two and a half goals you going I think
that<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.620> will<00:02:25.800> assist<00:02:26.099> an<00:02:26.280> over<00:02:26.580> 2.5<00:02:27.090> goals<00:02:27.150> in

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
that we will assist an over 2.5 goals in

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.140 
that we will assist an over 2.5 goals in
the<00:02:28.290> match<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.920> think<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.250> will<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.610> really

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the match I think it will be a really

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.270 
the match I think it will be a really
entertaining<00:02:30.450> match<00:02:30.930> with<00:02:31.200> over<00:02:31.739> 2.5<00:02:32.220> goals

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
entertaining match with over 2.5 goals

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.820 
entertaining match with over 2.5 goals
in<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> match<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.209> didn't<00:02:33.810> mention<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.709> other

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
in the match I didn't mention the other

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.000 
in the match I didn't mention the other
i<00:02:35.010> think<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.400> around<00:02:36.200> 2.05<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:37.830> i

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
i think it's around 2.05 and if i

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.949 
i think it's around 2.05 and if i
remember<00:02:38.280> correct<00:02:38.790> from<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.450> odds<00:02:39.540> yeah

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
remember correct from the odds yeah

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.720 
remember correct from the odds yeah
that's<00:02:40.349> right<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.739> then<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> under<00:02:41.400> there<00:02:41.580> is

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
that's right and then the under there is

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.660 
that's right and then the under there is
around<00:02:41.970> 1.9<00:02:42.720> very<00:02:43.380> close<00:02:43.799> indeed<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:44.489> but

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
around 1.9 very close indeed there but

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.610 
around 1.9 very close indeed there but
you're<00:02:44.790> going<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.269> over<00:02:45.600> doubling<00:02:46.530> your

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
you're going for the over doubling your

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.740 
you're going for the over doubling your
money<00:02:46.680> if<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.100> bets<00:02:47.310> comes<00:02:47.549> in<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.510> run<00:02:48.720> us

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
money if that bets comes in so run us

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.000 
money if that bets comes in so run us
through<00:02:49.080> your<00:02:49.200> bets<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.650> why<00:02:49.799> you've<00:02:49.980> chosen

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
through your bets and why you've chosen

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.199 
through your bets and why you've chosen
them<00:02:51.200> my<00:02:52.200> secondary<00:02:52.680> tippets<00:02:53.220> draw<00:02:53.519> half<00:02:53.940> time

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
them my secondary tippets draw half time

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.270 
them my secondary tippets draw half time
at<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.420> lot<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.810> 2.2<00:02:55.500> will<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.860> batteries

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
at a lot of 2.2 will the batteries

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.550 
at a lot of 2.2 will the batteries
inside<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:57.209> think<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:58.080> doorman<00:02:58.799> will

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
inside I think that the doorman will

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.380 
inside I think that the doorman will
will<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:02.040> lot<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.459> attack<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.000> first

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
will be a lot in the attack in the first

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.080 
will be a lot in the attack in the first
half<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.930> then<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.920> where<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.430> hubertus

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
half and then this is where the hubertus

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.300 
half and then this is where the hubertus
will<00:03:06.330> depend<00:03:06.690> really<00:03:07.019> good<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.860> think<00:03:07.890> that

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
will depend really good and I think that

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.390 
will depend really good and I think that
will<00:03:08.519> see<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> close<00:03:09.209> match<00:03:09.620> 1100<00:03:10.620> abstract

will see a close match 1100 abstract
time<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.239> think<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:13.140> all<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.340 
time and I think that it's all of the
winners<00:03:13.860> dipped<00:03:14.280> from<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.670> Italy<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.810> my

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
winners dipped from that Italy but my

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.170 
winners dipped from that Italy but my
top<00:03:16.620> tip<00:03:16.859> remains<00:03:17.310> boasting<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:17.940> score

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180
