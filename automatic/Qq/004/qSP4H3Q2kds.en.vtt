ModNation<00:02:12.020> racers<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.800> realized<00:02:13.190> by<00:02:13.370> layering

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
ModNation racers I realized by layering

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.240 
ModNation racers I realized by layering
different<00:02:13.940> decals<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:15.140> could<00:02:15.560> take<00:02:15.770> solid

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
different decals I could take solid

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.820 
different decals I could take solid
shapes<00:02:16.580> squares<00:02:17.569> circles<00:02:17.870> triangles<00:02:18.380> that

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
shapes squares circles triangles that

kind<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.100> thing

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
kind of thing

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.220 
kind of thing
Amala<00:02:19.940> put<00:02:20.330> them<00:02:20.450> all<00:02:20.599> together<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.110> could

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
Amala put them all together and I could

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.380 
Amala put them all together and I could
make<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.500> shape<00:02:21.709> artists<00:02:22.129> going<00:02:22.430> for<00:02:22.700> noses

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
make the shape artists going for noses

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.660 
make the shape artists going for noses
easy<00:02:23.599> it's<00:02:23.870> too<00:02:24.050> long<00:02:24.260> black<00:02:24.650> triangles<00:02:25.370> kind

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
easy it's too long black triangles kind

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.670 
easy it's too long black triangles kind
of<00:02:25.760> overlapping<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.810> then<00:02:27.140> mark<00:02:27.379> out<00:02:27.560> his

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
of overlapping and then mark out his

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.860 
of overlapping and then mark out his
teeth<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.129> just<00:02:28.280> took<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.519> little<00:02:28.760> black<00:02:29.390> skinny

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.440 
teeth I just took a little black skinny
decals<00:02:30.560> kind<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.340> place<00:02:31.580> them<00:02:31.819> out<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.150> space

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
decals kind of place them out and space

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.240 
decals kind of place them out and space
them<00:02:32.660> out<00:02:32.750> correctly<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.440> lined<00:02:33.590> them<00:02:33.800> up<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
them out correctly and lined them up the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.330 
them out correctly and lined them up the
eyes<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:34.730> were<00:02:34.790> two<00:02:35.090> black<00:02:35.330> circles

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
eyes there were two black circles

eyes there were two black circles
twisted<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.459> made<00:02:37.730> him<00:02:37.849> a<00:02:38.000> little<00:02:38.300> stretched

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
twisted I made him a little stretched

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.800 
twisted I made him a little stretched
out<00:02:39.470> for<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.040> white<00:02:40.280> square<00:02:40.760> over<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.599> cut

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
out for the white square over it to cut

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.750 
out for the white square over it to cut
off<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.110> top<00:02:42.290> edge<00:02:42.530> of<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.860> striped<00:02:43.370> suit<00:02:43.580> was

off the top edge of it striped suit was
pretty<00:02:44.030> easy<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.390> took<00:02:44.690> some<00:02:45.019> red<00:02:45.410> rectangles

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
pretty easy I took some red rectangles

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.759 
pretty easy I took some red rectangles
long<00:02:46.430> skinny<00:02:46.819> ones<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.780> layer<00:02:48.319> them<00:02:48.500> on<00:02:48.590> the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
them and duplicated them and then I

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.440 
them and duplicated them and then I
would<00:03:03.769> take<00:03:03.920> like<00:03:04.160> four<00:03:04.459> or<00:03:04.640> six<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.090> them<00:03:05.180> and

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
would take like four or six of them and

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.170 
would take like four or six of them and
make<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.319> decal<00:03:06.860> set<00:03:07.099> out<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.880> just

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
make a decal set out of that and just

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.539 
make a decal set out of that and just
reface<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.079> all<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.440> way<00:03:09.560> around<00:03:09.860> by<00:03:10.160> doing

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
reface that all the way around by doing

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.170 
reface that all the way around by doing
this<00:03:10.670> by<00:03:10.910> layering<00:03:11.390> all<00:03:11.540> these<00:03:11.720> decals<00:03:12.260> I

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
this by layering all these decals I

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.610 
this by layering all these decals I
could<00:03:14.180> get<00:03:14.390> what<00:03:14.569> I<00:03:14.599> wanted<00:03:15.049> skull<00:03:15.410> head

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
could get what I wanted skull head

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.030 
could get what I wanted skull head
always<00:03:16.130> has<00:03:16.480> these<00:03:17.480> knobs<00:03:17.959> on<00:03:18.349> his<00:03:18.500> head<00:03:18.709> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
bones and I want to get it over here on

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.340 
bones and I want to get it over here on
the<00:03:23.000> back<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.299> his<00:03:23.390> head<00:03:23.599> about<00:03:23.959> where<00:03:24.230> it

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
the back of his head about where it

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.860 
the back of his head about where it
should<00:03:24.620> be<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:25.160> really<00:03:25.400> want<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.060> stylize<00:03:26.480> him<00:03:26.750> I

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
should be I really want to stylize him I

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.599 
should be I really want to stylize him I
want<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.139> make<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.350> bones<00:03:27.560> big<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.280> chunky

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
want to make the bones big and chunky

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.640 
want to make the bones big and chunky
and<00:03:28.850> then<00:03:29.060> scale<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.569> his<00:03:29.690> head<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.260> they<00:03:30.470> have

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
and then scale to his head so they have

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.160 
and then scale to his head so they have
the<00:03:30.829> right<00:03:31.239> emotion<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.359> right<00:03:32.510> feel<00:03:32.870> and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
the right emotion the right feel and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.379 
the right emotion the right feel and
then<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.530> will<00:03:33.650> duplicate<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.609> I<00:03:35.000> will<00:03:35.150> pull

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
then I will duplicate it and I will pull

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.770 
then I will duplicate it and I will pull
another<00:03:35.690> one<00:03:35.780> out<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.590> stick<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.220> next<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:38.690> it

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
another one out and stick it next to it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.720 
another one out and stick it next to it
and<00:03:39.290> then<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.620> could<00:03:39.980> just<00:03:40.190> keep<00:03:40.430> duplicating

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
and then I could just keep duplicating

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.840 
and then I could just keep duplicating
it<00:03:41.389> keep<00:03:41.780> reusing<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.440> same<00:03:42.470> shape<00:03:43.069> it<00:03:43.670> just

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
it keep reusing the same shape it just
