something<00:03:06.699> sticking<00:03:07.209> out<00:03:07.419> here<00:03:07.719> you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
something sticking out here you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.569 
something sticking out here you
immediately<00:03:08.620> finger<00:03:09.040> there<00:03:09.219> something

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579

sticking<00:03:09.849> out<00:03:10.000> as<00:03:10.269> well<00:03:10.540> but<00:03:10.659> if<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.900> look

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
sticking out as well but if you look

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.970 
sticking out as well but if you look
closely<00:03:11.290> it's<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.889> circle<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.579> crater<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.980> half

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
closely it's a circle a crater and half

closely it's a circle a crater and half
of<00:03:15.189> it<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.519> six<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.299> shadow<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.900> other

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
of it is six of the shadow and the other

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.550 
of it is six of the shadow and the other
half<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.500> really<00:03:17.769> bright<00:03:18.840> by<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.900> way<00:03:20.199> a<00:03:20.409> very

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
half is really bright by the way a very

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.649 
half is really bright by the way a very
interesting<00:03:21.519> pattern<00:03:21.849> there<00:03:22.060> seems<00:03:22.419> to<00:03:22.569> be

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
interesting pattern there seems to be

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.530 
interesting pattern there seems to be
connected<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.319> this<00:03:23.439> grader<00:03:24.209> here<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:25.419> have

connected to this grader here you have

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.420 
connected to this grader here you have
something<00:03:25.959> very<00:03:26.139> strange<00:03:26.439> time<00:03:26.829> you<00:03:27.040> zoom<00:03:27.250> in

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
something very strange time you zoom in

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.969 
something very strange time you zoom in
a<00:03:27.459> bit<00:03:27.900> yes<00:03:28.900> it's<00:03:29.169> how<00:03:29.290> we're<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.530> this<00:03:29.739> image

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:29.979 
a bit yes it's how we're in this image

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:34.199 
a bit yes it's how we're in this image
as<00:03:30.159> well<00:03:30.340> hold<00:03:30.579> on<00:03:30.729> that<00:03:31.419> thing<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.959> huge<00:03:33.209> now

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
as well hold on that thing is huge now

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.599 
as well hold on that thing is huge now
look<00:03:34.389> at<00:03:34.509> this<00:03:34.659> all<00:03:35.500> goes<00:03:35.799> all<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.129> way<00:03:36.370> like

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
look at this all goes all the way like

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.559 
look at this all goes all the way like
this<00:03:37.290> rolling<00:03:38.290> up<00:03:38.879> no<00:03:39.879> idea<00:03:40.239> what<00:03:40.419> it<00:03:40.540> is

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
this rolling up no idea what it is

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.020 
this rolling up no idea what it is
there's<00:03:41.199> something<00:03:41.650> like<00:03:41.979> a<00:03:42.009> warrior<00:03:42.430> seats

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
there's something like a warrior seats

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.259 
there's something like a warrior seats
going<00:03:43.269> down<00:03:44.069> literally<00:03:45.069> a<00:03:45.220> war<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.729> is<00:03:45.879> a<00:03:45.909> war

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
going down literally a war this is a war

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.800 
going down literally a war this is a war
as<00:03:46.540> well<00:03:46.870> any<00:03:47.379> war<00:03:47.739> with<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.759> curvature<00:03:49.299> in<00:03:49.629> it

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
as well any war with a curvature in it

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.080 
as well any war with a curvature in it
as<00:03:50.680> he<00:03:50.979> curve<00:03:51.280> he<00:03:52.209> calls<00:03:52.419> this<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.840> bridge<00:03:53.109> I

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
as he curve he calls this the bridge I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.059 
as he curve he calls this the bridge I
wouldn't<00:03:55.090> call<00:03:55.239> as<00:03:55.449> a<00:03:55.479> bridge<00:03:55.719> but<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.650> think

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
wouldn't call as a bridge but I think

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.979 
wouldn't call as a bridge but I think
there's<00:03:57.310> two<00:03:57.849> walls<00:03:58.150> part<00:03:58.509> of<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.659> structure

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
there's two walls part of a structure

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.379 
there's two walls part of a structure
and<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.769> is<00:03:59.859> like<00:04:00.009> an<00:04:00.159> entrance<00:04:00.699> could<00:04:01.150> be

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
and this is like an entrance could be

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.959 
and this is like an entrance could be
somewhere<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.949> could<00:04:03.159> be<00:04:03.310> something<00:04:03.549> in<00:04:03.819> there

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:03.969 
somewhere it could be something in there

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.229 
somewhere it could be something in there
in<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.299> past<00:04:04.479> you<00:04:04.689> know<00:04:05.579> this<00:04:06.579> is<00:04:06.609> the<00:04:06.759> tower<00:04:07.060> I

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
in the past you know this is the tower I

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.479 
in the past you know this is the tower I
was<00:04:07.509> talking<00:04:07.900> mad<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.229> looked<00:04:08.409> at<00:04:08.590> huge<00:04:09.099> thing

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
was talking mad and looked at huge thing

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.259 
was talking mad and looked at huge thing
just<00:04:09.819> sticking<00:04:10.599> out<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.989> ground<00:04:12.120> look<00:04:13.120> at

even<00:06:42.419> when<00:06:42.629> the<00:06:42.779> atmosphere<00:06:43.319> this

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:44.309 
even when the atmosphere this

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:47.329 
even when the atmosphere this
interfering<00:06:44.939> his<00:06:45.929> telescope<00:06:46.379> I<00:06:46.589> think<00:06:47.309> that

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:47.339 
interfering his telescope I think that

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:49.040 
interfering his telescope I think that
we<00:06:47.550> can<00:06:47.669> just<00:06:47.939> see<00:06:48.089> a<00:06:48.119> lot<00:06:48.389> more<00:06:48.419> through

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
we can just see a lot more through

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.259 
we can just see a lot more through
telescope<00:06:49.649> than<00:06:49.860> we're<00:06:50.039> seeing<00:06:50.069> on<00:06:50.459> the<00:06:50.610> NASA

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:51.269 
telescope than we're seeing on the NASA

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:54.199 
telescope than we're seeing on the NASA
