for color work today we are using yarn

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
from their brights colorway so the yarn

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
forward around the needle increase is

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.520 
forward around the needle increase is
usually<00:01:00.710> used<00:01:00.980> in<00:01:01.190> lace<00:01:01.610> and<00:01:02.000> it's<00:01:02.530> different

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
usually used in lace and it's different

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.100 
usually used in lace and it's different
than<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:04.070> yarn<00:01:04.430> over<00:01:04.879> because<00:01:05.269> it's<00:01:05.570> used<00:01:05.870> when

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
than a yarn over because it's used when

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.510 
than a yarn over because it's used when
you're<00:01:06.290> transitioning<00:01:07.330> from<00:01:08.330> a<00:01:08.750> knit<00:01:09.229> stitch

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
you're transitioning from a knit stitch

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.210 
you're transitioning from a knit stitch
to<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.550> purl<00:01:11.030> stitch<00:01:11.150> in<00:01:11.720> your<00:01:12.170> pattern<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:12.860> if

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
to a purl stitch in your pattern so if

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.670 
to a purl stitch in your pattern so if
you<00:01:13.340> want<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.580> create<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:14.180> hole<00:01:14.630> or<00:01:14.930> gap<00:01:14.990> in

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
you want to create a hole or gap in

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.860 
you want to create a hole or gap in
between<00:01:15.920> these<00:01:16.400> two<00:01:16.729> for<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.090> specific<00:01:17.390> lace

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
between these two for a specific lace

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.870 
between these two for a specific lace
pattern<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:19.220> would<00:01:19.310> do<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.610> little<00:01:19.700> bit

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
pattern you would do it a little bit

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.850 
pattern you would do it a little bit
differently<00:01:20.210> than<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.810> normal<00:01:21.200> yarn<00:01:21.380> over<00:01:21.650> so

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
differently than a normal yarn over so

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.530 
differently than a normal yarn over so
you<00:01:22.610> can<00:01:22.760> see<00:01:22.940> here<00:01:23.360> in<00:01:23.510> this<00:01:23.930> pattern<00:01:24.460> we<00:01:25.540> had

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
you can see here in this pattern we had

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.090 
you can see here in this pattern we had
just<00:01:26.840> finished<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.260> knit<00:01:27.440> two<00:01:27.620> together<00:01:27.770> so

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
just finished a knit two together so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.250 
just finished a knit two together so
we're<00:01:28.370> on<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.520> knit<00:01:28.820> stitch<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.840> yarn<00:01:30.080> is

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
we're on a knit stitch and the yarn is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.130 
we're on a knit stitch and the yarn is
in<00:01:30.440> back<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:32.360> if<00:01:32.420> we<00:01:32.510> were<00:01:32.659> just<00:01:32.690> going<00:01:32.990> to

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
in back and so if we were just going to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.500 
in back and so if we were just going to
yarn<00:01:33.350> over<00:01:33.619> we<00:01:34.490> would<00:01:34.670> bring<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.060> yarn<00:01:35.299> over

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
yarn over we would bring the yarn over

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.539 
yarn over we would bring the yarn over
the<00:01:36.020> front<00:01:36.320> over<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.799> top<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> needle

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
the front over the top of the needle

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.960 
the front over the top of the needle
right<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.690> then<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.740> yarn<00:01:39.950> would<00:01:40.070> be<00:01:40.280> in<00:01:40.549> back

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
right and then the yarn would be in back

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.260 
right and then the yarn would be in back
but<00:01:41.750> because<00:01:41.930> we<00:01:42.290> need<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.650> purl<00:01:43.010> on<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:44.000> next

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
but because we need to purl on this next

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.410 
but because we need to purl on this next
stitch<00:01:44.570> here<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:46.010> doesn't<00:01:46.250> exactly<00:01:47.180> work

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
stitch here that doesn't exactly work

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.109 
stitch here that doesn't exactly work
out<00:01:47.689> that<00:01:47.960> way<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.200> we<00:01:48.590> insert<00:01:49.369> our<00:01:49.549> needle<00:01:49.970> to

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
out that way so we insert our needle to

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.060 
out that way so we insert our needle to
purl<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.720> then<00:01:50.840> bring<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.170> yarn<00:01:51.320> over<00:01:51.650> and

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
purl and then bring the yarn over and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.810 
purl and then bring the yarn over and
purl<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.979> it's<00:01:54.979> actually<00:01:55.130> going<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.520> give<00:01:55.670> us

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
purl it it's actually going to give us

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.810 
purl it it's actually going to give us
this<00:01:56.030> kind<00:01:56.270> of<00:01:56.330> weird<00:01:56.799> bar<00:01:57.799> stitch<00:01:58.220> along<00:01:58.790> the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
this kind of weird bar stitch along the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.100 
this kind of weird bar stitch along the
top<00:01:59.590> which<00:02:00.590> is<00:02:00.619> really<00:02:01.450> awkward<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.479> knit<00:02:02.840> from

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
top which is really awkward to knit from

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.060 
top which is really awkward to knit from
it's<00:02:03.380> not<00:02:03.590> situated<00:02:04.340> right<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:05.869> it's<00:02:06.380> just<00:02:06.890> not

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
it's not situated right so it's just not

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.509 
it's not situated right so it's just not
going<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.369> look<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.939> same<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:09.289> it's<00:02:09.499> just<00:02:10.310> not

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
going to look the same and it's just not

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.390 
going to look the same and it's just not
as<00:02:10.700> easy<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.450> work<00:02:12.019> with<00:02:12.079> so

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
as easy to work with so

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.000 
as easy to work with so
what<00:02:14.030> we<00:02:14.150> do<00:02:14.390> instead<00:02:14.599> is<00:02:14.989> we<00:02:15.409> do<00:02:15.799> what's

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
what we do instead is we do what's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.699 
what we do instead is we do what's
called<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> yarn<00:02:16.670> forward<00:02:17.420> around<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
called the yarn forward around the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.369 
called the yarn forward around the
needle<00:02:18.950> which<00:02:19.909> is<00:02:20.150> abbreviated<00:02:20.720> Y<00:02:21.620> F<00:02:22.010> RN<00:02:23.379> so

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
needle which is abbreviated Y F RN so

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.410 
needle which is abbreviated Y F RN so
for<00:02:25.010> step<00:02:25.220> one<00:02:25.489> we're<00:02:25.730> going<00:02:25.879> to<00:02:26.030> bring<00:02:26.239> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
for step one we're going to bring the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.190 
for step one we're going to bring the
yarn<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.290> front<00:02:27.439> of<00:02:28.010> our<00:02:28.790> work<00:02:29.090> since<00:02:29.480> we

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
that will place the yarn right where we

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.030 
that will place the yarn right where we
want<00:02:54.349> it<00:02:54.500> for<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.459> purl<00:02:55.909> stitch<00:02:56.139> so<00:02:57.139> then<00:02:57.739> for

step four look I lost it

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.970 
step four look I lost it
step<00:03:01.250> four<00:03:01.549> we're<00:03:01.819> just<00:03:02.000> going<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.209> purl<00:03:02.540> our

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
step four we're just going to purl our

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.530 
step four we're just going to purl our
next<00:03:03.980> stitch<00:03:04.220> as<00:03:04.519> normal<00:03:06.760> okay<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:07.819> let<00:03:08.299> me<00:03:08.389> do

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
next stitch as normal okay so let me do

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.690 
next stitch as normal okay so let me do
that<00:03:08.780> one<00:03:09.620> more<00:03:09.799> time<00:03:09.859> I'm<00:03:10.370> just<00:03:10.519> going<00:03:10.670> to

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
that one more time I'm just going to

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.960 
that one more time I'm just going to
undo<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.209> real<00:03:11.480> quick<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:13.010> I'll<00:03:13.760> talk

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
undo this real quick and I'll talk

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.520 
undo this real quick and I'll talk
through<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.329> little<00:03:14.540> bit<00:03:14.629> more<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.049> the

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
through it a little bit more so the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.110 
through it a little bit more so the
reasons<00:03:15.829> why<00:03:15.920> it's<00:03:16.069> called<00:03:16.250> yarn<00:03:16.609> forward

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
reasons why it's called yarn forward

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.939 
reasons why it's called yarn forward
around<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.049> needles<00:03:18.319> because<00:03:18.470> we<00:03:18.680> yarn

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:18.949 
around the needles because we yarn

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.339 
around the needles because we yarn
forward<00:03:19.310> first<00:03:19.849> and<00:03:20.299> bring<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.810> yarn<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.260> the

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
forward first and bring the yarn to the

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.360 
forward first and bring the yarn to the
front<00:03:21.739> then<00:03:22.489> we<00:03:22.760> bring<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.750> yarn<00:03:23.959> around<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
front then we bring the yarn around the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.659 
front then we bring the yarn around the
needle<00:03:25.849> over<00:03:26.449> the<00:03:27.109> top<00:03:27.349> and<00:03:27.650> back<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.549> the

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
needle over the top and back to the

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.220 
needle over the top and back to the
front<00:03:28.909> and<00:03:29.060> having<00:03:29.329> it<00:03:29.419> back<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> front<00:03:30.109> is

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
front and having it back to the front is

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.439 
front and having it back to the front is
the<00:03:30.260> key<00:03:30.620> part<00:03:30.829> of<00:03:31.040> this<00:03:31.190> because<00:03:31.430> if<00:03:31.819> we<00:03:32.120> were

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
the key part of this because if we were

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.399 
the key part of this because if we were
just<00:03:32.480> going<00:03:33.459> forward<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.699> over<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:36.199> we<00:03:36.290> were

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
just going forward and over and we were

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.300 
just going forward and over and we were
doing<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.739> knit<00:03:36.949> stitch<00:03:37.099> then<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:40.010> would<00:03:40.159> be

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
doing a knit stitch then that would be

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.339 
doing a knit stitch then that would be
similar<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.180> this<00:03:41.690> would<00:03:41.900> actually<00:03:42.169> just<00:03:42.260> be

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
similar to a this would actually just be

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.210 
similar to a this would actually just be
a<00:03:42.440> yarn<00:03:42.919> over<00:03:43.129> the<00:03:44.060> needle<00:03:44.829> which<00:03:45.829> we<00:03:46.040> would

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
a yarn over the needle which we would

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.580 
a yarn over the needle which we would
use<00:03:46.250> if<00:03:46.669> we<00:03:47.209> were<00:03:47.359> going<00:03:47.569> from<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:48.169> purl<00:03:48.470> stitch

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
use if we were going from a purl stitch

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.770 
use if we were going from a purl stitch
to<00:03:49.159> a<00:03:49.190> knit<00:03:49.459> stitch<00:03:49.609> so<00:03:52.060> so<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.209> yarn<00:03:53.389> forward

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
to a knit stitch so so the yarn forward

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.659 
to a knit stitch so so the yarn forward
is<00:03:53.989> bring<00:03:54.229> them<00:03:54.349> in<00:03:54.500> front<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.040> back<00:03:55.400> around

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
is bring them in front and back around

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.899 
is bring them in front and back around
and<00:03:56.389> ready<00:03:57.109> to<00:03:57.199> purl<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.889> a<00:03:58.519> lot<00:03:58.639> of<00:03:58.699> people

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
and ready to purl and a lot of people

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.990 
and ready to purl and a lot of people
get<00:03:59.000> confused<00:03:59.569> by<00:03:59.750> the<00:04:00.260> differences<00:04:00.769> between

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
get confused by the differences between

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.670 
get confused by the differences between
these<00:04:02.000> abbreviations<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:03.109> sometimes<00:04:03.590> they

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
these abbreviations and sometimes they

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.319 
these abbreviations and sometimes they
think<00:04:03.889> why<00:04:04.159> not<00:04:04.340> just<00:04:04.459> do<00:04:04.579> a<00:04:04.609> yarn<00:04:04.909> over<00:04:05.060> and

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
think why not just do a yarn over and

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.469 
think why not just do a yarn over and
this<00:04:05.930> is<00:04:06.079> why<00:04:06.199> we<00:04:06.379> use<00:04:06.560> this<00:04:06.739> specific<00:04:07.479> style

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:08.479 
this is why we use this specific style

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.640 
this is why we use this specific style
of<00:04:08.810> yarn<00:04:09.169> over<00:04:09.560> in<00:04:10.549> order<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.540> make<00:04:11.750> this<00:04:12.349> lace

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
of yarn over in order to make this lace

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.009 
of yarn over in order to make this lace
stitch<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:14.090> that's<00:04:14.269> how<00:04:14.389> you<00:04:14.449> do<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.629> yarn

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
stitch so that's how you do the yarn

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.780 
stitch so that's how you do the yarn
forward<00:04:15.290> round<00:04:15.590> needle

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
forward round needle
