00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.799
 let's make some fish puffs 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.040
 if you do not want to lose or any of my 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.040
 videos subscribe to the channel we started 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.310
 and the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.789
 they are puff pastry a chive and a 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.270
 leek minced olive oil 600 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.760
 grams of rooster 3 striped tomatoes 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.970
 Provenza herbs 2 cloves of garlic 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.970
 chopped half glass of white wine a 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.300
 little salt a laurel leaf 7 eggs 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.180
 quail cooked and peeled some leaves 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.540
 of sage and an egg and the first thing that 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.860
 we are going to do is remove the skin 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.189
 fish 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.890
 I have already removed the skin to the other fish 

00:00:55.189 --> 00:01:00.680
 I'm going to show you how to do it then 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.369
 I'm going to take it off this bit this 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.369
 It's the knife 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.500
 abbas of the skin and vice 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.200
 and vice sliding it as you see it goes 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.990
 leaving the skin and the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.580
 clean fish the knife has to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.240
 cut well has to be pretty 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.210
 sharp and as you can see the fish has come out 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.180
 clean and the skin has stayed here and 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.700
 now we will go to the fire to make 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.670
 the fish stir-fry first we will throw 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.520
 in this oil pan to make the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.609
 fried tomato 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.009
 and here in this other pan we are going to throw 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:44.770
 oil also to support chive 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.770
 and the leek we are going to take the agito 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.340
 and we are going to wait for it to last us a 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.100
 bit 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.829
 We have fire in a fire and so on 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.600
 we will keep it now since it has been 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.109
 brown a little garlic 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.109
 tomato 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.220
 we are going to take a little salt 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.710
 and in the other pan let's take the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.760
 chives 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.189
 and we will also throw the sane 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.269
 and we're going to make a little bit of salt for 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.269
 that bears before 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.400
 Now let's add fish 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.400
 that as you can see is cut into pieces 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.020
 and we are going to remove it so that it 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.300
 we are doing 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.920
 and in this case the caught is me because 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.690
 It was well priced in the fish market 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.570
 but this deal can be done 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.700
 equally with whiting or with rest 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.670
 what have you left of others 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.880
 fish 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.140
 You can also do it 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.640
 taking advantage of fish remains that 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.560
 you have for the refrigerator 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.110
 we are going to take a little more salt 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.959
 because the fish had no salt 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.959
 Now we're going to pour the wine and we're going to 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.090
 let me reduce I'm going to add these 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.370
 herbs of provence 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.400
 Now I'm going to take a little bit of 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.220
 pepper but this is optional if 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.190
 you want to put him and if not no it is not 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.390
 necessary and so and the fish also 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.060
 I'm going to put a little 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.860
 but as I say it is optional it has been 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.770
 forgotten to throw the bay leaf the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.170
 I will put now 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.490
 so that it takes a little bit of flavor what 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.770
 we will leave at the minimum 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.740
 keep cooking a little bit more I'll leave 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.370
 cutting a sprig of sage to 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.760
 tomato two leaves and these two are the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.830
 let's throw the fish here the tomato 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.980
 we have it ready, we are going to turn it off and 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.290
 we already have the fish ready 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.120
 turn it off and is now below 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.120
 let's stretch the puff pastry 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.280
 now let's take the filling in the 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.280
 center 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.060
 and now we are going to put the eggs of 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.060
 quail 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.919
 now we are going to put a little bit of 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:25.310
 Fried tomato to give you more 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.310
 flavor now let's join the puff pastry 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.159
 we wet our finger and we wet the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.949
 puff pastry so that the other part sticks 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.060
 let's hit a little bit to press 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.490
 so that it sticks 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.310
 we will cut a little bit the excess 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.560
 to stick here with a fork what 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.009
 we will paint with beaten egg and what 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.500
 we'll bake about 20 minutes at 180 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.840
 degrees then we have our 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.060

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.430
