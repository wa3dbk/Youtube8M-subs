but the egg-eater snake can swallow an

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.470 
but the egg-eater snake can swallow an
egg<00:00:04.620> ten<00:00:05.009> times<00:00:05.310> as<00:00:05.520> big<00:00:05.730> as<00:00:05.850> his<00:00:06.029> head<00:00:06.060> without

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
egg ten times as big as his head without

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.240 
egg ten times as big as his head without
breaking<00:00:07.049> it<00:00:07.230> or<00:00:07.440> his<00:00:07.830> head

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.240 

he<00:00:11.240> unhooks<00:00:11.750> his<00:00:11.990> lower<00:00:12.230> jaw<00:00:12.650> from<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.070> rest

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
he unhooks his lower jaw from the rest

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.010 
he unhooks his lower jaw from the rest
of<00:00:13.370> his<00:00:13.490> face<00:00:13.670> so<00:00:14.150> he<00:00:14.240> can<00:00:14.389> open<00:00:14.540> his<00:00:14.719> mouth

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
of his face so he can open his mouth

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.830 
of his face so he can open his mouth
wide<00:00:15.290> enough

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.560 

at<00:00:19.320> first<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.949> egg<00:00:20.099> keeps<00:00:20.490> slipping<00:00:20.699> away<00:00:20.970> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
at first the egg keeps slipping away and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.200 
at first the egg keeps slipping away and
he<00:00:21.720> goes<00:00:21.869> round<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.259> circles<00:00:22.970> but<00:00:23.970> he<00:00:24.060> has<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
he goes round in circles but he has a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.179 
he goes round in circles but he has a
good<00:00:24.419> reason<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.840> that

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
good reason for that

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.979 
good reason for that
eventually<00:00:26.189> he<00:00:26.550> has<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.910> egg<00:00:27.029> surrounded<00:00:27.630> so

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
eventually he has the egg surrounded so

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.650 
eventually he has the egg surrounded so
it<00:00:28.079> can<00:00:28.320> slip<00:00:28.590> away<00:00:28.710> anymore<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.820> now<00:00:30.270> he<00:00:30.329> can

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
it can slip away anymore and now he can

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:47.950 
it can slip away anymore and now he can
do<00:00:30.750> his<00:00:30.900> trick

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.540 

once<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.170> egg<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.590> safely<00:00:49.890> inside<00:00:50.100> him<00:00:50.520> he

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
once the egg is safely inside him he

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.940 
once the egg is safely inside him he
crushes<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.240> and<00:00:51.780> squeezes<00:00:52.380> out<00:00:52.500> all<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.830> good

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
crushes it and squeezes out all the good

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.610 
crushes it and squeezes out all the good
stuff<00:00:53.010> without<00:00:53.490> spilling<00:00:53.880> a<00:00:54.060> drop<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:55.440> few

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
stuff without spilling a drop and a few

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.440 
stuff without spilling a drop and a few
minutes<00:00:55.740> later<00:00:55.920> he<00:00:56.310> ejects<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> shell<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
minutes later he ejects the shell in a

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.070 
minutes later he ejects the shell in a
neat<00:00:57.660> disposable<00:00:58.500> package<00:00:58.890> yeah<00:00:59.930> but<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.020> you
