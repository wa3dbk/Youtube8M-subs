to<00:00:44.309> afford<00:00:44.670> coming<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
to afford coming here because of the the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
to afford coming here because of the the
sports<00:00:47.550> people<00:00:48.000> who<00:00:48.239> were<00:00:48.390> being<00:00:48.600> treated<00:00:48.870> and

sports people who were being treated and
the<00:00:50.539> professionalism<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> saw<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the professionalism and what I saw was a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
the professionalism and what I saw was a
little<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.699> intimidating<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.539> thought<00:00:55.020> maybe

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
little bit intimidating I thought maybe

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.930 
little bit intimidating I thought maybe
I<00:00:55.410> wasn't<00:00:55.680> worth<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.129> treatment<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.820> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
I wasn't worth the treatment that I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.930 
I wasn't worth the treatment that I
would<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.800> found<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.579> very

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
inside out and things started to connect

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.650 
inside out and things started to connect
for<00:03:09.989> me<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.470> get<00:03:10.680> better<00:03:10.860> for<00:03:11.220> me<00:03:11.400> more<00:03:11.849> with

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
for me and get better for me more with

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
emotions first before I really started

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.199 
emotions first before I really started
to<00:03:18.989> notice<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.440> lot<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.709> pain<00:03:20.069> relief<00:03:20.519> but

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
to notice a lot of pain relief but

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.770 
to notice a lot of pain relief but
knowing<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.019> those<00:03:22.230> things<00:03:22.700> happened

encouraged<00:03:24.780> me<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:24.989> keep<00:03:25.260> coming<00:03:25.650> back<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.250> I

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
encouraged me to keep coming back and I

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.729 
encouraged me to keep coming back and I
knew<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.180> with<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.569> progress<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.260> things

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
were going to keep happening and as as I

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.819 
were going to keep happening and as as I
keep<00:03:32.280> being<00:03:32.700> seen<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.680> healing<00:03:34.680> is

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
keep being seen the healing is

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.210 
keep being seen the healing is
continuing<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.120> now<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> know<00:03:37.200> without<00:03:37.680> any

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
continuing and I now I know without any
