he said well we've got these plastic
acrylic<00:01:07.290> shells<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> use<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
acrylic shells and we can use a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
acrylic shells and we can use a
different<00:01:09.479> color<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.020> each<00:01:10.140> drum<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.830> then

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
different color for each drum and then

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.730 
different color for each drum and then
we<00:01:11.100> could<00:01:11.220> put<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:12.049> fluorescent<00:01:13.049> light<00:01:13.439> bulb

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
we could put a fluorescent light bulb

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
we could put a fluorescent light bulb
inside<00:01:14.070> each<00:01:14.250> drum<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.909> it'll<00:01:15.360> light<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.600> like

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
inside each drum and it'll light up like

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.929 
inside each drum and it'll light up like
all<00:01:16.200> these<00:01:16.350> different<00:01:16.680> colors<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.759> I'm

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
all these different colors and I'm

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
all these different colors and I'm
thinking<00:01:18.240> there's<00:01:18.450> no<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.680> gonna

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
thinking there's no way this is gonna

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.249 
thinking there's no way this is gonna
work<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.810> first<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.900> all<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> plastic

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
work because first of all the plastic

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.070 
work because first of all the plastic
shells<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.770> gonna<00:01:22.860> sound<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.600> then<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
shells are gonna sound like and then the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.660 
shells are gonna sound like and then the
bulbs<00:01:25.350> are<00:01:25.439> gonna<00:01:25.530> break<00:01:25.740> every<00:01:25.920> night<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.640> I

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
bulbs are gonna break every night when I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.630 
bulbs are gonna break every night when I
hit<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> TomTom<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.890> thought<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
hit the TomTom and I just thought this

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.780 
hit the TomTom and I just thought this
is<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:30.030> gonna<00:01:30.150> work<00:01:30.860> but<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.310> proven<00:01:32.640> wrong

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
is not gonna work but I was proven wrong

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
is not gonna work but I was proven wrong
