00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
here which is the mcx antenna so that's

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.420 
here which is the mcx antenna so that's
how<00:03:22.660> their<00:03:23.109> ports<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.769> back<00:03:23.949> of<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.190> unit

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
how their ports on the back of the unit

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.240 
how their ports on the back of the unit
look<00:03:24.639> and<00:03:25.030> then<00:03:25.989> back<00:03:26.349> to<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> front<00:03:26.889> as<00:03:27.069> you
