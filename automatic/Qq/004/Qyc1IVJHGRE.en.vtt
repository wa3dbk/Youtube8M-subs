00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
thing a belted coat is like a trench

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.259 
thing a belted coat is like a trench
coat<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> coat<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.090> then<00:00:27.150> you

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
coat and you have a coat and then you

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.689 
coat and you have a coat and then you
have<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> belt<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.710> same<00:00:28.920> material<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
have a belt in the same material and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.370 
have a belt in the same material and
it's<00:00:29.939> sort<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.630> dressing-gown<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
it's sort of like a dressing-gown in the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's sort of like a dressing-gown in the
way<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.769> why<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> belt<00:00:32.250> functions<00:00:32.880> just<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
way that why the belt functions just to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.049 
way that why the belt functions just to
swish<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.230> around<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.500> middle<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.969> be

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
swish it around the middle and it can be

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.780 
swish it around the middle and it can be
very<00:00:36.210> cozy<00:00:36.770> it's<00:00:37.770> quite<00:00:38.070> hard<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.520> get<00:00:38.670> that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
very cozy it's quite hard to get that

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
very cozy it's quite hard to get that
look<00:00:39.200> looking<00:00:40.200> sharp

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
look looking sharp

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.850 
look looking sharp
because<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.579> belt<00:00:42.300> tends<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.809> kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.230> merge

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
because the belt tends to kind of merge

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.729 
because the belt tends to kind of merge
into<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> rest<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> shape<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> coat

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
into the rest of the shape of the coat

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.779 
into the rest of the shape of the coat
unless<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.860> spend<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.160> lot<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> time<00:00:47.579> sort<00:00:47.760> of

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
unless you spend a lot of time sort of

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.639 
unless you spend a lot of time sort of
sending<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.270> straight<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.649> putting

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
sending out very straight and putting

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.900 
sending out very straight and putting
your<00:00:49.770> tummy<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> don't<00:00:50.579> really

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
your tummy in which you don't really

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.000 
your tummy in which you don't really
when<00:00:51.149> you're<00:00:51.300> spending<00:00:51.570> at<00:00:51.660> bus<00:00:51.780> stop<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
when you're spending at bus stop so a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.369 
when you're spending at bus stop so a
coat<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.460> belt<00:00:53.670> kind<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.600> defines<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
coat with a belt kind of defines the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
coat with a belt kind of defines the
whole<00:00:55.530> belt<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.010> little<00:00:56.070> bit<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> it's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
whole belt a little bit more and it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
whole belt a little bit more and it's
just<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.719> bit<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> slicker<00:00:58.500> way<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.010> working

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
just a bit of a slicker way of working

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
just a bit of a slicker way of working
the<00:00:59.489> look<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.750> think<00:01:00.899> it's

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the look I think so I think it's

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
the look I think so I think it's
something<00:01:01.170> worth<00:01:01.940> differentiating<00:01:02.940> between

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
something worth differentiating between

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.600 
something worth differentiating between
of<00:01:03.809> course<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.799> put<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.189> normal

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
of course you can just put your normal

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.969 
of course you can just put your normal
codes<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.270> put<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> belt<00:01:07.200> over<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> top<00:01:07.740> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
codes and put a belt over the top you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.050 
codes and put a belt over the top you
see<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> thought<00:01:08.610> last<00:01:08.850> time

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
see this is what I thought last time

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.480 
see this is what I thought last time
this<00:01:09.450> trend<00:01:10.020> was<00:01:10.200> around<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:11.040> fact<00:01:11.250> three

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
this trend was around in fact three

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.670 
this trend was around in fact three
years<00:01:11.729> ago<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:13.229> doesn't<00:01:13.409> work

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
years ago but that actually doesn't work

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
years ago but that actually doesn't work
because<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.310> get<00:01:15.299> dressed<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.689> put<00:01:15.810> your

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
coat on you put the belt over top you

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.190

leather<00:03:26.260> rather<00:03:26.650> than<00:03:26.950> just<00:03:27.130> more<00:03:27.340> wool<00:03:27.580> wear

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
leather rather than just more wool wear

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.670 
leather rather than just more wool wear
really<00:03:28.060> does<00:03:28.300> make<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.720> feel<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.170> bit<00:03:29.650> more

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
really does make it feel a bit more

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.290 
really does make it feel a bit more
dressy<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:32.580> again<00:03:33.580> with<00:03:33.730> this<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.120> is<00:03:34.180> a

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
dressy and again with this this is a

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.070 
dressy and again with this this is a
trench<00:03:34.630> coat<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.320> Tommy<00:03:35.650> trench<00:03:35.950> coat

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
trench coat this is a Tommy trench coat

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.940 
trench coat this is a Tommy trench coat
which<00:03:38.080> you<00:03:38.260> could<00:03:38.380> obviously<00:03:38.530> worry<00:03:38.770> that

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
which you could obviously worry that

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.949 
which you could obviously worry that
with<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.520> normal<00:03:39.970> trench<00:03:40.270> coat<00:03:40.450> belt<00:03:40.660> but<00:03:40.810> this

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
with a normal trench coat belt but this

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.320 
with a normal trench coat belt but this
year<00:03:41.200> they're<00:03:41.380> doing<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.740> with<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:42.070> glossy<00:03:42.970> belt

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
year they're doing it with a glossy belt

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.910 
year they're doing it with a glossy belt
which<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:43.840> gives<00:03:44.020> it<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.170> bit<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.500> kind<00:03:44.800> of

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
which just gives it a bit of a kind of

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.210 
which just gives it a bit of a kind of
punchier<00:03:45.940> feel<00:03:46.300> I<00:03:46.570> think<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.110> then<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.010> high

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
punchier feel I think and then a high

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.170 
punchier feel I think and then a high
street<00:03:48.490> version<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.030> same<00:03:49.360> idea<00:03:49.750> here

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
street version of the same idea here

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.630 
street version of the same idea here
this<00:03:52.180> one<00:03:52.360> is<00:03:52.980> good<00:03:53.980> value<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.310> think<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:54.550> is

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
this one is good value I think this is

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.680 
this one is good value I think this is
about<00:03:54.820> 180<00:03:55.570> pounds<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.680> one<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.209> car<00:03:58.480> key

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
about 180 pounds this one in a car key

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.850 
about 180 pounds this one in a car key
and<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:58.900> think<00:03:59.080> these<00:03:59.170> colours<00:03:59.530> just<00:03:59.740> look

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
and I think these colours just look

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.199 
and I think these colours just look
really<00:03:59.980> nice<00:04:00.160> together<00:04:00.580> as<00:04:00.730> well<00:04:00.910> because

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
really nice together as well because

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.320 
really nice together as well because
that<00:04:01.390> all<00:04:01.780> over<00:04:02.380> beige<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.520> trench<00:04:03.760> coat<00:04:03.850> can

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
that all over beige of a trench coat can

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.300 
that all over beige of a trench coat can
make<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.050> little<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.320> little<00:04:05.530> bit<00:04:05.680> mushroomy<00:04:06.280> I

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
make you little a little bit mushroomy I

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.740 
make you little a little bit mushroomy I
think<00:04:06.580> it's<00:04:06.700> quite<00:04:06.910> nice<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.150> have<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> bit<00:04:07.570> of<00:04:07.660> a

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
think it's quite nice to have a bit of a

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.729 
think it's quite nice to have a bit of a
bit<00:04:08.320> of<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.760> different<00:04:09.760> contrast<00:04:10.209> at<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.450> waist

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.039 

there<00:04:15.739> we<00:04:15.830> have<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.130> coats<00:04:17.000> over<00:04:17.269> belts<00:04:17.750> not

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
there we have it coats over belts not

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.810 
there we have it coats over belts not
belted<00:04:18.260> coats<00:04:18.650> don't<00:04:18.950> forget<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.459> most

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
belted coats don't forget and most

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.610 
belted coats don't forget and most
importantly<00:04:20.329> do<00:04:20.600> not<00:04:20.630> take<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.019> belt<00:04:21.200> off<00:04:21.350> and

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
importantly do not take the belt off and

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.940 
importantly do not take the belt off and
leave<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.310> in<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.730> coke
