00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 and how about friends from youtube I send you a 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.359
 great greeting and good today we are going to see a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.380
 minecraft video how to get gold 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.420
 diamond or iron infinitely good 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.960
 let's start what we're going to need 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.240
 it will be at least 1 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.440
 if we want only one cube of gold or 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.490
 diamonds a diamond cube and so 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.380
 to do we will need 9 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.380
 pieces of each material 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:38.460
 be it nine nine gold of 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.460
 19 diamond iron 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.740
 and here I have them to craft two 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.650
 I'm going to spend nine gold 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.110
 I go to the craft table 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.100
 I move to the bottom in 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.430
 the left side 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.120
 to make a block he will ask us 9 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.460
 gold bullion 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.159
 here I have them and she became a cube 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.950
 and it can be reversible also to be 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.720
 ingots 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.909
 we selected a cube and he gave us the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.009
 9 others 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.159
 this is the first piece if you have to 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.799
 get it in the mines from a 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.280
 cube you can already do infinitely the 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.490
 material 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.650
 and good as you see I have only 2 of 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.850
 diamond 2 gold I have no more we are going to 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.150
 put them 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.000
 on the floor you can put them as you 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.110
 want or the amount they want in 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.890
 less than two either one or two can be 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.320
 one diamond single one gold one 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.270
 and good a very important point there 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.870
 Sometimes it may turn out there are times 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.270
 Do not keep trying if it works 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.729
 only that there are times that it does not give you the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.440
 good result I already put the ones that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.140
 they had the inventory of the posts 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.729
 I now leave the game what 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.100
 let's do it's going to be close the game 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.430
 pressing the start button twice 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.650
 to access multitasking and now that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.739
 we have left those icons we keep 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.520
 pressed on whatever it is and we close the 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.370
 game pressing on the red circle of 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.220
 minecraft has closed we go back to 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.490
 minecraft I repeat there are times that no no 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.850
 they will 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.740
 when it turns out there are times that if they try and 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.340
 I also recommend not doing much 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.130
 in a span of time well this as you 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.200
 I said there are times that it will not turn out 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.130
 me it has not turned out we're going to go back to 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.130
 try 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.840
 breaking the blocks again if not 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.840
 they find it and we are going to return them to 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.190
 place on the ground the same two with 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.190
 those that I started here I have them 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.560
 I repeat, you can place what you 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.560
 want to close the game again 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.920
 we go back to minecraft if it's a 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.500
 little unruly but believe me it's more 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.280
 annoying to look for materials in 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.280
 the mines 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.630
 and as you see now it's called me it turned out 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.550
 I have two gold two diamond that 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.740
 They were those that had I initially more 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:36.610
 the ones that I have on the ground 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.370
 and give a total of 4 I repeat to you 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.390
 start if they need to have a minimum 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.660
 block of each material if they want gold or 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.819
 diamond a minimum block and with that 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.920
 they can do many more 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.170
 because they are very difficult materials 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.810
 get 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.780
 so I recommend you do this 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.970
 this method and good when you find them 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.200
 simple since I have four keep them 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.140
 in a trunk 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.930
 they stay with two to do the same 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.760
 procedure now I already have two in 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.799
 the trunk of each material and two in the 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.320
 inventory we repeat also 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.570
 one of you is more likely to 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.080
 result because when I use this 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.430
 application to record this screen 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.810
 of the iphone, I do not almost find it 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.790
 then this one to you is easier than 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.610
 it works for you and I put the two that I 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.270
 had I do not have anything else we closed the 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.270
 game again 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.369
 and we reopen minecraft 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.100
 this well this I repeat you speak in a 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.130
 number turned out I only have those of those of 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.310
 down we are going to repeat the 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.640
 procedure this happens to me because 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.620
 I tell them I have the application to 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.140
 record the iphone screen i already what 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.630
 I have tried without the application 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.290
 running and if you give me a very good 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.290
 result 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.610
 and I say to you it 's more likely that 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:26.580
 they are well they are the two 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.370
 we close the game of facts and 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.240
 They already realized when I left here 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:36.949
 there is a red line which tells me that 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.949
 is recording the screen 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.300
 and sometimes that's what prevents me from this 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.389
 perform that procedure but already what 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.029
 they saw first and right now I already 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.819
 it turned out I have this one just gave me one more 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:53.439
 of diamond two more gold plus those that 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.439
 I have myself on the floor 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:03.210
 remember that I start only with two 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:06.180
 of each material and good now 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.580
 we have more than two we have three of 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.379
 diamond four gold and good friends 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.379
 Well, that's all I hope you have served them 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:16.620
 this this tutorial do not despair this 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:20.479
 if it works try it, I say goodbye 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:24.830
