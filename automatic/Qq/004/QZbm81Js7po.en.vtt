really going to be like high high-end
stuff<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
stuff like but see like some of the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.560 
stuff like but see like some of the
stuff<00:00:34.469> that's<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:35.640> high-end<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
stuff that's more high-end is at the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.990 
stuff that's more high-end is at the
like<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> stuff<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.460> don't<00:00:38.730> want

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
like the stuff that I really don't want

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
like the stuff that I really don't want
because<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.040> number<00:00:41.370> one

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
because it's not like the number one

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.610 
because it's not like the number one
isn't<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.540> will<00:00:42.989> number<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.379> probably

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
isn't like the will number one probably

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.639 
isn't like the will number one probably
is<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> most<00:00:43.890> expensive<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:45.559> put<00:00:46.559> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
is the most expensive but like put it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.560 
is the most expensive but like put it
this<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.579> stuff<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.210> want
