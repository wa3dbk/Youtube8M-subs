00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.900
...She looks like she's about to say something.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.000
But from the way she is staying silent...

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.470
Her words are at her mouth, but she seems to be... lacking something?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.600
...Kyousuke-shi...

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.300
Saori, please.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.070
I want to hear what you have to say.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.490
But, but...

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.620
I don't know what I should do anymore...!

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.900
I understand how Saori feels. I understand, but...!

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.100
But if she keeps rejecting me, then nothing will be done...

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.500
Why is it that she doesn't get this point...

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.750
...Are you planning to run away?

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.670
On the pretence of protecting the things important to you, to suppress your feelings...

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.090
In the end, aren't you just running away?

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.370
Following along with your parents, being persuaded by your fiance; all of it became too painful, and that's why you're running away!

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.400
Have a proper chat with your parents! Tell your fiance frankly what you really feel!

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.980
...if I... said that...!

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.700
Sa, Saori...?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.780
Uuu, *sniff*...

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.120
Th-That can't be... hey...

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.100
It's the first time I'm seeing Saori cry...

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.050
Saori... umm, I'm sorry...

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.480
I... went too far... right?

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.920
No... I'm the one who's crying all of a sudden...

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.820
But... this is me...

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:57.080
I'm really just a weak, tiny, cowardly girl...

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.070
It's already too... Nothing can be done...

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.580
Saori said that in a quivering voice, and began weeping.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.650
Facing Saori like that, I couldn't find suitable words to say, and could only wait for Saori's tears to subside...

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.970
A few days passed...

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.070
Today's the first day of Comiket.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.180
Kuroneko was participating as a circle, and Kirino and I came to her stall to play...

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.150
Rather, we came to look around, without plans to buy anything.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.400
And here, there was... no presence of Saori.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.110
Saori acceded to her fiance's request, and stopped being an otaku.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.080
"Otaku Girls Unite!" community was to be closed...

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.680
...but instead, Kirino and Kuroneko took over as moderators.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:11.350
Of course, as the fiance was keeping an eye of Kirino, Kuroneko and I, we stopped visibly contacting Saori.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.050
...just visibly though.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.680
That's right! The black one didn't manage to sell out again. Haven't she learnt her lesson yet?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.400
Perhaps people are prejudiced against it because the contents are too advanced for them to understand?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.250
Well, the amount I wish for you to understand is less than a pea's worth...

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.750
Huh? I wouldn't want to understand such a shitty story.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.330
Fu, fufu... how dare you use such a tone towards me?

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:58.360
I'll bathe your body in the flames of hell, and burn your soul to a crisp...

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.500
Hey, Saori, can you hear me? The black one is saying rubbish again and is really irritating...

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.810
...Lend me the phone. I also have something to tell her...

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.510
Why don't you use your special telepathy to tell her?

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:25.030
Don't use such casual terms like "telepathy." The powers of psychic mental induction are only given to chosen ones.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.740
Just like that...

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.190
Even till now, we secretly communicate in this manner, and share our recent activities with each other.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.280
Although we are physically apart, we can still connect our hearts like that.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.210
That's what buddies are like, right?

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.840
...but really, I still can't accept it...

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.730
[END]
