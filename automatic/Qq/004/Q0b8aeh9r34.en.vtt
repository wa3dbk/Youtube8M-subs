 explain to all of our viewers 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.369
 they only speak English that is happening 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.369
 because they are very confused 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.960
 thank you let me explain to all 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.700
 our friends from wing minds in the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.710
 care that they only speak English that is 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.050
 happening but now we have to start with 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.430
 this video and her boyfriend we write talk 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.280
 of the taxi a taxi is a figure that has 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.800
 the power skill by feature that gives 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.020
 the opportunity to transport others 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.500
 figures all over the map the power 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.770
 special symbols blink flying 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.710
 and transport are all examples of 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.380
 powers that have figures that make them 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.470
 taxis there are many ways how to use the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.440
 taxi but the most basic is what 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.370
 we tell you here in the us of 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.310
 be or the placement you have to use the 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.920
 example of a figure with charge that is 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.560
 very far from your goal to be able to use 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.020
 load but it can be placed in a way 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.750
 that can use the charging power the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.149
 figure has to take its action from 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.940
 movement wait to withdraw their 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.970
 action markers and in the third 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.240
 turn to be able to use the charging power 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.600
 that time your adversary would perform the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.330
 tragedies and he would attack the character with 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.270
 a taxi you could transport the figure with 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.930
 charge and give him the opportunity to attack 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.060
 in just two shifts this strategy 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.190
 It can also be used with figures that 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.560
 they are supports with a taxi you can 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.130
 transport a figure that has ring 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.280
 to be within reach of your goal and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.430
 You can make your figure available 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.100
 support to attack or retreat and that 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.800
 brings to other tragedy that you can use the 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.470
 taxi can use it as a retreat a 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.750
 taxi put in a correct place can 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.480
 get a figure of once very 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.640
 difficult or take it to a doctor a 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.300
 figure can transport to another figure 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.090
 that is in contact with the enemy without 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.420
 unlock carefully where it ends 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.420
 the action of your taxi 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.790
 to the side of the enemy if they are going to have to 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.709
 unlock and finally for the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.069
 players who like to bring three 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.900
 figures for a team of 300 points a 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.290
 taxi can be used to transport 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.840
 all your team and attack your enemy not 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.959
 you have to worry about that rule of 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.600
 one action for every 100 points of a 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.310
 team and now since they know all this is 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.489
 time to search for all your 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.920
 circles and find a perfect taxi 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.519
 that can transport all your 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.400
 figures and win your next spin game 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.310
 Claire good spin figures clicks are 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.830
 those who have the team symbol of 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.650
 green lantern because they let you transport 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.870
 eight figures at once and in the new set 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.090
 the guardian about that Ã¡lex and have the 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.640
 figure of the show that is a very figure 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.590
 good to transport I hope that all

 I hope you understood me as I said
