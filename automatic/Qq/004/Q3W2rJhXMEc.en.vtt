song<00:02:18.730> Hell<00:02:19.000> where<00:02:19.240> he<00:02:19.270> says<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:20.230> only

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
song Hell where he says the only

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.200 
song Hell where he says the only
permanent<00:02:20.770> thing<00:02:21.190> about<00:02:21.400> true<00:02:21.670> love<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
permanent thing about true love is the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.510 
permanent thing about true love is the
pain<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.690> feel<00:02:22.900> when<00:02:23.170> it's<00:02:23.320> gone<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
pain you feel when it's gone and the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.970 
pain you feel when it's gone and the
mantra<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.330> greater<00:02:25.660> vultures<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:26.500> you're

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
mantra on greater vultures if you're

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.100 
mantra on greater vultures if you're
willing<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.400> eat<00:02:27.700> what<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.180> vultures<00:02:28.660> are<00:02:28.870> not

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
willing to eat what the vultures are not

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.910 
willing to eat what the vultures are not
honestly<00:02:30.070> Matt's<00:02:30.459> words<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.540> feel<00:02:32.110> are<00:02:32.440> the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
honestly Matt's words I feel are the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.740 
honestly Matt's words I feel are the
best<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.580> most<00:02:33.730> consistent<00:02:34.420> thing<00:02:34.480> this

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
best and most consistent thing this

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750 
best and most consistent thing this
album<00:02:35.170> has<00:02:35.380> going<00:02:36.010> for<00:02:36.459> it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
album has going for it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.260 
album has going for it
because<00:02:37.360> even<00:02:37.900> when<00:02:38.020> a<00:02:38.050> song<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.670> short<00:02:39.670> winded

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
because even when a song is short winded

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.760 
because even when a song is short winded
or<00:02:40.720> kind<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.380> half-baked<00:02:42.130> musically<00:02:43.060> or

we're<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.720> little<00:02:59.410> longer<00:02:59.680> kind<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.400> went<00:03:00.640> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
we're a little longer kind of went the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.970 
we're a little longer kind of went the
distance<00:03:01.000> really<00:03:01.690> fleshed<00:03:02.080> themselves<00:03:02.770> out

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
distance really fleshed themselves out

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.760 
distance really fleshed themselves out
but<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.520> guess<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.270> silver<00:03:05.170> lining<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.739> that

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
but I guess the silver lining to that

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.220 
but I guess the silver lining to that
cloud<00:03:06.160> is<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.459> not<00:03:07.090> much<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.570> this<00:03:07.690> album<00:03:07.930> is

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230
