I'm staying in here because I have

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.870 
I'm staying in here because I have
someone<00:01:13.350> who<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.650> absorb<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> toxic<00:01:14.610> spikes

bit of damage in there and instead of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.200 
bit of damage in there and instead of

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
switching for I really didn't want to

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.350 
switching for I really didn't want to
lose<00:03:32.820> oxy<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:34.770> yeah<00:03:35.610> I'm<00:03:35.760> not<00:03:35.940> I'm<00:03:36.030> not<00:03:36.060> gonna

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
lose oxy so yeah I'm not I'm not gonna

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
lose oxy so yeah I'm not I'm not gonna
go<00:03:36.510> for<00:03:36.660> that

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
go for that

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.590 
go for that
so<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.100> blaze<00:03:38.580> kick<00:03:38.850> he<00:03:39.060> switches<00:03:39.330> into

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
so I blaze kick he switches into

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.780 
so I blaze kick he switches into
Gyarados<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.740> it<00:03:40.800> takes<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.130> nicely<00:03:41.310> gets<00:03:41.700> an

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
Gyarados and it takes it nicely gets an

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.820 
Gyarados and it takes it nicely gets an
intimidate<00:03:42.240> on<00:03:42.330> me<00:03:42.480> too

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
intimidate on me too

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.370 
intimidate on me too
and<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.700> decide<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.210> switch<00:03:45.540> out<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.900> oxy<00:03:46.290> at

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
and I decide to switch out to oxy at

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.460 
and I decide to switch out to oxy at
this<00:03:46.500> point<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:48.540> I'm<00:03:48.660> hoping<00:03:48.990> I<00:03:49.110> can<00:03:49.140> get<00:03:49.440> a

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
this point and I'm hoping I can get a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.070 
this point and I'm hoping I can get a
t-bolt<00:03:49.920> in<00:03:50.100> on<00:03:50.220> him<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.660> waterful<00:03:51.660> doesn't<00:03:51.960> do

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
t-bolt in on him and waterful doesn't do

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.750 
t-bolt in on him and waterful doesn't do
all<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.260> much<00:03:52.410> things<00:03:53.190> my<00:03:53.340> oxies<00:03:53.610> my

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
all that much things my oxies my

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.080 
all that much things my oxies my
physical<00:03:54.209> wall<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:56.010> he<00:03:56.670> water<00:03:56.850> falls

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
physical wall and so he water falls

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.330 
physical wall and so he water falls
again<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.810> thought<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.410> would<00:03:58.590> get<00:03:59.070> some

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
again and I thought I would get some

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.020 
again and I thought I would get some
sort<00:03:59.370> of<00:04:00.590> para<00:04:01.590> hacks<00:04:01.920> or<00:04:02.130> flinch<00:04:02.459> hacks<00:04:02.760> there

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
sort of para hacks or flinch hacks there

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.210 
sort of para hacks or flinch hacks there
but<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.750> was<00:04:04.080> lucky<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.380> got<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.650> tee<00:04:04.800> ball<00:04:04.950> and

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
but I was lucky I got the tee ball and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.370 
but I was lucky I got the tee ball and
it<00:04:05.820> really<00:04:06.060> didn't<00:04:06.330> do<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.600> much<00:04:06.900> even

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
it really didn't do that much even

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.050 
it really didn't do that much even
though<00:04:07.650> Garros<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.160> four<00:04:08.400> times<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.790> week<00:04:08.880> to

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
though Garros is four times a week to

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.360 
though Garros is four times a week to
Thunderbolt<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.690> didn't<00:04:09.959> do<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.110> lot<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:11.250> he

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
Thunderbolt it didn't do a lot and so he

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.680 
Thunderbolt it didn't do a lot and so he
brings<00:04:11.520> an<00:04:11.670> electrode<00:04:12.090> expecting<00:04:12.600> another

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
brings an electrode expecting another

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.039 
brings an electrode expecting another
t-bolt<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.150> was<00:04:15.450> actually<00:04:15.600> going<00:04:15.870> for<00:04:15.990> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
t-bolt but I was actually going for the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.599 
t-bolt but I was actually going for the
stealth<00:04:16.290> rock<00:04:16.560> there<00:04:16.799> just<00:04:17.040> so<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.370> when

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
stealth rock there just so that when

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.190 
stealth rock there just so that when
Guerra<00:04:17.820> comes<00:04:18.120> back<00:04:18.330> in<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.660> can<00:04:18.780> take<00:04:18.989> some

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
Guerra comes back in it can take some

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.880 
Guerra comes back in it can take some
more<00:04:19.620> damage<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:21.870> turn<00:04:22.350> out<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.560> get

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
more damage and so I you turn out to get

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.830 
more damage and so I you turn out to get
rid<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.070> his<00:04:23.250> sub

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
rid of his sub

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.659 
rid of his sub
but<00:04:25.440> next<00:04:25.710> time<00:04:25.860> works<00:04:26.100> it<00:04:26.220> comes<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.550> it's

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
but next time works it comes in it's

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.790 
but next time works it comes in it's
basically<00:04:26.790> gonna<00:04:27.210> be<00:04:27.390> useless<00:04:27.690> because<00:04:28.470> it's

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
basically gonna be useless because it's

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.670 
basically gonna be useless because it's
gonna<00:04:28.919> die<00:04:29.190> from<00:04:29.400> Stealth<00:04:29.700> Rock<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.650> I

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
gonna die from Stealth Rock and so I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.090 
gonna die from Stealth Rock and so I
bring<00:04:31.919> out<00:04:32.040> Hitmonlee

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
bring out Hitmonlee

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.320 
bring out Hitmonlee
and<00:04:34.190> he<00:04:34.910> has<00:04:35.150> electrode<00:04:35.780> out<00:04:35.930> he<00:04:36.110> withdraws<00:04:36.590> to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
and he has electrode out he withdraws to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.480 
and he has electrode out he withdraws to
Mantine<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:39.200> takes<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.830> Mack<00:04:40.040> punch<00:04:40.370> very

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
Mantine and it takes the Mack punch very

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.300 
Mantine and it takes the Mack punch very
nicely<00:04:41.530> if<00:04:42.530> he'd<00:04:42.710> stayed<00:04:42.890> in<00:04:43.100> there<00:04:43.280> I

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
nicely if he'd stayed in there I

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.950 
nicely if he'd stayed in there I
probably<00:04:43.940> would<00:04:44.150> have<00:04:44.210> killed<00:04:44.450> him<00:04:44.660> I<00:04:44.750> think

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
probably would have killed him I think

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.040 
probably would have killed him I think
because<00:04:45.890> I<00:04:45.920> boot<00:04:46.250> choice<00:04:46.520> bands<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.270> probably

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
because I boot choice bands so probably

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.270 
because I boot choice bands so probably
would<00:04:48.140> have<00:04:48.200> taken<00:04:48.320> him<00:04:48.560> out<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:48.860> I<00:04:48.890> switch<00:04:49.130> in

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
would have taken him out so I switch in

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.580 
would have taken him out so I switch in
oak<00:04:49.430> see<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:50.390> take<00:04:50.630> stealth<00:04:50.900> rock<00:04:51.110> damage<00:04:51.470> and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
oak see to take stealth rock damage and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.190 
oak see to take stealth rock damage and
get<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.800> safe<00:04:52.010> switch<00:04:52.340> in<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:53.570> he<00:04:53.750> brings<00:04:54.020> up

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
get the safe switch in and he brings up

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.290 
get the safe switch in and he brings up
an<00:04:54.290> aqua<00:04:54.680> ring<00:04:54.890> so<00:04:55.640> that<00:04:55.820> he<00:04:55.880> can<00:04:56.030> just<00:04:56.150> get

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
an aqua ring so that he can just get

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.330 
an aqua ring so that he can just get
some<00:04:56.450> extra<00:04:56.750> health<00:04:57.050> recovery<00:04:57.350> there<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.830> bring

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
some extra health recovery there I bring

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.250 
some extra health recovery there I bring
in<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.460> hit<00:04:58.580> only<00:04:58.700> here<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.210> I'm<00:04:59.930> looking<00:05:00.230> to

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
in a hit only here and I'm looking to

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.950 
in a hit only here and I'm looking to
stone<00:05:00.680> edge<00:05:00.890> him<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.280> I'm<00:05:02.210> thinking<00:05:02.390> a<00:05:02.750> stone

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
stone edge him and I'm thinking a stone

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.290 
stone edge him and I'm thinking a stone
as<00:05:03.110> you'll<00:05:03.230> take<00:05:03.410> him<00:05:03.590> out<00:05:03.680> if<00:05:03.830> it<00:05:03.980> hits<00:05:04.300> he

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
as you'll take him out if it hits he

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.450 
as you'll take him out if it hits he
brings<00:05:05.510> out<00:05:05.630> Lucario<00:05:06.230> four<00:05:06.710> times<00:05:06.980> resistant

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
brings out Lucario four times resistant

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.340 
brings out Lucario four times resistant
to<00:05:07.610> rock<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.090> that<00:05:08.150> just<00:05:08.390> really<00:05:08.630> sucks<00:05:08.990> and

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
to rock and that just really sucks and

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.890 
to rock and that just really sucks and
at<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.370> moment<00:05:10.490> I<00:05:10.670> don't<00:05:11.240> have<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.510> counter

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
at the moment I don't have a counter

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.110 
at the moment I don't have a counter
till<00:05:12.050> I<00:05:12.080> carry<00:05:12.410> at<00:05:12.620> all<00:05:12.800> as<00:05:13.430> soon<00:05:13.760> as<00:05:13.910> that

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
till I carry at all as soon as that

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.810
