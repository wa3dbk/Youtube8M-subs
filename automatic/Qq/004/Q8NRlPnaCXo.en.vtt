00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
map it's it's hard I mean you can block

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.249 
map it's it's hard I mean you can block
off<00:01:44.220> your<00:01:44.460> main<00:01:44.670> door<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> can't<00:01:45.600> get<00:01:45.780> the

interestingly<00:02:50.990> it<00:02:51.710> may<00:02:51.860> have<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.010> been<00:02:52.190> a

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
interestingly it may have just been a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.120 
interestingly it may have just been a
faint<00:02:53.380> Kwan<00:02:54.380> were<00:02:54.470> coming<00:02:54.710> out<00:02:54.770> with<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.920> ton<00:02:55.100> of

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
faint Kwan were coming out with a ton of

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.040 
faint Kwan were coming out with a ton of
drones<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.640> because<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.450> tiny<00:02:56.780> choke

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
drones and because of that tiny choke

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.450 
drones and because of that tiny choke
their<00:02:57.260> corner<00:02:57.680> was<00:02:57.800> easily<00:02:58.010> going<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.280> be<00:02:58.340> able

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
their corner was easily going to be able

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.970 
their corner was easily going to be able
to<00:02:58.550> hold<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.820> off<00:02:59.230> that<00:03:00.230> was<00:03:00.350> that<00:03:00.590> was<00:03:00.680> kind

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
to hold that off that was that was kind

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.980 
to hold that off that was that was kind
of<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.220> think<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:01.520> was<00:03:01.610> probably<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:02.750> kind

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
of I think that was probably just kind

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.020 
of I think that was probably just kind
of<00:03:03.020> a<00:03:03.140> temp<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.100> distract<00:03:04.520> there<00:03:04.760> he<00:03:04.910> was

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
of a temp to distract there he was

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.670 
of a temp to distract there he was
hoping<00:03:05.300> for<00:03:05.330> something<00:03:05.750> there<00:03:05.990> because<00:03:06.230> he<00:03:06.320> is

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
hoping for something there because he is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.260 
hoping for something there because he is
going<00:03:06.890> for<00:03:07.040> his<00:03:07.190> tech<00:03:07.490> he<00:03:07.670> wasn't<00:03:07.970> going<00:03:08.090> for

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
going for his tech he wasn't going for

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.910 
going for his tech he wasn't going for

first and then switches to two units and
cointreau<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.920> probably<00:03:39.920> going<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.100> go<00:03:40.370> in

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
cointreau is probably going to go in

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.910 
cointreau is probably going to go in
there<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:40.820> scout<00:03:41.120> lights<00:03:42.110> base<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> little<00:03:42.770> bit

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.480 
to okay now he has those links
underneath<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:22.050> so<00:05:22.200> so<00:05:22.620> we<00:05:23.160> actually<00:05:23.310> I<00:05:23.460> think

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
underneath it so so we actually I think

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.610 
underneath it so so we actually I think
we<00:05:23.700> saw<00:05:23.850> Savior<00:05:24.240> pull<00:05:24.450> this<00:05:24.570> this<00:05:24.900> trick<00:05:25.470> on

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
we saw Savior pull this this trick on

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.270 
we saw Savior pull this this trick on
hitchhiker<00:05:26.600> using<00:05:27.600> using<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.590> units<00:05:28.920> to<00:05:29.100> put

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
hitchhiker using using the units to put

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.400 
hitchhiker using using the units to put
underneath<00:05:29.550> that<00:05:29.820> factory<00:05:30.300> so<00:05:30.780> it<00:05:30.900> can't<00:05:31.140> land

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
underneath that factory so it can't land

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.010 
underneath that factory so it can't land
so<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:33.150> float<00:05:33.390> would<00:05:33.570> not<00:05:33.690> work<00:05:33.870> at

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
so that the the float would not work at

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.740 
so that the the float would not work at
all<00:05:34.110> so<00:05:34.860> that's<00:05:34.980> basically<00:05:35.130> what<00:05:35.550> what<00:05:35.910> a<00:05:35.940> quan

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
all so that's basically what what a quan

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.570 
all so that's basically what what a quan
was<00:05:36.960> doing<00:05:37.200> there<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.980> factory<00:05:38.340> does

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
was doing there and the factory does

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.300 
was doing there and the factory does
land<00:05:39.110> for<00:05:40.110> some<00:05:40.260> reason<00:05:40.530> quan<00:05:40.740> or<00:05:40.890> let<00:05:41.010> it<00:05:41.040> land

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
land for some reason quan or let it land

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.770 
land for some reason quan or let it land
maybe<00:05:41.520> he<00:05:41.640> was<00:05:41.760> distracted<00:05:42.090> as<00:05:42.390> front<00:05:42.630> there

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
maybe he was distracted as front there

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.780 
maybe he was distracted as front there
corner<00:05:43.410> with<00:05:43.560> his<00:05:43.650> speedlings<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:44.370> that's

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
corner with his speedlings and that's

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.190 
corner with his speedlings and that's
the<00:05:44.940> kind<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.150> micro<00:05:45.450> that<00:05:45.600> we<00:05:45.690> expect<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.080> see

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
the kind of micro that we expect to see

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.630 
the kind of micro that we expect to see
at<00:05:46.320> a<00:05:46.350> corner<00:05:46.620> over<00:05:46.770> using<00:05:46.980> those<00:05:47.190> speedlings

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
at a corner over using those speedlings

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.360 
at a corner over using those speedlings
too<00:05:47.880> and<00:05:48.360> he's<00:05:49.050> moving<00:05:49.230> is<00:05:49.500> he's<00:05:49.980> basically

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
too and he's moving is he's basically

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.980 
too and he's moving is he's basically
moving<00:05:50.640> in<00:05:50.820> Ling's<00:05:51.000> around<00:05:51.240> if<00:05:51.540> the<00:05:51.660> vulture

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
moving in Ling's around if the vulture

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.210 
moving in Ling's around if the vulture
comes<00:05:52.230> out<00:05:52.380> he's<00:05:52.530> gonna<00:05:52.650> surround<00:05:53.010> it<00:05:53.190> and

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
comes out he's gonna surround it and

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.860 
comes out he's gonna surround it and
just<00:05:53.400> kind<00:05:53.640> of<00:05:53.670> brave<00:05:54.120> it<00:05:54.270> before<00:05:54.540> i<00:05:54.570> can<00:05:54.720> get

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
just kind of brave it before i can get

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.120 
just kind of brave it before i can get
to<00:05:54.990> get<00:05:55.230> away<00:05:55.260> that's<00:05:55.590> going<00:05:55.740> to<00:05:55.800> be<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:55.950> key

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
to get away that's going to be the key

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.160 
to get away that's going to be the key
is<00:05:56.250> oh<00:05:56.370> and<00:05:56.640> i<00:05:56.700> can't<00:05:57.000> get<00:05:57.180> away<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.780> came<00:05:58.050> out

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
is oh and i can't get away it came out

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.660 
is oh and i can't get away it came out
on<00:05:58.290> the<00:05:58.380> side<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.590> it<00:05:58.890> is<00:05:59.130> able<00:05:59.340> to<00:05:59.460> get<00:05:59.610> away

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
on the side and it is able to get away

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.070 
on the side and it is able to get away
but<00:05:59.790> those<00:06:00.090> speedlings<00:06:00.570> are<00:06:00.690> going<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:00.900> be

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
but those speedlings are going to be

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.570 
but those speedlings are going to be
able<00:06:01.140> to<00:06:01.290> catch<00:06:01.440> up<00:06:01.590> with<00:06:01.620> it<00:06:01.860> though<00:06:02.010> if<00:06:02.220> they

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
able to catch up with it though if they

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.340 
able to catch up with it though if they
were<00:06:02.640> not<00:06:02.820> speed<00:06:03.090> upgraded<00:06:03.540> then<00:06:03.690> that<00:06:04.230> would

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
were not speed upgraded then that would

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.810 
were not speed upgraded then that would
have<00:06:04.440> been<00:06:04.500> very<00:06:04.680> bad<00:06:04.920> for<00:06:05.160> quan<00:06:05.340> row<00:06:05.520> he<00:06:05.670> would

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
have been very bad for quan row he would

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.300 
have been very bad for quan row he would
have<00:06:05.910> lost<00:06:06.480> some<00:06:06.750> drones<00:06:06.990> to<00:06:07.170> that<00:06:07.320> there<00:06:07.560> but

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
have lost some drones to that there but

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.710 
have lost some drones to that there but
he<00:06:08.490> does<00:06:08.670> have<00:06:08.850> those<00:06:09.000> speed<00:06:09.210> upgrade<00:06:09.540> lanes

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
he does have those speed upgrade lanes

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.800 
he does have those speed upgrade lanes
he<00:06:09.900> is<00:06:10.020> able<00:06:10.170> to<00:06:10.320> take<00:06:10.890> care<00:06:11.010> of<00:06:11.100> that<00:06:11.220> um<00:06:12.000> like

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
he is able to take care of that um like

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.450 
he is able to take care of that um like
I<00:06:12.840> said<00:06:12.930> he<00:06:13.140> does<00:06:13.560> have<00:06:13.710> a<00:06:13.740> high<00:06:13.920> dlist<00:06:14.250> then

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
I said he does have a high dlist then

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.570 
I said he does have a high dlist then
which<00:06:15.270> is<00:06:15.420> interesting<00:06:15.930> I<00:06:16.680> don't<00:06:17.310> know<00:06:17.370> if<00:06:17.460> he

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
which is interesting I don't know if he

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.000 
which is interesting I don't know if he
saw<00:06:17.820> that<00:06:17.970> i<00:06:18.030> went<00:06:18.240> there<00:06:18.390> are<00:06:18.660> high<00:06:18.810> rates<00:06:19.740> now

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
saw that i went there are high rates now

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.730 
saw that i went there are high rates now
in<00:06:20.280> cuadros<00:06:21.090> base<00:06:21.300> interestingly<00:06:22.170> he's<00:06:22.560> going

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
in cuadros base interestingly he's going

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.490 
in cuadros base interestingly he's going
for<00:06:22.890> drones<00:06:23.130> and<00:06:23.340> stove<00:06:23.520> overlords<00:06:24.030> um<00:06:24.500> wait

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
for drones and stove overlords um wait

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.030 
for drones and stove overlords um wait
did<00:06:26.340> I<00:06:27.090> could<00:06:27.420> have<00:06:27.510> sworn<00:06:27.690> I<00:06:27.750> saw<00:06:27.930> a<00:06:27.960> dead<00:06:28.230> okay

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
did I could have sworn I saw a dead okay

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.260 
did I could have sworn I saw a dead okay
maybe<00:06:29.220> he<00:06:29.370> cancelled<00:06:29.790> it<00:06:29.880> in<00:06:30.000> and<00:06:30.150> went

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
maybe he cancelled it in and went

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.440 
maybe he cancelled it in and went
straight<00:06:30.480> for<00:06:30.720> a<00:06:30.810> spire<00:06:31.430> so<00:06:32.430> very<00:06:33.060> confusing

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
straight for a spire so very confusing

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.300 
straight for a spire so very confusing
to<00:06:33.570> me<00:06:33.630> quarter<00:06:34.080> in<00:06:34.290> the<00:06:34.380> meantime<00:06:34.530> all<00:06:34.950> up<00:06:35.160> in

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
to me quarter in the meantime all up in

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.159 
to me quarter in the meantime all up in
light<00:06:35.610> space<00:06:35.850> and<00:06:36.120> light<00:06:36.479> has<00:06:36.690> just<00:06:36.930> sent<00:06:37.050> all

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
light space and light has just sent all

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.870 
light space and light has just sent all
of<00:06:37.200> the<00:06:37.350> units<00:06:37.470> he<00:06:37.710> spent<00:06:38.040> all<00:06:38.160> his<00:06:38.220> money<00:06:38.400> on

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
of the units he spent all his money on

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.930 
of the units he spent all his money on
tech<00:06:39.180> so<00:06:39.360> he<00:06:39.510> has<00:06:39.600> no<00:06:39.780> units<00:06:40.050> now<00:06:40.350> and<00:06:40.880> this<00:06:41.880> is

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
tech so he has no units now and this is

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.350 
tech so he has no units now and this is
basically<00:06:42.480> a<00:06:42.870> battle<00:06:43.380> to<00:06:43.500> see<00:06:43.650> who<00:06:43.800> can<00:06:43.980> the
