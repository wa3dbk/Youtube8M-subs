00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
ten down here right down here I use the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.250 
ten down here right down here I use the
wrench<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.730> do<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.270> uh<00:00:37.370> uh<00:00:38.930> telemeter

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.340 

I<00:00:43.489> use<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> ratchet<00:00:45.899> inside

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
I use this one with the ratchet inside

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.639 
I use this one with the ratchet inside
to<00:00:47.219> change<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.700> Hey<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.930> took<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.469> out

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to change it Hey and I took that one out

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it I have a 22 millimeter socket that I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.620 
it I have a 22 millimeter socket that I
used<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.570> break<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.930> loose

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.590 

just<00:01:20.630> put<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:24.700> 22<00:01:25.700> millimeter<00:01:26.119> socket<00:01:26.509> and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
just put this 22 millimeter socket and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.550 
just put this 22 millimeter socket and
it<00:01:26.750> just<00:01:27.189> went<00:01:28.189> right<00:01:28.399> over<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.729> see<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:30.439> I

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
just put my wrench here and I just

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.160 
just put my wrench here and I just
pulled<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:36.890> up<00:01:36.979> into<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.430> rocket<00:01:37.729> loose<00:01:38.170> so

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
pulled it up into the rocket loose so

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:48.060 
pulled it up into the rocket loose so
now<00:01:39.320> it's<00:01:39.530> loose<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:41.680> then<00:01:42.680> just<00:01:43.840> unscrew<00:01:44.840> it

this<00:02:18.550> one<00:02:18.930> pressure<00:02:19.930> switch<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.530> should

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
this one pressure switch and we should

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.210 
this one pressure switch and we should
be<00:02:20.740> good<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.890> go

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
be good to go
