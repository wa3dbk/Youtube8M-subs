00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
really wanted to dive into the coverage

of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> game<00:00:43.710> leading<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.879> its<00:00:45.090> early<00:00:45.690> 2014

of the game leading up to its early 2014

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.310 
of the game leading up to its early 2014
release<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> plan<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.960> don't

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
release but the plan is that I don't

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.369 
release but the plan is that I don't
want<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.829> dilute<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.480> brand<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379

coverage<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> main<00:00:53.399> channel<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
coverage here on the main channel so the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.560 
coverage here on the main channel so the
idea<00:00:55.260> behind<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.699> much<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.449> I'm

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
I subscribed for it and subscribe for a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
I subscribed for it and subscribe for a
ton<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> Elder<00:01:41.579> Scrolls<00:01:41.880> videos<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.450> subscribed

and so for that reason because I don't

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.429 
and so for that reason because I don't
want<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.970> confuse<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.990> channel<00:01:49.350> is

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
want to confuse what this channel is

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.929 
want to confuse what this channel is
about<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.159> know<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.430> channel<00:01:50.700> has<00:01:50.759> gone

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
about you know this channel has gone

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.700 
about you know this channel has gone
through<00:01:51.149> many<00:01:51.329> changes<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> past<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.649> was

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
through many changes in the past it was

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.190 
through many changes in the past it was
once<00:01:52.950> focused<00:01:53.430> entirely<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.149> starcraft<00:01:54.600> 2<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
once focused entirely on starcraft 2 and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.580 
once focused entirely on starcraft 2 and
my<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:56.399> artifact<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.390> name<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:58.049> still

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
my my artifact of a name is still

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
my my artifact of a name is still
referencing<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.210> switched<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
referencing that and then we switched to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.300 
referencing that and then we switched to
diablo<00:02:01.049> 3<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.649> was<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> game<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.040> i<00:02:02.219> was

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
diablo 3 is that was a game that i was

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.620 
diablo 3 is that was a game that i was
looking<00:02:02.549> forward<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.390> thought

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
looking forward to and then I thought

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.870 
looking forward to and then I thought
towards<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> future<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.100> i<00:02:05.189> decided<00:02:05.579> i

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
towards the future and i decided i

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.479 
towards the future and i decided i
really<00:02:06.329> want<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.750> continue<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> part<00:02:08.429> of

this<00:02:12.900> one

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
this one

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.750 
this one
channel<00:02:13.540> isn't<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:14.079> to<00:02:14.200> give<00:02:14.379> me<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:15.040> guess

channel isn't going to give me I guess

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.750 
channel isn't going to give me I guess
the<00:02:15.969> type<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.840> type<00:02:17.049> of<00:02:17.079> back<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:18.519> type<00:02:18.730> of

the type of the type of back the type of

the type of the type of back the type of
not<00:02:19.659> a<00:02:19.689> resume<00:02:20.349> but<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.950> know<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.310> experience

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
not a resume but you know the experience

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.880 
not a resume but you know the experience
that<00:02:21.969> I<00:02:22.150> need<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.719> so<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.930> be<00:02:23.469> a<00:02:23.500> part<00:02:23.769> of<00:02:23.799> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
that I need and so to be a part of the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.140 
that I need and so to be a part of the
industry<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> do<00:02:24.549> what<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.760> want<00:02:24.969> to<00:02:25.060> do

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
industry and to do what I want to do

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.619 
industry and to do what I want to do
continuing<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.019> cover<00:02:26.260> games<00:02:26.620> as<00:02:27.609> I<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.599> older

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
continuing to cover games as I get older

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.619 
continuing to cover games as I get older
then<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.829> decided<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.700> my<00:02:31.000> focus<00:02:31.420> who<00:02:31.540> is

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
then I decided that my focus who is

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.899 
then I decided that my focus who is
going<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.900> be<00:02:31.959> variety<00:02:32.500> news<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.400> commentary

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
going to be variety news and commentary

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.030 
going to be variety news and commentary
so<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.359> is<00:02:34.510> what<00:02:34.689> this<00:02:34.810> main<00:02:35.049> channel<00:02:35.379> is<00:02:35.530> but

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
so that is what this main channel is but

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.979 
so that is what this main channel is but
because<00:02:36.340> I'm<00:02:36.489> still<00:02:36.730> excited<00:02:37.090> about<00:02:37.480> games

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
because I'm still excited about games

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.770 
because I'm still excited about games
that<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.319> really<00:02:38.590> want<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.859> focus<00:02:39.010> on<00:02:39.450> I'm<00:02:40.450> gonna

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
that I really want to focus on I'm gonna

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.780 
that I really want to focus on I'm gonna
do<00:02:41.079> an<00:02:41.200> experiment<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.889> that<00:02:42.010> experiment<00:02:42.609> is

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
do an experiment and that experiment is

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.059 
do an experiment and that experiment is
starting<00:02:43.239> an<00:02:43.329> entirely<00:02:43.689> new<00:02:43.900> channel<00:02:44.379> just

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
starting an entirely new channel just

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.149 
starting an entirely new channel just
for<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.340> sake<00:02:45.519> of<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.790> game<00:02:46.000> now<00:02:46.239> there<00:02:46.450> are

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
for the sake of the game now there are

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.050 
for the sake of the game now there are
negatives<00:02:48.159> to<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.669> that<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.879> that<00:02:49.030> i

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
negatives to that and that is that i

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.210 
negatives to that and that is that i
don't<00:02:49.120> have<00:02:49.359> my<00:02:49.629> base<00:02:49.870> subscriber<00:02:50.500> base<00:02:50.859> but

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
don't have my base subscriber base but

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.830 
don't have my base subscriber base but
there's<00:02:51.489> also<00:02:51.609> positives<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.629> people

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
there's also positives and that people

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.199 
there's also positives and that people
understand<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.950> channel<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.340> about<00:02:54.400> so

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
understand what the channel is about so

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.360 
understand what the channel is about so
an<00:02:55.689> example<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.349> i<00:02:56.500> wouldn't<00:02:57.220> want

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
an example is that i wouldn't want

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.520 
an example is that i wouldn't want
people<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.879> subscribe<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.629> this<00:02:58.780> main<00:02:59.079> channel

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
people to subscribe to this main channel

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.379 
people to subscribe to this main channel
because<00:03:00.250> i<00:03:00.280> started<00:03:00.549> doing<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.939> lot<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.090> Elder

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
because i started doing a lot of Elder

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.879 
because i started doing a lot of Elder
Scrolls<00:03:01.659> coverage<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.290> then<00:03:02.650> if<00:03:02.769> I

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
Scrolls coverage and then if I

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.649 
Scrolls coverage and then if I
eventually<00:03:03.189> stopped<00:03:03.669> doing<00:03:04.060> Elder<00:03:04.329> Scrolls

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
eventually stopped doing Elder Scrolls

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.289 
eventually stopped doing Elder Scrolls
coverage<00:03:05.109> they<00:03:05.349> just<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:06.159> know<00:03:06.189> they<00:03:06.819> leave

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
coverage they just you know they leave

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.580 
coverage they just you know they leave
and<00:03:07.659> then<00:03:07.719> the<00:03:07.870> channels<00:03:08.169> got<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.349> ton<00:03:08.560> of

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
and then the channels got a ton of

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
I'm also interested in then maybe I'll

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.719 
I'm also interested in then maybe I'll
just<00:03:29.019> start<00:03:29.379> doing<00:03:29.560> separate<00:03:30.159> channel<00:03:30.489> for

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
just start doing separate channel for

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.699 
just start doing separate channel for
that<00:03:30.849> game<00:03:31.090> as<00:03:31.359> I'm<00:03:31.629> interested<00:03:32.049> in<00:03:32.169> them<00:03:32.500> and

if<00:03:33.099> I<00:03:33.220> eventually<00:03:33.790> lose<00:03:34.000> interest<00:03:34.329> i<00:03:34.540> just

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
if I eventually lose interest i just

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.270 
if I eventually lose interest i just
stop<00:03:34.930> making<00:03:35.260> videos<00:03:35.290> for<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.859> channel<00:03:36.069> so

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
stop making videos for that channel so

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.399 
stop making videos for that channel so
that's<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.579> idea<00:03:36.819> this<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.229> completely<00:03:38.229> an

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
that's the idea this is completely an

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:39.659 
that's the idea this is completely an
experiment<00:03:39.010> i'll<00:03:39.159> be<00:03:39.310> running<00:03:39.430> this

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
experiment i'll be running this

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.659 
experiment i'll be running this
experiment<00:03:40.060> for<00:03:40.419> a<00:03:40.449> probably<00:03:40.900> about<00:03:41.109> a<00:03:41.169> year

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
experiment for a probably about a year

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.129 
experiment for a probably about a year
at<00:03:42.669> least<00:03:42.729> until<00:03:43.299> you<00:03:43.720> know<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:43.989> game

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
at least until you know the game

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.319 
at least until you know the game
launches<00:03:44.409> and<00:03:44.889> then<00:03:44.979> we<00:03:45.129> see<00:03:45.340> my<00:03:45.790> filling<00:03:46.209> on

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
launches and then we see my filling on

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.819 
launches and then we see my filling on
the<00:03:46.419> game<00:03:46.599> from<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.959> point<00:03:47.169> forward<00:03:47.319> but

this new channel it is just an

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.580 
this new channel it is just an
experiment<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.759> may<00:03:58.209> fail<00:03:58.479> terribly<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.229> may

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
experiment it may fail terribly it may

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.710 
experiment it may fail terribly it may
not<00:03:59.709> be<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.889> greatest<00:04:00.159> idea<00:04:00.609> but<00:04:00.849> hey<00:04:01.030> you

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
not be the greatest idea but hey you

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.569 
not be the greatest idea but hey you
only<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:02.470> know<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.680> only<00:04:02.829> learn<00:04:03.069> if<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.370> try
