music<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:23.330> whip<00:05:23.479> is<00:05:23.660> much<00:05:23.900> stronger<00:05:24.290> now

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.710 

that's<00:05:28.370> basically<00:05:28.970> what<00:05:29.180> I<00:05:29.210> came<00:05:29.449> down<00:05:29.690> here

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
that's basically what I came down here

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:38.350

for how are we doing on Spears 17 not

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.640 
for how are we doing on Spears 17 not
nearly<00:05:38.720> enough<00:05:40.539> so<00:05:41.539> I<00:05:41.570> guess<00:05:41.990> we'll<00:05:42.199> go<00:05:42.350> back

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650

nearly enough so I guess we'll go back
to<00:05:42.949> the<00:05:43.449> twin<00:05:44.449> labyrinth<00:05:44.990> yeah<00:05:45.680> I<00:05:45.800> know
