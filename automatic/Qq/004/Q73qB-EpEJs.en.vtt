00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.279 
cameras can have the rest of it that we
wanted<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.759> challenge<00:02:06.000> ourselves<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.780> making

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
wanted to challenge ourselves is making

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.370 
wanted to challenge ourselves is making
a<00:02:07.440> very<00:02:07.740> dense<00:02:08.100> City<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.690> opinion<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:10.319> do

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
a very dense City now in my opinion I do

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.260 
a very dense City now in my opinion I do
think<00:02:10.830> cheese<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.190> Chicago<00:02:11.670> was<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.880> really

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
think cheese in Chicago was a really

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.059 
think cheese in Chicago was a really
good<00:02:12.510> move<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.900> good<00:02:13.110> idea<00:02:13.470> because<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:14.040> I

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
good move and good idea because like I

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.490 
good move and good idea because like I
mentioned<00:02:14.370> earlier<00:02:14.670> we're<00:02:15.480> barely<00:02:15.810> any<00:02:16.200> other

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
mentioned earlier we're barely any other

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.680 
mentioned earlier we're barely any other
games<00:02:16.830> with<00:02:17.040> Chicago<00:02:17.580> as<00:02:17.610> their<00:02:18.060> main<00:02:18.240> setting

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
games with Chicago as their main setting

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.510 
games with Chicago as their main setting
or<00:02:18.840> at<00:02:19.050> least<00:02:19.230> any<00:02:19.440> other<00:02:19.680> open<00:02:20.100> world<00:02:20.250> games

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
or at least any other open world games

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.850 
or at least any other open world games
so<00:02:21.120> with<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.480> being<00:02:21.660> said<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.260> definitely

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
so with that being said this definitely

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.220 
so with that being said this definitely
does<00:02:23.220> make<00:02:23.430> watchdogs<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.180> really<00:02:24.600> unique<00:02:24.810> game

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
does make watchdogs a really unique game

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.350 
does make watchdogs a really unique game
and<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:25.950> think<00:02:26.310> unique<00:02:26.760> games<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.240> always

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
and I do think unique games are always

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.050 
and I do think unique games are always
for<00:02:27.660> really<00:02:27.959> good<00:02:28.170> games<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:29.060> Jonathan

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
for really good games and Jonathan

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.150 
for really good games and Jonathan
himself<00:02:30.510> did<00:02:30.720> explain<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.319> Chicago<00:02:31.890> was<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
himself did explain that Chicago was a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.860 
himself did explain that Chicago was a
selling<00:02:32.640> point<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.240> development<00:02:33.690> team

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
selling point to the development team

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.920 
selling point to the development team

behind watch dogs as well as weird as it

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.110

when you solve your idea of gonna

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.960 
when you solve your idea of gonna

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
Chicago you can pick the worst possible

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.510 
Chicago you can pick the worst possible
spot<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.510> density<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.200> say<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:47.010> are<00:02:47.040> going<00:02:47.370> to

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
spot of density and say you are going to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.670 
spot of density and say you are going to
have<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.849> build<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.360> suddenly<00:02:49.319> people

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
have to build on that suddenly people

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.650 
have to build on that suddenly people
are<00:02:49.950> really<00:02:50.250> enticed<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:51.000> challenge<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
are really enticed to challenge and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.380 
are really enticed to challenge and
surpass<00:02:52.050> themselves<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.120> like<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.240> said

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
surpass themselves and like I said

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.210 
surpass themselves and like I said
earlier<00:02:54.599> I<00:02:55.080> think<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.800> really

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
earlier I think that this is a really

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.100 
earlier I think that this is a really
good<00:02:56.400> idea<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.970> if<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> think<00:02:57.480> about<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.780> if

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
good idea and if you think about it if

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.199 
good idea and if you think about it if
they<00:02:58.290> actually<00:02:58.680> did<00:02:58.950> choose<00:02:59.250> la<00:02:59.670> people<00:03:00.090> would

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
they actually did choose la people would

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.210 
they actually did choose la people would
have<00:03:00.329> only<00:03:00.540> said<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.230> here<00:03:01.319> copying<00:03:01.769> GTA

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
people are still doing when it's just a

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.010 
people are still doing when it's just a
completely<00:03:05.130> different<00:03:05.610> game<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.420> like<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.840> said

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
completely different game so like I said

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.470 
completely different game so like I said
it<00:03:07.200> makes<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.530> game<00:03:07.710> really<00:03:08.040> unique<00:03:08.580> but<00:03:09.330> if

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
it makes this game really unique but if

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.030 
it makes this game really unique but if

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
to add to a more realistic side of

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.390 
to add to a more realistic side of
things<00:03:53.880> for<00:03:54.690> example<00:03:55.200> after<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.770> does<00:03:55.950> rain<00:03:56.250> in

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
the game ver is going to be puddles all

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.750 
the game ver is going to be puddles all
over<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.410> place<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:58.950> do<00:03:59.100> think<00:03:59.520> that<00:03:59.550> this

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
over the place so I do think that this

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.450 
over the place so I do think that this
is<00:03:59.820> really<00:04:00.180> cool<00:04:00.510> now<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.680> doesn't<00:04:02.010> stop<00:04:02.220> there

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
is really cool now it doesn't stop there

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.880 
is really cool now it doesn't stop there
