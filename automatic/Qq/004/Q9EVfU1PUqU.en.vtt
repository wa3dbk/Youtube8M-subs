00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.840
 but how are you doing on this occasion? 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.790
 I bring a challenge from the hand of chapÃ­n win 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.580
 be of game distributed for salons 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.430
 relative by konami in the year 1985 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.020
 having conversions for nes amstrad and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.489
 commodore to overcome the challenge 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.950
 we will have to insert a credit and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.140
 pass the first phase with a credit 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.030
 the truth is that it is a bit difficult 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.340
 I was testing games before to 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.770
 make me more or less as it was apart 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 to see in the challenge of xavi 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.890
 in this game you can say that I 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.900
 it was the ape monkey sorry with the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.850
 what's cool to try it on your 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.260
 console version because the version of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 mayor I liked it but I would like 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.440
 know if the port they will come to perform 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 it was quite good ibarra similar if to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.229
 brands around the world we know that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.180
 many times they do it for 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.040
 scandals do a for shit but 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.110
 It is always playable at times that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.610
 I always have that way I go in all 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.530
 versions tend to test them in all 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 the versions something that I like to do 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 with all the games to mark the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.800
 difference is between the game 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.750
 original and the game that was 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.479
 they carried different versions by 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.220
 example to the fighting delporte super 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.900
 nintendo if I remember badly very much 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.020
 better than the arrival port 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.150
 because it's expensive is good, let's go to what 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.320
 let's forgive that comment so 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.909
 we are going to give him cane 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.950
 as we are seeing game is collateral 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.690
 very funny has many colors 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.090
 it's something that I like a game that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.400
 have colors just treat a field 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.810
 of mines that there was game that has 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.320
 colors to me is something that calls me that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.090
 like to say if it was a game 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.830
 colorless it would be a sad game not 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.390
 like who says the thing is in that 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.710
 we have to adapt to attack not 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.380
 we can stop a second because as 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.240
 we see we have the screen up 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.690
 of enemies there that killed me is not going to 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.190
 have played good have two 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.070
 more opportunities to try so 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.340
 that there is no dilemma this other that more 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.110
 we have to be very fast very fast 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.540
 a game that we will have to be very 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.610
 fast because people appear in front of us 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.430
 of tying in front of back we have to be 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.350
 agile more than anything agility 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.920
 many activities those of people who 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.680
 it appears 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.580
 and I played it jumping you saw 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.849
 and I'm scared a little flamethrower this 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.850
 good the bullet I'm saving it for 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:42.040
 when I say I will not be able to 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.040
 for example now like who says 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.940
 what a bastard with gold as I eat with 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.350
 errand uncle 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.960
 now I'm going to throw all the 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.900
 bullets is son of a bitch 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.350
 let's go to take me more calmly to 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.350
 see how 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.730
 good with more calm like who says with 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.489
 more calm is not more calm but 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.819
 more on this occasion since I was 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.440
 going quite quiet and I had not 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.239
 realized I did not remember better 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.360
 said after watching the etxaide video 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.640
 that cardboard ct but good come on let's go 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.260
 to go just do not have to go anymore that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.629
 if I do not have to go more concentrated with 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.430
 this occasion in the last and I do not want 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.670
 went to hunt 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.790
 I do not want to be hunting companions 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.790
 there comes the homeland of people hahahaha 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.390
 the super and see mega soldier white takes 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.040
 good friends and friends challenge completed 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.540

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.810
 video until the next mechanics of 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.810
