extensions<00:02:05.890> today<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.369> think<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.729> use<00:02:06.909> about<00:02:07.149> two

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.260 
extensions today I think I use about two
but<00:02:08.410> yeah<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.220> teasing<00:02:09.580> just<00:02:09.729> hopes<00:02:09.940> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
but yeah the teasing just hopes the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.930 
but yeah the teasing just hopes the
clips<00:02:10.599> stick<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.470> something<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:12.160> then<00:02:12.819> we're

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
clips stick to something and then we're

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.470 
clips stick to something and then we're
going<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.269> begin<00:02:13.900> curling<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.700> start<00:02:16.120> off<00:02:16.269> by

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
going to begin curling so I start off by

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.630 
going to begin curling so I start off by
taking<00:02:16.660> about<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.050> one-inch<00:02:17.319> section<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.340> hair

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
taking about a one-inch section of hair

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.170 
taking about a one-inch section of hair
and<00:02:18.880> then<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.660> wrap<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.380> curl<00:02:20.680> around<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
and then I wrap the curl around the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.650 
and then I wrap the curl around the
barrel<00:02:22.599> I<00:02:22.840> don't<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:24.670> like<00:02:24.849> twist<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.540> around

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
barrel I don't just like twist it around

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.809 
barrel I don't just like twist it around
but<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.080> actually<00:02:26.620> wrap<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.160> around<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.790> that

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
but I actually wrap it around so that

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.240 
but I actually wrap it around so that
the<00:02:28.660> same<00:02:28.930> side<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.260> my<00:02:29.440> hair<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.950> always

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
the same side of my hair is always

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.030 
the same side of my hair is always
touching<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.730> barrel<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.420> then<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.930> let<00:02:32.530> go<00:02:32.560> of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
touching the barrel and then I let go of

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.330 
touching the barrel and then I let go of
the<00:02:33.519> clamp<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.750> curling<00:02:35.049> iron<00:02:35.319> let<00:02:36.160> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the clamp on the curling iron let that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.970 
the clamp on the curling iron let that
fall<00:02:36.670> into<00:02:36.970> my<00:02:37.060> hand<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.989> then<00:02:38.380> it'll<00:02:38.530> cool<00:02:38.950> a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
fall into my hand and then it'll cool a

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.039 
fall into my hand and then it'll cool a
little<00:02:39.310> bit<00:02:39.489> when<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:40.030> bobby<00:02:40.209> pin<00:02:40.599> to

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
little bit when I get the bobby pin to

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.800 
little bit when I get the bobby pin to
stick<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.069> up<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.400> my<00:02:42.549> hair<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.150> I'm<00:02:43.569> doing

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
this so that as time to cool sort of the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.339 
this so that as time to cool sort of the
curls<00:02:47.170> get<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.280> right<00:02:48.790> shape<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.540> bounciness

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
curls get the right shape and bounciness

00:02:50.349 --> 00:03:37.790
