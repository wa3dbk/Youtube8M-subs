00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.090
 indicate from the bottom of the crankcase 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.250
 to be able to remove the cap from the chain 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.410
 of distribution now that we need 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.640

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.329
 this car if they realize and attracts 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.010
 a lot of silicon everywhere is because 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.820
 they put him in hand then you have to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.060

 another side they carry 12 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.320
 we can draw letters 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.940
 they are 19 million 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.429
 this car passed a lot of oil because what 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.880
