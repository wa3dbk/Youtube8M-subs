00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 nice guys here is between facets and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.850
 Welcome to this the only one that 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.930
 we are here on black ops 2 with the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.480
 which one had the opportunity 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.880
 to be able to try not to say in preview 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.250
 yes or uprising out questore di su 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.260
 xbox later one month later on ps3 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 and having said this precisely I wanted to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.279
 I will show you this series 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.720
 the new maps so we immediately got the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.650
 game and let's try a little 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.160
 domain 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.390
 and fortunately the list is present 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.060
 let's find only the new maps 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.679
 otherwise it would have been dispersive and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.660
 so far we say everything from opportunities 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.050
 to try study exclusively 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.129
 and magma here it is study is precisely the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.969
 similar map indeed almost identical from the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.739
 scenographic point of view affini james 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.789
 that is the map present in black ops 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.410
 turn so let's see some 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 then first not introduced 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.699
 not even the first class of my kind 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 excusing a simple mmc with 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.109
 silencer fast charger for 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.370
 as is evident they are not even a 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.379
 very high level because 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.320
 practically really played point up 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.119
 xbox and I said well now manages the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.340
 new dlc neither preview why not 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.350
 come back no because don't try to do 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.210
 some teeth then we said today 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.360
 I know precisely here to start the new one 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.729
 series but before doing so or better before 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.440
 let this contribute to me 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.330
 fact that you have to have to leave the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.520
 we better get to like 200 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.500
 so come on guys let me have so many 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.500
 like it will be there immediately after the new video 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.220
 so maybe leave here 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.440
 below what you think about this one 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.630
 new map my opinion for said note 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.340
 mine or rather the fact that practically 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.979
 did copy paste the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.940
 developers indeed apart from the fact that 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.399
 obviously the map is from the point of view 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.409
 graphic is more futuristic as between 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.210
 the other is the game so let's say a 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.740
 seemed logical to make some changes 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:06.819
 graphic but fucking keeps makeup dios 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.619
 perfect so we capture capture the 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.810
 I show the class here goes 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.120
 I practically have nothing that I can 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.040
 encourage to make a good score too 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.260
 if before or better before this than that 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.349
 this gameplay just did one 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.610
 good game that on this map like 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.379
 said precisely played only here on a 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.360
 study and magma then had the opportunity 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.730
 to try only these two dates so far 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.410
 he immediately said without thinking about doing the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.330
 new video then active 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.069
 I also tried zombies indeed 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.079
 little boy 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.510
 terrifying thing due to the fact that 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.549
 the map is really huge and expansive 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.859
 especially to the sound effects there 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.060
 I'm actually on that map 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.739
 join hurry up then under 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.829
 we continue our reader and the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.120
 rewards, of course, are the usual ones 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.489
 helicopter and praise be obviously 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.730
 the intent of xbox that is really loaded 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.169
 of snipers that obviously also them 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.739
 they favor their part maybe try 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:09.930
 to make big but for the moment not 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.590
 I intend to sniper too 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.650
 then here we are doing 79 ed 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.510
 all in all it is not bad materials 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.699
 maybe time to change class e 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:29.340
 we send a typical vote because they are there 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:31.639
 more used then we see the interval 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.639
 cut 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.810
 so I said really beautiful zombies 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.400
 map guys this dl be me at least 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.420
 to me it seemed that it was mounted 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.510
 own or better on the zombies that 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.980
 really done very well I don't want to 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.829
 advertise to better force you to 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.780
 complete but I can only tell you that if 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.200
 you just want to know my opinion how 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.780
 the classic let's say I want to do it 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.569
 in my opinion this 10 is very well 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.370
 past point on zombie modes 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.609
 so let's leave this part of course 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.849
 They leave senseless things during light and 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:14.010
 obviously understandable then cobain 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:20.009
 done now let's see why now 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:25.280
 then we take the fadhil goodbye that 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.280
 grenades there is my mumps 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.729
 and that sucks oh yes thank you for snipers 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.250
 oh oh what the fuck 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.290
 enough as well I put the snai still 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.570
 here 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.570
 here he is slutty bitch 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.389
 well the markers are classic, of course 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.960
 let's not give up just enough 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.380
 enough is enough 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.380
 n smc 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:16.580
 according to the cir e granate oddio you like it 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.289
 he likes but that comes from the provinces 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.999
 moment seemed to me put in contact 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:30.349
 on the bench 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:34.370
 fucking casserole or anarchy always has 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:36.939
 July oh well this game is really a 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.939
 of easter 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.320
 here it is there he is there he is unjust picciotto 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.610
 nice nice daddy and now it's there 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.250
 a little around because I know there is one 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.080
 slide for these parts is obviously 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.480
 I have no fantasy there are so me 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.780
 birkin ass 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.780
 oh my god bastard sneijder 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.990
 I throw grenades across the world 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.630
 a woman who sucks or I wanted to do 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.150
 one hundred more 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.949
 go well guys for the moment this 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.900
 gameplay is better on this new map 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.030
 it's over maybe it will happen 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.860
 subsequently a good score o 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.750
 better something more concentrated 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.000
 so I remember being a beautiful me 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.010
 like we come to teacher immediately loaded 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.780
 a new video is nothing well guys 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.370
 a default target was ten 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.870
 existing with the next video 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.990
 obviously on the next map well 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.990
 boys
