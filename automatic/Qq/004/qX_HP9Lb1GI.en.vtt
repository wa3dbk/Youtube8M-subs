00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.090
 today the boys and girls in the past 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.860
 days you have not been asking what of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.170
 where were these chokers that were not 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.570
 had to install a tennis player give me some 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.279
 video so in this video yes to tell 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.380
 where I bought them and I'm going to put them 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.250
 links to everything so that you have everything 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.009
 well annotated and do not miss the link 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.009
 more interesting 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.410
 well the first one I think it's going to be 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.010
 this because you saw it in a photo in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.230
 instagram and it seems that someone 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.739
 I had the same or something like that, I do not know who 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.489
 he was referring and you told me years like 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.489
 the one from jessica or someone and good 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.750
 it's not from any flea market but it's 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.730
 due to others that may have the same 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.930
 provenance because this is made in china 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:06.520
 total and good as you see has like three 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.100
 parts joined by a link moves or 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.759
 it throws a lot of movement and it's 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.140
 pretty short or is left is 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.290
 nice at the neckline is not even very 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.330
 long or very short nor drown you or anything and 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.030
 besides the color I love I love it 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.259
 that is golden because I have almost nothing 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.869
 of jewelery or accessories the gold 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.170
 but it's golden I like it because it's 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.680
 it is also very tribal and very 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.800
 wild 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.630
 I like it so much then this one 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.840
 it's the one we're going to call it collar 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.430
 smile for example and I leave the link in 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.650
 the information box 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.350
 well the next one is this and also you 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.940
 went crazy for instagram because I'm 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.640
 vitiated to urge the table is the truth 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.550
 Well, this as you see has a 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.890
 more chubby chain has three pieces that 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.500
 they are separated for which you ask me if 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.560
 they get up and it's also short though 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.050
 has an excess of chain in case you have 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.740
 the very wide neck you like to wear it and 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.500
 below it is very beautiful also remains 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.340
 precious with words of honor because 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.690
 It really is like a unique piece and it looks 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.690
 very much and this is going to be called the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.690
 necklace 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.890
 this we would call it collar plates 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.540
 so look below for the link that is the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.500
 of collar plates because these are like 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.930
 inserts 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.840
 and what I like most about this is that the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.030
 color is a very intense gold and also 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.420
 the cord seems quite original to me 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.990
 it's a chain but it's a string of 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.120
 slave and the third is this that you see 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.760
 here that I'm not going to take away the truth 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.500
 and as you can see has as mixed diamonds 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.200
 is all united by also by 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.930
 chain links and are rhombuses in 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.160
 silver and gold color on this side 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.770
 has as a drawing as well as scratched 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.300
 and on the other hand side does not have 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.920
 nothing or if you like more for the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.489
 You can take it on the other side 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.380
 side and this we're going to call it necklace 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.630
 rhombs and I also leave you below the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.989
 information so you know where 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.580
 buy the diamond necklace and nothing 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.959
 I have more to tell you, it's a very video 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.880
 short but you told me that 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.670
 you wanted me to do it so here's what 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.080
 I have done well then nothing here ends 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.630
 the video I hope that 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:42.780
 you liked it if it's like that, little hands up 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.780
 and see you next time
