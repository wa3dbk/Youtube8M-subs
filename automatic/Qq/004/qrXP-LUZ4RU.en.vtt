00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello my name is martin avocado me 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.449
 I'm in the rocker scene and if that 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 vegan scene very quite thick there trying 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.570
 to establish myself 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.640
 I am not vegan but that is 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.320
 no matter I try the people money out 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.869
 to pull the bag because it's easy 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.759
 I bring myself coal now 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.519
 I try the pigs expensive 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.119
 turn on products and on the rail 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.060
 to drive 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.539
 super awesome listens to super prices so 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.539
 Looks 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.530
 the people you can no longer or 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.050
 this dishonest spineless info 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 MÃ¶rschel marketing believe money money 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.810
 money product will be sold with it 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.270
 spares center ants 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.090
 I would almost sold medi 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.350
 Hundreds of liter let the raw food 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.960
 is full of it 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.360
 in germany, too , what was there for 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.430
 trains to rail life not only has 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.530
 to do with it good to get into it 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.900
 So I choose to check that to me 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.300
 What kind of food do I stop 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.370
 It also has to do with what would have to be done 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.320
 I throw out what trash I out 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.180
 I simply wanted to thank them 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.510
 Let's get started before I get into the topic 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.110
 The question should come in today 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.220
 his 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.220
 what do you think of mono now and that 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.100
 is called bananas apples pressing melons 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.760
 Press melons with real care 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.580
 You should always be special anyway 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.300
 put, so to speak, the thought behind it 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.910
 is just you taste that much 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.369
 intense satiety sets 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.410
 correct 1 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.850
 you can log on to your metabolism 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.369
 Metabolism can count on it a lot 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.050
 set better 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.390
 it is nothing bad and bananas 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.890
 apple mxm is and still have green 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.720
 tries the ads but it works 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.060
 So that's why I would be so personal 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.619
 do not look at five as the top border 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.630
 to mix more than five things 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.630
 that also means and salad is a real one 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.910
 Benefits Digested Digest 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.630
 that really cheaper in digests that 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.399
 Just better 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.250
 The body can seemingly somehow 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.700
 adjust what I also more 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.760
 is when you make me in you 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.860
 Direction of residence is avoided 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.110
 automatically unfavorable combination 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.040
 what is the unfavorable combination 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.090
 are yes yes any crude sharp 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.460
 to mix things with sweet things 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.380
 so to speak then 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.970
 this taste the sharp taste 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.880
 or the extremely bitter taste too 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.830
 Covering does not confuse this with 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.959
 the getting used to the beginning could 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.480
 I do not leave 50 grams so sharp and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.790
 today he was 100 so bitter 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.910
 gram and has no digging of it 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.680
 problem but it 's about if you 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.900
 any stark reality 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.970
 creates bitter things hate and those with 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.250
 mixed or mixed with a lot of fruit 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.080
 something or so much together 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.120
 then you can do the natural lock 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.310
 and available at fruit in almost all 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.800
 Fruits, there is this natural place 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.239
 stop grabbing because you just do it 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.910
 to say so because he deceives the body 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.519
 natural barriers may already be 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.800
 time with the other one is noticed 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.220
 At one point, that's up there 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.690
 top palate area say I join in 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.090
 the pineapple I find it naturally sets 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.790
 lock very very often 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.739
 and then comes along as well as surcharge 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.600
 So you can see bananas at kiwi 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.070
 they would be special if they were too 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.810
 is really from a spoon on 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.820
 dexia, what is it now? 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.560
 going on and the C max and you eat well 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.910
 find nothing more and further advantage 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.730
 I from the moon is making faster 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.709
 fed when I eat three gravel in a row 3 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.480
 ks in the piece 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.730
 So I can highly recommend before 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.880
 All said combinations 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.590
 Never fat with sweet 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.060
 Carbohydrate-rich combine that is 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.079
 bad for the digestion bad for 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.019
 a blood sugar level 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.090
 this leads to all the problems 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.150
 The people have the first too much 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.340
 Fat for days on end because I was something 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.350
 said he is the blood then 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.120
 full of fat, so to speak 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.180
 Oxygen transport is a disaster 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.720
 the simple carbs smartly rose the 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.640
 I can get into the cells and then stand 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.380
 she is there and then judges to say this 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.510
 album millions 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.400
 blood on and it happens rather we harm 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.560
 the foreigners can only be monomeric 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.540
 completely blue in the morning at noon 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.280
 completely bananas after me that completely 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.350
 apples then back sometime 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.330
 by kgs as a snack and evening makes 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.960
 German salad not too broad 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.300
 is diversified in the direction goes 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.940
 You can do that now 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.600
 drift or bite looser see that 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.010
 judge 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.330
 I hope now understood in about 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.400
 which direction that works with the mono 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.290
 mails that has its right to exist 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.930
 I can from own recommendations 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.030
 also from the long period artists 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.280
 the successful ones do it too 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.020
 Thank you very much in the direction 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.810
 already see a few in advance 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.940
 beautiful Christmas holidays will be her 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.090
 weak and excessive amounts of 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.090
 Cooking class then I come with the rod 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.090
 was
