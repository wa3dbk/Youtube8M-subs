00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 inside lynchburg you can buy 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.230
 anything from that coffee to clothes 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.970
 going through mustard and motorcycles but at 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.230
 final everything is summarized in the quality and 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.230
 whiskey consistency 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.050
 before these boxes leave the 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.000
 warehouse have to be submitted to a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.779
 final test that is possibly the most 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.779
 important 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.900
 the work of the master taster of norman 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.180
 is to make sure that the whiskey is 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.180
 always constant year after year 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.530
 we are in what we call the room 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.270
 samples of each batch of whiskey jack 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.330
 daniels that we bottled keep a 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.950
 sample bottle of that lot and care 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.280
 here we have a sample profile of two 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.280
 years 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.149
 every Friday the taster invites some 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.900
 how many workers to a room 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.210
 that looks more like a voting booth 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.790
 these are the official tasters of the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.530
 company are workers who play 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.540
 his usual work in different 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.390
 departments but now they are 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.370
 participating in a collective tasting every 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.290
 week about 100 tasters try the 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.940
 whiskey before distribution in a 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.940
 objective and scientific tasting 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.260
 in front they have three samples of jack 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.110
 daniel's unmarked 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.409
 Its purpose is to identify the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.749
 Whiskey that tastes different 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.569
 our employees smell the whiskey and 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:43.460
 then they try it whiskey to keep 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.789
 alerts tasters to the source of 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:51.490
 three samples vary sometimes they are lots 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.490
 different but today they are all the same 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.630
 let's hope they do not find a difference 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 in this case the tasters mark the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.450
 correct answer 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.710
 the three samples coincide 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.140
 this whiskey is ready to go to 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.630
 world and every drop 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.100
 It has been done with a lot of love in this 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.100
 small town of tennessee 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.450
