00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.649 

so<00:00:00.599> I<00:00:01.020> have<00:00:01.800> done<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.070> with<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> projection<00:00:03.419> of

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
so I have done this with a projection of

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.450 
so I have done this with a projection of
lightwave<00:00:04.879> i'm<00:00:05.879> going<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.150> show<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:07.460> plg

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
lightwave i'm going to show you plg

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.959 
lightwave i'm going to show you plg
plugging<00:00:09.230> plg<00:00:10.230> plugging<00:00:10.679> does<00:00:10.980> everything

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.269 

like<00:00:14.969> like<00:00:15.210> thus<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.619> different<00:00:16.920> from

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
like like thus but it's different from

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.260 
like like thus but it's different from
this<00:00:17.670> projection<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.660> bounding<00:00:19.140> box<00:00:19.380> okay<00:00:19.859> so

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
this projection and bounding box okay so

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.670 
this projection and bounding box okay so
it's<00:00:21.270> faster<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.279> in<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.400> case<00:00:24.410> linked<00:00:25.410> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
it's faster so in this case linked you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.650 
it's faster so in this case linked you
to<00:00:25.740> map<00:00:26.099> where<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.510> plg<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.939> LG<00:00:30.240> UV<00:00:30.599> if

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
to map where I have the plg the LG UV if

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.590 
to map where I have the plg the LG UV if
you<00:00:30.840> don't<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.439> go<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> Google<00:00:32.250> its<00:00:32.669> first

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
you don't have it go to Google its first

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.560 
you don't have it go to Google its first
or<00:00:33.870> second<00:00:34.290> link<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.100> very<00:00:35.910> easy<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.300> find

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
or second link so it's very easy to find

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.720 
or second link so it's very easy to find
and<00:00:39.020> so<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> came<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.070> cylinder<00:00:41.550> it's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and so I came here to this cylinder it's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.910 
and so I came here to this cylinder it's
just<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.270> copy<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
just a copy of this one and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.259 
just a copy of this one and
I'm<00:00:45.370> going<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:46.000> leave<00:00:46.149> on<00:00:46.329> edge<00:00:47.100> select

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
I'm going to leave on edge select

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.069 
I'm going to leave on edge select
advanced<00:00:49.269> edge<00:00:49.659> so<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:50.769> finds<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.519> loop

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
advanced edge so it finds the loop

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.200 
advanced edge so it finds the loop
select<00:00:54.510> select<00:00:55.510> advanced<00:00:56.199> edge<00:00:57.210> select

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
select select advanced edge select

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
select select advanced edge select
advanced<00:00:59.109> edge<00:00:59.350> and<00:00:59.710> well<00:01:00.579> I<00:01:00.850> didn't<00:01:01.750> have<00:01:01.989> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
advanced edge and well I didn't have to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.770 
advanced edge and well I didn't have to
unwell<00:01:03.430> anything<00:01:04.330> so<00:01:05.140> just<00:01:05.199> select<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.009> seams

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
unwell anything so just select the seams

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.210 
unwell anything so just select the seams
press<00:01:07.780> make<00:01:08.140> UV<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.799> bada-bing<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:11.229> done<00:01:11.470> so

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
press make UV and bada-bing it's done so

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.560 
press make UV and bada-bing it's done so
let's<00:01:12.880> see<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.240> difference<00:01:13.689> between<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.950> UV

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
let's see the difference between this UV

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.859 
let's see the difference between this UV
made<00:01:16.570> by<00:01:16.840> plg<00:01:17.470> in<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.979> one<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.479> did<00:01:19.720> by

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
made by plg in the one then I did by

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.639 
made by plg in the one then I did by
hands<00:01:20.200> up<00:01:20.399> this<00:01:21.399> is<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.880> UV<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.600> did<00:01:23.470> by<00:01:23.619> hand

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
hands up this is the UV I did by hand

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.820 
hands up this is the UV I did by hand
this<00:01:24.159> is<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.460> prg<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.060> it's<00:01:25.899> the<00:01:26.080> same<00:01:26.590> size

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
this is the prg so it's the same size

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.100 
this is the prg so it's the same size
only<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:27.700> plg<00:01:28.530> put<00:01:29.530> some<00:01:29.830> border<00:01:30.369> here<00:01:30.850> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
only that plg put some border here so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.749 
only that plg put some border here so
that's<00:01:32.110> why<00:01:32.319> it's<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.619> little<00:01:33.009> bit<00:01:33.220> different

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
that's why it's a little bit different

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.930 
that's why it's a little bit different
but<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.630> portions<00:01:35.020> are<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:36.069> same<00:01:36.310> ok<00:01:37.200> now

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
but the portions are the same ok now

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.169 
but the portions are the same ok now
using<00:01:39.940> plz<00:01:40.450> plz<00:01:41.170> for<00:01:41.470> these<00:01:42.069> objects<00:01:42.549> if<00:01:43.000> I

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
using plz plz for these objects if I

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.840 
using plz plz for these objects if I
used<00:01:43.420> cylinder<00:01:44.080> here<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:45.039> would<00:01:45.610> have<00:01:45.640> a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
used cylinder here I would have a

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.470 
used cylinder here I would have a
problem<00:01:46.360> because<00:01:48.359> check<00:01:49.359> what<00:01:49.630> happens

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
problem because check what happens

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.050 
problem because check what happens
it's<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> peek<00:01:52.620> it's<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.760> scan
