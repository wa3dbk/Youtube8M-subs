force after it's actually killed and

difficult actually to get animals grown
or<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.350> obviously<00:00:58.949> most<00:00:59.520> animals

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

they turn around to put as much meat on
as<00:01:02.160> possible<00:01:02.390> but<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.660> does<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:03.899> make<00:01:04.260> the

as possible but that does not make the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
meat with water on it the bacteria on it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.340 
meat with water on it the bacteria on it
sends<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.579> rot<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> few<00:01:54.479> weeks<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.170> will

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
sends it they rot in a few weeks it will

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590 
sends it they rot in a few weeks it will
not<00:01:55.500> keep<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.070> goo<00:01:56.219> very<00:01:56.460> tacky<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.390> dry

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
not keep in a goo very tacky so dry

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450 
not keep in a goo very tacky so dry
aging<00:01:57.869> actually<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> oxygen<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.100> actually

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
aging actually the oxygen is actually

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.179 
aging actually the oxygen is actually
breaking<00:01:59.820> down<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.479> fibers<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> meat<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
breaking down the fibers in the meat and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.649 
breaking down the fibers in the meat and
that's<00:02:02.490> what<00:02:02.700> actually<00:02:02.850> makes<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.479> more

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that's what actually makes it more

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.740 
that's what actually makes it more
mature<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.649> gives<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.850> extra<00:02:06.030> flavor<00:02:06.479> when

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
mature and gives that extra flavor when

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.460 
mature and gives that extra flavor when
you<00:02:06.869> cook<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.409> also<00:02:08.220> we've<00:02:08.399> got<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.580> box

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
you cook it and also we've got a box

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.220 
you cook it and also we've got a box
that's<00:02:10.100> in<00:02:10.250> there<00:02:10.430> that<00:02:10.610> takes<00:02:10.850> all<00:02:11.150> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
that's in there that takes all the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.990 
that's in there that takes all the
bacteria<00:02:12.230> out<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.890> air<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.070> in<00:02:13.790> that

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
bacteria out of the air and in that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.090 
bacteria out of the air and in that
fridge<00:02:14.180> as<00:02:14.360> well<00:02:14.390> would<00:02:15.260> be<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.530> biggest<00:02:15.920> draw

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
fridge as well would be the biggest draw

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.550 
fridge as well would be the biggest draw
ages<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.820> country<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.480> lot<00:02:17.960> of<00:02:18.020> people<00:02:18.110> say

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
ages in the country a lot of people say

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.170 
ages in the country a lot of people say
they<00:02:18.710> actually<00:02:19.010> draw<00:02:19.220> AIDS<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.820> they

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
they actually draw AIDS and they

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.880 
they actually draw AIDS and they
actually<00:02:20.360> don't<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:21.050> getting<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.470> using

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
actually don't that getting that using

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.100 
actually don't that getting that using
wet<00:02:22.100> aids<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.610> saying<00:02:22.880> that<00:02:23.060> draw<00:02:23.510> aging<00:02:23.990> it

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
wet aids and saying that draw aging it

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.440 
wet aids and saying that draw aging it
they<00:02:24.590> call<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:25.070> maturing<00:02:25.730> but<00:02:25.880> actually<00:02:26.270> it's

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
they call it maturing but actually it's

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.320 
they call it maturing but actually it's
it's<00:02:26.690> what<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.290> call<00:02:27.440> changing<00:02:28.010> they<00:02:28.760> actually

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
it's what we call changing they actually

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.560 
it's what we call changing they actually

it out and put it into a vacuum pack
back<00:02:36.470> which<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.520> actually<00:02:37.850> wet<00:02:38.210> aging<00:02:38.450> when

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
back which is actually wet aging when

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.860

will<00:02:52.490> Google<00:02:52.880> rubbery<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:54.410> actual<00:02:54.830> fat

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
will Google rubbery the actual fat
