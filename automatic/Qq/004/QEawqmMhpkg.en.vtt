fios connection that I have at home so

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.810 
fios connection that I have at home so
another<00:00:43.890> thing<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.789> can

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
another thing that I can do is I can

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.580 
another thing that I can do is I can
search<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.510> torrents<00:00:45.870> right<00:00:46.200> from<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.379> app

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
search for torrents right from the app

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.459 
search for torrents right from the app
so<00:00:47.399> when<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> click<00:00:47.640> search<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.960> will<00:00:49.110> pull<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
so when I click search it will pull up a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.010 
so when I click search it will pull up a
web<00:00:49.649> UI<00:00:49.890> view<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.520> give<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> pirate<00:00:51.899> bay

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
web UI view and give you the pirate bay

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.340 
web UI view and give you the pirate bay
and<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.010> let's<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.270> search<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.899> some

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and so let's do a little search for some

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.569 
and so let's do a little search for some
open<00:00:55.890> office<00:00:59.449> and<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:01.980> automatically

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
open office and so it will automatically

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.660 
open office and so it will automatically
sort<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.270> results<00:01:03.690> by<00:01:04.019> seeds<00:01:04.589> by<00:01:05.250> seeders

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
sort the results by seeds by seeders

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300 
sort the results by seeds by seeders
first<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.740> we've

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
first so you can see right here we've

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.460 
first so you can see right here we've
got<00:01:08.340> 21<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.299> five<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:09.930> four<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.200> three

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
got 21 and five then four then three

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.240 
got 21 and five then four then three
than<00:01:10.830> two<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.330> we've<00:01:12.960> got<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.350> most

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
than two and so we've got the most

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.249 
than two and so we've got the most
seeded<00:01:14.820> open<00:01:15.360> office<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.080> top

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
seeded open office right here at the top

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
seeded open office right here at the top
but<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.189> looking<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.610> something<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
but if I was looking for something that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.539 
but if I was looking for something that
was<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.180> newly<00:01:18.840> put<00:01:19.140> online<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.799> could<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
was just newly put online I could go and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.539 
was just newly put online I could go and
change<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> sorting<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.930> by<00:01:22.340> newest<00:01:23.340> first

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
change the sorting to do by newest first

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.050 
change the sorting to do by newest first
and<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.130> give<00:01:26.159> me<00:01:26.400> results<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and so this will give me results and you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.380 
and so this will give me results and you
can<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.570> 10<00:01:27.869> 19<00:01:28.259> 10<00:01:28.680> 14<00:01:29.100> 10<00:01:29.340> 13<00:01:29.729> while

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
because this list actually only

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.369 
because this list actually only
refreshes<00:02:14.489> every<00:02:14.849> four<00:02:15.120> seconds<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.170> don't

force a refresh when it's not

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.080 
force a refresh when it's not
necessarily<00:02:19.019> needed<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.640> also<00:02:20.760> delete
