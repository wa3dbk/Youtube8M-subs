to make about 1.5 mil per hour using the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.549 
to make about 1.5 mil per hour using the
mining<00:00:08.670> skill<00:00:08.970> but<00:00:09.480> also<00:00:09.510> gain<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> very<00:00:10.320> decent

amount of XP and one of the best ways to

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.959 
amount of XP and one of the best ways to
train<00:00:12.750> intel<00:00:13.170> level<00:00:13.500> 80<00:00:13.679> mine<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.429> if<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.759> need

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
train intel level 80 mine so if you need

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.670 
train intel level 80 mine so if you need
that<00:00:15.089> level<00:00:15.299> or<00:00:15.630> even<00:00:15.900> if<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.320> are<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.590> that

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
that level or even if you are on that

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.840 
that level or even if you are on that
level<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.039> would<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.430> take<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> bit

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
level and would like to take a bit

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.120 
level and would like to take a bit
slower<00:00:18.119> xp<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.750> some<00:00:19.350> good<00:00:19.560> money<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:20.039> you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
slower xp for some good money that you

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.980 
slower xp for some good money that you
can<00:00:20.279> make<00:00:20.460> per<00:00:20.670> hour<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:21.480> are<00:00:21.600> some<00:00:21.720> steps

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
can make per hour here are some steps

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.019 
can make per hour here are some steps
that<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.410> make<00:00:22.619> mining<00:00:23.310> granite<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.880> make

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
that you can make mining granite to make

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.490 
that you can make mining granite to make
actually<00:00:24.449> pretty<00:00:24.750> decent<00:00:24.930> money

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
actually pretty decent money

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.920 
actually pretty decent money
so<00:00:26.039> overall<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.000> requirements<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.779> this

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
so overall the requirements for this

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.929 
so overall the requirements for this
method<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.470> need<00:00:28.710> 45<00:00:29.429> money<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.789> mine

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
method is you need 45 money to mine

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
method is you need 45 money to mine
grant<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.390> would<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:30.750> recommend<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.320> until

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
grant but I would not recommend it until

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.950 
grant but I would not recommend it until
at<00:00:31.740> least<00:00:31.949> level<00:00:32.759> 60<00:00:33.210> because<00:00:33.390> before<00:00:33.840> that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
at least level 60 because before that

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
at least level 60 because before that
it's<00:00:34.079> too<00:00:34.230> slow<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.710> I'd<00:00:35.219> also<00:00:35.399> recommend<00:00:35.610> 48

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it's too slow and I'd also recommend 48

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.580 
it's too slow and I'd also recommend 48
definition<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.110> done<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.410> lower

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
definition it can be done with lower

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.319 
definition it can be done with lower
divination<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.579> very<00:00:38.850> important<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
divination but it's very important to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.910 
divination but it's very important to
have<00:00:39.420> higher<00:00:39.660> definition<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> portents

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
have higher definition for the portents

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
have higher definition for the portents
because<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> main<00:00:41.910> method<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.629> money<00:00:42.840> making

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
because the main method of money making

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.990 
because the main method of money making
during<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.649> guide<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.789> using

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
during this guide is going to be using

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
during this guide is going to be using
divination<00:00:45.510> importance<00:00:46.050> made<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
divination importance made with the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.450 
divination importance made with the
divination<00:00:46.739> skill<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.280> buy<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
divination skill you can buy the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
divination skill you can buy the
materials<00:00:47.969> off<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.300> GE<00:00:48.450> make<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> portents

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
materials off the GE make the portents

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.260 
materials off the GE make the portents
and<00:00:49.500> these<00:00:49.980> portents<00:00:50.399> will<00:00:50.520> send<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> granite

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and these portents will send the granite

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.430 
and these portents will send the granite
straight<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> bank<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.350> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
straight to the bank for you so you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
don't even have to bank and you can stay

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.040 
don't even have to bank and you can stay
there<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:54.180> quite<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> while<00:00:54.600> until<00:00:54.660> your

need to mix importance all the different
porters<00:01:26.580> require<00:01:26.939> different<00:01:27.150> things<00:01:27.270> however

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
porters require different things however

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.030 
porters require different things however
the<00:01:27.840> ones<00:01:27.990> I'd<00:01:28.110> recommend<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.650> sign<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the ones I'd recommend are sign of the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.530 
the ones I'd recommend are sign of the
porter<00:01:29.310> 4s<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:29.880> they're<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> most

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
porter 4s because they're the most

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.980 
porter 4s because they're the most
efficient<00:01:31.140> ones<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.500> use<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:32.040> only<00:01:32.990> 320

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
efficient ones to use they are only 320

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.830 
efficient ones to use they are only 320

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.999 
GP per items banked although this price
does<00:01:37.079> change<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> time<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.829> you'll<00:01:37.950> be

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
does change all the time and you'll be

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.859 
does change all the time and you'll be
making<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.369> lot<00:01:38.579> more<00:01:38.610> money<00:01:38.790> back<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
making a lot more money back so the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
making a lot more money back so the
method<00:01:40.320> itself<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.070> teleporting<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
method itself is just teleporting the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.889 
method itself is just teleporting the
granite<00:01:41.880> mind<00:01:42.060> again<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.780> with

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
granite mind again you can do this with

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.749 
granite mind again you can do this with
the<00:01:42.990> inoculum<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.590> quest<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.579> don't

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the inoculum at quest or if you don't

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.730

have the granite mind unlocked you can

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.469 
have the granite mind unlocked you can
teleport<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.310> desert<00:01:47.700> lodestone<00:01:48.180> or

teleport to the desert lodestone or

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.420 
teleport to the desert lodestone or
again<00:01:48.810> take<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> carpet<00:01:49.530> ride<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.009> pol<00:01:50.280> numb

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and the method is quite simple you just

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.510 
and the method is quite simple you just
mined<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> spots<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.649> best<00:01:58.829> ways<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.070> mine

mined the spots the best ways to mine

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.190 
mined the spots the best ways to mine
them<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:00.360> showing<00:02:00.390> here

extra XP you can bring decorated mining
urns<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.780> did<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.110> show<00:02:07.350> them<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.680> video

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
urns I did not show them in this video

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.559 
urns I did not show them in this video
but<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.429> definitely<00:02:08.849> worth<00:02:08.970> using<00:02:09.420> so

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
but they are definitely worth using so

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.420 
but they are definitely worth using so
if<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:09.929> want<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> bring<00:02:10.319> about<00:02:10.590> five<00:02:11.250> or

if you just want to bring about five or

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.160 
if you just want to bring about five or
six<00:02:11.580> mines<00:02:11.940> per<00:02:12.180> trip<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.690> then<00:02:12.840> fill<00:02:13.050> the

six mines per trip and then fill the

six mines per trip and then fill the
rest<00:02:13.349> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
rest you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.530 
rest you
with<00:02:14.010> porters<00:02:14.370> again<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.030> my<00:02:15.120> inventory<00:02:15.300> I've

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
with porters again in my inventory I've

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.730 
with porters again in my inventory I've
assigned<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.870> porters<00:02:16.110> three<00:02:16.320> because<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.620> had

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
assigned the porters three because I had

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.900 
assigned the porters three because I had
a<00:02:16.770> whole<00:02:16.920> bunch<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.160> them<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.400> my<00:02:17.490> bank<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.880> I

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
a whole bunch of them in my bank and I

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.130 
a whole bunch of them in my bank and I
kind<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.180> needed<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.570> use<00:02:18.690> them<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:19.020> but

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
kind of needed to use them up but

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.510 
kind of needed to use them up but
signing<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.470> porter<00:02:19.710> for<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.010> are<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.370> most

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
signing the porter for is are the most

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.190 
signing the porter for is are the most
efficient<00:02:20.940> ones<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.270> use<00:02:21.420> now<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.960> might<00:02:22.170> be

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
efficient ones to use now you might be

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.050 
efficient ones to use now you might be
saying<00:02:22.530> sign<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> porters<00:02:23.520> are<00:02:23.610> actually

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
saying sign of the porters are actually

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.940 
saying sign of the porters are actually
quite<00:02:24.300> expensive<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.840> make<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.320> costs<00:02:25.650> three

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
quite expensive to make it costs three

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.260 
quite expensive to make it costs three
hundred<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.400> twenty<00:02:26.700> two<00:02:26.790> three<00:02:27.000> hundred<00:02:27.060> and

on how much what level sign the porter
you're<00:02:31.620> making<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.100> make<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> lot<00:02:32.550> back

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
you're making but you make a lot back

you're making but you make a lot back
and<00:02:33.540> my<00:02:33.690> testing<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.200> tested<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.680> about<00:02:35.040> for

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
and my testing I tested this about for

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.270 
and my testing I tested this about for
half<00:02:35.610> an<00:02:35.730> hour<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.630> by<00:02:36.750> my<00:02:36.960> testing<00:02:37.500> using<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
half an hour and by my testing using the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.800 
half an hour and by my testing using the
sign<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.610> porters<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.120> about<00:02:39.540> three

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
sign of the porters is about three

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.840 
sign of the porters is about three
hundred<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.140> thirty<00:02:40.290> K<00:02:40.560> loss<00:02:40.830> per<00:02:41.100> hour<00:02:41.250> but

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
hundred and thirty K loss per hour but

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.400 
hundred and thirty K loss per hour but
then<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> granite<00:02:42.450> itself<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.990> about<00:02:43.230> eight

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
then the granite itself is about eight

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.950 
then the granite itself is about eight
one<00:02:43.920> point<00:02:44.370> eight<00:02:44.610> five<00:02:44.940> mill<00:02:45.360> profit<00:02:45.840> per

cost of the porters themselves again it
does<00:02:54.330> depend<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.840> your<00:02:54.930> levels<00:02:55.230> how<00:02:55.320> much<00:02:55.500> you

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
does depend on your levels how much you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.020 
does depend on your levels how much you
make<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:55.980> if<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.190> have<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.730> dragon

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.790 
make and if you have like the dragon
pickaxe<00:02:57.390> if<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.690> have<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.050> obsidian<00:02:58.470> golem

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
pickaxe if you have the obsidian golem

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.470 
pickaxe if you have the obsidian golem
or<00:02:58.890> Titan<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.400> again<00:02:59.940> if<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.270> really

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
or Titan and again if you have a really

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.820 
or Titan and again if you have a really
high<00:03:00.570> mining<00:03:00.900> level<00:03:00.990> you'll<00:03:01.200> make<00:03:01.500> more<00:03:01.740> than

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
high mining level you'll make more than

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.140 
high mining level you'll make more than
me<00:03:01.890> or<00:03:02.160> if<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.340> have<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.490> lower<00:03:02.670> mining<00:03:03.030> level

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
me or if you have a lower mining level

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.490 
me or if you have a lower mining level
you'll<00:03:03.360> probably<00:03:03.570> make<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.020> bit<00:03:04.260> less<00:03:04.470> than

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
you'll probably make a bit less than

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.980 
you'll probably make a bit less than
that<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.670> does<00:03:05.850> vary<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.480> depending<00:03:06.900> on

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
that so it does vary just depending on

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.300 
that so it does vary just depending on
your<00:03:07.140> level<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.440> equipment<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.070> no<00:03:08.190> matter

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
your level and equipment but no matter

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.710 
your level and equipment but no matter
what<00:03:08.520> level<00:03:08.700> or<00:03:08.850> equipment<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.270> are<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.570> will

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
what level or equipment you are you will

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.540 
what level or equipment you are you will
make<00:03:09.870> profit<00:03:10.290> with<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.520> just
