00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:01.110> I<00:00:01.170> can<00:00:01.410> use<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.770> process<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.610> distillation

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so I can use the process of distillation

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.869 
so I can use the process of distillation
to<00:00:03.600> make<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.780> mixture<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.549> separate<00:00:05.549> it<00:00:05.759> out

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
to make a mixture and separate it out

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.900 
to make a mixture and separate it out
into<00:00:06.420> its<00:00:06.750> parts<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:08.099> for<00:00:08.130> example<00:00:08.610> if<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.790> have

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
into its parts so for example if I have

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.180 
into its parts so for example if I have
a<00:00:08.940> glass<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.300> water<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.960> say<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.260> had<00:00:10.500> salt<00:00:10.920> to

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
a glass of water and say I had salt to

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.030 
a glass of water and say I had salt to
it<00:00:11.340> stir<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.730> around<00:00:11.849> dissolve<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.599> salt<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.080> can

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
it stir it around dissolve a salt I can

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.919 
it stir it around dissolve a salt I can
pour<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.549> mixture<00:00:14.790> into<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.450> distillation

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
pour that mixture into a distillation

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.710 
pour that mixture into a distillation
flask<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.650> new<00:00:16.830> distillation<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.640> then<00:00:18.420> I'll

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
flask a new distillation and then I'll

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.920 
flask a new distillation and then I'll
get<00:00:18.990> out<00:00:19.230> at<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.770> end<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:21.240> water<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
get out at the end the water that I

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.259 
get out at the end the water that I
started<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.279> salt<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.820> they'll<00:00:24.150> be

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
started with and the salt and they'll be

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.950 
started with and the salt and they'll be
separate<00:00:25.070> if<00:00:26.070> you're<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> little<00:00:26.519> bit<00:00:26.789> rusty<00:00:27.300> on

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
separate if you're a little bit rusty on

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960 
separate if you're a little bit rusty on
this<00:00:28.260> basic<00:00:28.680> idea<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.070> distillation<00:00:29.550> check

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this basic idea of distillation check

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.730 
this basic idea of distillation check
out<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> first<00:00:30.420> video<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.230> made<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.590> this

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
out the first video that I made on this

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.650 
out the first video that I made on this
topic<00:00:32.040> tip<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.610> clear<00:00:32.850> everything<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.600> it

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
topic tip to clear everything up so it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.760 
topic tip to clear everything up so it
makes<00:00:33.899> sense<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:34.440> we're<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> do

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
makes sense for what we're going to do

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.090 
makes sense for what we're going to do
now<00:00:35.239> now<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.630> thing<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.829> have

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
now now the thing is I don't just have

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.299 
now now the thing is I don't just have
to<00:00:38.129> use<00:00:38.309> distillation<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.809> separate<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.620> liquid

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to use distillation to separate a liquid

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.139 
to use distillation to separate a liquid
from<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.420> solid<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.800> also<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.340> distillation

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
from a solid I can also use distillation

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.770 
from a solid I can also use distillation
to<00:00:45.510> separate<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.230> mixture<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.920> liquids<00:00:47.780> here's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to separate a mixture of liquids here's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.240 
to separate a mixture of liquids here's
what<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> mean<00:00:49.050> when<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> say<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.739> mixture<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
what I mean when I say a mixture of

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.750 
what I mean when I say a mixture of
liquids<00:00:50.899> let's<00:00:51.899> talk<00:00:52.110> about<00:00:52.289> three<00:00:53.160> liquids

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
liquids let's talk about three liquids

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.939 
liquids let's talk about three liquids
right<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:55.430> these<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:56.940> water

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
right now these are going to be water

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
right now these are going to be water
methanol<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.219> ether<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.300> may<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.960> be

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
methanol and ether you may not be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.479 
methanol and ether you may not be
familiar<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.620> any<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> these<00:01:02.070> liquids

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
familiar with any of these liquids

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.140 
familiar with any of these liquids
besides<00:01:02.820> water<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.780> they're<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:05.150> clear

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
besides water but they're all just clear

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.100 
besides water but they're all just clear
liquids<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.530> look<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.280> lot<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.490> water<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> if

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
liquids that look a lot like water so if

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.320 
liquids that look a lot like water so if
I<00:01:10.229> took<00:01:10.290> above<00:01:11.159> three<00:01:11.520> bottles<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.090> each<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
I took above three bottles of each of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330 
I took above three bottles of each of
these<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.869> pour<00:01:13.200> them<00:01:13.350> together<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.979> mixed

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
these and I pour them together and mixed

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.390 
these and I pour them together and mixed
around<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
around and get something that is just a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.830 
around and get something that is just a
clear<00:01:18.270> liquid

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
clear liquid

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.789 
clear liquid
all<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.530> these<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:19.950> mixed<00:01:20.280> together<00:01:20.479> okay<00:01:21.799> how

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
all of these are mixed together okay how

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
all of these are mixed together okay how
can<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.070> separate<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.750> use

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
can I separate this out I can use

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.740 
can I separate this out I can use
distillation<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.280> pull<00:01:26.640> each<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.570> these

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
distillation to pull each of these

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.469 
distillation to pull each of these
liquids<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.560> separately<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.119> break<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
liquids out separately and to break the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.800 
liquids out separately and to break the
mixture<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:31.020> into<00:01:31.259> its<00:01:31.409> parts<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.570> here's<00:01:33.570> what

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
mixture up into its parts so here's what

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.980 
mixture up into its parts so here's what
I'll<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.520> let's<00:01:35.520> pretend<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.450> zoom

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
I'll do let's pretend that we can zoom

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.260 
I'll do let's pretend that we can zoom
in<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.619> mixture<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> liquids<00:01:38.670> zillions

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
in on this mixture of liquids zillions

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.120 
in on this mixture of liquids zillions
and<00:01:39.420> zillions<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.960> times<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.500> take<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> look<00:01:40.979> at

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and zillions of times and take a look at

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.030 
and zillions of times and take a look at
what<00:01:41.340> its<00:01:41.460> molecules<00:01:41.820> would<00:01:42.479> look<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:43.040> this

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
what its molecules would look like this

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.969 
what its molecules would look like this
liquid<00:01:44.430> mixture<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.259> my

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
liquid mixture is right in here in my

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.710 
liquid mixture is right in here in my
flask<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:48.689> are

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
flask and you can see that there are

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.539 
flask and you can see that there are
three<00:01:49.380> different<00:01:49.530> kinds<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.009> molecules

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
three different kinds of molecules

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
three different kinds of molecules
there's<00:01:50.939> water<00:01:51.390> which<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.170> this

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
there's water which is this

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.700 
there's water which is this
there<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.490> also<00:01:53.850> molecules<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:55.110> methanol

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
there are also molecules of methanol

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
there are also molecules of methanol
which<00:01:56.040> look<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:57.570> there<00:01:57.780> are

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
which look like this and then there are

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959 
which look like this and then there are
some<00:01:57.990> molecules<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.770> ether<00:01:59.189> which<00:01:59.729> look<00:01:59.939> like

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
some molecules of ether which look like

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.030 
some molecules of ether which look like
this<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.810> again<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.469> want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.860> able<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
this so again I want to be able to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.219 
this so again I want to be able to
separate<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:02.909> three<00:02:03.270> type<00:02:03.479> these

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
separate out these three type these

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.670 
separate out these three type these
three<00:02:04.560> types<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.920> molecules

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
three types of molecules

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.170 
three types of molecules
so<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.960> way<00:02:08.200> I'm<00:02:08.380> going<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.649> do<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.369> by

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
so the way I'm going to do this is by

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.350 
so the way I'm going to do this is by
using<00:02:10.410> their<00:02:11.410> boiling<00:02:12.100> points<00:02:12.550> as<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.210> can

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
using their boiling points as you can

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.420 
using their boiling points as you can
see<00:02:13.630> ether<00:02:14.050> has<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> relatively<00:02:14.770> low<00:02:15.070> boiling

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
see ether has a relatively low boiling

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.950 
see ether has a relatively low boiling
point<00:02:15.640> another<00:02:16.120> one<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.420> kind<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.720> medium

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
point another one is kind of a medium

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.810 
point another one is kind of a medium
boiling<00:02:17.500> point<00:02:17.740> relatively<00:02:18.280> speaking

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
boiling point relatively speaking

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.420 
boiling point relatively speaking
water<00:02:19.300> has<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.600> pretty<00:02:20.020> high<00:02:20.350> boiling<00:02:20.710> point<00:02:21.010> so

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
water has a pretty high boiling point so

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.580 
water has a pretty high boiling point so
this<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.030> what<00:02:22.210> I'm<00:02:22.300> going<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.690> we're<00:02:23.470> going

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
this is what I'm going to do we're going

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.740 
this is what I'm going to do we're going
to<00:02:23.650> take<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:23.980> flask<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.790> underneath<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.660> I'm

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
to take this flask and underneath it I'm

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.390 
to take this flask and underneath it I'm
going<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.930> put<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.170> Bunsen<00:02:26.650> burner<00:02:26.680> or<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.100> hot

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
going to put a Bunsen burner or a hot

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.940 
going to put a Bunsen burner or a hot
plate<00:02:27.790> something<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.600> heat<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.380> liquid

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
plate something to heat this liquid

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.540 
plate something to heat this liquid
mixture<00:02:30.430> up<00:02:30.990> either<00:02:31.990> has<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.410> low<00:02:32.800> boiling

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
mixture up either has a low boiling

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.000 
mixture up either has a low boiling
point<00:02:33.850> which<00:02:34.390> means<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.870> isn't<00:02:35.230> at<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.350> very<00:02:35.770> low

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
point which means it isn't at a very low

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.260 
point which means it isn't at a very low
temperature<00:02:36.040> maybe<00:02:36.670> just<00:02:36.880> around<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.240> time

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
temperature maybe just around the time

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.330 
temperature maybe just around the time
of<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.630> flask<00:02:38.020> cokes<00:02:38.560> kind<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:38.920> starts<00:02:39.160> to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
of this flask cokes kind of starts to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.360 
of this flask cokes kind of starts to
get<00:02:39.490> warm<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.690> ether<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.709> going<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.070> make<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
get warm that ether is going to make the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.020 
get warm that ether is going to make the
transition<00:02:43.090> from<00:02:43.540> liquid<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.560> gas<00:02:45.070> it's<00:02:45.790> going

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
transition from liquid to gas it's going

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.690 
transition from liquid to gas it's going
to<00:02:46.090> start<00:02:46.240> boiling<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.530> let's<00:02:48.220> imagine<00:02:48.340> this

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
to start boiling so let's imagine this

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.770 
to start boiling so let's imagine this
happens<00:02:49.470> these<00:02:50.470> ether<00:02:51.400> molecules<00:02:52.030> are<00:02:52.330> going

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
happens these ether molecules are going

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.380 
happens these ether molecules are going
to<00:02:52.870> come<00:02:53.740> out<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.250> liquid<00:02:54.459> phase<00:02:54.730> they're

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
to come out of the liquid phase they're

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.790 
to come out of the liquid phase they're
going<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.600> be<00:02:55.690> gas<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.470> they're<00:02:56.620> going<00:02:56.709> to

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
going to be gas and so they're going to

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.410 
going to be gas and so they're going to
move<00:02:56.980> up<00:02:57.190> here<00:02:57.490> into<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.730> top<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.150> flask

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
move up here into the top of the flask

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.470 
move up here into the top of the flask
as<00:02:58.810> gas<00:02:59.680> that<00:03:00.040> can<00:03:00.160> enter<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:00.760> condenser

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
as gas that can enter this condenser

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.560 
as gas that can enter this condenser
this<00:03:01.900> condensers<00:03:02.560> cool<00:03:03.070> remember<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.880> as

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
this condensers cool remember and as

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.570 
this condensers cool remember and as
they<00:03:04.810> move<00:03:05.050> down<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.440> condenser<00:03:06.010> they're

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
they move down the condenser they're

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.880 
they move down the condenser they're
going<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.180> get<00:03:07.360> colder<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.050> colder<00:03:08.140> until<00:03:08.709> the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
going to get colder and colder until the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.580 
going to get colder and colder until the
gas<00:03:09.160> ether<00:03:09.700> turns<00:03:10.060> back<00:03:10.330> into<00:03:10.360> liquid<00:03:10.959> ether

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
gas ether turns back into liquid ether

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.310 
gas ether turns back into liquid ether
and<00:03:11.800> then<00:03:12.489> this<00:03:12.670> liquid<00:03:13.180> ether<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.690> going<00:03:14.260> to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
and then this liquid ether is going to

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.949 
and then this liquid ether is going to
drip<00:03:14.739> down<00:03:15.810> into<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:17.190> beaker<00:03:18.190> or<00:03:18.580> glass<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.930> I

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
drip down into a beaker or glass that I

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.830 
drip down into a beaker or glass that I
have<00:03:20.170> waiting<00:03:20.470> right<00:03:20.830> here<00:03:21.120> okay<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:22.630> that's

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
have waiting right here okay so that's

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.690 
have waiting right here okay so that's
how<00:03:23.050> I'm<00:03:23.140> going<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.350> get<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.620> ether<00:03:23.950> at<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.370> low

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
how I'm going to get the ether at a low

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.910 
how I'm going to get the ether at a low
temperature<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:25.390> starts<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.840> boil<00:03:26.080> this<00:03:26.739> is

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
temperature it starts to boil this is

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.960 
temperature it starts to boil this is
something<00:03:27.190> that's<00:03:27.250> important<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.700> keep<00:03:27.850> in

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
something that's important to keep in

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.360 
something that's important to keep in
mind<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.870> other<00:03:29.140> stuff<00:03:29.560> which<00:03:29.830> has<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.070> boiling

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
mind the other stuff which has a boiling

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.100 
mind the other stuff which has a boiling
point<00:03:30.610> that's<00:03:31.120> higher<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.630> water<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.050> the

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
point that's higher the water in the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.340 
point that's higher the water in the
methanol<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.709> will<00:03:33.459> not<00:03:33.820> boil<00:03:34.239> when<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.019> ether

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
methanol it will not boil when the ether

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.229 
methanol it will not boil when the ether
bowls<00:03:35.590> because<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.130> has<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.400> be<00:03:36.489> hotter<00:03:36.790> for

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
bowls because it has to be hotter for

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.910 
bowls because it has to be hotter for
these<00:03:37.390> two<00:03:37.570> things<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.959> boil<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.769> means

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
these two things to boil so that means

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.250 
these two things to boil so that means
that<00:03:39.040> this<00:03:39.130> low<00:03:39.430> temperature<00:03:39.670> only<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.840> ether

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
that this low temperature only the ether

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.500 
that this low temperature only the ether
is<00:03:41.440> going<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.070> be<00:03:42.190> turning<00:03:42.940> from<00:03:43.120> liquid<00:03:43.480> to

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
is going to be turning from liquid to

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.360 
is going to be turning from liquid to
gas<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:44.230> water<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.680> methanol<00:03:45.010> they're<00:03:45.220> going

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
gas the water in methanol they're going

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.490 
gas the water in methanol they're going
to<00:03:45.430> stay<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.060> liquid<00:03:46.390> phase<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:47.050> here's

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
to stay in the liquid phase so here's

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.750 
to stay in the liquid phase so here's
what's<00:03:47.709> eventually<00:03:47.890> going<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.280> happen<00:03:48.459> at

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
what's eventually going to happen at

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.569 
what's eventually going to happen at
this<00:03:49.239> low<00:03:49.420> temperature

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.899 

okay<00:03:55.629> so<00:03:56.629> now<00:03:57.500> all<00:03:57.799> my<00:03:58.129> teeth<00:03:58.400> they're<00:03:58.610> boiled

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
okay so now all my teeth they're boiled

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.819 
okay so now all my teeth they're boiled
on<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.329> flask<00:03:59.650> condensed<00:04:00.650> in<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.769> condenser

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
on the flask condensed in the condenser

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.550 
on the flask condensed in the condenser
and<00:04:01.430> drip<00:04:02.120> into<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.420> speaker<00:04:02.840> here<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:03.290> now<00:04:03.530> I

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
and drip into the speaker here so now I

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.619 
and drip into the speaker here so now I
have<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:03.980> beaker<00:04:04.459> that's<00:04:04.849> full<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.180> liquid

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
have a beaker that's full of liquid

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.929 
have a beaker that's full of liquid
ether<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:06.349> none<00:04:06.829> of<00:04:06.860> this<00:04:07.040> other<00:04:07.159> stuff<00:04:07.310> okay

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
ether and none of this other stuff okay

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.720 
ether and none of this other stuff okay
so<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.150> got<00:04:08.359> the<00:04:08.390> ether<00:04:08.750> out<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:10.250> next<00:04:10.549> thing

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
so I got the ether out the next thing

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.880 
so I got the ether out the next thing
that<00:04:10.849> I<00:04:11.000> want<00:04:11.329> to<00:04:11.359> do<00:04:11.540> is<00:04:11.870> get<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.409> methanol

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
that I want to do is get the methanol

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.979 
that I want to do is get the methanol
out<00:04:13.069> I'll<00:04:13.430> do<00:04:13.849> this<00:04:14.060> by<00:04:14.299> raising<00:04:14.599> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
out I'll do this by raising the

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.140 
out I'll do this by raising the
temperature<00:04:15.319> of<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:16.100> flask<00:04:16.370> actually<00:04:16.880> point

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
temperature of the flask actually point

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.659 
temperature of the flask actually point
out<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:17.989> thing<00:04:18.289> up<00:04:18.440> here<00:04:18.709> represents<00:04:19.609> a

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
out that this thing up here represents a

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.279 
out that this thing up here represents a
thermometer<00:04:20.090> which<00:04:20.570> we<00:04:20.720> often<00:04:20.989> put<00:04:21.139> at<00:04:21.259> the

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
thermometer which we often put at the

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.350 
thermometer which we often put at the
top<00:04:21.350> of<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.829> distillation<00:04:22.250> flask<00:04:22.580> that's

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
top of the distillation flask that's

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.610 
top of the distillation flask that's
just<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.660> keep<00:04:23.810> an<00:04:23.990> eye<00:04:24.229> on<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.470> temperature

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
just to keep an eye on the temperature

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.700 
just to keep an eye on the temperature
so<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:25.460> we<00:04:25.550> know<00:04:25.789> when<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.449> expect<00:04:26.960> each<00:04:27.470> of

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
so that we know when to expect each of

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.740 
so that we know when to expect each of
these<00:04:27.800> chemicals<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.850> be<00:04:28.970> coming<00:04:29.360> out<00:04:29.479> and

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
these chemicals to be coming out and

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.140 
these chemicals to be coming out and
into<00:04:30.440> our<00:04:30.560> collection<00:04:30.949> beaker<00:04:31.370> here<00:04:31.550> okay<00:04:32.090> so

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
into our collection beaker here okay so

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.840 
into our collection beaker here okay so
anyway<00:04:32.510> we<00:04:33.289> raise<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.949> temperature<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.639> little

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
anyway we raise the temperature a little

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.850 
anyway we raise the temperature a little
bit<00:04:35.060> more<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.479> we'll<00:04:35.930> reach<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.560> temperature

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
bit more and we'll reach the temperature

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.240 
bit more and we'll reach the temperature
at<00:04:37.160> which<00:04:37.449> methanol<00:04:38.449> boils<00:04:39.289> so<00:04:39.949> then<00:04:40.130> these

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
at which methanol boils so then these

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.279 
at which methanol boils so then these
methanol<00:04:40.820> molecules<00:04:41.360> are<00:04:41.600> going<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.750> pull<00:04:42.050> out

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
methanol molecules are going to pull out

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.439 
methanol molecules are going to pull out
of<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.740> liquid<00:04:42.979> and<00:04:43.400> they're<00:04:44.180> going<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.389> be

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
of the liquid and they're going to be

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.110 
of the liquid and they're going to be
kind<00:04:44.630> of<00:04:44.720> gas<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.289> go<00:04:45.440> into<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.710> condenser<00:04:46.120> go

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
kind of gas and go into the condenser go

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.129 
kind of gas and go into the condenser go
down<00:04:47.330> here<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:47.870> go<00:04:48.410> into<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.710> beaker<00:04:49.039> and

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
down here and go into the beaker and

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.409 
down here and go into the beaker and
again<00:04:51.139> I<00:04:51.349> should<00:04:51.650> point<00:04:51.919> out<00:04:52.099> that<00:04:52.419> while

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
again I should point out that while

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.140 
again I should point out that while
methanol<00:04:54.139> can<00:04:54.710> boil<00:04:54.979> this<00:04:55.340> meeting<00:04:55.669> medium

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
methanol can boil this meeting medium

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.360 
methanol can boil this meeting medium
temperature<00:04:56.449> the<00:04:56.990> water<00:04:57.320> isn't<00:04:57.889> going<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.310> be

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
temperature the water isn't going to be

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.980 
temperature the water isn't going to be
boiling<00:04:58.729> so<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.000> water<00:04:59.240> is<00:04:59.389> going<00:04:59.539> to<00:04:59.630> stay<00:04:59.960> a

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
boiling so the water is going to stay a

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.860 
boiling so the water is going to stay a
liquid<00:05:00.560> even<00:05:01.400> while<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.729> methanol<00:05:02.240> is<00:05:02.510> able

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
liquid even while the methanol is able

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.969 
liquid even while the methanol is able
to<00:05:03.320> come<00:05:03.560> out<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:03.919> form<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.490> gas

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.570 

okay<00:05:10.979> so<00:05:11.729> now<00:05:12.419> I<00:05:12.479> have<00:05:12.659> a<00:05:13.259> glass<00:05:13.679> of<00:05:13.709> liquid

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
okay so now I have a glass of liquid

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.309 
okay so now I have a glass of liquid
methanol<00:05:15.149> I've<00:05:15.300> separated<00:05:15.569> that<00:05:16.050> from<00:05:16.259> the

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
methanol I've separated that from the

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.519 
methanol I've separated that from the
water<00:05:16.559> a<00:05:17.149> final<00:05:18.149> thing<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.659> I<00:05:18.809> want<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.139> do<00:05:19.289> is

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
water a final thing that I want to do is

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:22.070 
water a final thing that I want to do is
raise<00:05:20.159> the<00:05:20.429> temperature<00:05:20.849> this<00:05:21.059> flask<00:05:21.389> even

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
raise the temperature this flask even

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.079 
raise the temperature this flask even
more<00:05:22.259> to<00:05:22.649> reach<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:23.309> temperature<00:05:23.789> at<00:05:23.969> which

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:24.089 
more to reach the temperature at which

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.999 
more to reach the temperature at which
water<00:05:24.389> boils<00:05:24.539> which<00:05:25.110> is<00:05:25.289> about<00:05:25.529> 100<00:05:25.919> degrees

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
water boils which is about 100 degrees

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.249 
water boils which is about 100 degrees
Celsius<00:05:26.669> is<00:05:26.999> exactly<00:05:27.599> entrepreneurial

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
Celsius is exactly entrepreneurial

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.790 
Celsius is exactly entrepreneurial
Celsius<00:05:28.679> and<00:05:29.209> all<00:05:30.209> of<00:05:30.539> this<00:05:30.629> water<00:05:31.019> all<00:05:31.379> these

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
Celsius and all of this water all these

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.889 
Celsius and all of this water all these
water<00:05:32.129> molecules<00:05:32.639> are<00:05:32.969> going<00:05:33.179> to<00:05:33.239> transition

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:33.899 
water molecules are going to transition

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:36.919 
water molecules are going to transition
from<00:05:34.110> liquid<00:05:34.919> into<00:05:35.610> gas<00:05:35.789> they're<00:05:36.599> going<00:05:36.809> to<00:05:36.869> go

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:36.929 
from liquid into gas they're going to go

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:38.899 
from liquid into gas they're going to go
up<00:05:37.019> in<00:05:37.139> this<00:05:37.259> flask<00:05:37.529> through<00:05:38.519> the<00:05:38.610> condenser

course<00:06:01.679> as<00:06:01.860> I've<00:06:02.009> said<00:06:02.249> this<00:06:02.519> is<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.729> super

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:03.269 
course as I've said this is a super

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:06.019 
course as I've said this is a super
super<00:06:03.509> super<00:06:03.899> magnified<00:06:04.679> molecular<00:06:05.459> view<00:06:05.819> if

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
super super magnified molecular view if

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.089 
super super magnified molecular view if
we're<00:06:06.509> looking<00:06:06.809> at<00:06:06.869> these<00:06:06.989> in<00:06:07.229> real<00:06:07.409> life<00:06:07.439> they

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
we're looking at these in real life they

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.929 
we're looking at these in real life they
would<00:06:08.279> all<00:06:08.579> be<00:06:09.079> three<00:06:10.079> beakers<00:06:10.949> of<00:06:11.189> clear

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:11.939 
would all be three beakers of clear

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.629 
would all be three beakers of clear
liquid<00:06:12.449> but<00:06:13.439> I've<00:06:13.589> been<00:06:13.800> able<00:06:13.979> using

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
liquid but I've been able using

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.569 
liquid but I've been able using
distillation<00:06:15.209> to<00:06:15.839> separate<00:06:16.499> these<00:06:17.159> three

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:17.579 
distillation to separate these three

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:19.429 
distillation to separate these three
liquids<00:06:18.029> from<00:06:18.179> each<00:06:18.360> other<00:06:18.599> and<00:06:18.809> just<00:06:19.199> once

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439 
liquids from each other and just once

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:21.589 
liquids from each other and just once
again<00:06:19.709> to<00:06:19.860> review<00:06:20.219> I've<00:06:20.399> used<00:06:21.089> the<00:06:21.240> fact<00:06:21.479> that

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
again to review I've used the fact that

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:23.179 
again to review I've used the fact that
they've<00:06:21.809> all<00:06:22.079> boiled<00:06:22.589> at<00:06:22.709> different

00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:23.189 
they've all boiled at different

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:26.509 
they've all boiled at different
temperatures<00:06:23.729> in<00:06:23.999> order<00:06:24.659> to<00:06:24.749> do<00:06:24.869> this<00:06:25.050> so<00:06:25.919> at<00:06:26.189> a

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:26.519 
temperatures in order to do this so at a

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.489 
temperatures in order to do this so at a
certain<00:06:26.759> temperature<00:06:27.139> one<00:06:28.139> of<00:06:28.259> them<00:06:28.379> will

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:28.499 
certain temperature one of them will

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.439 
certain temperature one of them will
boil<00:06:28.769> but<00:06:29.399> the<00:06:29.550> others<00:06:29.879> will<00:06:30.209> not

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
boil but the others will not

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.480 
boil but the others will not
they'll<00:06:30.749> stay<00:06:31.019> lit<00:06:31.289> and<00:06:31.499> that's<00:06:32.009> how<00:06:32.279> we're

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
they'll stay lit and that's how we're

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.459 
they'll stay lit and that's how we're
able<00:06:32.519> to<00:06:32.759> separate<00:06:33.329> out<00:06:33.569> these<00:06:34.019> different

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
able to separate out these different

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.369 
able to separate out these different
liquids<00:06:34.829> if<00:06:35.579> they<00:06:35.909> have<00:06:36.119> different<00:06:36.809> boiling

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:37.379 
liquids if they have different boiling

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.860 
liquids if they have different boiling
points
