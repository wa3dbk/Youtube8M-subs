forest as possible by clear cutting just

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
forest as possible by clear cutting just
think<00:00:31.289> about<00:00:31.529> all<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> paper<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> get

from<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:32.850> those<00:00:33.030> ugly<00:00:33.329> trees<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.820> it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
from all those ugly trees if you do it

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
from all those ugly trees if you do it
right<00:00:36.149> pretty<00:00:36.600> soon<00:00:36.719> your<00:00:37.140> forest<00:00:37.530> will<00:00:37.649> look

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
right pretty soon your forest will look

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.670 
right pretty soon your forest will look
