has<00:00:47.720> gone<00:00:47.900> now<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:48.410> now<00:00:49.370> it's<00:00:49.520> down<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:49.730> a<00:00:49.850> case

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
has gone now so now it's down to a case

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.910 
has gone now so now it's down to a case
of<00:00:50.329> sort<00:00:50.570> in<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.840> rubbish<00:00:51.470> that's<00:00:51.620> left

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
there's a lot of little bits of metal

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.630
