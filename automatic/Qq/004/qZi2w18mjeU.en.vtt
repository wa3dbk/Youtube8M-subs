00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
hello and welcome to this video what I'm

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.730 
hello and welcome to this video what I'm
going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> show<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.120> now<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.569> how<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.810> write<00:00:07.470> an

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
going to show you now is how to write an

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.560 
going to show you now is how to write an
absolute<00:00:08.280> value<00:00:08.400> inequality<00:00:09.150> when<00:00:09.420> you're

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
absolute value inequality when you're

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.490 
absolute value inequality when you're
given<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.050> graph<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.809> our<00:00:13.170> lovely

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
given a graph so here is our lovely

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.620 
given a graph so here is our lovely
graph<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.500> what<00:00:16.980> we're<00:00:17.130> gonna<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.520> first<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:18.150> we

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
graph so what we're gonna do first is we

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.890 
graph so what we're gonna do first is we
need<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:19.050> establish<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.980> our<00:00:20.010> Homebase<00:00:20.580> is

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
need to establish what our Homebase is

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.740 
need to establish what our Homebase is
so<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.140> are<00:00:22.170> looking<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:23.240> home<00:00:24.240> base

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
so we are looking for home base

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
so we are looking for home base
so<00:00:25.170> here's<00:00:26.449> house<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:28.260> windows<00:00:28.730> there's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
so here's house with windows there's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.919 
so here's house with windows there's
your<00:00:29.880> house<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.359> we're<00:00:30.480> looking<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.810> home

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
your house so we're looking for home

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.000 
your house so we're looking for home
base<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.640> home<00:00:32.640> base<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:34.110> point<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.770> is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
base so home base is the point that is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.580 
base so home base is the point that is
exactly<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> middle<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.540> our<00:00:37.320> two

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
exactly in the middle of our two

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.310 
exactly in the middle of our two
boundary<00:00:38.250> values<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.750> our<00:00:39.780> boundary

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
boundary values so here our boundary

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.450 
boundary values so here our boundary
values<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.950> 4<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.840> 8<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.920> we're<00:00:44.100> looking<00:00:44.340> for

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
values are 4 and 8 so we're looking for

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
values are 4 and 8 so we're looking for
the<00:00:44.520> value<00:00:44.760> that's<00:00:44.879> right<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> middle<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the value that's right in the middle of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.100 
the value that's right in the middle of
them<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:47.129> how<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.930> can

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
them so how we can do that is we can

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.100 
them so how we can do that is we can
find<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.920> far<00:00:50.190> apart<00:00:50.340> there<00:00:50.719> we're<00:00:51.719> finding

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
find how far apart there we're finding

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.680 
find how far apart there we're finding
the<00:00:52.289> distance<00:00:52.890> between<00:00:53.129> them<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.329> find<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the distance between them so we find the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.139 
the distance between them so we find the
distance<00:00:55.199> between<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.770> by<00:00:56.280> either<00:00:56.579> counting

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
distance between them by either counting

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
distance between them by either counting
on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.539> number<00:00:57.780> line<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:58.680> easy

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
on the number line here it's pretty easy

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.540 
on the number line here it's pretty easy
to<00:00:59.070> see<00:00:59.309> or<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.750> use<00:01:01.140> subtraction<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:02.190> find<00:01:02.399> out

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
to see or we use subtraction to find out

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.889 
to see or we use subtraction to find out
how<00:01:02.670> far<00:01:02.879> apart<00:01:02.969> there<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.480> that's<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:03.809> we're

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
how far apart there so that's what we're

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.600 
how far apart there so that's what we're
gonna<00:01:03.960> show<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.559> sometimes<00:01:04.979> we're<00:01:05.519> gonna

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
gonna show because sometimes we're gonna

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.980 
gonna show because sometimes we're gonna
be<00:01:05.760> working<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.180> numbers<00:01:06.360> where<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.780> not

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
be working with numbers where it's not

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.710 
be working with numbers where it's not
easy<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.500> count<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> number<00:01:08.250> line<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.720> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
easy to count on the number line so to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.810 
easy to count on the number line so to
find<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.049> how<00:01:10.170> far<00:01:10.350> apart<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.640> can

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
find out how far apart they are we can

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.760 
find out how far apart they are we can
do<00:01:11.909> 8<00:01:13.159> minus<00:01:14.159> 4<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.570> know<00:01:15.770> that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
do 8 minus 4 and as we all know that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.120 
do 8 minus 4 and as we all know that
makes<00:01:17.040> 4<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.720> tells<00:01:18.990> us<00:01:19.259> how<00:01:19.619> far<00:01:19.979> apart

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
makes 4 so that tells us how far apart

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
makes 4 so that tells us how far apart
they're<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.420> want<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> find<00:01:21.900> out<00:01:22.049> where

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
they're but we want to find out where

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.030 
they're but we want to find out where
the<00:01:22.439> middle<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> we're<00:01:24.720> looking<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the middle is so we're looking for the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
the middle is so we're looking for the
number<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.549> between<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.390> we're<00:01:27.600> gonna<00:01:27.720> cut

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
number in between so we're gonna cut

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.100 
number in between so we're gonna cut
that<00:01:28.259> distance<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.040> half<00:01:30.320> then<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.560> 2<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> with

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that distance in half then get 2 so with

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.880 
that distance in half then get 2 so with
that<00:01:34.350> too<00:01:34.740> we're<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> move<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.890> two

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that too we're going to move in two

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.999 
that too we're going to move in two
units<00:01:38.310> from<00:01:38.520> 8<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.150> move<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.020> two<00:01:40.470> units<00:01:40.680> from

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
units from 8 and move in two units from

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.469 
units from 8 and move in two units from
4<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.350> tada<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.950> 6<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.270> means

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
4 and tada we get to 6 so that means

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.990 
4 and tada we get to 6 so that means
home<00:01:45.750> base<00:01:47.329> is<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.570> 6<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.430> we're<00:01:50.820> trying

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
home base is that 6 so now we're trying

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.840 
home base is that 6 so now we're trying
to<00:01:51.119> figure<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.509> how<00:01:52.049> far<00:01:52.500> these<00:01:53.189> values<00:01:53.640> are

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
to figure out how far these values are

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.999 
to figure out how far these values are
from<00:01:54.180> 6<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:54.960> absolute<00:01:55.350> value<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.770> talking

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
from 6 because absolute value is talking

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.090 
from 6 because absolute value is talking
about<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> distance<00:01:56.729> from<00:01:57.000> home<00:01:57.540> base<00:01:57.810> so

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
about the distance from home base so

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.469 
about the distance from home base so
we're<00:01:59.100> looking<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.520> how<00:01:59.640> far<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.030> value<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
we're looking for how far a value is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.450 
we're looking for how far a value is
from<00:02:00.659> home<00:02:01.079> base<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.070> case<00:02:02.280> we've

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
from home base so in this case we've

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.920 
from home base so in this case we've
already<00:02:02.640> figured<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.479> out

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
already figured that out

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.169 
already figured that out
it's<00:02:04.670> due<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:07.140> what<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.649> do<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:09.030> can

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
it's due so what we can do is we can

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.270 
it's due so what we can do is we can
take<00:02:09.239> our<00:02:09.989> home<00:02:10.709> base<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.610> our<00:02:12.360> distance

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
take our home base and our distance

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.610 
take our home base and our distance
from<00:02:13.580> home<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.540> incorporate<00:02:15.170> them<00:02:15.320> into<00:02:15.530> our

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
from home and incorporate them into our

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.070 
from home and incorporate them into our
absolute<00:02:16.010> value<00:02:16.040> inequality<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.510> our<00:02:17.690> basic

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
absolute value inequality so our basic

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.360 
absolute value inequality so our basic
absolute<00:02:18.680> value<00:02:19.550> inequality<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:21.070> we<00:02:22.070> have<00:02:22.250> our

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
absolute value inequality is we have our

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.410 
absolute value inequality is we have our
absolute<00:02:22.700> value<00:02:22.730> bars<00:02:23.060> our<00:02:24.520> value<00:02:25.520> is<00:02:26.180> going

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
absolute value bars our value is going

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.810 
absolute value bars our value is going
to<00:02:26.540> be<00:02:26.600> some<00:02:27.020> distance<00:02:27.500> away<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:28.670> use

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
to be some distance away we use

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.400 
to be some distance away we use
subtraction<00:02:29.570> when<00:02:29.840> we're<00:02:30.020> talking<00:02:30.170> about

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
subtraction when we're talking about

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.190 
subtraction when we're talking about
distance<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.970> show<00:02:32.120> how<00:02:32.300> far<00:02:32.570> apart<00:02:32.720> things

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
distance to show how far apart things

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.780 
distance to show how far apart things
are<00:02:33.470> subtraction<00:02:34.040> tells<00:02:34.220> us<00:02:34.370> how<00:02:34.490> far<00:02:34.700> apart

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
are subtraction tells us how far apart

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.020 
are subtraction tells us how far apart
things<00:02:35.180> are<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.610> what<00:02:37.610> happens<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.240> our<00:02:40.030> home

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
things are so what happens is our home

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.510 
things are so what happens is our home
base<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.660> what<00:02:41.900> goes<00:02:42.080> inside<00:02:42.680> our<00:02:43.130> absolute

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
base is what goes inside our absolute

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.610 
base is what goes inside our absolute
value<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.060> becomes<00:02:44.390> 6<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:47.620> that's

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
value so that becomes 6 the that's

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.770 
value so that becomes 6 the that's
another<00:02:48.830> color<00:02:49.070> here<00:02:49.280> please<00:02:49.520> orange<00:02:49.820> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
another color here please orange the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.920 
another color here please orange the
distance<00:02:51.709> from<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.070> outside<00:02:52.810> distance<00:02:53.810> from

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
distance from the outside distance from

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.590 
distance from the outside distance from
home<00:02:54.080> goes<00:02:54.350> on<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.620> outside<00:02:55.180> now<00:02:56.180> we<00:02:56.270> need<00:02:56.510> to

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
home goes on the outside now we need to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.930 
home goes on the outside now we need to
figure<00:02:56.750> out<00:02:56.870> what<00:02:57.290> symbol<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.800> is<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.670> we<00:02:58.820> can

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
figure out what symbol it is so we can

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.300 
figure out what symbol it is so we can
come<00:02:59.150> back<00:02:59.270> up<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.870> our<00:02:59.900> original<00:03:00.320> absolute

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
come back up to our original absolute

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.610 
come back up to our original absolute
value<00:03:01.550> inequality<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.810> decide<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.350> and

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
value inequality and decide is this and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.780 
value inequality and decide is this and
vs.<00:03:04.459> or<00:03:04.640> so<00:03:05.630> in<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.080> case<00:03:06.380> this<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.640> a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
vs. or so in this case this is a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.310 
vs. or so in this case this is a
situation<00:03:08.060> where<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.540> need<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.870> stay<00:03:09.080> close

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
situation where you need to stay close

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
situation where you need to stay close
to<00:03:09.650> home<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:11.000> can<00:03:11.270> go<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:12.140> houses<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:12.709> way<00:03:12.980> or

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
to home you can go to houses this way or

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.670 
to home you can go to houses this way or
to<00:03:13.370> houses<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.090> way<00:03:14.330> but<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.959> have<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.470> stay

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
to houses that way but you have to stay

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.530 
to houses that way but you have to stay
close<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:16.160> home<00:03:16.310> stay<00:03:16.970> in<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.239> middle

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
close to home stay in this middle

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.900 
close to home stay in this middle
section<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:20.170> an<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:24.130> situation<00:03:25.130> we

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
section so this is an and situation we

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.720 
section so this is an and situation we
need<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.120> stay<00:03:26.299> close<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:27.080> home<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:28.459> when<00:03:28.610> we're

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
need to stay close to home so when we're

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.310 
need to stay close to home so when we're
staying<00:03:28.970> close<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.390> home<00:03:29.600> our<00:03:29.870> distance<00:03:30.200> is

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
staying close to home our distance is

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.570 
staying close to home our distance is
restricted<00:03:31.070> so<00:03:31.250> we<00:03:31.640> use<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.790> less<00:03:32.060> than<00:03:32.090> symbol

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
restricted so we use a less than symbol

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.580 
restricted so we use a less than symbol
our<00:03:34.580> boundary<00:03:35.420> value<00:03:35.810> circles<00:03:36.200> are<00:03:36.350> not

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
our boundary value circles are not

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.550 
our boundary value circles are not
filled<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:37.760> we<00:03:37.910> are<00:03:38.209> not<00:03:38.600> an<00:03:38.840> or<00:03:39.049> equal<00:03:39.410> to

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
filled in so we are not an or equal to

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.880 
filled in so we are not an or equal to
situation<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:42.019> what<00:03:42.560> we<00:03:42.709> have<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.750> our<00:03:44.890> answer

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
situation so what we have is our answer

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.490 
situation so what we have is our answer
the<00:03:46.730> absolute<00:03:47.180> value<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.900> quantity<00:03:48.019> X

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
the absolute value of the quantity X

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.569 
the absolute value of the quantity X
minus<00:03:48.890> 6<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.400> less<00:03:49.730> than<00:03:50.000> 2<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.989> that's<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.579> so

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
minus 6 is less than 2 and that's it so

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.319 
minus 6 is less than 2 and that's it so
that's<00:03:52.790> how<00:03:53.000> we<00:03:53.510> do<00:03:54.519> write<00:03:55.519> an<00:03:55.700> absolute<00:03:56.060> value

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
that's how we do write an absolute value

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.440 
that's how we do write an absolute value
from<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.930> graph<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:58.340> now<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.549> guys<00:03:59.030> are<00:03:59.090> gonna

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
from a graph so now you guys are gonna

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.940 
from a graph so now you guys are gonna
try<00:03:59.750> this<00:03:59.810> on<00:04:00.230> your<00:04:00.590> own

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
try this on your own

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.170 
try this on your own
and<00:04:01.040> we'll<00:04:01.250> see<00:04:01.459> what<00:04:01.610> kind<00:04:01.790> of<00:04:01.850> videos<00:04:02.150> you

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
and we'll see what kind of videos you

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.750 
and we'll see what kind of videos you
can<00:04:02.480> come<00:04:02.630> up<00:04:02.660> with
