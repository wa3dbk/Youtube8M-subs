 that seeing this mode is really 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.890
 very well accomplished by god I do not know of the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.950
 best modes I 've seen is 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.690
 worked elaborate and is a bit small 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 but my god is the first phase and you 're 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.350
 see that in you will want to add 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.940
 many more things besides that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 showers is one of the virtues that most 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.910
 They are close to their community nearby 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.710
 are not closer together 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.180
 buried of your community and any 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.030
 thing that you want the city made 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.979
 I leave your twitter and your channel 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.380

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.310
 very interesting 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.050
 So what to teach them, I think there's no 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.050

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.899

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.960
 systems that you will find in this game 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.550

 first of all we have the tables of 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.610

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.760
 what does he have 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.040
 the model is from the faithfull text but 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.980
 the same they are very very very well 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.570
 gotten is not there that stays very 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.790
 ok with the whole square theme and 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.400
 here they have creative tables 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.740
 even great is beautiful but this is not 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.010
 it ends here clear that no 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.430
 we also have chests that my god to 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.020
 see steve steve come here steve you can not 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.180

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.740

 this clock here is there yes how can 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.690
 see we can put things on top but not 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.000
 we can 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.650
 open it, so to speak, because the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.830
 way nothing else add those things 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.260
 decorative what good if you do not want 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.350
 and put it you will find it in the part of 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.540
 cameras here will have this part of the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.060
 sierra will not be achieved and who 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.920
 found on the bedside table is my 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.170
 bedside table and here is how can 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.730
 see is great and it 's very well and 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.290
 to change the view of kraft me 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.570
 as you can see there are different designs 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.570
 which is the kraft table in the chest and 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.910
 this is a tmt that you see everything 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.890
 red so nothing let's see the design 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.920
 of the tnt that is not far behind 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.410
 it is very very very 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.990
 Well done seriously, it's very, very good 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.390
 achieved I love this mode well these 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.280
 had this see this tmt that pixels 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.310
 more defined with the nor s s plant 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.600
 and good to finish good indeed 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.420
 it does not end there are still enough 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.510
 things we go to the world to build we put 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.850
 here in tapestries and we have a new 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.340
 upholstery that is the upholstery of minecraft 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.210
 as you can see it serves as if it were like 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.010
 stones and this gives us this 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.100
 just see how it looks, we're going to 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.170
 way to live and it's a little bit is a 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.660
 little bit dark but we worry about 80 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.120
 in good thought of us and added 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.150
 minecraft torches oh my god those 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.210
 things these things are going to do 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.460
 the best in the 104 by god and clean 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.460
 that you do that way well this adds 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.870
 Minecraft torches illuminate illuminate 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.220
 very well besides they are very cheap 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.890
 since you already know from you that 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.990
 torches are are quite cheap in 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.030
 minecraft for that very reason they must be 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.250
 cheap in theaters 4 also not 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.730
 I suppose we are going to fill all this with 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.130
 torches and so on and so I love you 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:33.130
 will split these torches or I think that 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.770
 both of the stone and the torches 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.630
 they are very very well achieved by not 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.780
 say that they are perfectly achieved 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.970
 in their 100% see this or see the 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.390
 model of the night is great I 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.430
 love I love I love it like that 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.220
 which I love 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.660
 so well I think this mode this 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.040
 mode does not end here guys for a 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.620
 this is the first update 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.030
 that we have brought chan the first phase 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.360
 of the mod so to speak look here is 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.190
 the school but good is the first phase 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.590
 of the mod will add many more things 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.290
 at least I hope to see more things like 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.060
 for example I do not know if well a little 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.250
 more than walls it would be good to see more 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.830
 parents do not achieve wooden walls can 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.900
 put also of brick there 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.640
 a lot of things to exploit I do not know 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.740
 besides that it has many blocks 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.870
 minecraft and can therefore also 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.730
 exploit them no I do not know this one do not have 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.860
 very much where to draw in truth but 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.170
 chan I know you'll see this and I do not know from 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.220
 here many congratulations indeed 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:39.940
 I think that this nickname is very very very very 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.730
 very very very well accomplished and expect more 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.680
 things about you I do not think you deserve it 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.560
 so as a kid he told you the link of the 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.370
 download in this way in the description 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.610
 Obviously there will not be the download link 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.320
 good will be the video of 2 am 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.160
 so they go and see it also if it is 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.890
 who do not know you know 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.600
 and also there then she will explain to you a 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.850
 little bit more of his humor because I think that 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.280
 there is no one to explain it better than 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.590
 her so there you will have it guys nothing 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.240
 more than telling them that I hope we're 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.160
 they download it play it and if it 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.830
 download do not forget to send me your photos 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.240

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.770
 an upcoming video chao
