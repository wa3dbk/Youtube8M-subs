computer's<00:00:22.680> being<00:00:22.800> very<00:00:23.039> slow<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.580> had

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
computer's being very slow because I had

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.540 
computer's being very slow because I had
just<00:00:24.000> started<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:25.019> program<00:00:25.740> crash<00:00:26.220> so

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
just started this program crash so

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.570 
just started this program crash so

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.720 
I think we knew that from the trailer
and<00:00:38.670> why<00:00:38.910> wouldn't<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.239> include<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
and why wouldn't they include it

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.160 
and why wouldn't they include it
crossbow<00:00:42.079> stakeout<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:44.809> there's<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
crossbow stakeout and there's like a

some<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.430> that's<00:01:41.579> kind<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> cool<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.180> an

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
some so that's kind of cool it's an

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.730 
some so that's kind of cool it's an
avenged<00:01:42.509> sevenfold<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> good

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
avenged sevenfold take on it it's a good

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
avenged sevenfold take on it it's a good
song<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.460> long<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.210> apparently<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:45.990> guess

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
song it's long and apparently I guess

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.780 
song it's long and apparently I guess
there's<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.560> songs<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.579> kind

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
there's two songs in this so that's kind

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.210 
there's two songs in this so that's kind
of<00:01:47.820> cool<00:01:47.970> maybe<00:01:48.659> we'll<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.590> able<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.799> replay

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
of cool maybe we'll be able to replay

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.249 
of cool maybe we'll be able to replay
songs<00:01:50.610> whenever<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.689> maybe<00:01:51.930> after

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
songs whenever we want like maybe after

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.530 
songs whenever we want like maybe after
five<00:01:52.619> rounds<00:01:52.649> you'll<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.340> able<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.549> play<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
five rounds you'll be able to play a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.510 
five rounds you'll be able to play a
song<00:01:55.049> again<00:01:55.229> maybe<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:55.829> what<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.340> I

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
song again maybe that's what that is I

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.230 
song again maybe that's what that is I
highly<00:01:57.060> doubt<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:58.170> know<00:01:59.240> also

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
highly doubt that but I don't know also
