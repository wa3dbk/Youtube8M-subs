is<00:01:52.119> we<00:01:52.240> get<00:01:52.359> authentication<00:01:53.079> to<00:01:53.889> display<00:01:54.880> and

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
is we get authentication to display and

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.039 
is we get authentication to display and
use<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.810> webcam<00:01:55.990> we<00:01:56.889> get<00:01:57.039> this<00:01:57.249> camera<00:01:58.049> we

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
use the webcam we get this camera we

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.800 
use the webcam we get this camera we
create<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.859> web<00:02:00.459> camera<00:02:00.759> texture<00:02:01.299> using<00:02:01.569> the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
create a web camera texture using the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.620 
create a web camera texture using the
device<00:02:02.079> name<00:02:02.459> we<00:02:03.459> tell<00:02:03.670> this<00:02:03.850> texture<00:02:04.209> to<00:02:04.359> play

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
device name we tell this texture to play

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.379 
device name we tell this texture to play
this<00:02:05.319> will<00:02:05.529> start<00:02:05.740> recording<00:02:05.999> on<00:02:06.999> the<00:02:07.270> web

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.389 
this will start recording on the web

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:10.919 
this will start recording on the web
camera<00:02:08.550> next<00:02:09.550> very<00:02:09.970> importantly<00:02:10.390> we<00:02:10.659> create<00:02:10.899> a

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
camera next very importantly we create a

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.280 
camera next very importantly we create a
new<00:02:11.200> material<00:02:11.670> which<00:02:12.670> uses<00:02:13.120> our<00:02:13.299> new<00:02:13.720> custom

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
new material which uses our new custom
