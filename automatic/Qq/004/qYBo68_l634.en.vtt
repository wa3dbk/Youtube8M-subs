 confirmed by all parties 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.890
 Conflict Kiev refused to renew 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.630
 ceasefire and immediately went to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.400
 the offensive was already at dawn 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.439
 noticed the movement of heavy machinery in 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.509
 particular self-propelled howitzers and installations 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.520

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.770
 explosions in the vicinity of Slavic in the area 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.150
 Kramatorsk and other locations 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.450
 and near Donetsk reportedly 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.650
 news agencies and all go tank battles 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.850
 huge about what's happening in the zone 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.859
 operation words we learn from ours 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 correspondent Alexander Ageev his sign 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.149
 he comes in direct communication from Slavic 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.989
 Alexander what is happening and whether you have 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.989
 data from other cities 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.300
 hello lera really night 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.470
 Slavonic today was very nervous 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.330
 as soon as the truce expired 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.460
 fullness at 23:00 Moscow time 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.140
 time in it and soared over the city 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.390
 lighting rockets and it was incomprehensible 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.420
 who highlights the territory of Ukrainian 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.830
 troops to more accurately beat on those 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.420
 the purposes they intend 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.400
 destroy either the militia who 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.979
 feared assault feared that they 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.040
 sneak up in the dark need to note that 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.960
 literally immediately at 23:00 began 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.580
 cannonade around the city as a result 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.860
 artillery duel 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.390
 the television tower on 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.550
 Mount Karachun judging by the logic 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.860
 what is happening is the militia shot at 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.890
 the accumulation of Ukrainian troops who like 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.800
 times and are in short not here we are 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.910

 eyewitnesses as it was 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.950

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.680
 eyewitnesses need to note the fact that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.750
 Ukrainian troops today beat from all 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.420
 sides of the Slavic suburbs in all 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.570
 wherein positions are arranged such militias 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.860
 settlements like a seed village such as 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.050
 compound feed plant 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.790
