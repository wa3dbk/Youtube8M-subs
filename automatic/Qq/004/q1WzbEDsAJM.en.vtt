00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
only got the base anti-aliasing but

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.130 
only got the base anti-aliasing but
everything<00:01:17.580> else<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.000> high<00:01:18.600> settings

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
this laptop it sucks for gaming so turn

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.580 
this laptop it sucks for gaming so turn
up<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> volume

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.920 

as<00:01:39.649> you<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.430> see<00:01:42.100> awesome<00:01:43.100> frame<00:01:43.369> rates<00:01:43.930> I

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
as you can see awesome frame rates I

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.630 
as you can see awesome frame rates I
don't<00:01:45.530> actually<00:01:45.680> know<00:01:45.950> what<00:01:46.100> I'm<00:01:46.189> doing<00:01:46.520> at

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
don't actually know what I'm doing at

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.779 
don't actually know what I'm doing at
this<00:01:46.759> level<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:47.390> go<00:01:48.110> options<00:01:48.700> video<00:01:49.700> oh<00:01:51.789> okay

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
this level but go options video oh okay

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.109 
this level but go options video oh okay
so<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.299> have<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:54.159> anti-aliasing<00:01:55.159> on<00:01:55.310> four<00:01:55.850> times

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
so I have a anti-aliasing on four times

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.080 
so I have a anti-aliasing on four times
or<00:01:56.600> whatever<00:01:57.909> filtering<00:01:58.909> on<00:01:59.470> trilinear<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:02.030> I

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
or whatever filtering on trilinear and I

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.609 
or whatever filtering on trilinear and I
think<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.329> gotta<00:02:03.369> um<00:02:04.390> but<00:02:05.390> here's<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.170> big<00:02:06.380> part

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
page full memory available I don't know

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.890 
page full memory available I don't know
what<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.600> but<00:02:17.840> hi<00:02:19.180> don't<00:02:20.180> know<00:02:20.630> if<00:02:20.780> you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
what that is but hi don't know if you

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.870 
what that is but hi don't know if you
can<00:02:21.080> actually<00:02:21.230> know<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.340> can<00:02:22.459> just<00:02:22.640> put<00:02:22.790> it

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
can actually know you can just put it

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.759 
can actually know you can just put it
low<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.209> those<00:02:24.049> are<00:02:24.200> actually<00:02:24.500> like<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
low so those are actually like the

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.130 
low so those are actually like the
highest<00:02:25.160> settings<00:02:25.580> right<00:02:25.790> there<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.360> then

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
highest settings right there and then

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.839 
highest settings right there and then
just<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.530> few<00:02:27.560> other<00:02:27.890> settings<00:02:28.160> would<00:02:28.519> make<00:02:28.670> it

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
just a few other settings would make it

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.250 
just a few other settings would make it
running<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.900> run<00:02:30.290> on<00:02:30.440> high<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:32.060> we<00:02:32.959> apply

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
running like run on high so we apply

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.690 
running like run on high so we apply
that<00:02:33.670> go<00:02:34.670> back<00:02:34.880> back<00:02:35.330> you're<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.230> game

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
that go back back you're in the game

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.830 
that go back back you're in the game
you'll<00:02:37.700> notice<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.180> it's<00:02:38.360> completely

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
you'll notice that it's completely

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.690 
you'll notice that it's completely
lagless<00:02:42.280> see<00:02:43.280> if<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.519> shoot<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.820> portal<00:02:45.670> fine

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
lagless see if I shoot the portal fine

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.620 
lagless see if I shoot the portal fine
this<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.120> no<00:02:47.720> lag<00:02:47.989> at<00:02:48.200> all<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.150> guess<00:02:50.420> we<00:02:50.600> just

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
this is no lag at all so I guess we just

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.949 
this is no lag at all so I guess we just
want<00:02:51.350> that<00:02:51.620> uh<00:02:53.530> puzzle<00:02:55.569> loading<00:02:56.569> loading

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
want that uh puzzle loading loading

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.920 
want that uh puzzle loading loading
screens<00:02:57.530> are<00:02:57.739> kind<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:58.040> long<00:02:58.250> I've<00:02:58.609> noticed<00:02:59.120> at

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
screens are kind of long I've noticed at

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.900 
screens are kind of long I've noticed at
first<00:02:59.959> they're<00:03:00.500> like<00:03:01.160> short<00:03:01.519> but<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.760> guess

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
first they're like short but I guess

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.069 
first they're like short but I guess
that's<00:03:02.060> because<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:02.540> like<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.959> beginning

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
that's because it's like the beginning

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.860 
that's because it's like the beginning
of<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.410> game<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.700> near<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.180> end<00:03:05.450> but<00:03:07.870> as
