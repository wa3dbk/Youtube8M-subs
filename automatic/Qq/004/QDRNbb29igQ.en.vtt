00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
kind of a nice flush color sometimes on

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.860 
kind of a nice flush color sometimes on
the<00:02:56.670> camera<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.180> right<00:02:57.420> now<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.750> is

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the camera like right now it is

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.250 
the camera like right now it is
appearing<00:02:58.320> super<00:02:58.950> super<00:02:59.220> dark<00:02:59.540> um<00:03:00.540> but<00:03:00.990> for

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
appearing super super dark um but for

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.570 
appearing super super dark um but for
some<00:03:01.440> reason<00:03:01.830> that's<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.310> way<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
some reason that's just the way the

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.340 
some reason that's just the way the
camera<00:03:02.790> picks<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.570> like<00:03:03.840> different<00:03:04.170> lights

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
camera picks up like different lights

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.890 
camera picks up like different lights
and<00:03:04.650> shadows<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.460> just<00:03:06.150> wrote<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.450> make<00:03:06.570> sure<00:03:06.720> to

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
and shadows I just wrote to make sure to

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.550 
and shadows I just wrote to make sure to
kill<00:03:07.170> myself<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.860> did<00:03:08.600> nope<00:03:09.600> it's<00:03:09.780> even<00:03:10.110> but

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
kill myself I did nope it's even but

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.170 
kill myself I did nope it's even but
just<00:03:11.010> for<00:03:11.100> some<00:03:11.400> reason<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.820> lighting<00:03:12.150> just

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
just for some reason the lighting just

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.740 
just for some reason the lighting just
picks<00:03:12.690> things<00:03:12.900> up<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.440> don't<00:03:13.650> know<00:03:13.740> why<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:13.950> is

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
picks things up I don't know why that is

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.840 
picks things up I don't know why that is
way<00:03:15.750> things<00:03:16.230> work<00:03:16.560> but<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.700> a

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
way things work but this is like a

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.300 
way things work but this is like a
really<00:03:18.150> awesome<00:03:19.160> awesome<00:03:20.160> bronzer<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.540> I

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
really awesome awesome bronzer so I

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.470 
really awesome awesome bronzer so I
would<00:03:23.310> say<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.270> is<00:03:24.510> probably<00:03:24.750> for

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
would say that this is probably for

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.970 
would say that this is probably for
bronzer<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.870> probably<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.350> one<00:03:28.770> of<00:03:28.800> the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
bronzer this is probably like one of the

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.360 
bronzer this is probably like one of the
top<00:03:29.780> one<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> top<00:03:31.140> ones<00:03:31.410> definitely<00:03:31.830> like

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
top one of the top ones definitely like

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.050 
top one of the top ones definitely like
there<00:03:32.940> are<00:03:33.030> some<00:03:33.210> bronzers<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:33.840> NARS<00:03:34.350> Laguna

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
think you have to have an olive skin

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.180 
think you have to have an olive skin
tone<00:03:42.300> for<00:03:42.600> NARS<00:03:42.780> Laguna<00:03:42.990> to<00:03:43.410> work<00:03:43.560> because<00:03:43.980> it

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
tone for NARS Laguna to work because it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.770 
tone for NARS Laguna to work because it
makes<00:03:44.459> my<00:03:44.670> skin<00:03:44.730> look<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.150> little<00:03:45.450> greenish

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
makes my skin look a little greenish

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.750 
makes my skin look a little greenish
when<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.200> put<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.530> my<00:03:46.590> skin<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.520> if<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.670> have

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
when I put it on my skin so if you have

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.340

an<00:03:47.850> olive<00:03:47.940> skin<00:03:48.540> tone<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:49.020> don't<00:03:49.200> think<00:03:49.320> that

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
an olive skin tone I don't think that

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.930 
an olive skin tone I don't think that
happened<00:03:49.620> because<00:03:49.920> when<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.340> have<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.670> olive

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
happened because when you have it olive

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.850 
happened because when you have it olive
skin<00:03:51.209> tone<00:03:51.390> obviously<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.530> have<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.680> little

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860
