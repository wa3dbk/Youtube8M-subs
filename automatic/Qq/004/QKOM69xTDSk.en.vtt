was<00:00:05.430> on<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.700> internet<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.720> built<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.680> lot<00:00:07.799> of

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
was on the internet and I built a lot of

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.720 
was on the internet and I built a lot of
these<00:00:08.069> systems<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:09.530> it's<00:00:10.530> come<00:00:10.800> very<00:00:11.070> familiar

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
these systems so it's come very familiar

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.810 
these systems so it's come very familiar
with<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.940> case<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.599> got<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> cooler<00:00:13.590> master<00:00:13.830> FX

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820

100 I that's your liquid cooled
processor<00:00:25.260> cooler<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.490> noticed<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.510> on

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
processor cooler I noticed that on

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.589 
processor cooler I noticed that on
YouTube<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.500> lot<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.220> people<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:30.090> try<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.390> do

YouTube a lot of people that try to do
tutorials<00:00:32.030> were<00:00:33.030> missing<00:00:33.930> some<00:00:34.140> things

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
tutorials were missing some things

tutorials were missing some things
trying<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> install<00:00:35.100> these<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.640> case<00:00:35.880> my

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
trying to install these in this case my

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.959 
trying to install these in this case my
case<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.050> all<00:00:37.170> torn<00:00:37.410> apart<00:00:37.559> by<00:00:38.309> swapping<00:00:38.700> out<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
case is all torn apart by swapping out a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.090 
case is all torn apart by swapping out a
motherboard<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> use<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> old

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
motherboard I'm going to use a old

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.990 
motherboard I'm going to use a old
motherboard<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.879> an<00:00:42.030> example<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:44.000> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
motherboard as an example here but the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.779 
motherboard as an example here but the
best<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.360> install<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.289> I've<00:00:47.190> got<00:00:47.460> two

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
best way to install this is I've got two

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.979 
best way to install this is I've got two
fans<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.809> top<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.969> half<00:00:50.969> x<00:00:51.210> case<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
fans on the top of the half x case it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
fans on the top of the half x case it
came<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.829> put<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> second<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:53.940> in

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
came with one I put the second one in

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.110 
came with one I put the second one in
there<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.480> I've<00:00:54.570> got<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:54.899> fans<00:00:55.640> I've<00:00:56.640> got<00:00:56.940> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
there so I've got two fans I've got it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.810 
there so I've got two fans I've got it
in<00:00:57.239> an<00:00:57.600> exhaust<00:00:58.050> mode<00:00:58.410> because<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.430> me<00:00:59.520> heat

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
in an exhaust mode because to me heat

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.479 
in an exhaust mode because to me heat
rises<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.660> I've<00:01:00.780> got<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.109> sucking<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> hot<00:01:02.340> air

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
rises so I've got it sucking the hot air

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.899 
rises so I've got it sucking the hot air
out<00:01:03.229> as<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.949> I've<00:01:05.129> already<00:01:05.309> got<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
out as you can see I've already got the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.550 
out as you can see I've already got the
let<00:01:06.330> me<00:01:06.360> put<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> little<00:01:06.780> light<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:06.990> here

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
let me put a little light on here

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.039 
let me put a little light on here
the<00:01:08.450> h100<00:01:09.450> i<00:01:09.650> installed<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.369> bottom

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
the h100 i installed on the bottom

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.289 
the h100 i installed on the bottom
that's<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.680> exhaust<00:01:14.130> mode<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.939> it's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that's also in exhaust mode so it's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.340 
that's also in exhaust mode so it's
pushing<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.909> heat<00:01:18.229> through<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
pushing the the heat through the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.899 
pushing the the heat through the
radiator<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:21.020> out<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> top<00:01:22.409> I'm<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> mechanic

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
radiator and out the top I'm a mechanic

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.240 
radiator and out the top I'm a mechanic
by<00:01:24.030> trade<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.830> familiar<00:01:25.979> with

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
by trade so I'm very familiar with

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.300 
by trade so I'm very familiar with
cooling<00:01:26.700> systems<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.680> there's<00:01:28.680> no<00:01:28.890> problem

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
cooling systems and there's no problem

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
cooling systems and there's no problem
whatsoever<00:01:29.579> doing<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.150> even<00:01:30.450> though<00:01:30.570> course

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
whatsoever doing this even though course

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.190 
whatsoever doing this even though course
they're<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> believe<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:31.920> recommend<00:01:33.200> pulling

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
they're I believe they recommend pulling

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.190 
they're I believe they recommend pulling
the<00:01:34.500> cooler<00:01:35.100> through<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> top<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:37.020> there's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the cooler through the top but there's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.649 
the cooler through the top but there's
so<00:01:37.320> much<00:01:37.439> air<00:01:37.650> flow<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:38.040> these<00:01:38.159> cases<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.909> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
so much air flow in these cases that you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.390 
so much air flow in these cases that you
can<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.189> works

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
can do it just like this and it works

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.770 
can do it just like this and it works
fine<00:01:42.500> other<00:01:43.500> thing<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.280> some<00:01:44.640> people<00:01:44.970> have

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
fine other thing is is some people have

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
fine other thing is is some people have
this<00:01:46.170> flipped<00:01:46.439> around<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:46.950> isn't<00:01:47.159> an<00:01:47.340> issue

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this flipped around which isn't an issue

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.770 
this flipped around which isn't an issue
but<00:01:48.450> when<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> run<00:01:49.259> these<00:01:49.470> hoses<00:01:49.799> over<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
but when you run these hoses over to the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.609 
but when you run these hoses over to the
motherboard<00:01:51.780> which<00:01:51.960> will<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.200> sitting<00:01:52.439> right

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
motherboard which will be sitting right

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.760 
motherboard which will be sitting right
there<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> back<00:01:53.220> wall<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
there on the back wall it kind of the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.910 
there on the back wall it kind of the
hose<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.130> kind<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.520> covered<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.770> pump<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
hose is kind of covered the pump a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.310 
hose is kind of covered the pump a
little<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.219> not<00:01:59.640> much<00:01:59.670> I've<00:02:00.630> got<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> rubber

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
little bit not much I've got a rubber

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.520 
little bit not much I've got a rubber
band<00:02:01.649> wrapped<00:02:02.369> around<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.719> hold<00:02:04.290> on

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
band wrapped around here just hold on

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.869 
band wrapped around here just hold on
the<00:02:04.969> plastic<00:02:06.770> compound<00:02:07.770> cover<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> I

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
the plastic compound cover so that I

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.100 
the plastic compound cover so that I
don't<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.569> smudging<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.319> over<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> place

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
don't go smudging it all over the place

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.850 
don't go smudging it all over the place
so

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.730 
so
this<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.070> how<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.610> set<00:02:14.730> up<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:16.650> know

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
and I highly recommend you use one

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.150 
and I highly recommend you use one
washer<00:02:51.300> on<00:02:51.630> each<00:02:52.350> one<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.620> those<00:02:52.739> screws

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
washer on each one of those screws

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.260 
washer on each one of those screws
because<00:02:53.370> otherwise<00:02:53.670> you're<00:02:53.910> going<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.090> notice

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
because otherwise you're going to notice

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.900 
because otherwise you're going to notice
that<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.780> will<00:02:54.989> hit<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:57.140> radiator<00:02:58.140> fins<00:02:58.910> it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
that it will hit the radiator fins it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.240 
that it will hit the radiator fins it
won't<00:03:00.209> affect<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.080> performance<00:03:01.410> but<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.100> does

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
won't affect the performance but it does

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.740 
won't affect the performance but it does
bend<00:03:02.520> those<00:03:02.640> spins<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.030> little<00:03:03.150> bit<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.510> did

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
bend those spins a little bit so I did

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.930 
bend those spins a little bit so I did
put<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> washer<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.560> there<00:03:04.739> just<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.640> keep<00:03:05.760> that

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
put a washer on there just to keep that

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.300 
put a washer on there just to keep that
screw<00:03:06.270> from<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.840> too<00:03:07.050> deep<00:03:07.260> as<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:08.160> can

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
screw from going in too deep as you can

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.010 
screw from going in too deep as you can
see<00:03:08.520> there<00:03:08.730> there<00:03:08.940> are<00:03:09.060> some<00:03:09.270> washers<00:03:09.780> on

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
see there there are some washers on

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.500 
see there there are some washers on
there<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:12.140> anyways<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:14.250> know<00:03:14.370> when<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.880> mount

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
there so anyways you know when you mount

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.130 
there so anyways you know when you mount
this<00:03:15.750> cooler<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.500> backplate<00:03:17.810> which<00:03:18.810> goes<00:03:19.019> on

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
this cooler the backplate which goes on

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.509 
this cooler the backplate which goes on
the<00:03:19.290> back<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.739> motherboard<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:23.280> know<00:03:23.400> if

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
the back of the motherboard you know if

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.920 
the back of the motherboard you know if
you're<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:24.120> you're<00:03:24.209> putting<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.690> motherboard

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
you're if you're putting a motherboard

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.350 
you're if you're putting a motherboard
in<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:26.100> have<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.519> put<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.790> back<00:03:26.850> paid-up

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
in you have to put that back paid-up

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.600 
in you have to put that back paid-up
plate<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.870> first<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.590> an<00:03:28.680> 1155<00:03:30.110> set<00:03:31.610> at

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
plate on first if it's an 1155 set at

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.780 
plate on first if it's an 1155 set at
least<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.000> do<00:03:33.120> our<00:03:33.269> mine<00:03:33.680> otherwise<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:35.670> will

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
least you do our mine otherwise you will

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.070 
least you do our mine otherwise you will
not<00:03:35.940> be<00:03:36.000> able<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.299> get<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.630> on<00:03:36.750> with<00:03:36.959> this

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
not be able to get it on with this

not be able to get it on with this
access<00:03:37.530> panel<00:03:37.890> that's<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.220> downfall<00:03:38.850> for<00:03:38.959> the

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
access panel that's a downfall for the

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.720 
access panel that's a downfall for the
1/2<00:03:40.140> X<00:03:40.410> case<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.830> don't<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.160> why<00:03:41.310> they<00:03:41.519> didn't

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
1/2 X case I don't know why they didn't

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.759 
1/2 X case I don't know why they didn't
make<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:42.030> little<00:03:42.150> bit<00:03:42.299> larger<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:42.769> the

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
make it a little bit larger but the

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.210 
make it a little bit larger but the
that's<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.730> problem<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:45.630> make<00:03:46.590> sure<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:47.010> put

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
that's the problem so make sure you put

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.810 
that's the problem so make sure you put
that<00:03:47.250> backplate<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.390> before<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.500> put<00:03:49.820> your

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
that backplate on before you put your

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.530 
that backplate on before you put your
motherboard<00:03:51.120> in<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.750> case<00:03:53.239> excuse<00:03:54.239> me<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.420> got

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
motherboard in the case excuse me I got

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.630 
motherboard in the case excuse me I got
allergies<00:03:54.989> they're<00:03:55.200> getting<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.250> best<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.549> me

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
complaining a lot about the backplate

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.580 
complaining a lot about the backplate
being<00:04:08.850> loose<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.480> lot<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.840> playing<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.290> lot<00:04:10.560> of

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.530 
slop so I'm going to show you what I did
on<00:04:13.230> mine<00:04:13.470> not<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.370> it'll<00:04:15.360> work

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
on mine not that you have to it'll work

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.090 
on mine not that you have to it'll work
fine<00:04:15.780> without<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.410> there's<00:04:16.650> supposed<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.010> be

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
fine without that there's supposed to be

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.890 
fine without that there's supposed to be

a little play in there but people are
saying<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.410> because<00:04:19.440> it's<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.130> loose<00:04:20.400> it

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
saying that because it's so loose it

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.730 
saying that because it's so loose it
doesn't<00:04:21.479> keep<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:22.729> processor<00:04:23.729> as<00:04:24.150> cool<00:04:25.050> as<00:04:25.410> if

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
doesn't keep the processor as cool as if

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.980 
doesn't keep the processor as cool as if
it

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
it

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.559 
it
it<00:04:26.259> was<00:04:26.380> tight<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.520> what<00:04:27.669> I<00:04:27.699> did<00:04:27.819> let<00:04:28.240> me<00:04:28.300> get<00:04:28.419> up

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
it was tight so what I did let me get up

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.279 
it was tight so what I did let me get up
trying<00:04:29.289> to<00:04:29.319> do<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:29.590> with<00:04:30.479> one<00:04:31.479> hand<00:04:31.509> here

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
trying to do this with one hand here

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.920 
trying to do this with one hand here
I<00:04:32.319> took<00:04:33.160> some<00:04:35.370> refrigerant<00:04:36.370> all<00:04:37.090> rings<00:04:37.539> and

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
I took some refrigerant all rings and

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.400 
I took some refrigerant all rings and
popped<00:04:38.560> them<00:04:38.830> on<00:04:39.840> just<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.020> can<00:04:41.229> see

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
popped them on just so you can see

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.370 
popped them on just so you can see
they're<00:04:41.590> not<00:04:41.710> tight<00:04:42.039> except<00:04:42.430> for<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.639> one

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
they're not tight except for the one

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.830 
they're not tight except for the one
just<00:04:44.380> pop<00:04:44.590> them<00:04:44.680> on<00:04:44.800> those<00:04:44.949> pins<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:46.300> when<00:04:46.750> you

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
just pop them on those pins and when you

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.240 
just pop them on those pins and when you
bring<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.169> through<00:04:47.349> let<00:04:47.620> me<00:04:47.710> set<00:04:47.919> this<00:04:48.039> back

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
bring it through let me set this back

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.520 
bring it through let me set this back
down<00:04:49.770> when<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.889> bring<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.310> through<00:04:51.520> here<00:04:52.530> and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
down when you bring it through here and

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.749 
down when you bring it through here and
you<00:04:53.590> screw<00:04:54.400> those<00:04:54.520> down<00:04:54.849> you'll<00:04:55.509> notice<00:04:56.759> there

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
you screw those down you'll notice there

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.120 
you screw those down you'll notice there
is<00:04:57.910> no<00:04:57.940> more<00:04:58.360> play<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:59.380> play<00:04:59.590> is<00:04:59.740> completely

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
is no more play the play is completely

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.689 
is no more play the play is completely
gone

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
gone

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.670 
gone
and<00:05:00.789> the<00:05:01.599> back<00:05:01.780> plate<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.110> is<00:05:02.889> tight<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:04.680> this

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
and the back plate is is tight so this

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.620 
and the back plate is is tight so this
was<00:05:05.889> the<00:05:06.099> other<00:05:06.220> question<00:05:06.430> that<00:05:06.759> a<00:05:07.300> lot<00:05:07.479> of

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
was the other question that a lot of

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.110 
was the other question that a lot of
people<00:05:07.960> seem<00:05:08.139> to<00:05:08.169> be<00:05:08.380> having<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:09.190> how<00:05:09.789> to<00:05:09.849> fix

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
people seem to be having and how to fix

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.689 
people seem to be having and how to fix
it<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.599> don't<00:05:11.020> understand<00:05:12.009> why<00:05:12.250> there's<00:05:12.520> so

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
it I don't understand why there's so

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.140 
it I don't understand why there's so
much<00:05:12.849> slop<00:05:13.180> but<00:05:14.159> evidently<00:05:15.159> Corsair<00:05:15.789> doesn't

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
much slop but evidently Corsair doesn't

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.460 
much slop but evidently Corsair doesn't
seem<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.479> think<00:05:16.509> that<00:05:16.690> there's<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:16.990> problem<00:05:17.229> but

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
seem to think that there's a problem but

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.670 
seem to think that there's a problem but
it<00:05:17.590> is<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:17.770> proven<00:05:18.220> fact<00:05:18.460> that<00:05:19.449> taking<00:05:20.169> up<00:05:20.530> the

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
it is a proven fact that taking up the

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.219 
it is a proven fact that taking up the
slack<00:05:20.949> and<00:05:21.479> running<00:05:22.479> a<00:05:22.539> test<00:05:22.750> before<00:05:23.199> and

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
slack and running a test before and

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:29.219 
slack and running a test before and
after<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:25.630> will<00:05:25.840> get<00:05:26.020> cooler<00:05:26.319> temps<00:05:28.229> so

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
after that you will get cooler temps so

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.550 
after that you will get cooler temps so
it's<00:05:29.740> it's<00:05:30.190> all<00:05:30.400> over<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.699> net<00:05:30.849> about<00:05:31.060> that

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
it's it's all over the net about that

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.520 
it's it's all over the net about that
another<00:05:32.560> thing<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:34.120> will<00:05:34.330> see<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:36.070> wide

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
another thing is you will see a wide

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.420 
another thing is you will see a wide
connector<00:05:38.530> for<00:05:39.190> your<00:05:39.340> fans<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:39.940> use<00:05:40.810> one<00:05:41.169> for<00:05:41.590> my

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
connector for your fans I use one for my

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.310 
connector for your fans I use one for my
to<00:05:42.490> upper<00:05:42.940> fans<00:05:43.240> that<00:05:43.330> are<00:05:43.419> with<00:05:43.539> a<00:05:43.570> 1/2<00:05:43.810> X<00:05:44.050> case

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
to upper fans that are with a 1/2 X case

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.649 
to upper fans that are with a 1/2 X case
and<00:05:45.210> also<00:05:46.210> use<00:05:46.509> the<00:05:46.750> splitter<00:05:47.759> for<00:05:48.759> the<00:05:48.969> fans

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659 
and also use the splitter for the fans

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.909 
and also use the splitter for the fans
that<00:05:49.750> came<00:05:49.930> with<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.400> h100<00:05:51.400> I<00:05:51.750> I<00:05:52.750> saw<00:05:53.440> one<00:05:53.710> guy

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
that came with the h100 I I saw one guy

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.339 
that came with the h100 I I saw one guy
on<00:05:54.159> YouTube<00:05:54.610> let<00:05:55.360> me<00:05:55.479> get<00:05:55.630> a<00:05:55.659> better<00:05:55.810> view<00:05:56.110> this

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
on YouTube let me get a better view this

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.189 
on YouTube let me get a better view this
you<00:05:57.219> can<00:05:57.370> see<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.699> the<00:05:58.690> 4<00:05:58.960> pin<00:05:59.169> connector

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
you can see the the 4 pin connector

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.159 
you can see the the 4 pin connector
there<00:05:59.940> couldn't<00:06:00.940> figure<00:06:01.120> out<00:06:01.270> how<00:06:01.659> to<00:06:01.690> plug<00:06:02.020> it

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
there couldn't figure out how to plug it

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.409 
there couldn't figure out how to plug it
in<00:06:02.319> because<00:06:02.590> this<00:06:03.430> is<00:06:03.639> what<00:06:03.819> he<00:06:03.969> was<00:06:04.120> looking

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
in because this is what he was looking

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.029 
in because this is what he was looking
at<00:06:04.539> was<00:06:04.780> this<00:06:04.990> you<00:06:05.590> know<00:06:05.620> black<00:06:07.080> pin<00:06:08.080> didn't

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
at was this you know black pin didn't

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.800 
at was this you know black pin didn't
realize<00:06:09.430> at<00:06:09.669> all<00:06:09.729> that<00:06:09.909> is<00:06:10.060> a<00:06:10.090> protective

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
realize at all that is a protective

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.320 
realize at all that is a protective
cover<00:06:11.050> for<00:06:11.319> the<00:06:11.469> pins<00:06:11.740> so<00:06:12.580> if<00:06:12.729> you<00:06:12.880> see<00:06:13.120> these

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
cover for the pins so if you see these

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.550 
cover for the pins so if you see these
you<00:06:13.960> gotta<00:06:14.169> pull<00:06:14.469> those<00:06:14.710> off<00:06:15.300> and<00:06:16.380> that's<00:06:17.380> what

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
you gotta pull those off and that's what

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.950 
you gotta pull those off and that's what
you'll<00:06:17.710> have<00:06:18.180> so<00:06:19.180> if<00:06:19.389> you<00:06:19.509> don't<00:06:19.659> pull<00:06:19.810> those

you'll have so if you don't pull those

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.330 
you'll have so if you don't pull those
off<00:06:20.110> you're<00:06:20.380> not<00:06:20.409> gonna<00:06:20.680> be<00:06:20.830> able<00:06:20.889> to<00:06:20.979> plug<00:06:21.190> it

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
so anyways just a test board when I was

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.379 
so anyways just a test board when I was
yanking<00:06:30.039> out<00:06:30.190> it's<00:06:30.370> got<00:06:30.520> a<00:06:30.550> processor<00:06:31.210> in

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
yanking out it's got a processor in

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.360 
yanking out it's got a processor in
there<00:06:32.340> you<00:06:33.340> know

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
there you know

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.909 
there you know
just<00:06:35.330> to<00:06:35.479> give<00:06:35.720> you<00:06:35.810> a<00:06:35.870> general<00:06:36.199> idea<00:06:36.290> how<00:06:36.710> I<00:06:36.740> do

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
just to give you a general idea how I do

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.510 
just to give you a general idea how I do
it<00:06:37.250> but<00:06:37.960> mounting<00:06:38.960> that<00:06:39.080> radiator<00:06:39.530> you<00:06:39.860> have

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
it but mounting that radiator you have

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.180 
it but mounting that radiator you have
to<00:06:40.669> remove<00:06:40.850> the<00:06:40.970> top<00:06:41.199> portion<00:06:42.199> of<00:06:42.290> the<00:06:42.470> half<00:06:42.949> x

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
to remove the top portion of the half x

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.170 
to remove the top portion of the half x
case<00:06:43.960> and<00:06:44.960> I<00:06:45.590> would<00:06:45.800> highly<00:06:46.160> recommend<00:06:46.190> having

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
case and I would highly recommend having

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.280 
case and I would highly recommend having
those<00:06:47.449> hoses<00:06:47.830> faced<00:06:48.970> towards<00:06:49.970> the<00:06:50.660> front<00:06:51.169> of

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
those hoses faced towards the front of

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.340 
those hoses faced towards the front of
your<00:06:51.440> half<00:06:52.100> x<00:06:52.340> case<00:06:52.610> when<00:06:53.389> you<00:06:53.540> do<00:06:53.720> install<00:06:53.930> it

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
your half x case when you do install it

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.460 
your half x case when you do install it
just<00:06:54.620> for<00:06:55.490> cosmetic<00:06:56.000> reasons<00:06:56.260> it<00:06:57.260> doesn't

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
just for cosmetic reasons it doesn't

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.170 
just for cosmetic reasons it doesn't
interfere<00:06:57.770> with<00:06:57.919> a<00:06:58.040> fan<00:06:58.280> back<00:06:58.550> here<00:06:58.820> if<00:06:58.940> you<00:06:59.030> do

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
interfere with a fan back here if you do

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.780 
interfere with a fan back here if you do
put<00:06:59.419> it<00:06:59.570> in<00:06:59.690> there<00:06:59.870> but<00:07:00.620> it<00:07:01.280> does<00:07:01.460> look<00:07:01.639> better

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790 
put it in there but it does look better

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.879 
put it in there but it does look better
this<00:07:02.060> way<00:07:02.300> might<00:07:03.050> be<00:07:03.080> a<00:07:03.260> little<00:07:03.380> bit<00:07:03.560> different

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:03.889 
this way might be a little bit different

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:05.469 
this way might be a little bit different
as<00:07:03.949> far<00:07:04.010> as<00:07:04.160> the<00:07:04.310> airflow<00:07:04.699> but<00:07:04.970> you<00:07:05.389> know

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 
as far as the airflow but you know

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:07.689 
as far as the airflow but you know
that's<00:07:05.660> the<00:07:05.840> way<00:07:05.930> I<00:07:05.960> have<00:07:06.290> it<00:07:06.500> so<00:07:07.430> anyways

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699

pretty quick I was just breaking it down

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.080 
pretty quick I was just breaking it down
gonna<00:07:13.550> build<00:07:13.789> another<00:07:13.850> system<00:07:14.419> pretty<00:07:14.630> soon

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
gonna build another system pretty soon

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.620 
gonna build another system pretty soon
so<00:07:17.090> there<00:07:17.840> you<00:07:17.990> go<00:07:18.139> that's<00:07:18.530> how<00:07:18.800> I<00:07:19.330> put<00:07:20.330> any

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
liquid cooled h100 I into a 1/2 X case

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.770 
liquid cooled h100 I into a 1/2 X case
hope<00:07:26.240> this<00:07:26.479> helps<00:07:26.810> you<00:07:26.870> good<00:07:27.590> luck
