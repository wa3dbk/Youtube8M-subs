00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to have more than less obviously so you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.320 
to have more than less obviously so you
still<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:12.080> tie<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.860> yarn<00:01:13.890> into<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> nut<00:01:15.030> in

the<00:01:17.850> dread<00:01:18.350> actually<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.770> like

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the dread actually I kind of like

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.670 
the dread actually I kind of like
stagger<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.270> side<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.509> longer<00:01:21.680> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
stagger it so one side is longer and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620 
stagger it so one side is longer and
then<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.799> don't<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.759> chopped

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
then you don't have this like chopped

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.050 
then you don't have this like chopped
bob<00:01:24.960> look<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.100> chopped<00:01:26.310> bob<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> your

band wood if you've done rubber band

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.050 
band wood if you've done rubber band
installs<00:06:54.140> all<00:06:54.650> you<00:06:54.860> do<00:06:55.010> is<00:06:55.130> simply<00:06:55.340> cut<00:06:55.760> the

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
installs all you do is simply cut the

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.490 
installs all you do is simply cut the
little<00:06:56.270> knot<00:06:56.480> that<00:06:56.690> you<00:06:56.810> made<00:06:56.990> with<00:06:57.140> the<00:06:57.260> yarn

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
little knot that you made with the yarn

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.560 
little knot that you made with the yarn
then<00:06:58.870> unravel<00:06:59.870> and<00:07:00.670> like<00:07:01.670> I<00:07:01.700> said<00:07:02.060> when<00:07:02.480> you

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
then unravel and like I said when you

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.960 
then unravel and like I said when you
take<00:07:02.750> it<00:07:02.900> out<00:07:03.020> you<00:07:03.260> know<00:07:03.440> your<00:07:04.070> hair<00:07:04.310> shouldn't

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:04.970

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
have very much tangles in it because

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.440 
have very much tangles in it because
it's<00:07:06.710> been<00:07:06.860> braided<00:07:07.100> and<00:07:07.490> covered<00:07:08.270> by<00:07:08.420> the

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.990 
it's been braided and covered by the
yarn<00:07:08.780> so<00:07:08.960> it's<00:07:09.080> been<00:07:09.200> protected<00:07:09.770> what<00:07:10.760> you'll
