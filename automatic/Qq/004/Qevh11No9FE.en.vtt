directly<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:16.090> i<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:17.680> put<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.070> hood<00:03:18.340> on

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
directly on i can put this hood on

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:27.900 
directly on i can put this hood on
record<00:03:19.180> outside<00:03:20.520> helps<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.910> lining<00:03:26.070> but<00:03:27.070> the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
record outside helps the lining but the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.610 
record outside helps the lining but the
camera<00:03:28.360> is<00:03:28.420> actually<00:03:28.570> great<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.290> reason<00:03:29.560> I

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
camera is actually great the reason I

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.480 
camera is actually great the reason I
bought<00:03:29.800> this<00:03:29.860> camera<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.790> because<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:32.490> wanted

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
bought this camera is because I wanted

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.860 
bought this camera is because I wanted
something<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:33.940> recorded<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:35.110> SD<00:03:36.070> in<00:03:36.870> this

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
something that recorded to SD in this

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.510 
something that recorded to SD in this
reports<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:40.180> sdhc<00:03:40.990> cards<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:44.620> also<00:03:44.800> has<00:03:45.190> a

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
reports to the sdhc cards it also has a

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.000 
reports to the sdhc cards it also has a
32<00:03:46.150> gigabyte<00:03:46.890> internal<00:03:47.890> hard<00:03:48.100> drive<00:03:50.010> which

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
32 gigabyte internal hard drive which

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.230 
32 gigabyte internal hard drive which
also<00:03:51.490> is<00:03:51.880> great<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:52.960> use<00:03:53.830> labs<00:03:54.040> report<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.940> the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
also is great and use labs report to the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.270 
also is great and use labs report to the
archive<00:03:55.750> and<00:03:55.990> then<00:03:56.080> dump<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.590> card<00:03:56.920> and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
archive and then dump it to the card and

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.010 
archive and then dump it to the card and
I<00:03:57.700> have<00:03:57.820> more<00:03:58.000> storage<00:03:58.270> space

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.500 

the<00:04:03.560> battery<00:04:04.100> that<00:04:04.250> comes<00:04:04.430> with<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.700> lasts

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
the battery that comes with it lasts

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.140 
the battery that comes with it lasts
about<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:10.010> always<00:04:10.160> says<00:04:10.430> it's<00:04:10.610> about<00:04:10.850> an<00:04:10.940> hour

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
about it always says it's about an hour

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.340 
about it always says it's about an hour
it's<00:04:11.630> actually<00:04:12.050> about<00:04:12.470> 30<00:04:13.010> minutes<00:04:14.350> fully

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
it's actually about 30 minutes fully

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.330 
it's actually about 30 minutes fully
charged<00:04:15.760> but<00:04:16.760> they<00:04:17.390> sell<00:04:17.810> batteries<00:04:18.350> like<00:04:18.950> the

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
charged but they sell batteries like the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.510 
charged but they sell batteries like the
extra<00:04:19.670> batteries<00:04:20.030> will<00:04:20.560> do<00:04:21.560> whatever<00:04:21.799> they're

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
extra batteries will do whatever they're

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.350 
extra batteries will do whatever they're
expensive<00:04:24.700> not<00:04:25.700> really<00:04:25.910> worth<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.210> for<00:04:26.330> me

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
expensive not really worth it for me

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.080 
expensive not really worth it for me
because<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.380> keep<00:04:27.950> it<00:04:28.130> plugged<00:04:28.340> in<00:04:28.610> most<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:29.030> the

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
because I keep it plugged in most of the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:41.730 
because I keep it plugged in most of the
time<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.330> use<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:29.990> battery<00:04:34.390> at<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.570> swiveling

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.220 

you<00:04:42.740> can<00:04:42.920> actually<00:04:43.490> do<00:04:43.730> editing<00:04:44.570> on<00:04:44.840> the

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
you can actually do editing on the

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.950 
you can actually do editing on the
camera<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.160> string<00:04:46.940> frames<00:04:47.270> together<00:04:47.570> and

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
camera and string frames together and

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.160 
camera and string frames together and
stuff<00:04:48.200> so<00:04:48.770> you<00:04:48.830> could<00:04:49.160> you<00:04:49.940> really<00:04:50.390> want<00:04:51.080> to

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
stuff so you could you really want to

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.930 
stuff so you could you really want to
sit<00:04:51.350> here<00:04:51.380> on<00:04:51.800> this<00:04:52.010> little<00:04:52.400> tiny<00:04:52.690> screen<00:04:54.940> see

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
sit here on this little tiny screen see

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.280 
sit here on this little tiny screen see
it's<00:04:56.210> got<00:04:56.480> push<00:04:57.320> buttons<00:04:57.800> here<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.960> you<00:05:00.110> can

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
it's got push buttons here and you can

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.360 
it's got push buttons here and you can
basically<00:05:01.270> edit<00:05:02.270> on<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.440> camera<00:05:03.920> but<00:05:06.370> much

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
basically edit on the camera but much

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.210 
basically edit on the camera but much
easier<00:05:07.960> just<00:05:08.960> dump<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.470> stuff<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:09.980> mac

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
easier just dump the stuff to the mac

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.720 
easier just dump the stuff to the mac
and<00:05:11.650> live<00:05:12.650> in<00:05:12.800> either<00:05:12.980> I<00:05:13.430> movie<00:05:13.910> or<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.360> could<00:05:15.110> go

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
and live in either I movie or I could go

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:23.230 
and live in either I movie or I could go
on<00:05:16.730> a<00:05:17.180> lot<00:05:17.930> easier<00:05:18.170> that<00:05:18.560> way<00:05:18.590> um<00:05:22.060> but<00:05:23.060> yeah

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
on a lot easier that way um but yeah

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.890 
on a lot easier that way um but yeah
this<00:05:23.420> is<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.690> camera<00:05:24.020> use<00:05:24.380> and<00:05:25.300> it's<00:05:26.300> a<00:05:26.390> great

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
this is the camera use and it's a great

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.100 
this is the camera use and it's a great
camera<00:05:27.230> for<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.590> money<00:05:31.630> that<00:05:32.630> really<00:05:32.930> that

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
camera for the money that really that

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.220 
camera for the money that really that
much<00:05:33.350> considering<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.760> quality<00:05:35.120> is<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:36.020> only

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
much considering the quality is the only

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.040 
much considering the quality is the only
thing<00:05:36.410> about<00:05:36.590> these<00:05:36.800> cameras<00:05:37.460> in<00:05:37.780> any<00:05:38.780> of<00:05:38.960> the

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
thing about these cameras in any of the

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.320 
thing about these cameras in any of the
cameras<00:05:39.410> that<00:05:39.710> I<00:05:39.740> found<00:05:40.160> so<00:05:40.340> far<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.790> report

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
cameras that I found so far that report

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.760 
cameras that I found so far that report
to<00:05:41.510> SD<00:05:42.260> is<00:05:43.270> they<00:05:44.270> don't<00:05:44.570> really<00:05:44.840> work<00:05:45.110> well<00:05:45.470> in

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
to SD is they don't really work well in

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:57.070 
to SD is they don't really work well in
low<00:05:46.070> light<00:05:46.310> situations<00:05:48.669> that's<00:05:49.669> why<00:05:49.970> I<00:05:55.660> had<00:05:56.660> to

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
low light situations that's why I had to

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.840 
low light situations that's why I had to
learn<00:05:57.260> a<00:05:57.620> lot<00:05:57.770> and<00:05:58.340> I'm<00:05:58.550> still<00:05:58.790> learning<00:05:59.080> about

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
learn a lot and I'm still learning about

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.890 
learn a lot and I'm still learning about
lighting<00:06:01.850> and<00:06:03.850> stuff<00:06:04.850> because<00:06:05.120> this<00:06:05.450> camera

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
lighting and stuff because this camera

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.279 
lighting and stuff because this camera
doesn't<00:06:06.230> really<00:06:06.410> work<00:06:07.000> great<00:06:08.000> all

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
doesn't really work great all

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.959 
doesn't really work great all
the<00:06:10.129> less<00:06:10.669> light<00:06:10.939> has<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:11.749> worst<00:06:12.020> picture<00:06:12.770> was

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
the less light has the worst picture was

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:18.639 
the less light has the worst picture was
um<00:06:13.969> I<00:06:15.789> really<00:06:16.789> couldn't<00:06:17.089> afford<00:06:17.499> you<00:06:18.499> know<00:06:18.589> to

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:18.649 
um I really couldn't afford you know to

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:24.869 
um I really couldn't afford you know to
