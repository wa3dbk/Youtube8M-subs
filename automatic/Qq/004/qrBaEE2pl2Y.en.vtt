00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.180
 with another new video of how to get 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.700
 beds being an account let's start for 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.700
 mainly the monkey account is 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.149
 difficult we approach you since you only have 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.250
 a character and the drop because I do not know that 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.079
 have some nutro will cost you a 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.329
 little but I'm going to tell you some tricks 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.760
 being any character taking a 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.410
 good amount of how we put ourselves as 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.540
 we have to start in two and we're 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.210
 trying to make our first set 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.680
 either a peak press set or just 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.690
 we want to earn a quantity of beds 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.590
 to be calm for our next 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.240
 bonus the first zone 2 I recommend if there 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.640
 what level are you for example that 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.470
 we are between level 1 and level 50 os 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.820
 I recommend coming here steiner or the 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.970
 cradle a little bit above the star 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.550
 outside the dungeon pulls everything 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.920
 we can fight against latin is white 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.110
 halal tim is black I wish all heads of 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.060
 war are combats that aside from if 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.530
 we are between level 1 and 50 are going to 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.990
 provide a good amount of 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.000
 experience also all the drop that 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.130
 we get out of here it's very commercial since 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.620
 almost all the resources that we are 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.480
 from this area 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.180
 they are sold like hot bread very fast 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.100
 now we go to the flea market for 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.160
 example and let's look at the prices that 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.560
 we have to provide us with the drone of 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.230
 this area that would be the leathers of 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.790
 hannah team white hopefully team black the 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.430
 more expensive are the leathers leave Latin 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.670
 white here we're going to look at prices that 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.180
 leaves us white latin 100 leathers 175 thousand 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.160
 beds leaves latin black 160 thousand let's go 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.430
 I just tell you that a hundred will leave us in 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.500
 white do us in less than half an hour 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.370
 three quarters of an hour as long 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.530
 100 white garden leathers 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.990
 black garden more of the same let them 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.610
 the cough and that are not worth much remains is 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.010
 better thrown to the ground because they occupy 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.229
 bots but we do not have two leathers 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.260
 we also have the great let it all leave 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.850
 Latin black and white and those of the head of 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.170
 jabato war these are the most 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.910
 faces 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.310
 we also find other resources like 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.130
 for example the drool let it you what good 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.950
 something is worth it and the horns that are not very 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.230
 expensive but we can also get to 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.430
 put to sell being good story 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.500
 I also recommend that you get 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.090
 the odd job I for example 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.780
 when I started, the peasant catches me 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.330
 baker since you can make your loaves 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.739
 so you do not have to spend buying them 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.739
 since they are a little expensive 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.500
 the oils that I recommend if you are 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.480
 an account is a peasant baker and 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.020
 when you have level 100 or subis 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.910
 alchemist 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.100
 question the baker farmer has 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.530
 logic but quimistán because alchemists 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.480
 and we also do not see how to make money with 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.600
 so look with the new update 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.570
 they have taken out that fences 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.000
 the collectors can not be 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.010
 put paying thousand 100 thousand 200 beds 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.390
 Now you have to buy a potion 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.610
 which can only make an alchemist 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.560
 level 100 that potion values ​​with a 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.330
 good amount of beds now let's 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.820
 see the price and resources that 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.490
 We need to do it as we can 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.670
 see a potion of these ballet about 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.730
 the 30 thousand beds the 10 300 thousand and the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.980
 It has about 3 million 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.900
 We put these resources to ask us 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.849
 they are too easy from european or 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.360
 simply buying at the flea market 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.350
 and we keep winning and everything to see these 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.870
 resources 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.120
 to put it like that I think that all the 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.760
 world has these resources in the bank and 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.920
 that nothing more than take advantage of them for 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.140
 make these potions and precious ice a 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.580
 potion of 30 thousand beds to make a 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.370
 potion of resources that you have in the 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.440
 bank or eat them at the market is 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.390
 a good source of income being a 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.120
 mono story is going to make you a little 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.070
 a little hard to make good beds 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.680
 in this video I will also teach you 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.660
 another area where you can get beds 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.730
 being mono account 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.530
 that area is the cemetery of the 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.990
 tortured but who are called who is 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.560
 bratman's right now I'm going to 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.310
 teach where exactly is 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.520
 is here this area here in front of 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.610
 tortured that sending ghosts 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.280
 that is called ghost appetizer expert 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.950
 they give us the family relics and those 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.780
 relics have us a threshold of 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.730
 pretty high protection that is 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.460
 putting us a turquoise payment but not 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.250
 we are an other we will take them out yes or yes 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.150
 let's look at prices the ethics of 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.580
 150000 family about ten o'clock 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.590
 close to half a million beds are 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.940
 Relics are very commercial because the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.450
 people buy them in large quantities 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.970
 to make his trophies basically 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.800
 because it 's the only thing they serve worth with 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.750
 these relics 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.480
 it will cost us more to find them 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.370
 European maps not the 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.370
 because you see these ghosts 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.449
 to see it costs enough to find 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.580
 that in that area we find schaeffer's 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:18.740
 we found vampires and another kind of 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.250
 bugs but I think that if you put 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.009
 you alone with about 200 250 of 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.169
 prospecting more or less in an hour os 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.030
 I say that you can take between 10 and 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.330
 about 20 relics that would come 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.380
 one million cameras or less in an hour 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.110
 I think it makes up for it 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.930
 ok in this video I will not give more 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.980
 tips and in the next video I'll do 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.010
 another guide where some achievements or guides 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.020
 for multi accounts as is my case 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.330
 and other ways of winning camos I hope that
