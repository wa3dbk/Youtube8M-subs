00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello to all the friends it's captain 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.770
 flam I hope you're fine with me 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.480
 is going great we find ourselves for the quest of the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.460
 two son Emerald finally so I 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.839
 take over I managed to sell some 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.670
 companions so I have a little less 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.619
 I sold a number and lumino so I 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.029
 I'm done 5 million cases ma with 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.550
 I could buy 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.050
 the ends all the fragments plus the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.090
 smeared pebbles since we did both 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.769
 poles with jack 6 and so here I have my 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.079
 five pieces of checks plus the guy 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.790
 the smokes and then we left for 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.739
 which I believe we were on the quest 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.280
 twenty-one 20 or 21 something like 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.930
 and we had to go bring back those famous 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 fragments so dropped not going 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.940
 accustomed to the new card one has to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.579
 go down there we will go through 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.289
 the swamp and we will going to bring me 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.820
 fragments are already doing kraft and the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:01.440
 fragments so the fragments are either 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.480
 drop to bhl on the on the bandits of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.220
 cagnes so I showed you quickly 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:14.520
 the areas to try the bestiary so he 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.140
 it did and now das das and the party disorder 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.030
 I showed you quickly the area so 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.540
 it can appear in any 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.280
 combat this area so so the area 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:32.440
 full of cagnes then there is named 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.120
 poc who is here the cra potter 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.430
 he appears to him in the plains 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.450
 rocky and a little bit in the plain 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.160
 of cagnes so it may appear that 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.720
 in these cases so now that the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.550
 quest has already come out since a small 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.690
 moment 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.670
 they finally appear I mean 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.600
 it's less complicated to find them than 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.030
 in the beginning is so here he stays still and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.040
 so miss the iop miss them their 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 claimants who appears to him either 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.060
 in the lakes around the lake of cagnes to 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.680
 in the massif de cagnes 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.810
 it's really all around the plains 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.290
 canes is really a big enough 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.700
 area and it's enough that you do the 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.980
 maps you will fall on to a 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.970
 moment or another 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.090
 I personally chose 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.710
 to buy the fragments because and 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.720
 they have eleven thousand pv as you have it 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.280
 seen and they make really bad so must 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.390
 really be to many to succeed at 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:30.020
 do them and it's not always easy 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.700
 golden then we will try to redo the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.470
 the maze since it really does 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.140
 a long time I have not played back I do 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.630
 you really vouge resumed yesterday 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.270
 on a whim with jaxx I say to myself 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.250
 come on come if you want I'm going with my 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.550
 the balloon will be redone it will be cool 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.140
 and all that good I hope it's okay 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.510
 to happen in any case I hope you 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.750
 are glad that I resume after the 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.450
 name of mp2 message that I was asked 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.980
 to continue this quest of 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.990
 dofus semrau I said good to myself 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.230
 that's what they want to see then 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.340
 of honor we never see the means in 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.570
 place to relax your needs thank you 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.400
 were not there it's a bit of a mess 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.520
 I do not remember the path at all 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.260
 I guess it's here but I'm 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.500
 not very sure it's possible it's by 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.540
 right here 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.890
 this just right just that's it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.000
 so once you have your five 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.100
 fragments of each plus the three guys 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.019
 the smokes once we are here in 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.040
 the house of my rihanna we can click 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.709

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.959
 and here we will be able to kraft and the famous 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.100
 fragments and once wanted kraft 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.500
 so is in fact everybody 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.850
 they are actually in the tab of 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.209
 resources but once you have them 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.400
 kraft and it goes into quest items 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.080
 so if you want to resell them or what 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.209
 you really need to be sure that you are going 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.890

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.500
