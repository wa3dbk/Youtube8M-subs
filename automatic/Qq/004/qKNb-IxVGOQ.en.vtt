you're having a really good game now
obviously<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.890> gameplays<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.369> screen<00:01:50.670> kind

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
obviously the gameplays on screen kind

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.520 
obviously the gameplays on screen kind
of<00:01:50.970> throw<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.270> off<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.930> SWAT<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
of throw that off because it's SWAT and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.800 
of throw that off because it's SWAT and
these<00:01:52.979> are<00:01:53.130> really<00:01:53.670> high<00:01:53.790> scoring<00:01:54.180> SWAT<00:01:54.509> games

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
these are really high scoring SWAT games

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.170 
these are really high scoring SWAT games
but<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.649> what's<00:01:55.799> kind<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.399> don't<00:01:56.909> know<00:01:57.030> I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
but so what's kind of I don't know I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
but so what's kind of I don't know I
like<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.350> put<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
like it I like that they put it in the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.590 
like it I like that they put it in the
playlist<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.700> want<00:01:59.880> Team<00:02:00.119> doubles<00:02:00.509> I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
playlist I really want Team doubles I

and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.409> FFA<00:02:05.009> because

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
and then I really would like FFA because

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.550 
and then I really would like FFA because
regicide<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.000> good<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:06.869> FFA

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
regicide is good but it just is not FFA

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.309 
regicide is good but it just is not FFA

there's<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> point<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:27.060> there's<00:02:27.299> a<00:02:27.359> point<00:02:27.629> B<00:02:27.780> how

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
there's a point a there's a point B how

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.479 
there's a point a there's a point B how
do<00:02:28.079> I<00:02:28.170> get<00:02:28.319> from<00:02:28.590> point<00:02:28.680> A<00:02:28.859> to<00:02:28.890> point<00:02:29.010> B<00:02:29.250> as

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
do I get from point A to point B as

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.880 
do I get from point A to point B as
quickly<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.329> I<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:31.379> let's<00:02:31.500> talk<00:02:31.590> about<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
quickly as I can so let's talk about the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.199 
quickly as I can so let's talk about the
importance<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.370> jumping<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.879> learning<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
importance of jumping and learning the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.270 
importance of jumping and learning the
different<00:02:33.480> jump<00:02:33.689> routes<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.290> map<00:02:34.829> so<00:02:35.250> let's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
different jump routes on a map so let's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.589 
different jump routes on a map so let's
look<00:02:35.549> at<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.700> drift<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:36.209> you're<00:02:36.299> trying<00:02:36.569> to

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
look at a drift if you're trying to

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.569 
look at a drift if you're trying to
capture<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.140> flag<00:02:37.409> on<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> drift<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.250> need<00:02:38.430> to

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
capture the flag on a drift you need to

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.399 
capture the flag on a drift you need to
know<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:39.090> three<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.629> four<00:02:39.840> different<00:02:40.019> routes

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
know like three or four different routes

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.289 
know like three or four different routes
to<00:02:40.560> take<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:41.010> flag<00:02:41.280> back<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.579> their<00:02:41.879> base<00:02:42.090> and

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
to take that flag back to their base and

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.089 
to take that flag back to their base and
the<00:02:42.689> only<00:02:42.810> way<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.290> do<00:02:43.439> that<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.799> usually

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
the only way you can do that is usually

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.399 
the only way you can do that is usually
by<00:02:44.400> jumping<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.299> get<00:02:45.540> very<00:02:45.780> familiar<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
by jumping so get very familiar with the

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.990 
by jumping so get very familiar with the
maps<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.799> fact<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.220> warm<00:02:47.430> up<00:02:47.609> it's<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.819> great

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
maps in fact to warm up it's a great

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.789 
maps in fact to warm up it's a great
idea<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.299> go<00:02:48.480> into<00:02:48.689> custom<00:02:49.019> games<00:02:49.230> into<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
idea to go into custom games into the

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.190 
idea to go into custom games into the
map<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.129> by<00:02:50.430> yourself<00:02:50.909> run<00:02:51.450> around<00:02:51.569> look<00:02:52.019> for

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
map just by yourself run around look for

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.069 
map just by yourself run around look for
new<00:02:52.349> drums<00:02:52.680> jumps<00:02:53.280> try<00:02:53.760> new<00:02:54.000> routes<00:02:54.239> out<00:02:54.510> it's

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
new drums jumps try new routes out it's

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.110 
new drums jumps try new routes out it's
your<00:02:55.379> chance<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:56.010> these<00:02:56.129> first<00:02:56.400> weeks<00:02:56.790> two

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
your chance in these first weeks two

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.940 
your chance in these first weeks two
months<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.720> game<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.379> learn<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.799> better

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
months of the game to learn it better

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.050 
months of the game to learn it better
than<00:02:59.250> those<00:02:59.430> who<00:02:59.639> don't

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
than those who don't

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.819 
than those who don't
so<00:03:00.359> just<00:03:00.599> by<00:03:00.750> going<00:03:01.079> in<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.439> hitting<00:03:01.620> those

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
so just by going in and hitting those

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.679 
so just by going in and hitting those
jumps<00:03:02.189> you're<00:03:02.370> already<00:03:02.549> taking<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:03.000> big<00:03:03.269> step

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
jumps you're already taking a big step

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.449 
jumps you're already taking a big step
to<00:03:04.019> give<00:03:04.169> yourself<00:03:04.500> an<00:03:04.620> advantage<00:03:04.739> over<00:03:05.189> those

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
to give yourself an advantage over those

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.069 
to give yourself an advantage over those
who<00:03:05.879> don't<00:03:06.180> know<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.510> maps<00:03:06.689> who<00:03:06.870> don't
