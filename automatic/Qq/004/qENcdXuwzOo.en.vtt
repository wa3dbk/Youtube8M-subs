is 3/4 inch you can see I cut a/c into
it<00:00:21.399> and<00:00:21.610> I<00:00:22.210> was<00:00:22.390> careful<00:00:22.840> to<00:00:22.869> cut<00:00:23.259> the<00:00:23.380> edges

flat<00:00:24.160> at<00:00:24.579> an<00:00:25.360> angle<00:00:25.750> so<00:00:26.410> that<00:00:26.619> they<00:00:26.860> sit<00:00:27.430> flat

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669

on<00:00:27.849> the<00:00:27.970> tubing<00:00:28.360> when<00:00:28.480> it<00:00:28.570> gets<00:00:28.750> clamped<00:00:29.020> on

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
on the tubing when it gets clamped on

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.639

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
a planet bike taillight other than just

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.139 
a planet bike taillight other than just
cutting<00:00:38.230> a/c<00:00:38.620> out<00:00:38.800> of<00:00:38.949> it<00:00:39.039> like<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.339> PVC<00:00:39.910> I

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149

the two zip ties run it around cinch it

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.460 
the two zip ties run it around cinch it
up<00:01:50.610> make<00:01:51.610> sure<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:52.030> your<00:01:52.180> light<00:01:52.360> is<00:01:52.570> facing

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
up make sure that your light is facing

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.380 
up make sure that your light is facing
straight<00:01:53.830> off<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.220> back<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.460> can<00:01:54.880> plug<00:01:55.120> it<00:01:55.270> in

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
straight off the back you can plug it in

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.480 
straight off the back you can plug it in
and<00:01:55.570> check<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:55.810> it's<00:01:56.470> gonna<00:01:56.590> be<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:56.830> wide<00:01:57.160> range

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
and check it it's gonna be a wide range

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.830 
and check it it's gonna be a wide range
of<00:01:57.730> motion<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:58.870> any<00:01:59.260> seat<00:01:59.740> tube<00:02:00.010> angle

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
of motion so any seat tube angle

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.460 
of motion so any seat tube angle
shouldn't<00:02:01.840> be<00:02:01.930> a<00:02:01.960> problem

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
shouldn't be a problem

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.700 
shouldn't be a problem
Center<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.460> up<00:02:03.720> since<00:02:04.720> your<00:02:04.870> zip<00:02:05.080> ties<00:02:05.290> up<00:02:05.560> as

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
Center it up since your zip ties up as

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.450 
Center it up since your zip ties up as
tight<00:02:05.920> as<00:02:06.070> they'll<00:02:06.250> go

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
tight as they'll go

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.240 
tight as they'll go
and<00:02:06.730> when<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:07.690> get<00:02:07.840> those<00:02:08.019> tight<00:02:08.379> take<00:02:09.190> a

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and when you get those tight take a

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.420 
and when you get those tight take a
razor<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.879> cut<00:02:10.569> your<00:02:10.950> excess<00:02:11.950> off<00:02:12.189> flush<00:02:12.609> and

I<00:02:37.319> had<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.799> small<00:02:38.010> piece<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.430> PVC<00:02:39.109> underneath

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
I had a small piece of PVC underneath

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.210 
I had a small piece of PVC underneath
just<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:41.250> mount<00:02:41.459> here<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.030> cinched<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.930> with

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
just the mount here and cinched it with

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.020 
just the mount here and cinched it with
one<00:02:44.220> zip<00:02:44.519> tie<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.900> mount<00:02:46.609> went<00:02:47.609> back<00:02:47.819> and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
one zip tie and the mount went back and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.699 
one zip tie and the mount went back and
forth<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.510> side<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.780> side<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.290> wasn't<00:02:49.560> very

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
forth and side to side it wasn't very

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.789 
forth and side to side it wasn't very
stable<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.819> just<00:02:51.090> widened<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.629> base<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
stable so I just widened the base of the

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.399 
stable so I just widened the base of the
PVC<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> little<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:53.909> added<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> extra<00:02:55.170> zip

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
PVC a little bit added the extra zip

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.710 
PVC a little bit added the extra zip
ties<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.069> now<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.819> doesn't<00:02:56.970> go<00:02:57.209> up<00:02:57.389> and<00:02:57.569> down

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
ties and now it doesn't go up and down

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.500 
ties and now it doesn't go up and down
and<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.139> doesn't<00:02:58.500> go<00:02:58.620> side<00:02:58.859> to<00:02:58.889> side<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.519> all

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
and it doesn't go side to side at all

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.280 
and it doesn't go side to side at all
actually

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
