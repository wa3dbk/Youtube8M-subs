00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.470 

yeah<00:00:45.870> there's<00:00:46.870> my<00:00:46.989> rig<00:00:47.200> you<00:00:47.559> know<00:00:47.710> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
yeah there's my rig you know that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.380 
yeah there's my rig you know that
fucking<00:00:51.600> fucking<00:00:52.600> fuck<00:00:52.899> fuck

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.430 

so<00:00:58.040> we<00:00:59.040> just<00:00:59.280> flashed<00:00:59.670> his<00:00:59.910> bias<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
so we just flashed his bias because the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.040 
so we just flashed his bias because the
multiplier<00:01:02.010> was<00:01:02.190> locked<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.730> 20<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.809> we

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
multiplier was locked at 20 and we

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.640 
multiplier was locked at 20 and we
needed<00:01:04.290> 21<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.290> CPU<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:09.229> 4.1<00:01:10.229> gigahertz

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
needed 21 so the CPU is at 4.1 gigahertz

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.330 
needed 21 so the CPU is at 4.1 gigahertz
as<00:01:11.210> we<00:01:12.210> speak<00:01:12.920> with<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:13.950> point<00:01:14.400> 28<00:01:15.030> volts<00:01:17.900> no

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340

you fucking asshole no but yeah my cpu
spins<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.640> bit<00:04:18.820> faster<00:04:19.329> so<00:04:19.510> in<00:04:19.989> 58<00:04:20.560> seventh<00:04:20.890> and

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
spins a bit faster so in 58 seventh and

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.600 
spins a bit faster so in 58 seventh and
then<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.760> 95<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.360> really<00:04:22.720> close<00:04:22.930> in<00:04:23.610> GPU

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
then to 95 is really close in GPU

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.920 
then to 95 is really close in GPU
performance<00:04:24.910> so<00:04:25.840> that's<00:04:26.320> nice<00:04:26.610> but<00:04:27.660> yeah<00:04:28.660> I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930
