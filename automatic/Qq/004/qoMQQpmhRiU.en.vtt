 quebec have a story to tell 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.810
 this one took a little bit of reading a 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.140
 little this whole story lyon we get 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.700
 plunges back into the past 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.020
 it's a fantastic place actually 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.400
 even when we travel on the planet in 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.620
 time we realize how much the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.510
 Old Quebec is a unique place 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.660
 world a beautiful place a place 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.640
 living a long historic district all 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.750
 has begun 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.390
 it is the cradle of the new France 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.610
 this is the cradle an optimization here and 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.979
 then that this neighborhood managed to keep 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.860
 his soul to the movie this time for me it's 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.510
 a 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 a great pride and a great 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.340
 responsibility too 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.340
 comedy 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.869
 one of the main challenges of the city of 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.390
 québec is to reconcile the vocation 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.369
 residential of old Quebec is the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.610
 vocation of tourism development 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.720
 these are conflicting needs of a 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 side as the other because of a 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.049
 side we were citizens who chose the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.970
 old Quebec because they do not like the 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.079
 karting are also home 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.020
 citizens who need peace of mind 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.979
 also and on the other side we have 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.270
 tourists who want well in the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.829
 québec because what is done in a neighborhood 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.830
 animated when events or 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:57.799
 animation so we have to reconcile that 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:01.060
 it's not always easy the life of 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.220
 québec that really real will 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.780
 deep desire to improve the quality of 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.450
 citizens' lives to bring back the favored 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.530
 however the quebec or steam then we have 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.849
 set up last year in 2012 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.500
 of a round table that came 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.790
 just about everyone involved 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.069
 old-quebec august in ten points people 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.680
 business institutions school 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.570
 the hospital everyone together we have 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.489
 put your finger on this deserving point and 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.140
 we especially thought to prefer to 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.090
 find solutions to these irritants there 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.060
 who have so much at the housing level that 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.800
 circulation then commercial of the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.480
 balance between events and the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.370
 quality of life of citizens we have 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.310
 really found ways to facilitate 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.360
 everybody's life and then we're going 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.190
 keep working because that's 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.989
 a land of permanent consultation and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.069
 the goal is to consolidate 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.230
 residential function of the neighborhood 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.890
 of espionage in Quebec is 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.299
 also to ensure commercial vitality 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.220
 old Quebec to protect the 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.959
 heritage and it's very interesting 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.069
 exchanges that brings us to the concrete 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.349
 the old quebec is alive the goal of 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.760
 keep alive forever or 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.910
 does it have to be a neighborhood 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.260
 inhabited by two points rugby by 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.120
 traders who are doing great business 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.120
