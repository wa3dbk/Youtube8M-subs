00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the good old times so let's begin the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.810 
the good old times so let's begin the
game<00:00:43.260> looks<00:00:43.739> very<00:00:43.980> different<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.550> first

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
game looks very different at first

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.060 
game looks very different at first
compared<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.510> other<00:00:45.750> games<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.590> I'm<00:00:46.920> sure

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
compared to the other games and I'm sure

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
compared to the other games and I'm sure
it<00:00:47.219> also<00:00:47.460> looks<00:00:47.640> very<00:00:47.850> simple<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it also looks very simple but it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.590 
it also looks very simple but it
actually<00:00:48.840> has<00:00:49.200> many<00:00:49.530> aspects<00:00:50.100> i<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:51.390> call

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
actually has many aspects i would call

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.319 
actually has many aspects i would call
with<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> strategy<00:00:52.680> physics<00:00:53.160> puzzle<00:00:53.579> game<00:00:53.789> with

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
with a strategy physics puzzle game with

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.819 
with a strategy physics puzzle game with
elements<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.930> rpgs<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:57.030> mixing<00:00:57.449> date

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
elements of rpgs a very good mixing date

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.099 
elements of rpgs a very good mixing date
so<00:00:58.829> what's<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.340> story<00:00:59.399> line<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.300> mysterious

land<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.189> i<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.520> show<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.759> how<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.210> works<00:01:45.240> how

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
land so i can show you how it works how

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800 
land so i can show you how it works how
it<00:01:46.920> works<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.759> need<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> use<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.329> power<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it works you need to use the power of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.780 
it works you need to use the power of
physics<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.470> angles<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.159> make<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:50.520> hero

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
an enemy it deals damage you can check

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.800 
an enemy it deals damage you can check
the<00:01:56.399> attack<00:01:56.640> power<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.240> hero<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.659> his

you notice that we use some energy in
order<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:23.130> start<00:03:23.400> at<00:03:23.579> pero<00:03:23.850> that's<00:03:24.660> very

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019
