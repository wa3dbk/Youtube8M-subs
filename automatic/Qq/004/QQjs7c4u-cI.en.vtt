the<00:01:05.250> last<00:01:05.430> year's<00:01:05.960> model<00:01:06.960> now<00:01:07.460> this<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> SE

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the last year's model now this is the SE

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.240 
the last year's model now this is the SE
okay<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> step<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:10.860> above<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
okay so this is the step right above the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.370 
okay so this is the step right above the
S<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.729> there's<00:01:12.270> an<00:01:12.420> S<00:01:12.570> width<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.020> believe<00:01:13.260> it's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
S and there's an S width I believe it's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980 
S and there's an S width I believe it's
technology<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.180> comes<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.840> at

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
technology so this one comes in at

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.710 
technology so this one comes in at
20,000<00:01:16.770> 915<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.360> there<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.570> no

since<00:01:44.630> 2010<00:01:45.630> alright<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.890> freshen

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
since 2010 alright so they just freshen

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.859 
since 2010 alright so they just freshen
them<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> bit<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:48.299> front<00:01:48.570> you're<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
them a bit up front you're going to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.120 
them a bit up front you're going to
notice<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.259> new<00:01:49.439> bumper<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.070> Grille<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.540> lower

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
notice a new bumper and Grille the lower

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.080 
notice a new bumper and Grille the lower
I<00:01:53.159> guess<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:53.909> lower<00:01:54.090> valence<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:55.940> gives<00:01:56.940> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
I guess the lower valence there gives it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.899 
I guess the lower valence there gives it
a<00:01:57.180> more<00:01:57.360> wider<00:01:58.040> appearance<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.820> the
