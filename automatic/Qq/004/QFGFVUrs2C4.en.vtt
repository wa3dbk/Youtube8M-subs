00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.900 

think<00:06:00.530> it's<00:06:00.830> quite<00:06:00.980> interesting<00:06:01.400> having

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
think it's quite interesting having

think it's quite interesting having
watched<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.690> previous<00:06:03.080> tears<00:06:03.680> also<00:06:03.980> that<00:06:04.490> now

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
watched the previous tears also that now

watched the previous tears also that now
when<00:06:05.240> they're<00:06:05.390> trying<00:06:05.660> to<00:06:05.720> do<00:06:05.900> these

difficult transitions in the lists it is

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.130 
difficult transitions in the lists it is
looking<00:06:09.650> pretty<00:06:10.630> should<00:06:11.630> we<00:06:11.690> say<00:06:11.840> there<00:06:11.990> isn't

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
looking pretty should we say there isn't

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.110 
looking pretty should we say there isn't
really<00:06:12.470> much<00:06:12.590> flow<00:06:12.950> from<00:06:13.310> one<00:06:13.550> position<00:06:13.760> to

really much flow from one position to
the<00:06:14.150> next<00:06:14.570> it<00:06:14.690> is<00:06:14.780> becoming<00:06:15.140> increasingly

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
the next it is becoming increasingly

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.590

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
difficult for them to change position

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.020

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
list as you can see there was a little

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.010 
list as you can see there was a little

that their treble twist at the start of
the<00:06:28.100> program<00:06:28.280> looking<00:06:28.730> to<00:06:28.910> increase<00:06:29.540> the

the program looking to increase the
level<00:06:29.960> of<00:06:30.020> difficulty<00:06:30.500> here's<00:06:30.920> the<00:06:31.190> throw

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
level of difficulty here's the throw

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.120 
level of difficulty here's the throw
triple<00:06:31.850> salchow<00:06:32.000> loads<00:06:32.630> of<00:06:32.750> height

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.940 

so<00:06:36.670> it<00:06:36.760> wasn't<00:06:36.910> check<00:06:37.450> early<00:06:37.750> enough<00:06:37.870> yeah<00:06:38.590> why

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
so it wasn't check early enough yeah why

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.200 
so it wasn't check early enough yeah why
it's<00:06:39.100> very<00:06:39.370> difficult<00:06:39.760> when<00:06:39.910> a<00:06:39.970> man's

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
it's very difficult when a man's

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.490 
it's very difficult when a man's
throwing<00:06:40.630> you<00:06:40.750> across<00:06:43.170> you<00:06:44.170> tell<00:06:44.380> me

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
throwing you across you tell me

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.900 
throwing you across you tell me
strangely<00:06:44.980> I<00:06:45.100> haven't<00:06:45.520> either

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
strangely I haven't either

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.880 
strangely I haven't either
but<00:06:46.240> you<00:06:46.450> know<00:06:46.570> I<00:06:46.600> can<00:06:46.840> imagine<00:06:47.050> that<00:06:47.440> actually

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
but you know I can imagine that actually

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.380 
but you know I can imagine that actually
you<00:06:47.980> know<00:06:48.100> for<00:06:48.310> somebody<00:06:48.580> to<00:06:48.760> throw<00:06:48.790> you<00:06:49.060> the

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
you know for somebody to throw you the

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.030 
you know for somebody to throw you the
momentum<00:06:49.990> must<00:06:50.170> be<00:06:50.320> very<00:06:50.530> difficult<00:06:50.740> to

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
momentum must be very difficult to

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.160 
momentum must be very difficult to
control<00:06:51.250> and<00:06:51.820> I<00:06:52.090> know<00:06:52.150> they<00:06:52.510> work<00:06:52.690> on<00:06:52.930> it<00:06:52.960> on<00:06:53.110> a

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
control and I know they work on it on a

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.020 
control and I know they work on it on a
daily<00:06:53.380> basis<00:06:53.890> but<00:06:54.010> yeah<00:06:54.190> you<00:06:54.250> have<00:06:54.520> to<00:06:54.550> be<00:06:54.670> very

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
daily basis but yeah you have to be very

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.330 
daily basis but yeah you have to be very
strong<00:06:55.420> in<00:06:55.450> that<00:06:55.630> check<00:06:56.020> and<00:06:56.050> the<00:06:56.320> landing<00:06:56.680> and

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
strong in that check and the landing and

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.190 
strong in that check and the landing and
make<00:06:57.610> sure<00:06:57.820> you<00:06:58.000> really<00:06:58.390> keep<00:06:58.570> that<00:06:58.750> left<00:06:58.990> side

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
make sure you really keep that left side

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.010 
make sure you really keep that left side
in<00:06:59.380> front<00:06:59.610> she<00:07:00.610> did<00:07:01.150> pretty<00:07:01.360> well<00:07:01.450> there

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
in front she did pretty well there

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.620 
in front she did pretty well there
and<00:07:02.710> as<00:07:03.190> the<00:07:03.340> transition<00:07:03.970> in<00:07:04.180> one<00:07:04.360> of<00:07:04.480> those

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
and as the transition in one of those

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.530 
and as the transition in one of those
difficult<00:07:04.960> lifts<00:07:05.590> as<00:07:06.160> they<00:07:06.280> had<00:07:06.490> in<00:07:06.520> the<00:07:06.940> short

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
difficult lifts as they had in the short

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.020 
difficult lifts as they had in the short
program<00:07:07.690> some<00:07:08.200> quite<00:07:08.800> showy<00:07:09.220> elements<00:07:09.850> almost

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
program some quite showy elements almost

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.870 
program some quite showy elements almost
Adagio<00:07:10.840> type<00:07:11.200> approach<00:07:11.590> to<00:07:11.800> things<00:07:12.010> and<00:07:12.670> it<00:07:12.850> is

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
Adagio type approach to things and it is

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.420 
Adagio type approach to things and it is
just<00:07:13.360> when<00:07:13.570> you<00:07:13.740> reversing<00:07:14.740> rotation<00:07:14.890> or

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
just when you reversing rotation or

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.640 
just when you reversing rotation or
keeping<00:07:15.790> him<00:07:15.940> or<00:07:16.600> doing<00:07:17.170> something<00:07:17.530> whether

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.650 
keeping him or doing something whether

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.020 
keeping him or doing something whether
there's<00:07:17.830> a<00:07:17.890> major<00:07:18.160> change<00:07:18.580> of<00:07:18.700> position

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
there's a major change of position

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.400 
there's a major change of position
keeping<00:07:19.360> that<00:07:19.480> run<00:07:19.720> over<00:07:19.960> the<00:07:20.050> ice<00:07:20.140> not

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
keeping that run over the ice not

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.110 
keeping that run over the ice not
letting<00:07:20.710> those<00:07:20.830> blades<00:07:21.370> catch<00:07:21.730> very

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 
letting those blades catch very

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.840 
letting those blades catch very
difficult<00:07:22.690> to<00:07:22.780> do<00:07:23.310> and<00:07:24.310> when<00:07:24.400> it's<00:07:24.520> made<00:07:24.700> to

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:24.850 
difficult to do and when it's made to

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.320 
difficult to do and when it's made to
look<00:07:24.970> easy<00:07:25.150> we<00:07:25.990> all<00:07:26.110> just<00:07:26.290> go<00:07:26.440> on<00:07:26.560> that's<00:07:26.740> great

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330 
look easy we all just go on that's great

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.909 
look easy we all just go on that's great
so<00:07:28.870> you've<00:07:28.990> never<00:07:29.080> been<00:07:29.199> shown<00:07:29.500> across<00:07:29.800> the

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
so you've never been shown across the

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:43.920 
so you've never been shown across the
ice<00:07:30.039> by<00:07:30.280> our<00:07:30.669> chapter<00:07:31.000> there<00:07:42.240> that<00:07:43.240> will<00:07:43.690> have

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:43.930 
ice by our chapter there that will have

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.369 
ice by our chapter there that will have
them<00:07:44.199> at<00:07:44.500> the<00:07:44.650> moment<00:07:44.919> in<00:07:45.900> second<00:07:46.900> place

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:47.379 
them at the moment in second place

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:53.430 
them at the moment in second place
Katy<00:07:47.919> Denny<00:07:48.250> and<00:07:48.550> John<00:07:49.800> Cochran<00:07:51.870> are<00:07:52.870> in<00:07:53.110> first

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 
Katy Denny and John Cochran are in first

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.020 
Katy Denny and John Cochran are in first
at<00:07:53.889> the<00:07:54.460> moment<00:07:55.830> so<00:07:56.830> that's<00:07:57.009> after<00:07:57.280> the<00:07:57.610> first

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.030 
at the moment so that's after the first

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.919 
at the moment so that's after the first
four<00:07:58.919> couples
