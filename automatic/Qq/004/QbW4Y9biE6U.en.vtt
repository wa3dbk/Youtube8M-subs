patient<00:00:09.030> or<00:00:09.260> his<00:00:10.260> class<00:00:11.809> then<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.110> am<00:00:14.009> first

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
patient or his class then I am first

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.340 
patient or his class then I am first
trying<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.920> make<00:00:17.869> this<00:00:18.869> outline<00:00:19.710> exercise

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
trying to make this outline exercise

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.609 
trying to make this outline exercise
after<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:24.350> beautiful<00:00:25.350> straight

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
after I can make beautiful straight

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.990 
after I can make beautiful straight
smooth<00:00:28.619> line<00:00:29.990> able<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:32.329> painting<00:00:33.329> on

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
smooth line able to this painting on

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
smooth line able to this painting on
silk<00:00:36.000> square<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.469> hence<00:00:39.469> each<00:00:41.840> child<00:00:42.840> will

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
silk square so hence each child will

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.090 
silk square so hence each child will
have<00:00:44.420> one<00:00:45.420> piece<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.230> silk<00:00:47.120> for<00:00:48.120> them<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
have one piece of silk for them to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.700 
have one piece of silk for them to
exercise<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:53.870> for<00:00:54.870> children's<00:00:55.590> art<00:00:55.980> project

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
exercise and for children's art project

the<00:00:58.710> treaty's<00:01:00.469> make<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:02.780> simple<00:01:04.880> do<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.360> make

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the treaty's make it simple do not make

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:17.920 
the treaty's make it simple do not make
it<00:01:08.299> complicate

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.120 

this<00:01:18.650> is<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.890> very<00:01:19.390> absorbent<00:01:20.390> paper<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:21.890> is

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
this is a very absorbent paper it is

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.080 
this is a very absorbent paper it is
almost<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.240> same<00:01:23.600> nature<00:01:25.270> same<00:01:26.380> reaction<00:01:27.380> as

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
almost the same nature same reaction as

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:37.390 
almost the same nature same reaction as
we<00:01:29.090> do<00:01:29.420> on<00:01:30.760> silk<00:01:32.260> so<00:01:33.260> I<00:01:34.090> have<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.120> try<00:01:35.660> first<00:01:36.400> so

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
we do on silk so I have a try first so

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.710 
we do on silk so I have a try first so
here<00:01:37.880> are<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.420> outline<00:01:39.100> now<00:01:40.100> we<00:01:40.160> see<00:01:40.670> how<00:01:41.210> the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
here are the outline now we see how the

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:54.859 
here are the outline now we see how the
color<00:01:42.730> couch

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.800 

you<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:56.159> color<00:01:56.520> stay<00:01:57.030> within<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you see the color stay within the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.800 
you see the color stay within the
boundary<00:01:59.780> wind<00:02:00.780> apart

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.590 

mmm<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:08.209> important<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.410> make<00:02:09.920> this

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
mmm the important is to make this

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.090 
mmm the important is to make this
enclosed<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:12.050> line<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.730> color<00:02:14.000> does<00:02:14.390> not<00:02:15.100> run

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
enclosed a line the color does not run

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.670 
enclosed a line the color does not run
out<00:02:18.010> actually<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.280> same<00:02:19.940> technique<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.990> be

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
out actually this same technique can be

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.640 
out actually this same technique can be
used<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:24.160> Chinese<00:02:25.160> painting<00:02:25.790> Xuan<00:02:26.450> paper<00:02:29.650> so

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
used in Chinese painting Xuan paper so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.600 
used in Chinese painting Xuan paper so
the<00:02:30.920> color<00:02:31.280> does<00:02:31.580> not<00:02:31.910> go<00:02:32.569> up<00:02:33.010> let's<00:02:34.010> do<00:02:34.340> some

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
the color does not go up let's do some

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.500 
the color does not go up let's do some
more<00:02:34.910> tricks

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.890 

Coosh

wandah

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.980 

okay<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:52.020> think<00:02:52.440> my<00:02:52.950> lines<00:02:53.280> will<00:02:53.790> do<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.780> will

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
okay I think my lines will do it I will

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.940 
okay I think my lines will do it I will
do<00:02:55.410> on<00:02:55.650> real<00:02:56.010> change<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.550> silk
