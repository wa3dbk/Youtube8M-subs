the<00:02:21.430> opponent<00:02:21.880> I'm<00:02:22.060> getting<00:02:22.390> carried<00:02:23.040> at<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the opponent I'm getting carried at the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.490 
the opponent I'm getting carried at the
bottom<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:26.069> think<00:02:27.069> it's<00:02:28.030> entirely<00:02:28.390> random<00:02:29.170> how

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
bottom I think it's entirely random how

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.750 
bottom I think it's entirely random how
often<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.040> when<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.209> hits<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:33.100> anyway<00:02:33.520> right

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
often it when it hits so anyway right

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.180 
often it when it hits so anyway right
I've<00:02:34.209> not<00:02:34.510> really<00:02:34.870> realized<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:38.190> particular

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
I've not really realized a particular

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.040 
I've not really realized a particular
pattern<00:02:39.459> because<00:02:40.030> sometimes<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.569> happens<00:02:40.900> is

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
pattern because sometimes it happens is

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:52.940 
pattern because sometimes it happens is
one<00:02:41.290> after<00:02:41.650> another

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.520 

yeah<00:02:53.950> what<00:02:54.160> happened<00:02:54.570> was<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.780> type<00:02:55.930> two<00:02:56.200> ducks

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
yeah what happened was a type two ducks

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:06.880 
yeah what happened was a type two ducks
and<00:02:57.010> then

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.720 

wander

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:24.850 

to

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.309 

ah<00:03:26.770> issue

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.729 

all<00:03:33.159> right<00:03:33.310> well<00:03:34.060> 43<00:03:34.689> millions<00:03:35.019> not<00:03:35.319> too<00:03:35.530> bad

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
all right well 43 millions not too bad

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.459 
all right well 43 millions not too bad
just<00:03:36.040> for<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.659> random<00:03:37.659> set<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:37.900> treasures<00:03:38.439> that

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:38.469 
just for a random set of treasures that

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:42.240 
just for a random set of treasures that
really<00:03:39.010> aren't<00:03:39.189> doing<00:03:39.340> much<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.769> 65

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
really aren't doing much and so 65

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.339 
really aren't doing much and so 65
million<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:42.879> I<00:03:43.060> think<00:03:43.180> she<00:03:43.510> has<00:03:43.659> potential<00:03:44.049> if

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
million so I think she has potential if

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.770 
million so I think she has potential if
you<00:03:44.530> can<00:03:44.799> all<00:03:45.549> got<00:03:45.760> mr.<00:03:46.060> Doolittle<00:03:46.420> fucking

Blossom<00:03:53.170> cookie<00:03:53.680> yet<00:03:53.799> I<00:03:53.950> think<00:03:54.250> she's<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.459> good

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
Blossom cookie yet I think she's a good

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.690 
Blossom cookie yet I think she's a good
contender<00:03:55.859> not<00:03:56.859> too<00:03:57.040> sure<00:03:57.189> how<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.370> should<00:03:57.549> be

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
contender not too sure how it should be

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.000 
contender not too sure how it should be
in<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.000> other<00:03:58.180> maps<00:03:58.420> but<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:59.019> think<00:03:59.349> when<00:03:59.829> is<00:03:59.980> a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
in the other maps but I think when is a

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.190 
in the other maps but I think when is a
load<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.370> obstacles<00:04:00.909> and<00:04:01.090> she<00:04:01.209> goes<00:04:01.359> frigging

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
load of obstacles and she goes frigging

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.890 
load of obstacles and she goes frigging
crazy<00:04:02.620> with<00:04:03.310> all<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.549> jellies<00:04:03.969> I<00:04:04.239> think<00:04:04.689> it's

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
crazy with all the jellies I think it's

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.670 
crazy with all the jellies I think it's
a<00:04:05.730> it's<00:04:06.730> really<00:04:06.819> useful<00:04:07.359> I<00:04:07.569> clears<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.290> lot<00:04:08.530> of

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
a it's really useful I clears a lot of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.899 
a it's really useful I clears a lot of
stuff<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.840> here<00:04:11.290> maybe<00:04:11.530> we<00:04:11.829> can<00:04:12.040> get<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.280> high

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
stuff so here maybe we can get a high

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.909 
stuff so here maybe we can get a high
score<00:04:13.299> with<00:04:13.510> her<00:04:13.689> if<00:04:16.289> you've<00:04:17.289> not<00:04:17.560> been<00:04:17.620> able

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
score with her if you've not been able

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.580 
score with her if you've not been able
to<00:04:18.160> unlock<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.880> cherry<00:04:19.690> blossom<00:04:20.079> cookie<00:04:20.410> I

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
to unlock the cherry blossom cookie I

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.040 
to unlock the cherry blossom cookie I
think<00:04:21.549> if<00:04:21.789> you<00:04:22.090> can't<00:04:22.330> afford<00:04:22.449> the<00:04:22.690> cherry

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
think if you can't afford the cherry

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.680 
think if you can't afford the cherry
blossom<00:04:23.380> cookie<00:04:23.710> but<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:24.580> unlock<00:04:24.970> the

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
blossom cookie but you unlock the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.749 
blossom cookie but you unlock the
moonlight<00:04:26.050> cookie<00:04:26.349> then<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:26.830> mean<00:04:27.310> like<00:04:27.490> cookie

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
moonlight cookie then I mean like cookie

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.710 
moonlight cookie then I mean like cookie
becomes<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.180> better<00:04:28.419> option<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:30.449> but<00:04:31.449> it's

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
becomes a better option so but it's

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.520 
becomes a better option so but it's
still<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.199> nice<00:04:32.500> addition<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:34.750> cookie

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
still a nice addition to the cookie

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.300 
still a nice addition to the cookie
collection<00:04:35.820> although<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:37.270> doubt<00:04:38.010> that<00:04:39.010> you'll

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
collection although I doubt that you'll

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.189 
collection although I doubt that you'll
use<00:04:39.639> her<00:04:39.970> or<00:04:40.210> her<00:04:40.510> pet

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.350 

in<00:04:44.650> weeks<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.759> come<00:04:45.939> she'll<00:04:46.180> probably

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
in weeks that come she'll probably

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.369 
in weeks that come she'll probably
become<00:04:46.779> pretty<00:04:47.050> redundant<00:04:47.680> quite<00:04:48.189> quickly

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
become pretty redundant quite quickly

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.540
