00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.820
 that chocolate 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.820
 do not look at me like this 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.300
 I am once and for all 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.510
 who traveled along a winding road alone at sunset 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.219
 after a while' 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.339
 the brothers came across a river too dangerously dangerous 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.400
 sn poured into the magical art the three brothers just shake the sticks for 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.730
 build a bridge 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.300
 but before I can cross I can't I was born of a hooded figure 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.480
 it was death 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.820
 she felt cheated 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.149
 because travelers usually drowned, not admission, but cunning death 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.290
 he pretended to congratulate the three brothers for their magic and said that 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 militated a prize for their escaped abilities 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.049
 the major asked for a stick more powerful than any other language 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.880
 so death and I like one from an elder tree that was in the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.330
 neighborhood 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.020
 the second brother 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.210
 happy to want to humiliate death even more 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.500
 and asked for the power to recall a friend's gift 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.389
 so death ran a stone from the river my son and I 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.290
 finally death turned to the third brother 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 no no 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.840
 better church something that would allow me to leave that place 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 without being followed by death 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.750
 and so the death with the songs of delivery its own mantle 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.750
 invisibility 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:20.019
 the first brother review not tam village armed with the wand of 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.619
 elder and you are a magician with whom he had quarreled in the past 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.769
 me 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.309
 intoxicated by the power that the elder wand had given him so much of 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.309
 its invincibility 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.089
 but that night 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.089
 another magician stole the wand and for good measure, 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.759
 so death called the first brother 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.919
 10 second brother returns home and takes out the stone and read other times 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.209
 in the hand 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.239
 there is no joy the girl he had hoped to marry before death 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.049
 premature late 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.379
 the festival of sad women is over because it did not belong to the world of gods 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.479
 dead 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:08.649
 what you do now wish according to brother you do if people's lives 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.699
 I do not like death took the second child 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.509
 remember his brother 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:19.169
 death is situated in many years but was never able to find it 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.629
 only when and has reached a venerable age 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.529
 the younger brother site if the cloak of invisibility edema his 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:27.679
 son 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.309
 then greets death like an old friend 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:31.889
 he went with her 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.889
 concentrating from this life the trattoria quaglini 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.439
 these are the gifts of death
