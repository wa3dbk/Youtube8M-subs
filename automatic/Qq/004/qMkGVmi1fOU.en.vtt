think a die hard in the White House but

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.850 
think a die hard in the White House but
a<00:02:54.430> longline<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> really<00:02:55.570> smart<00:02:55.840> idea<00:02:56.020> but<00:02:56.770> if

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
a longline is a really smart idea but if

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.440 
a longline is a really smart idea but if
you're<00:02:56.980> gonna<00:02:57.070> do<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:57.760> have<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.210> not

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
you're gonna do that you have to not

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.910 
you're gonna do that you have to not
only<00:02:58.600> watch<00:02:58.840> die<00:02:59.110> hard<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.440> see<00:02:59.560> what<00:02:59.680> works

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
only watch die hard to see what works

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.640 
only watch die hard to see what works
but<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.640> make<00:03:00.790> sure<00:03:00.820> you're<00:03:01.150> not<00:03:01.180> just<00:03:01.690> copying

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
but so make sure you're not just copying

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.170 
but so make sure you're not just copying
it<00:03:02.770> because<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.100> feel<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:03.430> disrespectful<00:03:04.030> you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
it because I feel it's disrespectful you

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
it because I feel it's disrespectful you
go<00:03:04.300> from<00:03:04.510> being<00:03:04.630> respectful<00:03:05.080> to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
go from being respectful to

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.990 
go from being respectful to
disrespectful<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.760> was<00:03:06.850> my<00:03:06.970> biggest

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
disrespectful so that was my biggest

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.750 
disrespectful so that was my biggest
complaint<00:03:07.720> about<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.080> film<00:03:08.370> overall<00:03:09.370> though

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
complaint about the film overall though

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.180 
complaint about the film overall though
I<00:03:10.000> think<00:03:10.660> Olympus<00:03:11.050> Olympus<00:03:11.500> has<00:03:11.590> fallen<00:03:11.650> is

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
I think Olympus Olympus has fallen is

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.360 
I think Olympus Olympus has fallen is
admirable<00:03:12.820> because<00:03:13.210> it<00:03:13.360> tries<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:14.350> hard<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.800> be

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
admirable because it tries so hard to be

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.310 
admirable because it tries so hard to be
this<00:03:15.640> big<00:03:15.880> action<00:03:16.240> movie<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.750> almost<00:03:17.020> gets

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
this big action movie and it almost gets

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.470 
this big action movie and it almost gets
there<00:03:17.590> but<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.250> think<00:03:18.520> it<00:03:18.610> falls<00:03:18.850> short<00:03:19.000> due<00:03:19.360> to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
there but I think it falls short due to

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.700 
there but I think it falls short due to
budgetary<00:03:19.900> restraints

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
budgetary restraints

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.620 
budgetary restraints
I<00:03:20.740> think<00:03:21.520> millennium<00:03:21.880> films<00:03:22.240> which<00:03:22.390> is<00:03:22.510> the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
I think millennium films which is the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.470 
I think millennium films which is the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
well researched this is actually how it

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.740 
well researched this is actually how it
would<00:04:09.280> happened<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.790> could<00:04:10.060> happen<00:04:10.420> this<00:04:10.540> way

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
would happened it could happen this way

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.140 
would happened it could happen this way
but<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:12.010> whole<00:04:12.220> time<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.459> was<00:04:12.580> watching<00:04:12.790> the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
but the whole time I was watching the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.199 
but the whole time I was watching the
scene<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.390> just<00:04:13.989> was<00:04:14.140> like<00:04:14.320> we<00:04:15.160> really<00:04:15.910> go<00:04:16.030> down

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
scene I just was like we really go down

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.090 
scene I just was like we really go down
that<00:04:16.450> easy<00:04:16.690> would<00:04:17.440> we<00:04:17.560> really<00:04:17.709> make<00:04:17.950> that

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
that easy would we really make that

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.770 
that easy would we really make that
mistake<00:04:18.280> we<00:04:18.760> really<00:04:18.970> not<00:04:19.120> guard<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.510> against

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
mistake we really not guard it against

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.320 
mistake we really not guard it against
that<00:04:20.019> I<00:04:20.260> mean<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:20.830> guess<00:04:21.190> what<00:04:21.850> I'm<00:04:21.940> saying<00:04:22.150> is

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
that I mean I guess what I'm saying is

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.330 
that I mean I guess what I'm saying is
you<00:04:22.690> know<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.960> movie<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.410> guess<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.740> has<00:04:23.919> to<00:04:24.190> but

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
you know the movie I guess it has to but

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.770 
you know the movie I guess it has to but
the<00:04:24.460> movie<00:04:24.729> makes<00:04:24.940> us<00:04:25.120> look<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.419> little<00:04:25.570> bit

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
the movie makes us look a little bit

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.120 
the movie makes us look a little bit
like<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:26.350> know<00:04:26.440> we<00:04:26.590> don't<00:04:26.680> know<00:04:26.830> what<00:04:26.979> we're

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
like you know we don't know what we're

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.560 
like you know we don't know what we're
doing<00:04:27.280> when<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.669> comes<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:28.000> defending<00:04:28.419> the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
doing when it comes to defending the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.300 
doing when it comes to defending the
White<00:04:28.780> House<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.140> mean<00:04:29.410> I<00:04:29.500> know<00:04:29.560> Air<00:04:29.830> Force<00:04:30.100> One

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
White House I mean I know Air Force One

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.150 
White House I mean I know Air Force One
can<00:04:30.490> withstand<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.970> nuclear<00:04:31.000> blast<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.950> would

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
can withstand a nuclear blast so I would

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.370 
can withstand a nuclear blast so I would
think<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.460> I<00:04:33.820> don't<00:04:34.540> know<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.660> well<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.169> don't

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
think that I don't know I well I don't

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.530 
think that I don't know I well I don't
