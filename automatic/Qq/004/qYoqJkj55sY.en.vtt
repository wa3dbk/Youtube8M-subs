well for starters most of his matte
boxes<00:01:38.850> come<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.180> three<00:01:39.360> trays<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.869> they<00:01:40.290> all

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
boxes come with three trays and they all

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.429 
boxes come with three trays and they all
rotate<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.790> they<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.090> rotate<00:01:42.240> together<00:01:42.810> or

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
they can rotate independently they do

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.780 
they can rotate independently they do
swing<00:01:45.840> away<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> standard<00:01:47.250> swing<00:01:47.670> away

matte box so you slide it forward use
the<00:01:50.070> pin<00:01:50.280> mechanism<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.210> swing<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.630> away<00:01:51.810> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the pin mechanism and swing it away so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.480 
the pin mechanism and swing it away so
you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.229> change<00:01:52.470> lenses<00:01:52.680> change<00:01:53.159> filters

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490

even larger 6.6 well Andy has a unique
and<00:02:05.250> ingenious<00:02:05.640> way<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.119> my<00:02:06.270> opinion<00:02:06.509> to

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and ingenious way in my opinion to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.410 
and ingenious way in my opinion to
change<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.649> filters<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> back<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
change the filters on the back of the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
change the filters on the back of the
matte<00:02:09.599> box<00:02:09.780> itself<00:02:10.110> there<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.619> two<00:02:10.860> different

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
matte box itself there are two different

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.920 
matte box itself there are two different
pens

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
pens

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.470 
pens
on<00:02:12.260> each<00:02:12.379> side<00:02:12.409> you<00:02:13.310> squeeze<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.150> remove

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
on each side you squeeze and you remove

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.970 
on each side you squeeze and you remove
it<00:02:14.510> that's<00:02:14.750> right<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.349> came<00:02:15.530> off<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:15.860> like

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
it that's right just came off just like

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.300 
it that's right just came off just like
that

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.830 
that
so<00:02:16.519> if<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.730> wanted<00:02:16.939> to<00:02:17.000> go<00:02:17.090> from<00:02:17.209> three<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.510> two

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
so if you wanted to go from three to two

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.270 
so if you wanted to go from three to two
you'd<00:02:17.989> squeeze<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.439> middle<00:02:18.620> one<00:02:18.860> off<00:02:19.010> and

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
you'd squeeze the middle one off and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.830 
you'd squeeze the middle one off and
take<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.549> out<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.970> replace<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.540> because

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
take that out and replace this because

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.539 
take that out and replace this because
it<00:02:20.959> has<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.110> rubber<00:02:21.349> bellows<00:02:21.769> honey<00:02:22.189> has<00:02:22.430> them

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
it has the rubber bellows honey has them

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.399 
it has the rubber bellows honey has them
in<00:02:22.610> sizes<00:02:22.819> just<00:02:23.180> about<00:02:23.360> anything<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.049> want<00:02:24.290> to

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
fit in lens out there when you want to

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.750 
fit in lens out there when you want to
replace<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.840> filter<00:02:27.170> it's<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.890> process<00:02:28.459> in

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
replace the filter it's the process in

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.729 
replace the filter it's the process in
Reverse<00:02:29.030> if<00:02:29.329> you<00:02:29.420> put<00:02:29.569> it<00:02:29.659> on<00:02:29.780> squeeze<00:02:30.590> the

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
Reverse if you put it on squeeze the

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.979 
Reverse if you put it on squeeze the
pins<00:02:30.950> push<00:02:31.549> it<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.819> and<00:02:32.120> there<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.329> have<00:02:32.359> it<00:02:32.629> so

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
pins push it on and there you have it so

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.979 
pins push it on and there you have it so
now<00:02:33.109> you<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.349> put<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.739> map<00:02:33.890> box<00:02:34.129> back<00:02:34.549> on<00:02:34.989> by

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
now you can put the map box back on by

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.250 
now you can put the map box back on by
swinging<00:02:36.409> it<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.189> sliding<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.670> on<00:02:38.079> it<00:02:39.079> is

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
swinging it and sliding it on it is

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.449 
swinging it and sliding it on it is
really<00:02:39.560> sexy<00:02:39.799> when<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.010> look<00:02:40.159> at<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.430> mean

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
in its own little flannel bag that way

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.250 
in its own little flannel bag that way

else<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.359> I<00:04:11.840> just<00:04:12.139> think<00:04:12.229> that<00:04:12.379> Andy<00:04:12.590> has

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
else and I just think that Andy has

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.930 
else and I just think that Andy has
thought<00:04:12.829> of<00:04:12.919> just<00:04:13.220> about<00:04:13.370> everything<00:04:13.669> going

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
thought of just about everything going

Andy has clip on matte boxes he has

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.610 
Andy has clip on matte boxes he has
matte<00:04:16.909> boxes<00:04:17.359> that<00:04:17.510> have<00:04:17.720> different<00:04:18.349> kind<00:04:18.560> of

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
matte boxes that have different kind of

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.769 
matte boxes that have different kind of
staged<00:04:19.579> removal<00:04:20.000> systems<00:04:20.329> where<00:04:20.479> you<00:04:20.510> pull

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:20.779 
staged removal systems where you pull

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.360 
staged removal systems where you pull
one<00:04:20.900> out<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.109> then<00:04:21.289> it<00:04:21.409> collapses<00:04:22.159> down<00:04:22.190> on

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
one out and then it collapses down on

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.930 
one out and then it collapses down on
itself

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
itself

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.490 
itself
I<00:04:22.969> think<00:04:23.330> bright<00:04:23.539> tangerine<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.169> Andy<00:04:24.469> are

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
I think bright tangerine and Andy are

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.129 
I think bright tangerine and Andy are
onto<00:04:24.740> something

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
onto something

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.140

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
something big there combined the best

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.850 
something big there combined the best
products<00:04:27.719> of<00:04:27.900> several<00:04:28.229> different<00:04:28.349> types<00:04:28.650> of

products of several different types of
