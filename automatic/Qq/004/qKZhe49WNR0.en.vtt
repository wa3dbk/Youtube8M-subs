usually<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> mountain<00:00:08.189> bike<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.639> means

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
usually on a mountain bike this means

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.180 
usually on a mountain bike this means
that<00:00:09.059> you're<00:00:09.179> partway<00:00:09.570> through<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.960> crash<00:00:10.320> so

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
that you're partway through a crash so

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.740 
that you're partway through a crash so
actually<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> really<00:00:11.759> good<00:00:11.969> technique<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
actually a really good technique is the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.930 
actually a really good technique is the
exact<00:00:13.049> opposite<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.650> try<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.580> lay<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
exact opposite of that try and lay the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.300 
exact opposite of that try and lay the
bike<00:00:15.089> over<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.139> keep<00:00:16.320> your<00:00:16.500> weight<00:00:16.710> outside

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
bike over and keep your weight outside

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.099 
bike over and keep your weight outside
the<00:00:17.460> bike<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:18.449> technique<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.050> be

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the bike this technique can be

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.189 
the bike this technique can be
especially<00:00:19.590> useful<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.580> flat<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.570> off-camber

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
especially useful in flat or off-camber

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.700 
especially useful in flat or off-camber
turns<00:00:23.210> okay<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.269> start<00:00:24.900> off<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.289> shaft<00:00:25.560> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
turns okay so start off the shaft on

they're in line with the seat then

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.820 
they're in line with the seat then
you're<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.359> doing<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.870> practice<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.589> both

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you're not doing it practice it both

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
you're not doing it practice it both
ways<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.369> most<00:01:05.610> people<00:01:05.970> are<00:01:06.090> stronger<00:01:06.450> doing

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
ways as most people are stronger doing

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.929 
ways as most people are stronger doing
it<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.930> way<00:01:06.960> than<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> other<00:01:07.729> practice<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.850> on

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it one way than the other practice it on

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.490 
it one way than the other practice it on
a<00:01:08.970> car<00:01:09.270> park<00:01:09.570> where<00:01:09.960> there's<00:01:10.140> loads<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
a car park where there's loads of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.620 
a car park where there's loads of
consistent<00:01:11.100> grip<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.909> might<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.270> surprised

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
consistent grip you might be surprised

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
consistent grip you might be surprised
how<00:01:12.900> low<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> bike<00:01:13.920> something

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
how low you can get the bike something

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.130 
how low you can get the bike something
you<00:01:15.030> wouldn't<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.360> able<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:15.990> in

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
you wouldn't be able to do if you're in

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.410 
you wouldn't be able to do if you're in
line<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> bike<00:01:16.880> leaning<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.939> bike<00:01:17.970> over

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
line with the bike leaning the bike over

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.270 
line with the bike leaning the bike over
is<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> great<00:01:18.869> technique<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.320> use<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.860> corners

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
is a great technique to use on corners

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
is a great technique to use on corners
and<00:01:20.430> maybe<00:01:20.580> tighten<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.170> want<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and maybe tighten up or you want to

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.590 
and maybe tighten up or you want to
change<00:01:22.560> your<00:01:22.830> line<00:01:23.040> mid<00:01:23.340> turn<00:01:23.610> rather<00:01:24.390> than

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
change your line mid turn rather than

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.660 
change your line mid turn rather than
trying<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.869> steer<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> perfect<00:01:25.650> radius<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.549> can

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
trying to steer a perfect radius you can

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.340 
trying to steer a perfect radius you can
lean<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> bike<00:01:27.150> over<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.869> where<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.290> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
lean the bike over and where you want it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
lean the bike over and where you want it
to<00:01:28.470> turn<00:01:28.590> tighter<00:01:29.000> push<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> bike<00:01:30.329> over

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
to turn tighter push the bike over

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
to turn tighter push the bike over
further<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.200> wants<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> fall<00:01:31.710> over<00:01:32.070> wants<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
further it wants to fall over wants to
