00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.949
 hi there, tungsten is the first 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.900
 Yaroslavl video blog 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:22.509
 finally learned that solemn 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 the moment has acquired a smokehouse even by myself 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:31.990
 really I did not look particularly studio acquired 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.020
 smokehouse economy smoke easy thing 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:40.270
 attractive in this picture this 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.520
 of course the price is only 351 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.949
 in hand 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.269
 such a budget really economy 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.940
 smokehouse designed for hot 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.530
 smoked fish poultry meat sausages and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.170
 other products outdoors 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.179
 consists of a body with a cover and grids 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.179
 inserts for product placement 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.379
 make it in tver 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.780
 so seemingly done more or less 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.060
 okay and how will she behave when 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:22.380
 the temperature can ruin it all 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.380
 and in general I will regret that I bought it and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:33.840
 lattice two jokes some kind of flimsy her 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:38.380
 cool well, nothing with a couple of 2 rome 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.940
 now broke and still not great 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.480
 managed to take advantage of something 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.480
 broke down 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.090
 what are so flimsy and lattice well then 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:59.280
 we ourselves can make a variety 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:23.870
 it is not problematic so much 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:27.890
 smokehouse so it should close 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.890
 now try to close 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:38.989
 everything closes almost ready for 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.380
 work mostly then of course and bought for 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.260
 to capta here neither fish nor meat 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.800
 and you know that chicken legs girly 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.569
 especially for the crustaceans bought here 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.480
 such a gadget device chips from spices 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.099
 for smoking chicken suitable for chicken 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.880
 and turkey ducks can be used 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.080
 smokehouse 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.620
 heated and in the oven but generally in 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.400
 I plan to make money boxes myself in the future 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.430
 this chip 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.730
 because we have all sorts there 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.500

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.280
 ru jars walk some method 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.319
 so come up with a fit of this sliver a lot 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.600

 written wood chips of beech and pear with mint 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.980
 Well, here is the use of how to apply it but 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.500
 I think nothing will be difficult 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.260

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.220

 can after the first use immediately 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.590
