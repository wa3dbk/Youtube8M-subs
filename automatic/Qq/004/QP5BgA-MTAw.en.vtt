00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.840
 Hightech on the Hindukusch like the heron 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.850
 the air patrols supported on the ground 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.930
 early evening in camp marmal in 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.080
 Afghanistan 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.869
 the tactical air force squadron 51 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.380
 from jail prepares a heron for 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.939
 the mission of the coming night to 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.150
 the same time the men make of 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.400
 geburt reconnaissance battalion 230 from 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.350
 finish your phenix ready for the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.870
 Enlightenment order on the ground 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.129
 the men from here and from the air force 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.800
 become tight all night 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.739
 work together but without 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.600
 see the heron crowe the patrol 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.489
 with observational results from the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.510
 Luft supports the declared lieutenant colonel 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.510
 stefan n 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.089
 basically we get from the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.750
 army units or others 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:01.149
 units asks a motion plan 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.890
 delivered where do you want to go where 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.239
 they want to go long in what their 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.310
 on-site tasks see yours 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.320
 points of support we accompany you 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.049
 to score points for their arrivals 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.960
 their observation points and scan the 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.759
 straighten the way ahead so we're almost there 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.830
 our eyes thus lead all a 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.740
 kilometer before the vehicles put and 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.289
 the quasi- emerging situations 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.140
 Report in advance and partly so 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.330
 can prevent it by going 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.130
 lieutenant christof k the leader of 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.950
 scout squads are happy about the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.780
 support from the air in 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.209
 direct in front of a direct connection 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.159
 with the heron so if i have 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.960
 my grids through what i give 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.840
 would like to have clarified 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.369
 that I almost the picture then of 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.170
 which then get the give me then 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.900
 direct location information what do you see ? 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.920
 up there can inform me and 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.960
 This I have a closed 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.610
 situation picture and can proceed further 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.880
 the heron is one of the most valuable 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.630
 Assets of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.090
 the unmanned one is driven 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.690
 Aircraft of a rotax engine with 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.280
 115 ps with 860 longer and one 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.170
 span of 16 60 ends the 1200 kilo 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.160
 heavy here in the outside one 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.220
 motorsegler 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.620
 She has an infrared and a tv camera 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.540
 with night vision optics through her 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.040
 bright technology can be used here 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.380
 enlighten day and night 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.040
 The system is controlled by one 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.040
 two team 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.540
 somehow she is looking upside down 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.400
 but 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.390
 the place where the data thieves 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.390
 is housed 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.400
 or the application for our satellites 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.459
 communication at dusk lifts that 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.769
 aircraft starts simultaneously 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.609
 scout the enlighteners will be the whole 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.079
 be in your vehicles on the night 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.569
 the fans are also high-tech 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.510
 equipped you have thermal image device 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.700
 Camera and laser rangefinder with 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.620
 four-wheel and big wheels cope with them 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.719
 almost every terrain and with the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.040
 The mechanical weapons station can do that 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.590
 defend himself 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.040
 yet he is glad the heron survey 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.260
 to know 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.659
 the unmanned aerial vehicle reached 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.310
 a top speed of 210 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.599
 hours kilometers 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.209
 It flies to a maximum height of 9000 meters 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:28.069
 the heron sends your data directly 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.849
 The patrol can take up to 24 hours 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.769
 stay in the air 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.260
 heron is always watching from above 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.959
 so movements or objects on 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.420
 are best distinguished from declared 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.430
 We can people 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.169
 we can see animals we can see 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.280
 People also distinguish whether we are now 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.269
 Men women or children have children 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.000
 show them quite nice thereby from 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.980
 that they like to get wild through the area in there 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.900
 One knows that from the playground adults 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.230
 move a bit calmer and 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.980
 more relaxed and based on the clothes 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.569
 completely veiled women are moving 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.889
 unlike men 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.389
 we are there for a quasi one 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.950
 surprise or nasty surprise for 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.879
 to prevent your own troops in the 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.370
 indemnify back 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.409
 whether houses vehicles people heron 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.750
 provides detailed information for 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.280
 the operations management can also 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.220
 The operators decide if they are the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.139
 Show enemy when you are seen 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.340
 so that one says okay the people 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.580
 you want to show that she is watching 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.990
 that you say you are there you want it 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.449
 show presence 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.970
 then you fly into greater depths that 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.490
 Being heard is being seen flying 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.590
 maybe during the day instead of at night 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.930
 other objects to monitor 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.849
 would like where to find a dilapidated 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.800
 where would you like to have a movement profile? 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.740
 want to see what do you do where hide 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.570
 they weapons where they bury weapons where 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.340
 negotiate money or others 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.050
 things you do that already so that 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.419
 one out of reach larger 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.820
 distance and that is not heard 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.070
 and would not be seen early on 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.830
 tomorrow the heron is invisible 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.900
 the fennecs watching the terrain nearly 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.720
 half of Afghanistan is made up 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.580
 recover 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.320
 From above, the enlighteners enter 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.120
 continuous picture image from the 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.010
 bird's eye view without sight 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.730
 restrictions by mountains or 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.170
 stonewall 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.510
 in the end we are one 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.200
 ground-based heavy enlightenment and us 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.260
 need quasi in the eye from above then 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.280
 the enemy may or ids the 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.100
 are hidden somewhere 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.830
 then to clarify what we got from the ground 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.870
 the ids can not go crazy 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.150
 are among the biggest dangers on the ground 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.700
 she can be enlightened from the air and 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.190
 even if a flying machine without a pilot on 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.980
 many scary effect the German 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.080
 Soldiers on the ground, the heron is more than 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.390
 a friend she protects on patrol 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.640
 you live and so do the 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.800
 enlightener from feet this morning 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.800
 safely back to the camp
