00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
marigold two rare gold but if we did

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.430

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.890 
lose any of the games that we would do
this<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.130> we<00:02:22.280> would<00:02:22.550> hopefully<00:02:23.300> we<00:02:23.569> have<00:02:23.690> got

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
this so we would hopefully we have got

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.080 
this so we would hopefully we have got
some<00:02:24.140> bronze<00:02:24.410> players<00:02:24.709> in<00:02:25.010> there<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.849> we<00:02:25.940> will

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
some bronze players in there so we will

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.040

so we don't actually have a rare bonds
we<00:02:31.819> have<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.940> non<00:02:32.420> rare<00:02:32.630> bond<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:32.930> that's<00:02:33.080> after

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
we have a non rare bond so that's after

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.050 
we have a non rare bond so that's after
two<00:02:33.980> losses<00:02:34.220> but<00:02:34.459> fingers<00:02:34.640> crossed<00:02:34.849> that
