00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.750
 will come too fast to a curve 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.290
 slow down too much accelerate before 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.510
 time or trace the evil this serves us 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.080
 to go faster but it makes 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.780
 we consume more fuel 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.490
 compared to a smooth driving that 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.490
 it does not necessarily have to be slow 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.190
 and spend little fuel has 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.930
 global and individual benefits the 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.060
 global are that they consume less 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.310
 resources and a smaller amount are issued 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.810
 of co2 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.390
 individually there are economic advantages 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.430
 direct we spend less money and in 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.910
 some measure we increase the useful life 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.910
 of the car 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.000
 to save the fastest way is 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.039
 choose a car that consumes little in addition 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.229
 we can spend even less amount of 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.290
 fuel just by watching a few 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.570
 basic rules 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.210
 The consumption is affected by two factors 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.040
 distinct and complementary one is the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.170
 driving the car itself what we could 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.610
 call driving the other is the way in 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.110
 the one that we develop between the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.110
 traffic or circular 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.720
 driving driving the car is 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.030
 essentially in the way that 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.030
 we accelerate we brake and we turn 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.120
 to accelerate economically we can 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.460
 think that between the foot of the accelerator 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.950
 there is a piece of ripe fruit the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.640
 goal is to gain speed without clogging the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.960
 contact fruit can be accelerated 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.920
 frankly if done in a way 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.930
 progressive 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.090
 there will be times that there is no other way 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.070
 take it out but good in a driving 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.580
 It is not usual to have to give a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.740
 stomp on the accelerator 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.330
 and to accelerate it is convenient to miss 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.550
 more to brake is better to do 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.080
 exactly the opposite step on what 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.790
 the pedal at the beginning of the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.760
 brake and go raising the pedal to 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.160
 as the car loses speed 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.860
 it's something like breathing when you 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.380
 do exercise inspire fast and drop 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.680
 the air slowly so the deceleration 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.840
 it will be more constant the goal is 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.450
 control the braking to lose all the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.120
 speed that is necessary neither less nor 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.120
 more stopping is losing energy 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.230
 to turn we refer you to the chapter 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.140
 on the curve line there we saw 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.760
 basically two things one does not have to 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.430
 make a more closed curve than what 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.170
 it really is two you have to turn 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.720
 progressively until reaching the maximum 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.310
 turning point sustain it the time that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.780
 be necessary and undo the turn 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.819
 gently 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.190
 what in the jargon of the automobile 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.410
 know how to close go by hitting 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.520
 unnecessary steering wheel is the opposite of 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.520
 an economic driving 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.080
 with a little practice this way of 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.480
 accelerate braking and turning will become 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.310
 a habit in an automatism only with 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.660
 this will already be saving fuel 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.430
 but for this savings to be 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.770
 truly significant there is 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.910
 Circular thinking about spending the least 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.950
 possible amount of energy 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.590
 the golden rule to circulate 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.510
 economic is very simple you have to 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.920
 anticipate as much as possible the traffic and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.920
 the conditions of the road 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.530
 to carry out this golden rule is 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.239
 It is essential to look far to see what 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.330
 what is happening and to anticipate what 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.270
 may happen 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.980
 let's see some examples if we are going to 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.930
 getting to a red light is convenient 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.470
 approach slowly in case it gets in 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.510
 green before arriving 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.270
 It is best to do this if there is a 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.070
 momentary retention is better to approach 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.840
 slowly to give time for the 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.960
 appropriate vehicle start again the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.960
 March 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.260
 when another vehicle is going to incorporate 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.200
 to the road through which we circulate the best 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.970
 is to facilitate the maneuver if it is a way 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.870
 in addition to one lane per sense- enough 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.870
 with letting yourself free 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.870
 if there is only one lane you can choose 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.090
 between accelerating a bit to surpass 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.830
 you can accelerate it slightly for 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.270
 give him time to join 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.550
 any of these alternatives 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.500
 it requires less energy than reaching your 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.890
 height when even more slowly and have 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.890
 what to stop 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.350
 if on the contrary, we are 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.690
 who are forced to give up the 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.910
 step for example in a roundabout 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.940
 the ideal is to foresee the maneuver so that 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.950
 do not have to stop 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.090
 to drive economically what 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.700
 better is to maintain a speed 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.860
 constant anticipate the traffic serves 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.080
 precisely to minimize those 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.870
 speed variations how much can you 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.190
 save with an economical driving 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.410
 to answer this we are going to 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.590
 refer to the ecomotion consumption test 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.930
 2010 tour that organizes ld automotive 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.120
 in which Citroën has participated with 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.580
 10 other brands 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.229
 the test consisted of a tour of 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.000
 road with a planned layout 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.490
 precisely to prevent a march 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.500
 constant goal was to achieve 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.010
 maximum reduction on average consumption 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.770
 approved citroën with a c5 hd and has 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.449
 achieved a reduction of 19% over a 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.150
 approved consumption that is already low 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.219
 It will come so hard but we can 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.349
 get a significant reduction if 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.349
 we turn these techniques into a habit
