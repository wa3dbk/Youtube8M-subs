00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
training wheels if you will of this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:03:47.570 
training wheels if you will of this
series<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:19.079> I'm<00:02:19.170> gonna<00:02:19.260> pick<00:02:19.439> Megaman<00:02:19.860> see

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.550 

so<00:03:48.210> this<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.570> actually<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:49.020> character<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.410> was

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
so this is actually the character I was

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.050 
so this is actually the character I was
talking<00:03:49.950> about<00:03:50.010> unlocking<00:03:50.430> when<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.820> beat<00:03:50.970> it

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
talking about unlocking when you beat it

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.150 
talking about unlocking when you beat it

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
on hard mega I don't get why they just

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.280 
on hard mega I don't get why they just
don't<00:03:53.280> call<00:03:53.550> him<00:03:53.670> rock<00:03:53.970> but<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.840> guess<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:55.170> cuz

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:57.129 
he wasn't known as rock here in North
America<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:58.710> I<00:03:58.950> digress

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.420 

and<00:04:57.409> mega<00:04:58.599> it's<00:04:59.599> turned<00:04:59.930> into<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.919> mega<00:05:01.159> man

good<00:05:43.849> as<00:05:44.029> the<00:05:44.120> 8-bit<00:05:44.449> game<00:05:44.689> so<00:05:44.900> i<00:05:44.960> will<00:05:45.139> be

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
good as the 8-bit game so i will be

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.439 
good as the 8-bit game so i will be
using<00:05:45.409> it<00:05:45.740> a<00:05:45.830> lot<00:05:45.860> to<00:05:46.310> get<00:05:46.400> around<00:05:46.639> faster<00:05:47.240> it

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
using it a lot to get around faster it

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.920 
using it a lot to get around faster it
helps<00:05:48.169> you<00:05:48.289> get<00:05:48.469> through<00:05:48.800> a<00:05:49.159> narrow<00:05:49.930> passages

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
helps you get through a narrow passages

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.730 
helps you get through a narrow passages
and<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:53.240> charge<00:05:53.509> shot<00:05:53.779> kills<00:05:54.139> practically

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
and the charge shot kills practically

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.469 
and the charge shot kills practically
everything<00:05:54.979> in<00:05:55.249> one<00:05:55.430> hit<00:05:58.180> it's<00:05:59.180> a<00:05:59.270> pretty

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
everything in one hit it's a pretty

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.740 
everything in one hit it's a pretty
neato<00:05:59.810> ability<00:06:00.439> if<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.610> say<00:06:01.849> so<00:06:01.909> myself<00:06:04.750> it

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
neato ability if I say so myself it

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.869 
neato ability if I say so myself it
makes<00:06:06.020> a<00:06:06.259> really<00:06:06.319> annoying<00:06:07.069> noise<00:06:07.490> though

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:07.879 
makes a really annoying noise though

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.309 
makes a really annoying noise though
they<00:06:08.060> could<00:06:08.210> have<00:06:08.300> like<00:06:08.449> made<00:06:08.750> that<00:06:08.960> charge

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 
they could have like made that charge

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.610 
they could have like made that charge
sound<00:06:09.770> better<00:06:11.050> here<00:06:12.050> we<00:06:12.169> have<00:06:12.289> checkpoints

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
sound better here we have checkpoints

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:34.409 
sound better here we have checkpoints
and<00:06:13.219> here's<00:06:13.430> the<00:06:13.580> boss<00:06:13.759> of<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.120> opening

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:40.120 

it's<00:06:35.419> the<00:06:35.599> proto<00:06:36.080> I<00:06:37.360> and<00:06:38.380> you<00:06:39.380> shoot<00:06:39.650> it<00:06:39.770> in<00:06:39.949> its

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
it's the proto I and you shoot it in its

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.900 
it's the proto I and you shoot it in its
little<00:06:40.340> eye<00:06:40.550> socket<00:06:41.150> I<00:06:41.770> think<00:06:42.770> everything<00:06:43.310> is

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
little eye socket I think everything is

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.350 
little eye socket I think everything is
weak<00:06:44.300> and<00:06:44.740> by<00:06:45.740> when<00:06:45.949> I<00:06:45.979> say<00:06:46.250> we<00:06:46.490> I<00:06:46.520> mean<00:06:46.819> get

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
weak and by when I say we I mean get

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.110 
weak and by when I say we I mean get
stunned<00:06:47.870> like<00:06:48.770> if<00:06:49.039> they<00:06:49.490> were<00:06:49.520> hit<00:06:49.849> by<00:06:49.940> their

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
stunned like if they were hit by their

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.080 
stunned like if they were hit by their
weakness<00:06:50.509> I<00:06:50.750> think<00:06:51.440> everything<00:06:51.919> is<00:06:52.099> wheat<00:06:52.460> to

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
weakness I think everything is wheat to

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.210 
weakness I think everything is wheat to
the<00:06:53.440> Mega<00:06:54.440> Buster<00:06:54.680> charge<00:06:55.460> shot<00:06:57.039> so<00:06:58.039> it's

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
the Mega Buster charge shot so it's

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.830 
the Mega Buster charge shot so it's
acting<00:06:58.520> like<00:06:58.669> as<00:06:58.880> if<00:06:59.060> it<00:06:59.210> were<00:06:59.300> hit<00:06:59.509> by<00:06:59.630> its

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
acting like as if it were hit by its

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.159 
acting like as if it were hit by its
legitimate<00:07:00.440> week<00:07:00.590> lyst<00:07:00.830> weakness<00:07:01.370> weakness

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
legitimate week lyst weakness weakness

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.610 
legitimate week lyst weakness weakness
whatever<00:07:03.169> words<00:07:04.069> I<00:07:05.080> stumble<00:07:06.080> over<00:07:06.199> them<00:07:06.470> all

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
whatever words I stumble over them all

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:14.140 
whatever words I stumble over them all
the<00:07:06.800> time<00:07:08.470> that's<00:07:09.470> the<00:07:09.650> proto<00:07:09.919> I<00:07:13.150> leave

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
the time that's the proto I leave

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:37.339 
the time that's the proto I leave
through<00:07:14.360> fast<00:07:15.940> loading<00:07:16.940> times

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:37.349 

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:41.039 

so<00:07:38.789> that's<00:07:39.789> one<00:07:39.969> good<00:07:40.119> thing<00:07:40.149> about<00:07:40.299> cutscenes

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:41.049 
so that's one good thing about cutscenes

00:07:41.049 --> 00:07:42.599 
so that's one good thing about cutscenes

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:42.609 
in this and voice acting I don't have to

00:07:42.609 --> 00:07:45.479 
in this and voice acting I don't have to
read<00:07:42.789> the<00:07:42.939> words<00:07:43.119> which<00:07:43.929> sometimes<00:07:44.229> I<00:07:44.559> stumble

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:45.489
