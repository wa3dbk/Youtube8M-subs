00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
if I am an ectomorph or a mesomorph says

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.160 
if I am an ectomorph or a mesomorph says
I'm<00:00:22.830> not<00:00:22.949> quite<00:00:23.189> sure<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:24.630> eat<00:00:24.720> whatever<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
I'm not quite sure I can eat whatever I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.500 
I'm not quite sure I can eat whatever I
want<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.859> don't<00:00:25.890> gain<00:00:26.490> weight<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.359> I've

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
want and I don't gain weight but I've

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.179 
want and I don't gain weight but I've
gotten<00:00:27.810> quite<00:00:28.019> muscular<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:28.680> working<00:00:29.039> out

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
gotten quite muscular from working out

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.609 
gotten quite muscular from working out
so<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.060> may<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.390> mesomorph<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.500> I'm

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
so I think I may be a mesomorph but I'm

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.459 
so I think I may be a mesomorph but I'm
not<00:00:31.800> sure<00:00:32.660> all<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:33.780> well<00:00:33.960> that's<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.230> great

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
not sure all right well that's a great

mesomorphic<00:00:56.399> build<00:00:57.329> where<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> lean

your natural body type what or how you

your natural body type what or how you
can<00:01:04.920> find<00:01:05.159> out<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.549> natural<00:01:05.790> body<00:01:06.210> type

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
can find out what your natural body type

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.289 
can find out what your natural body type
is<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:07.010> what<00:01:08.010> were<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.520> before<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
is is what were you like before you

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.539 
is is what were you like before you
started<00:01:09.720> working<00:01:09.930> out<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:11.189> would<00:01:11.369> your

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
started working out and what would your

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.359 
started working out and what would your
body<00:01:11.729> resort<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.290> back<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.220> were

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
body resort to or go back to if you were

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.090 
body resort to or go back to if you were
to<00:01:14.580> stop<00:01:14.939> working<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.720> mean<00:01:16.439> chances<00:01:16.710> are

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
to stop working out I mean chances are

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.649 
to stop working out I mean chances are
you've<00:01:17.640> probably<00:01:17.909> gone<00:01:18.150> through<00:01:18.210> phases

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you've probably gone through phases

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.570 
you've probably gone through phases
where<00:01:19.049> you've<00:01:19.170> been<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.799> serious<00:01:20.460> with

where you've been really serious with

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.550 
where you've been really serious with
your<00:01:20.759> training<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.689> other<00:01:21.930> phases<00:01:22.229> where

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
your training and the other phases where

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
your training and the other phases where
you've<00:01:22.650> probably<00:01:22.860> gotten<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.310> bit<00:01:23.460> slack<00:01:23.820> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you've probably gotten a bit slack you

do you kind of lose weight and you know

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.469 
do you kind of lose weight and you know
kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.950> thin<00:01:41.220> out<00:01:41.340> meaning<00:01:41.939> that's<00:01:42.299> an

kind of thin out meaning that's an

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
ectomorph ik trait or do you pile on

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.080 
ectomorph ik trait or do you pile on
body<00:01:45.810> fat<00:01:45.930> easily<00:01:46.439> meaning<00:01:47.369> an<00:01:47.460> endomorphic

body fat easily meaning an endomorphic
trait<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.170> kind<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.619> hang<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
trait or do you kind of just hang in the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.280 
trait or do you kind of just hang in the
middle<00:01:50.700> they're<00:01:50.880> probably<00:01:51.570> maintaining

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
middle they're probably maintaining

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.679 
middle they're probably maintaining
pretty<00:01:52.530> close<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> what<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.159> were<00:01:53.280> before

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
pretty close to what you were before

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.910 
pretty close to what you were before
that<00:01:54.689> would<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.170> genetically<00:01:55.890> gifted

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that would be a genetically gifted

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.550 
that would be a genetically gifted
mesomorphic<00:01:56.820> trait<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> kind<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.290> need<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
mesomorphic trait so you kind of need to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740 
mesomorphic trait so you kind of need to
look<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:58.890> what<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.670> your<00:01:59.909> body's<00:02:00.270> natural

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
look at what is your body's natural

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.050 
look at what is your body's natural
tendencies<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:02.280> you're<00:02:02.430> willing<00:02:02.759> your

weight I mean on the flip side and

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.150 
weight I mean on the flip side and
endomorph<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.260> complete<00:02:22.650> opposite

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
body weight piles on very quickly so

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.360 
body weight piles on very quickly so
