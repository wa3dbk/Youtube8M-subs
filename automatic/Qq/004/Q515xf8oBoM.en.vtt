Chewbacca because the jager was so that

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.110 
Chewbacca because the jager was so that
the<00:03:25.390> air<00:03:25.599> was<00:03:25.720> near<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.500> bottom<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.880> still

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
the air was near the bottom you still

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.580

get<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.360> weights<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.690> but<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.930> still<00:03:29.110> flows<00:03:29.349> in

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
get it weights it but it still flows in

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.070 
get it weights it but it still flows in
just<00:03:30.099> it's<00:03:30.760> it's<00:03:31.030> more<00:03:31.300> subtle<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:31.810> that

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
just it's it's more subtle so that

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.170 
just it's it's more subtle so that
pineapple<00:03:32.349> is<00:03:32.709> your<00:03:32.860> attack<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.730> keeps<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
pineapple is your attack it keeps the

pineapple is your attack it keeps the
alcohol<00:03:34.450> from<00:03:34.480> just<00:03:34.830> attacking<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:36.069> in<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
alcohol from just attacking you in the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
experience all at once the weird color

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.509 
experience all at once the weird color
yeah<00:03:45.790> it's<00:03:45.970> not<00:03:46.690> really<00:03:47.130> it's<00:03:48.130> kind<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.459> a

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
yeah it's not really it's kind of like a

up<00:03:51.610> with<00:03:51.819> an<00:03:51.940> analogy<00:03:52.480> for<00:03:52.510> what<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.840> could

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
up with an analogy for what that could

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:00.809 
up with an analogy for what that could
be<00:03:53.400> maybe<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.519> really<00:03:55.269> weird<00:03:55.569> cider<00:03:56.019> yeah<00:03:59.819> good

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
still cut through quite well it's weird

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.550 
still cut through quite well it's weird
like<00:04:11.739> I'd<00:04:11.890> even<00:04:12.010> have<00:04:12.190> a<00:04:12.220> like<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.560> alcohol

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
like I'd even have a like that alcohol

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.640 
like I'd even have a like that alcohol
aftertaste

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.960 

now<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:20.510> only<00:04:20.720> problem<00:04:20.930> i<00:04:21.350> find<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.790> not

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
now the only problem i find this is not

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.840 
now the only problem i find this is not
the<00:04:23.180> cocktails<00:04:23.630> problem<00:04:24.080> i<00:04:24.260> don't<00:04:25.250> really<00:04:25.580> get

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
a lot of spice from this maybe once upon

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.830 
a lot of spice from this maybe once upon
a<00:04:28.190> time<00:04:28.430> when<00:04:28.610> I<00:04:28.640> used<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.910> order<00:04:29.090> captain<00:04:29.570> draw
