at the apple event they are missing six

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.029 
at the apple event they are missing six
core<00:00:55.949> applications<00:00:56.910> which<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.620> stocks

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
core applications which are the stocks

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
core applications which are the stocks
the<00:00:59.489> weather<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.120> voice<00:01:00.329> memos<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> clock

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the weather the voice memos the clock

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
the weather the voice memos the clock
the<00:01:01.800> calculator<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> compass<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the calculator and the compass and that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.940 
the calculator and the compass and that
doesn't<00:01:04.470> make<00:01:04.650> much<00:01:05.220> sense<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.540> has<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
doesn't make much sense because it has a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.980 
doesn't make much sense because it has a
1024<00:01:07.950> x<00:01:08.430> 768<00:01:09.360> resolution<00:01:10.970> for<00:01:11.970> those<00:01:12.210> apps<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
1024 x 768 resolution for those apps and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.609 
1024 x 768 resolution for those apps and
it<00:01:13.979> also<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.760> 10<00:01:15.090> inch<00:01:15.330> screen<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.140> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
it also has a 10 inch screen so it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.289 
it also has a 10 inch screen so it
doesn't<00:01:17.009> make<00:01:17.100> sense<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:17.970> wouldn't

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
doesn't make sense that they wouldn't

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.530 
doesn't make sense that they wouldn't
make<00:01:18.479> use<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> those<00:01:19.140> apps<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> next<00:01:20.790> rumor

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
make use of those apps so the next rumor

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.100 
make use of those apps so the next rumor
in<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.840> video<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.820> relating<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.000> flash<00:01:24.330> so

videos that Apple has posted the head

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.060 
videos that Apple has posted the head
flash<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.810> an<00:01:36.990> hour<00:01:37.229> later<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.920> would

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
flash then like an hour later they would

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.550 
flash then like an hour later they would
correct<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.960> flash<00:01:40.290> on

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
correct it that they don't have flash on

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.600 
correct it that they don't have flash on
the<00:01:40.680> iPad<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.790> that's<00:01:42.000> mean<00:01:43.189> going<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.399> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the iPad then that's mean going back and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.830 
the iPad then that's mean going back and
forth<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.950> flash<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.450> think

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
forth so that is the flash so I think

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.700 
forth so that is the flash so I think
there<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.189> capabilities<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> flash<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
iPad but that is undecided yet I guess

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.319
