often<00:00:14.959> is<00:00:15.110> hey<00:00:15.589> al<00:00:15.799> what<00:00:16.219> do<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.669> numbers<00:00:17.119> on

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
often is hey al what do the numbers on

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.570 
often is hey al what do the numbers on
the<00:00:17.540> bag<00:00:17.750> of<00:00:17.960> fertilizer<00:00:18.140> stand<00:00:18.830> for<00:00:19.099> or<00:00:19.279> what

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
the bag of fertilizer stand for or what

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.069 
the bag of fertilizer stand for or what
are<00:00:19.669> the<00:00:19.759> numbers<00:00:20.150> on<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:20.570> bags<00:00:20.810> of

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.990 
are the numbers on the bags of
fertilizer<00:00:21.230> mean<00:00:21.800> that's<00:00:22.369> a<00:00:22.460> great<00:00:22.640> question

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
fertilizer mean that's a great question

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.550 
fertilizer mean that's a great question
because<00:00:23.119> that's<00:00:23.449> really<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.840> key<00:00:24.260> to

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
because that's really the key to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.620 
because that's really the key to
starting<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.460> proper<00:00:25.820> application<00:00:26.000> of

putting down so let's talk about NPK
real<00:01:02.510> quick<00:01:02.689> so<00:01:02.869> nitrogen<00:01:03.080> its<00:01:03.860> primary<00:01:04.309> goal

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
real quick so nitrogen its primary goal

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.820 
real quick so nitrogen its primary goal
is<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.239> turn<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.630> grass<00:01:05.869> green<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.650> make

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
is to turn the grass green and to make

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.020 
is to turn the grass green and to make
it<00:01:06.950> grow<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.340> I'll<00:01:07.400> link<00:01:07.520> below<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:08.000> the

it grow and I'll link below in the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.029 
it grow and I'll link below in the
description<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.720> video<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.049> did<00:01:09.350> on<00:01:09.530> what

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
description to a video I did on what

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.950 
description to a video I did on what
does<00:01:10.340> or<00:01:10.880> what's<00:01:11.179> the<00:01:11.329> best<00:01:11.509> way<00:01:11.689> to<00:01:11.719> have<00:01:11.899> a

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
does or what's the best way to have a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.380 
does or what's the best way to have a
green<00:01:12.200> lawn<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:13.219> second<00:01:13.609> one<00:01:13.700> phosphorus

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
green lawn the second one phosphorus

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.120 
green lawn the second one phosphorus
that's<00:01:14.600> really<00:01:14.990> going<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.200> be<00:01:15.350> designed<00:01:16.039> to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
that's really going to be designed to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.130 
that's really going to be designed to
help<00:01:16.310> root<00:01:16.729> growth<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.270> root<00:01:17.539> development<00:01:17.810> so

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
help root growth and root development so

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.080 
help root growth and root development so
phosphorus<00:01:18.619> is<00:01:18.770> going<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.130> be<00:01:19.250> more<00:01:19.609> important

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
phosphorus is going to be more important

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.639 
phosphorus is going to be more important
in<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.420> fall<00:01:20.630> it's<00:01:21.049> also<00:01:21.170> important<00:01:21.590> to

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
in the fall it's also important to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.289 
in the fall it's also important to
understand<00:01:21.979> that<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.159> lot<00:01:22.429> of<00:01:22.460> municipalities

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
understand that a lot of municipalities

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.539 
understand that a lot of municipalities
around<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.409> country<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:24.859> North<00:01:25.009> America<00:01:25.399> have

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
around the country in North America have

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.029 
around the country in North America have
actually<00:01:25.909> banned<00:01:26.240> phosphorus<00:01:26.960> use<00:01:27.200> due<00:01:28.009> to

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
actually banned phosphorus use due to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.010 
actually banned phosphorus use due to
some<00:01:28.850> negative<00:01:29.119> effects<00:01:29.539> can<00:01:29.749> have<00:01:29.869> on

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
some negative effects can have on

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.800 
some negative effects can have on
waterways<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:31.460> then<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.820> last<00:01:31.969> potash<00:01:32.600> or
