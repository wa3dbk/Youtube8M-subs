00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.080 

$30.00<00:00:35.060> flu<00:00:35.300> set<00:00:35.570> up<00:00:35.660> over<00:00:35.840> there

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
$30.00 flu set up over there

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.720 
$30.00 flu set up over there
we've<00:00:38.090> classified<00:00:38.360> about<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.050> half<00:00:39.590> bucket<00:00:40.579> so

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
we've classified about a half bucket so

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.729 
we've classified about a half bucket so
far<00:00:41.000> we<00:00:41.239> got<00:00:41.390> a<00:00:41.420> little<00:00:41.539> bit<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:41.840> color<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.289> it's

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
far we got a little bit of color so it's

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.459 
far we got a little bit of color so it's
looking<00:00:42.949> promising<00:00:43.660> this<00:00:44.660> is<00:00:44.780> our<00:00:44.930> new<00:00:45.140> test

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
looking promising this is our new test

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.290 
looking promising this is our new test
site<00:00:45.739> we're<00:00:45.980> up<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:46.160> Northern<00:00:46.610> Ontario<00:00:49.300> we

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
site we're up in Northern Ontario we

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.880 
site we're up in Northern Ontario we
looked<00:00:50.629> around<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:51.050> lot<00:00:51.289> of<00:00:51.440> rivers<00:00:51.710> this

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
looked around a lot of rivers this

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.160 
looked around a lot of rivers this
summer<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:52.910> far<00:00:53.559> this<00:00:54.559> little<00:00:54.890> gem<00:00:56.170> seems

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
summer and so far this little gem seems

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.729 
summer and so far this little gem seems
to<00:00:57.289> be<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.469> boat<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.739> best<00:00:57.949> spot<00:00:58.280> we<00:00:58.460> can<00:00:58.579> find

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
to be the boat the best spot we can find

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.880 
to be the boat the best spot we can find
so<00:01:00.739> we're<00:01:00.890> gonna<00:01:00.980> keep<00:01:01.280> classifying<00:01:01.969> here<00:01:02.890> run

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
so we're gonna keep classifying here run

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.760 
so we're gonna keep classifying here run
some<00:01:04.070> more<00:01:04.220> material<00:01:04.699> through<00:01:05.620> this<00:01:06.620> is

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.560 

where<00:02:07.870> you<00:02:08.050> see<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.380> river<00:02:08.590> now<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.330> river

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
where you see the river now the river

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.040 
where you see the river now the river
actually<00:02:10.840> used<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.950> be<00:02:12.070> above<00:02:12.420> 30<00:02:13.420> feet<00:02:13.750> into

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
actually used to be above 30 feet into

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.500 
actually used to be above 30 feet into
the<00:02:14.170> bush<00:02:14.320> over<00:02:14.650> there<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.090> think<00:02:16.180> our<00:02:16.450> next

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
the bush over there so I think our next

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.240 
the bush over there so I think our next
target<00:02:16.960> is<00:02:17.290> actually<00:02:17.440> going<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.830> be<00:02:17.920> inside

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
target is actually going to be inside

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.740 
target is actually going to be inside
the<00:02:18.430> bush<00:02:18.640> they're<00:02:18.880> trying<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.270> catch<00:02:19.480> this

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
the bush they're trying to catch this

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.540 
the bush they're trying to catch this
inside<00:02:20.170> corner<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:21.270> see<00:02:22.270> what<00:02:22.420> happens<00:02:23.550> so

inside corner and see what happens so

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.260 
inside corner and see what happens so
