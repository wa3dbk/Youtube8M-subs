00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
like I said you know it's going to be a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.240 
like I said you know it's going to be a
great<00:01:06.659> challenge<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.590> thing<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.040> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
great challenge the thing that that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
great challenge the thing that that
makes<00:01:08.460> them<00:01:08.640> effective<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> do

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
makes them effective as they kind of do

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380 
makes them effective as they kind of do
both<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.520> keep<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
both you know they can keep it in the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.620 
both you know they can keep it in the
quarterbacks<00:01:12.840> hands<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.320> little<00:01:13.439> bit<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:15.600> know

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
quarterbacks hands a little bit you know

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.359 
quarterbacks hands a little bit you know
and<00:01:16.020> also<00:01:16.259> throw<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> football<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.220> that's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and also throw the football and that's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.859 
and also throw the football and that's
the<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.610> thing<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.000> he<00:01:18.299> knows<00:01:18.479> everybody

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the one thing I think he knows everybody

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.450 
the one thing I think he knows everybody
talks<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.170> him<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.040> running<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
talks about him you know running the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460 
talks about him you know running the
football<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.869> know<00:01:21.900> me<00:01:22.200> being<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
football but I you know me being a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.990 
football but I you know me being a
second<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:22.979> guy<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.640> watch<00:01:23.790> how

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
second there guy I kind of watch how

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.580 
second there guy I kind of watch how
effective<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.659> he<00:01:24.960> throws<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.439> football

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
effective that he throws the football

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.539 
effective that he throws the football
too<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.409> challenge<00:01:28.829> is

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
too so that's what I think challenge is

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.819 
too so that's what I think challenge is
