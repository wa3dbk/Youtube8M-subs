00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello everyone saw a small left 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.330
 lichku on kia sorento who went with 3 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.080
 years as far as I remember and tutor above 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:18.619
 you rent it here is such a material 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:25.170
 stainless steel are notable for the diameter 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:28.170
 pipes we have 76 millimeters lateral the same 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 and most notably the central 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:38.879
 the same 76 is usually the central tube 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:41.940
 thinner than the exterior plus it 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.789
 bulged forward bulged forward 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:51.600
 often the central tube is just straight 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:54.360
 and thinner places are made below 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 move the number so as not to be bullet to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.800
 comrades cops there was not superfluous 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:10.850
 questions on the good here we are one here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:14.510
 the second bracket and we have such here 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.510
 also in stainless steel 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.040
 can be seen wike bolts hardware has it all 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.729
 flopped 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.729
 instruction 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.570
 kia sorento 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.100
 it is written that we come out well and how that 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.050
 where shorter everything is attached for 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.270
 complete happiness to install 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.270
 even step by step is painted as will be 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.659
 kenguryatnik still interesting in that its 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.390
 principle can be put on different 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.880
 cars here there is no sign that he 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.750
 sorento that is, it just became court other 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.009
 brackets here again pretty 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.000
 can easily be cut off or some 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.000
 plates from the same ones that go to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.209
 the kit can bend them rearranged 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.489
 to another car 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:25.900
 the opponent is very interesting what how 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:28.959
 appearance behind the scenes there pipe well in 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.970
 In general, then all all while subscribe to 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.209
 my video feed will continue to be many 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.209
 interesting
