your your your home network rather with

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.070 
your your your home network rather with
a<00:00:25.949> router<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.640> some<00:00:26.910> sort<00:00:27.150> then<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.810> what<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
a router of some sort then you what you

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.359 
a router of some sort then you what you
would<00:00:28.170> need<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.890> go<00:00:29.130> into<00:00:29.279> your

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
would need to do is go into your

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.720 
would need to do is go into your
settings<00:00:30.529> it<00:00:31.529> will<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.160> take<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
settings it will then and take you to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
settings it will then and take you to
the<00:00:32.910> main<00:00:33.510> settings<00:00:33.930> screen<00:00:34.110> which<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.469> just

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the main settings screen which is just

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.760 
the main settings screen which is just
the<00:00:34.890> Wi-Fi<00:00:35.700> screen<00:00:36.059> if<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.200> enabled

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the Wi-Fi screen if this is not enabled

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.100 
the Wi-Fi screen if this is not enabled
so<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.700> green<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.600> would<00:00:39.719> like

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
so if this is not green you would like

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.639 
so if this is not green you would like
this<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.840> for<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.350> if

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
this for I just for I just do that if

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
this for I just for I just do that if
it's<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.309> then<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.640> need<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> enable

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it's like that then you need to enable

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's like that then you need to enable
it<00:00:46.070> like<00:00:47.070> so

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it like so

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.190 
it like so
it<00:00:47.610> will<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:47.910> turn<00:00:48.149> green<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.930> start

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it will then turn green and then start

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200 
it will then turn green and then start
scanning<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.680> any<00:00:49.860> nearby<00:00:50.129> networks<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.149> if

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
scanning for any nearby networks now if

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.700 
scanning for any nearby networks now if
you've<00:00:51.390> hidden<00:00:51.840> your<00:00:52.230> networks<00:00:53.219> name<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.910> SSID

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
you've hidden your networks name or SSID

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.290 
you've hidden your networks name or SSID
but<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> both<00:00:56.039> mean<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.309> same<00:00:56.430> thing<00:00:56.789> what

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
but the both mean the same thing what

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.729 
but the both mean the same thing what
you<00:00:57.390> need<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.870> manually<00:00:58.379> enter<00:00:58.649> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
details of your network so it can

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.640 
details of your network so it can
connect<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.290> all<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.530> is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
button I've already done this I'm just

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.149 
button I've already done this I'm just
going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> cancel<00:01:58.140> out<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.619> dialog<00:01:58.950> and

going to cancel out of this dialog and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.880 
going to cancel out of this dialog and
then<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.670> will<00:01:59.759> bring<00:01:59.880> up<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:01.380> Wi-Fi

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
then it will bring up the the Wi-Fi

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.490 
then it will bring up the the Wi-Fi
network<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.700> along<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.750> any<00:02:03.960> intercept<00:02:04.380> is

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
network here along with any intercept is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.709 
network here along with any intercept is
still<00:02:04.979> scanning<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.490> picking<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.420> then

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
still scanning or picking up and then

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.930 
still scanning or picking up and then
once<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.890> should<00:02:08.190> say<00:02:08.369> connected

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
once you it should say connected

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.990 
once you it should say connected
underneath<00:02:09.300> there<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:11.250> should<00:02:11.370> also<00:02:11.610> see

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
underneath there and you should also see

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.059 
underneath there and you should also see
a<00:02:12.500> Wi-Fi

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
a Wi-Fi

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.179 
a Wi-Fi
sign<00:02:15.060> basically<00:02:15.540> looks<00:02:16.080> like<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.290> radar<00:02:16.620> type

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
sign basically looks like a radar type

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.729 
sign basically looks like a radar type
of<00:02:17.400> sign<00:02:17.640> with<00:02:18.150> two<00:02:18.450> arrows<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.260> pointing

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
of sign with two arrows one pointing

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.429 
of sign with two arrows one pointing
down<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.189> one<00:02:20.340> pointing<00:02:20.909> upwards<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.959> upwards

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
down on one pointing upwards the upwards

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.670 
down on one pointing upwards the upwards
lights<00:02:23.129> up<00:02:23.400> green<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.299> downwards<00:02:24.810> life

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
lights up green and the downwards life

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.490 
lights up green and the downwards life
stop<00:02:26.040> orange<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:26.730> once<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.689> that<00:02:27.959> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
stop orange so once you have that that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.440 
stop orange so once you have that that
basically<00:02:28.890> means<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.220> are<00:02:29.250> connected<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:30.060> a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
basically means you are connected to a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.710 
basically means you are connected to a
network<00:02:30.659> you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.290> also<00:02:31.470> go<00:02:31.829> down<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.720> about

network you can also go down to about

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.849 
network you can also go down to about
device<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:35.420> go<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.659> status<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:38.150> also<00:02:39.150> see

so<00:02:51.409> that<00:02:52.409> was<00:02:52.790> connecting<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.909> a<00:02:53.940> Wi-Fi

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
so that was connecting to a Wi-Fi
