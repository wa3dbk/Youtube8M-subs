00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.630
 good dari mustard welcome to this 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.090
 new spot light 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.230
 today we are talking about a mod that in my opinion 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.480
 it is very beautiful and adds goblins 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.850
 their villages naturally in this 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.150
 case we have two villages one that is 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.490
 spurred naturally on the other hand 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.980
 artificially smeared sky I 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.699
 we have as you see different goblins and 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.589
 some have different uses for us 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.179
 example 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.749
 this is the woodcutter then we have the 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.510
 miner 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:40.479
 then we took those who kill 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.710
 that some are found on these cannes 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:45.429
 let's say and some people are not sure 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.289
 how to tell you 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:51.389
 then we have the archers the one with 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:54.729
 the bow and in any case we have several goblins 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:55.989
 then within their villages up 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.539
 for the date within them 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.569
 villages we can find things 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.729
 in fact precious that you see we find 5 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:07.720
 gold bars 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.400
 here we see here 10 bars of 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.040
 iron and so on 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.560
 and always if we can get into 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.170
 these villages because they are a lot 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.500
 difficult to defeat 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.640
 apart from that they are very strong then they are 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.560
 different and therefore very difficult 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.830
 going down inside this box 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.080
 to see what they dug then there 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.020
 I show a little how it only works 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.540
 like the co2 and then it gives way they add 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.790
 here is another spiner to expose 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:46.380
 others and these are the miners here 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:48.640
 they were fine so we can go back but 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.360
 Now I see one up there that's me 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.110
 waiting for 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.290
 in fact it is also easy what 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.670
 adds we have this we launch is 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.790
 for magic goblins 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.800
 in fact this look is wonderful 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.909
 this then we have these c 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.660
 teleports very nice these must us 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:16.930
 carry not where he decides 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.160
 us but behind the village then we have 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.810
 a catania look at it after the most 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.590
 kill a goblin we have these that 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.750
 instead look here launched with them 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.850
 flames when we hit it with something 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.900
 I really like this sword so much 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.180
 that we have these are very beautiful 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.420
 these when we throw them at the same 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.400
 year of the same are of the arrows and 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.980
 We bombs bombs that are beautiful 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.350
 do not affect there they kill the hunchbacks but not 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:56.110
 kill do not destroy the village 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.940
 then we have this that instead like 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.650
 you see lightning spears and this is a lot 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.030
 good if we want to kill them because 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.070
 immediately kill them example here there 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:15.750
 they are many and throw to the ground and die 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:17.950
 all and enough then I know I said it all e 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.810
 let's say where there are magic ones 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.610
 because as you can see here they can do 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.780
 potions and everything then continues to kill 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.510
 stop 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.959
 and nothing we see each other 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.090
 videos I hope for everything if you have any 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.000
 doubt of tender and maybe one day there 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.040
 I will make a vast light spot say of the vi 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.920
 I will say that I said 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.470
 of ovidy everything for example vat of 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.090
 crafting then let's say how to spur it on and 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.160
 see you so well at the next video 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.500
