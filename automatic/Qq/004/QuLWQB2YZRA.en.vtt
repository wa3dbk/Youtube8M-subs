mil on one end a 13 mil on the other

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.340 
mil on one end a 13 mil on the other
maybe<00:01:17.640> require<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.450> loosen<00:01:18.780> off<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:19.140> 10

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
maybe require you to loosen off your 10

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.160 
maybe require you to loosen off your 10
mil<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.070> side<00:01:20.630> push<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> bolt<00:01:21.960> through

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
mil on this side push the bolt through

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.990 
mil on this side push the bolt through
and<00:01:22.530> then<00:01:23.009> twist<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.520> clicker<00:01:23.700> into

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and then twist your clicker into

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.120 
and then twist your clicker into
position<00:01:24.479> depending<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.110> whether<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.890> want

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
position depending on whether you want

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.960 
position depending on whether you want
one<00:01:26.310> through<00:01:26.580> six

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
one through six

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.149 
one through six
so<00:01:27.689> each<00:01:28.020> click<00:01:28.350> usually<00:01:28.710> gives<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.979> about

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
so each click usually gives you about

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.630 
so each click usually gives you about
250<00:01:30.090> rpm<00:01:30.270> per<00:01:30.840> click<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.040> you're<00:01:32.189> revving

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
250 rpm per click so if you're revving

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.990 
250 rpm per click so if you're revving
at<00:01:33.619> 8,000<00:01:34.619> rpm<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.579> want<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
at 8,000 rpm and you want to get a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
at 8,000 rpm and you want to get a
little<00:01:36.180> bit<00:01:36.360> more<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.170> sled<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.979> can

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
little bit more out of your sled you can

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.710 
little bit more out of your sled you can
bump<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.759> click<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.329> should<00:01:39.540> put

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
bump it up one click and that should put

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.580 
bump it up one click and that should put
you<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.170> another<00:01:40.530> 250<00:01:41.460> rpm<00:01:41.720> if<00:01:42.720> you're<00:01:43.200> revving

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you up another 250 rpm if you're revving

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.460 
you up another 250 rpm if you're revving
at<00:01:43.909> 7600<00:01:44.909> RPM<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.689> might<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> bump<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> up

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
at 7600 RPM you might want to bump it up

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.370 
at 7600 RPM you might want to bump it up
a<00:01:46.619> few<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.280> retry<00:01:48.030> your<00:01:48.060> sled<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.720> then

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
a few and then retry your sled and then

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
a few and then retry your sled and then
