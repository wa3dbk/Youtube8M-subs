00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 are in the Crimean capital Simferopol the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.940
 use of mini unmanned aircraft of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.519
 called drone is increasing but still 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809
 there is no legislation to regulate the use 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.670
 of these devices 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.289
 one of the largest programs of the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.510
 Portuguese Air Force 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.710
 the first missions can happen 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.710
 within two years 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.320
 It looks like a toy but it's a 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.649
 unmanned aerial vehicles of the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.750
 Portuguese air force was in 2009 with 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.989
 I am the development of this 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.340
 technology the last two years have been 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.340
 passed in the air 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.860
 inside take care of buying a set 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.290
 unified from two locations 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.960
 I know this technology is in context 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.440
 and the lens or programs from the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.450
 Santa Cruz is because it was not by port 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.610
 and we see a text two years from the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 opportunity to test this technology 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.650
 in a built set of contest flights 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.670
 on the sea namely a lot of decision 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.500
 to withdraw the billet in the water an inversion 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.840
 of the coastline and identification of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.619
 benefit is another and the voice of these 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.869
 gadgets 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.200
 The pilot staying out knows us well. 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.310
 aircraft of this model is has the system 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.440
 simplest basic vote matiko is 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 composed of an autopilot one 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.550
 power board 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.520
 a camera to shoot with some good 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.310
 directed video transmission in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.979
 direct base is mobile ground can be 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.229
 displaced to any point because it is 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.440
 sums up little equipment 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.440
 the antenna transmit and receive data a 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.259
 computer control is another camera to 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.899
 mini aircraft almost like a game of 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.030
 computer is here it's like a 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.470
 therefore hit the flight data or 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.250
 it is not 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:23.700
 we have a map and we have the lion's plans 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:26.130
 and large system and leave on the map 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.470
 the lions need to be a plan 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.220
 and the security whites that are 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.470
 the le point of the hospital when I 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.030
 first link for any reason 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.700
 where you are back to a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.740
 comfort that over the duvet 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.950
 has never happened so far and have 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.940
 carried out over 900 flights in a total of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.140
 500 hours 97% of the area under 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.250
 responsibility of the authorities 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.530
 portuguese 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.340
 is the water and the extension of the platform 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.580
 continental 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.890
 to make these operations even more 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.200
 the potential of these devices goes there 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.269
 the military aspect rest Air Force 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.459
 plans to use 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.459
 with civil society 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.549
 in this other text, fifa was to verify 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.290
 high voltage poles 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.690
 one of the jobs that the military 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.140
 plan to make in the future and that 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.760
 currently is by helicopters with the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.430
 social risks 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.950
 the goal is not to replace the 94 but rather 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.810
 complement the capabilities and 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.060
 advantages of this technology are 11 is a 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.370
 technology that is in terms of pressure 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.620
 cheap is not the pilot risk death 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.680
 we can take risks that are not 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.629
 We were assumed to have articulate 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.760
 great potential as a tool for 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.700
 parliamentary oversight of the European Parliament 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.000
 just voted on a proposal to ban 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.290
 the air attacks with the so-called drones 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.480
 used in the United States 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.910
 portugal is at the forefront and 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.859
 integrates the perseus program aimed at 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.470
 create a unified network of 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.079
 monitoring where all the advantages 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.049
 there are also costs 50 cents 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:16.930
 fuel arrive for an hour flight in 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.079
 2014 promises to be a decisive year in 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.000
 development of these new technologies 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.789
 increasingly accessible 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.979
 within two or three years and to 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.430
 how they can become a presence 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:33.490
 habitat in the Portuguese coastal zone 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.270
 precious weapon in force patrolling
