if<00:00:06.690> you're<00:00:06.930> asked<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.320> describe<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.950> computer

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
if you're asked to describe the computer

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.270 
if you're asked to describe the computer
system<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.540> might<00:00:09.690> quite<00:00:09.959> rightly<00:00:10.280> describe

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
system you might quite rightly describe

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.499 
system you might quite rightly describe
something<00:00:11.549> like<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.789> desktop<00:00:12.360> computer

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
something like a desktop computer

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.140 
something like a desktop computer
there's<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.169> keyboard<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.039> monitor<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.700> box

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
there's a keyboard and a monitor a box

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.179 
there's a keyboard and a monitor a box
of<00:00:15.360> electronics<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.200> does<00:00:16.350> processing<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
of electronics that does processing and

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.669 
of electronics that does processing and
storing<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> information<00:00:18.689> we<00:00:19.529> could

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:19.679 
storing of the information we could

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.120 
storing of the information we could
think<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.869> possibly<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.080> laptop<00:00:22.949> device

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
think of it as possibly a laptop device

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.519 
think of it as possibly a laptop device
and<00:00:23.580> mobile<00:00:25.070> computing<00:00:26.070> twice<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:27.529> more

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and mobile computing twice or more

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.640 
and mobile computing twice or more
recently<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.460> could<00:00:29.640> think<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.999> devices<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
recently we could think of devices that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.750 
recently we could think of devices that
do<00:00:32.120> such<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> smartphone<00:00:33.840> or<00:00:34.289> a<00:00:34.469> tablet<00:00:34.770> then

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
do such as a smartphone or a tablet then

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.670 
do such as a smartphone or a tablet then
perform<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> role<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> computer<00:00:39.530> but<00:00:40.530> what

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
perform the role of computer but what

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.010 
perform the role of computer but what
I'd<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.949> do<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.460> video<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:42.180> consider

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I'd like to do in this video is consider

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170 
I'd like to do in this video is consider
a<00:00:43.140> computer<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:44.219> something<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:45.059> bit

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
a computer as something a little bit

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.500 
a computer as something a little bit
different<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> model<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> computer

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
different as a model of the computer

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.549 
different as a model of the computer
essentially<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.660> computers<00:00:49.109> do<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.410> they

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
essentially what computers do is they

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.180 
essentially what computers do is they
process<00:00:50.309> information<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:52.739> obvious<00:00:53.039> we're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
process information so obvious we're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.880 
process information so obvious we're
going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> need<00:00:53.519> to<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.780> form<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.260> input

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
going to need to have some form of input

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.099 
going to need to have some form of input
into<00:00:56.460> our<00:00:56.850> system<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.539> provide<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
into our system to provide the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.930 
into our system to provide the
information<00:00:58.370> this<00:00:59.370> could<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.670> things<00:00:59.789> like

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
information this could be things like

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.210 
information this could be things like
keyboards<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.929> mice<00:01:01.370> microphones<00:01:02.370> joysticks

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
keyboards and mice microphones joysticks

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.010 
keyboards and mice microphones joysticks
touchscreens<00:01:05.220> etc<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.509> then<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
touchscreens etc and then when the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.230 
touchscreens etc and then when the
computer<00:01:07.500> processes<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.549> information

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
computer processes this information

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.620 
computer processes this information
normally<00:01:10.080> done<00:01:10.259> by<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.500> CPU<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.090> output

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
normally done by the CPU we can output

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.600 
normally done by the CPU we can output

the computer by allowing applications to
