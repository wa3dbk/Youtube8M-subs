00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
on through now let's see moving on to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.680 
on through now let's see moving on to
stocks<00:00:31.980> again<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.969> very<00:00:33.030> similar<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
stocks again this is very similar to the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.229 
stocks again this is very similar to the
one<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.590> Mac<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.610> add<00:00:35.760> your<00:00:35.940> stocks

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
one on the Mac you can add your stocks

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.340 
one on the Mac you can add your stocks
and<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.719> them<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:36.989> using<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.950> chart

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
and look at them at using the chart

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.780 
and look at them at using the chart
looks<00:00:40.350> very<00:00:40.620> much<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.100> widget<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.760> can

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
looks very much like a widget you can

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.740 
looks very much like a widget you can
remove<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:43.110> TNT<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.070> then<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.610> add<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.300> new

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
remove a TNT and then you can add a new

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.569 
remove a TNT and then you can add a new
stock<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.440> plus<00:00:46.680> sign<00:00:46.710> hit<00:00:47.280> done<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
stock with that plus sign hit done and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.910 
stock with that plus sign hit done and
again<00:00:48.360> it'll<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.780> edge<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.230> Wi-Fi<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.680> keep

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
again it'll use edge or Wi-Fi to keep

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.500 
again it'll use edge or Wi-Fi to keep
your<00:00:50.070> stocks<00:00:50.340> perfectly<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> date<00:00:51.300> right

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
your stocks perfectly up to date right

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630 
your stocks perfectly up to date right

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
now the markets are closed so this is

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.490 
now the markets are closed so this is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
limited in its usefulness and then

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.020 
limited in its usefulness and then
tomorrow<00:00:55.649> morning<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> fun<00:00:56.399> begins<00:00:56.730> again

in<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:31.979> rural<00:01:32.490> area<00:01:33.000> let's<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.079> zoom<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
in some rural area let's just zoom out a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
in some rural area let's just zoom out a
little<00:01:34.740> more<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:36.810> go<00:01:37.020> into

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
little more and we can also go into

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 
little more and we can also go into
satellite<00:01:37.740> view<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.450> we're

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
satellite view and we can see that we're

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.510 
satellite view and we can see that we're
in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> middle<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.229> farmland<00:01:40.619> let's<00:01:41.400> go

in the middle of farmland let's go

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.870 
in the middle of farmland let's go
somewhere<00:01:41.790> more<00:01:41.909> interesting<00:01:42.720> let's<00:01:42.960> go<00:01:43.290> to

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
somewhere more interesting let's go to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.060 
somewhere more interesting let's go to
recents<00:01:44.880> how<00:01:45.600> about<00:01:45.869> France<00:01:46.380> let's<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.009> to
