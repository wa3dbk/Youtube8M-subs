 is him and I know where I am cordial 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.120
 Welcome to a small announcement 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.020
 video and two important things or 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.170
 But think things of interest in one 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.340
 compiled on the one hand here 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.830
 On the one hand , I wanted you first 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.099
 give notice now is a 16 32 17 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.310
 watch live stream city ​​skyler into the city 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.929
 skylines occurs think spice channel left 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.489
 the video description as always and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.630
 just sit over it and go 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.969
 watch how long you make 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.170
 I have dsl now and now i want to 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.190
 actually everything is going too 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.809
 primetime i had it too 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.730
 probably because of that more regularly 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.110
 primetime scream and today 17 o'clock 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 Now we would be our city next 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.070
 we build together with a higher one 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.570
 fall so the streaming falls 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.250
 had started we have already 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.070
 30,000 inhabitants or so the team 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.750
 solid thing so and now for the second 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.100
 point here, that's already me 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.180
 'm just a few people 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.530
 as well as already noticed the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.109
 on my facebook page 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.550
 I am just about to 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.820
 to take care of or merchandising 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.000
 motives and since yesterday I'm there 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.140
 to create the final motifs 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.850
 those faces here had the yes 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.900
 Thrush painted for me you have live 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.930
 he had made this stream 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.820
 made faces and meanwhile has 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.220
 a few variations and so I have then 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.040
 the bubbles created but this 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.450
 I wanted to make a lot of heaps 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.009
 Just show it like his team 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.630
 Not everything we would look like now 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.979
 actually the t-shirt I have that too 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.170
 he will still give a pillow and mugs 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.460
 We created them see also something 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.659
 has a wonderful morning 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.040
 and so I just wanted to look 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.500
 show it to you and you see something 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.060
 now write to the things a few 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.470
 I'm unsure of things, for example 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.759
 If I want to send one at all 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.079
 So for the mouse I had that 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.509
 himself painted just like that himself 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.649
 I do not know if I painted it myself 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.240
 first deep boarding or whether I 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.479
 First of all let there be yours, for example 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.619
 feedback of interest so tomorrow 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.970
 latest about tomorrow then 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.219
 Send and then the shop will be ready 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.420
 and I am right now 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.850
 again bastian I show that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.320
 you look just like that 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.729
 which is already relatively finalist for 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.670
 example that here so that I actually 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.869
 quite cool with here raid team that is 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.250
 But shit this heap I have 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.539
 By the way, made yourself 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.480
 I say the consumption every time 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.440
 if not the job I have it too 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.570
 already a poll on facebook 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.130
 Lying in the logo is a few 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.410
 people had said yes so far cool if 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.490
 you are therefore the lettering shopping field and 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.590
 I just have it my banner of 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.520
 Biologists I think I like the front 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.870
 i will do the writing i will too 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.760
 So the only question is stop 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.490
 I leave that with or without 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.310
 logan I think but actually with 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.600
 cooler so I have to be honest 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.830
 yes write again but there are 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.940
 since already survey on facebook can 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.620
 also like to go on facebook and still 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.940
 time bowl that is also the chief 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.130
 boss I asked with or without 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.470
 logo I do not really like it 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.790
 better and so far most of them 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.910
 that's probably why it is here 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.670
 I can make and go 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.140
 I think I have that is already a 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.989
 a bit simpler can sometimes 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.110
 show yes it's about that 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.890
 about final and the plain white 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.390
 not me 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.680
 can be that on some of these too 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.209
 I have those two too 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.530
 times here with the lettering made 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.239
 where to just taste no idea 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.530
 I have no offer to arrive 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.590
 If he ever pick someone 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.090
 so I do not know 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.049
 So what else do we have here ? 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.220
 that here I will do everything somehow 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.230
 imagine that you should 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.489
 actually on the pillow do not know 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.230
 If I put that on a t-shirt after that 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.459
 ultimately with a spade of bees 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.750
 I know quite well on the pillow 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.630
 On a cup that could be 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.650
 maybe even rubber on it 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.880
 you can write if a t-shirt can 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.209
 what actually open up I know it 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.030
 Not 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.989
 Let's have a nice good day 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.970
 Here I am still a bit uncertain 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.190
 because of the bubble if I leave that there 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.570
 I've finished this once 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.410
 That's about it 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.549
 already go back not quite cool 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.630
 By the way, a t-shirt color and so can 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.890
 of course, then choose if 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.290
 you I'm right there for example 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.790
 Master and good fit is like that 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.620
 made and, by the way, the logo that 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.950
 is not some program now 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.329
 I just think it's cool I know 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.560
 not what you write about it and what I do 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.329
 because it will mainly interest what is 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.620
 She said to those two motives 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.269
 on the one hand the mouse but this with 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.579
 the dome plate is the time itself 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.959
 by completely painted alone yet 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.579
 shit took a long time but it's fun 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.200
 made and paint one again 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.760
 Last time I scribbled something too 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.480
 my schooldays in the school staple the 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.220
 what had been 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.310
 Well palm tree remains maybe I have to 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.780
 to make a tree care gb 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.250
 it could not but be rectangular 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.750
 not to mention as well 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.040
 did not actually secure cool because 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.139
 you can always write with what you do 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.160
 think about it and just like the mouse 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.320
 could also write 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.460
 I had just such a bubble inside 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.370
 where the so-called balloon where the band 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:42.710
 I think I did like it though 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:43.880
 without almost better I do not know it 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.080
 give up to 1000 different 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.580
 possibilities in theory I can 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.930
 Even the logo could take away the mouse 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.510
 is up here somehow after girls 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.740
 a lot smaller at the moment 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.030
 possibilities that's why it's actually 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.190
 not so easy what you do there 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.630
 I'm curious what you are 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.910
 but writes here as just seen 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.410
 I'll go back here I would 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.460
 that's the first time I imagine 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.900
 It's not bad and as I said that 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.190
 could also do as a pillow and so is 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.780
 of course a bit of advertising is clear 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.700
 one will always give for the job 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.080
 so of course I would pay attention 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.669
 do that right now 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.370
 I can not blame you 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.020
 but I would love to have feedback about that 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.780
 listen what you say so we do 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.830
 place and of course brings nothing 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.370
 if now one writes that is 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.020
 crap 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.160
 that does not help me but 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.720
 Maybe it can be that now 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.450
 somehow very many say the power 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.419
 please be brave, but also use it 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.100
 this palm tree would have been striking or something 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.840
 I'm betting on it then I would 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.860
 that's exactly what they are doing 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.490
 that with the mouse, I 'm curious 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:41.120
 what he says that you are too 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.710
 have been and I will be on everyone 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.300
 case number then information media 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.800
 then do the video right if that's all 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.910
 So, that's it when I'm done 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.520
 I read that feedback then I will 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.539
 Everything will finish the shop so 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.970
 my partner and that is 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.479
 probably now going to be shirts 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.320
 I will then send the motives 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.729
 and will do that for me 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.870
 set up and when it's all done 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.180
 there 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.530
 there can be almost like merchandising 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.600
 buy stuff so incidentally I am 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.950
 curious; excited 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.050
 I'm really curious about the things that 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:17.030
 So I painted myself 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.650
 I had no trouble for a long time 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.120
 We had fun together and I have 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.730
 I will give it to you so that I can you 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.960
 I 'm not good at promising today 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.880
 So as I said 17 clock it starts 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.990
 another 20 minutes time that would work already 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.450
 the busiest I wanted to just 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.770
 let's see what you say 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.990
 and as I said I'm also still one 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.910
 if real big information video 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.150
 the shop is ready I give you 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.600
 so good and see it live
