but<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.170> fun<00:00:25.380> weird<00:00:25.650> about<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.890> aids<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:27.740> orb<00:00:28.740> in

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
but I fun weird about it aids the orb in

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.799 
but I fun weird about it aids the orb in
between<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:30.560> streams<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.950> chemtrails<00:00:32.809> it

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
between the two streams of chemtrails it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.319 
between the two streams of chemtrails it
keeps<00:00:34.230> perfect<00:00:34.679> formation<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.850> them<00:00:36.059> like

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
keeps perfect formation with them like

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.279 
keeps perfect formation with them like
almost<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.320> thru<00:00:37.499> invisable<00:00:38.210> triangle

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
almost like it thru invisable triangle

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:53.660 
almost like it thru invisable triangle
leaving<00:00:40.289> those<00:00:40.969> lines<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> sky

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.790 

and<00:00:54.670> look<00:00:55.300> how<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.449> cuts<00:00:55.719> off<00:00:56.219> contrail<00:00:57.219> my<00:00:57.609> ass

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and look how it cuts off contrail my ass

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.669 
and look how it cuts off contrail my ass
and<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:01.059> going<00:01:01.210> straight<00:01:01.690> up<00:01:01.809> they<00:01:02.620> are

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
and just going straight up they are

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.230 
and just going straight up they are
basically<00:01:03.540> drawing<00:01:04.540> on<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.019> sky<00:01:06.240> some

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:20.080 
basically drawing on the sky some

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.240 

I<00:01:20.149> just<00:01:20.840> thought<00:01:20.990> that<00:01:21.289> was<00:01:21.770> really<00:01:21.979> weird

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
I just thought that was really weird

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.289 
I just thought that was really weird
what<00:01:23.000> is<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:23.270> orb<00:01:23.509> doing<00:01:23.929> there<00:01:25.299> there's

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
what is that orb doing there there's

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.700 
what is that orb doing there there's
something<00:01:26.479> else<00:01:26.689> happening<00:01:27.109> here<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.500> we

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
something else happening here that we

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.669 
something else happening here that we
don't<00:01:27.890> even<00:01:28.119> see<00:01:29.119> it's<00:01:29.810> probably<00:01:30.140> has<00:01:30.500> nothing

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
don't even see it's probably has nothing

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.130 
don't even see it's probably has nothing
to<00:01:30.920> do<00:01:31.069> with<00:01:31.189> airplanes<00:01:31.869> it's<00:01:32.869> probably

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
to do with airplanes it's probably

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.800 
to do with airplanes it's probably
something<00:01:33.380> else

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.240 

next<00:01:38.810> one<00:01:41.230> you<00:01:42.230> see<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.530> same<00:01:42.740> thing<00:01:43.040> of

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
next one you see the same thing of

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.960 
next one you see the same thing of
chemtrails<00:01:44.240> start<00:01:44.900> out<00:01:45.050> of<00:01:45.170> nowhere<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.970> I

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
chemtrails start out of nowhere and I

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.080 
chemtrails start out of nowhere and I
found<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:47.420> on<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:48.080> foreign<00:01:49.070> website<00:01:49.550> for

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
found this on a foreign website for

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.230 
found this on a foreign website for
meteorite<00:01:50.750> enthusiasts<00:01:51.620> who<00:01:52.240> record

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
meteorite enthusiasts who record

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.450 
meteorite enthusiasts who record
fireballs<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.200> shooting<00:01:54.770> stars<00:01:55.010> with<00:01:55.370> their

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
fireballs and shooting stars with their

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.550 
fireballs and shooting stars with their
cameras<00:01:55.880> they<00:01:56.720> set<00:01:56.960> them<00:01:57.110> up<00:01:57.230> at<00:01:57.380> night<00:01:57.410> and

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
cameras they set them up at night and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.290 
cameras they set them up at night and
then<00:01:57.860> they<00:01:57.950> just<00:01:58.160> automatically<00:01:58.640> record<00:01:59.120> when

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
then they just automatically record when

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.470 
then they just automatically record when
something<00:01:59.660> moves<00:01:59.840> I<00:02:00.520> dug<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.790> dug<00:02:01.820> for<00:02:02.300> these

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
something moves I dug and dug for these

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.070 
something moves I dug and dug for these
videos<00:02:02.570> nobody<00:02:03.410> had<00:02:03.860> seen<00:02:04.130> them<00:02:04.310> before<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:05.080> was

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
videos nobody had seen them before I was

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.570 
videos nobody had seen them before I was
searching<00:02:06.290> in<00:02:06.650> different<00:02:07.010> languages<00:02:07.310> and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
searching in different languages and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.870 
searching in different languages and
everything<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.050> these<00:02:09.860> videos<00:02:10.280> are<00:02:10.459> legit

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
everything so these videos are legit

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.490 
everything so these videos are legit
because<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:12.620> people<00:02:12.950> who<00:02:13.030> posted<00:02:14.030> these<00:02:14.500> they

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
because the people who posted these they

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.600 
because the people who posted these they
don't<00:02:15.680> care<00:02:15.920> about<00:02:16.190> UFOs<00:02:16.790> they<00:02:17.690> care<00:02:17.990> about

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
don't care about UFOs they care about

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.540 
don't care about UFOs they care about
getting<00:02:20.200> comets<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.440> meteors<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.810> it

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
getting comets and meteors and it's it

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.960 
getting comets and meteors and it's it
so<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.050> under<00:02:27.380> their<00:02:27.560> little

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
so this is just under their little

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.050 
so this is just under their little
section<00:02:28.970> for<00:02:29.770> unexplainable<00:02:30.770> stuff<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.340> they

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
section for unexplainable stuff and they

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.860 
section for unexplainable stuff and they
have<00:02:32.180> hardly<00:02:32.990> said<00:02:33.290> much<00:02:33.500> else<00:02:33.709> about<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.040> I

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
have hardly said much else about it I

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.650 
have hardly said much else about it I
just<00:02:35.870> think<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.170> fascinating<00:02:36.350> look<00:02:36.830> at<00:02:36.980> this

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
just think it's fascinating look at this

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.780 
just think it's fascinating look at this
the<00:02:38.660> moon<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.230> melting<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:41.150> have<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:42.519> plane<00:02:43.519> or

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
the moon is melting you have a plane or

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.870 
the moon is melting you have a plane or
something<00:02:43.820> leaving<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:45.080> chem<00:02:45.950> trail<00:02:46.130> right<00:02:46.640> in

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
something leaving a chem trail right in

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.900 
something leaving a chem trail right in
front<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.780> blur<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.350> out<00:02:48.650> as<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.550> moon

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
front of it to blur it out as the moon

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.420 
front of it to blur it out as the moon
is<00:02:50.269> melting<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.019> then<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.860> blurs<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.310> out

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
is melting and then it blurs it out

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:03.190 
is melting and then it blurs it out
completely<00:02:52.959> that's<00:02:54.500> crazy
