to<00:00:43.000> go<00:00:43.090> ahead<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:43.540> make<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.900> u-shape<00:00:44.730> some<00:00:45.730> like

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
to go ahead and make a u-shape some like

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.720 
to go ahead and make a u-shape some like
this<00:00:46.650> then<00:00:47.650> you<00:00:47.710> want<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:47.890> go<00:00:48.040> ahead<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:48.460> break

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
up here on top and dust right there I'm

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.970 
up here on top and dust right there I'm
going<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.050> go<00:02:17.110> ahead<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.349> play<00:02:17.470> some<00:02:17.530> dust

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
going to go ahead and play some dust

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.720 
going to go ahead and play some dust
here<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:19.690> repeater<00:02:20.080> here<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.980> there<00:02:21.670> you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
here and a repeater here and there you

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.330 
here and a repeater here and there you
go<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.940> have<00:02:22.150> yourself<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.690> 1<00:02:22.900> wide<00:02:23.080> clock<00:02:23.500> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
go you have yourself a 1 wide clock that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.280 
go you have yourself a 1 wide clock that
you<00:02:24.459> can<00:02:24.610> also<00:02:24.760> mess<00:02:25.510> as<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.020> see<00:02:26.260> right

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
you can also mess as you can see right

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.830 
you can also mess as you can see right
now<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.709> actually<00:02:26.980> four<00:02:27.370> clock<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.719> was

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
now is actually four clock and it was

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.300 
now is actually four clock and it was
able<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.140> burn<00:02:29.349> out<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:29.829> i'll<00:02:29.920> go<00:02:30.069> ahead<00:02:30.099> and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
able to burn out so i'll go ahead and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.030 
able to burn out so i'll go ahead and
set<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.969> one<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.480> now<00:02:32.379> it<00:02:32.469> should<00:02:32.620> be<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.769> 5

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
set that to one and now it should be a 5

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.140 
set that to one and now it should be a 5
clock

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
clock

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.220 
clock
so<00:02:34.450> once<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> torches<00:02:35.349> unburn<00:02:35.950> out<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:37.230> think

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
so once the torches unburn out I think

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.720 
so once the torches unburn out I think
it<00:02:38.349> should<00:02:38.500> start<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:38.829> may<00:02:39.129> have<00:02:39.189> to<00:02:39.340> manually

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
it should start I may have to manually

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.229 
it should start I may have to manually
restart<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:41.340> go<00:02:42.340> ahead<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.640> try<00:02:42.760> manually

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
restart it go ahead and try manually

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.410 
restart it go ahead and try manually
restarting<00:02:43.930> here<00:02:44.400> there<00:02:45.400> we<00:02:45.519> go<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.299> have

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
restarting here there we go so you have

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.210 
restarting here there we go so you have
to<00:02:46.540> mainly<00:02:46.900> restart<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.439> clock<00:02:47.769> if<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.040> burns

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
to mainly restart this clock if it burns

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.550 
to mainly restart this clock if it burns
out<00:02:48.459> but<00:02:49.180> here<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.569> actually<00:02:49.840> have<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:49.989> 1<00:02:50.319> wide

out but here you actually have a 1 wide
5<00:02:51.220> clock<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.689> even<00:02:52.780> put<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:53.049> lever<00:02:53.319> on

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.710 
there you go you have yourself a 1 wide
5<00:03:07.870> clock<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:09.280> can<00:03:09.430> even<00:03:09.549> take<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.180> up<00:03:10.299> make<00:03:10.690> it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
5 clock you can even take it up make it

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.789 
5 clock you can even take it up make it
a<00:03:10.840> 6<00:03:11.139> clock<00:03:11.500> make<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.489> seven<00:03:12.879> clock<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:14.530> it's

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
a 6 clock make it a seven clock so it's

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.069 
a 6 clock make it a seven clock so it's
pretty<00:03:15.099> easy<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.549> make<00:03:15.849> and<00:03:16.060> it's<00:03:16.659> a<00:03:16.840> pretty
