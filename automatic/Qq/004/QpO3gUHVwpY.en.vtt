00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.470 
the bench press it does stuff a lot yeah
so<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.780> our<00:02:09.929> thing<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:11.239> you<00:02:12.239> know<00:02:12.360> it's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
so this is our thing and you know it's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.530 
so this is our thing and you know it's
just<00:02:12.510> our<00:02:12.780> opinion<00:02:13.140> when<00:02:13.319> you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
just our opinion when you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.920 
just our opinion when you
the<00:02:13.629> flat<00:02:14.370> barbell<00:02:15.370> bench<00:02:15.760> pressing<00:02:16.269> you

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
the flat barbell bench pressing you

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.660 
the flat barbell bench pressing you
should<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.349> arching<00:02:17.829> your<00:02:17.859> back<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.370> you

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
should have a arching your back and you

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.220 
should have a arching your back and you
should<00:02:18.879> pin<00:02:19.090> your<00:02:19.239> shoulder<00:02:19.510> blades<00:02:19.719> back<00:02:19.959> and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
should pin your shoulder blades back and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.589 
should pin your shoulder blades back and
so<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.700> move<00:02:22.000> more<00:02:22.209> weight<00:02:22.390> do

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
so you can you can move more weight do

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.839 
so you can you can move more weight do
more<00:02:22.840> reps<00:02:23.109> which<00:02:23.409> is<00:02:23.530> great<00:02:23.799> right<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.219> what
