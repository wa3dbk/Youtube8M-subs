heads<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.770> their<00:00:56.340> face<00:00:56.579> isn't<00:00:57.000> quite<00:00:57.210> as

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
heads and their face isn't quite as

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.130 
heads and their face isn't quite as
narrow<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.660> rats<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.829> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.160> blunt<00:00:59.550> ended

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
narrow as rats it's kind of blunt ended

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.950 
narrow as rats it's kind of blunt ended
that's<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> best<00:01:01.410> way<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> describe<00:01:02.070> one<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
that's the best way to describe one I

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.670 
that's the best way to describe one I
can<00:01:03.960> think

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
can think

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.400 
can think
so<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.550> figured<00:01:06.000> how<00:01:06.540> much<00:01:06.780> harm<00:01:07.080> could<00:01:07.260> these

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
so we figured how much harm could these

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.370 
so we figured how much harm could these
overgrown<00:01:07.800> rents<00:01:08.490> due<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.850> our<00:01:09.000> wetlands<00:01:09.540> so

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
overgrown rents due to our wetlands so

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
overgrown rents due to our wetlands so
we<00:01:10.530> decided<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.980> eggs<00:01:11.540> that's<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.660> good

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
we decided to eggs that's a good

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.460 
we decided to eggs that's a good
question<00:01:13.010> it's<00:01:14.390> look<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.660> you<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.110> too<00:01:16.350> many

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
question it's look if you have too many

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.460 
question it's look if you have too many
cals<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.160> field<00:01:17.520> those<00:01:18.360> cows<00:01:18.690> can<00:01:18.960> /<00:01:19.229> graze

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
cals in the field those cows can / graze

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.320 
cals in the field those cows can / graze
that<00:01:19.740> field<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.460> instead<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.880> having<00:01:21.120> a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that field and so instead of having a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.090 
that field and so instead of having a
lot<00:01:21.510> of<00:01:21.660> grass<00:01:21.870> in<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.260> field<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.950> have

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
lot of grass in that field you have

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.760 
lot of grass in that field you have
nothing<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.580> barefield<00:01:24.350> nutria<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
nothing but barefield nutria can do the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.950 
nothing but barefield nutria can do the
same<00:01:26.010> thing<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.850> population<00:01:27.119> densities

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
same thing when the population densities

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.460 
same thing when the population densities
are<00:01:27.990> too<00:01:28.380> high<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.430> over<00:01:30.090> graze<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
are too high they can over graze the the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.100 
are too high they can over graze the the
marsh<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.820> cause<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.330> Marsh<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.810> start

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
marsh and they cause that Marsh to start

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.380 
marsh and they cause that Marsh to start
to<00:01:34.260> break<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.280> marsh<00:01:35.550> system<00:01:36.000> unlike<00:01:36.330> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
to break up the marsh system unlike a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.680 
to break up the marsh system unlike a
field<00:01:36.979> has<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> lot<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> water<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:39.060> flows<00:01:39.390> over

field has a lot of water that flows over
it<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.050> when<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.590> take<00:01:40.979> away<00:01:41.280> that

it and when you take away that
vegetative<00:01:42.270> cover<00:01:42.300> or<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.380> reach<00:01:43.649> when

the nutria for instance dig down and eat

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.350 
the nutria for instance dig down and eat
the<00:01:46.290> roots<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.800> plant<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.369> stirs<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:48.330> the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
time water flows through that system it

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.550 
time water flows through that system it
moves<00:01:53.190> out<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.729> sediment<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.440> causes<00:01:55.440> that

moves out the sediment and causes that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.910 
moves out the sediment and causes that
Marsh<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.340> disappear<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.149> land<00:01:57.420> itself

believe<00:05:11.840> suggested<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.440> new<00:05:12.590> solution<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:13.340> the

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
believe suggested a new solution to the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.930 
believe suggested a new solution to the
overpopulation<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.480> nutria<00:05:15.640> well<00:05:16.640> I<00:05:16.670> think

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
overpopulation of nutria well I think

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.580 
overpopulation of nutria well I think
the<00:05:17.150> only<00:05:17.180> opportunity<00:05:17.570> would<00:05:18.020> be<00:05:18.170> fed<00:05:18.350> food

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
the only opportunity would be fed food

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.450 
the only opportunity would be fed food
if<00:05:19.460> we<00:05:19.820> like<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.090> everybody<00:05:21.020> has<00:05:21.230> as<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.500> as<00:05:22.430> a

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
if we like it everybody has as a as a

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.640 
if we like it everybody has as a as a
food<00:05:22.760> item<00:05:22.790> I<00:05:23.240> think<00:05:23.810> that<00:05:23.960> nutria<00:05:24.350> would<00:05:24.530> be

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
food item I think that nutria would be

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.650 
food item I think that nutria would be
perfect<00:05:25.070> for<00:05:25.160> for<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.090> best<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.540> definitely
