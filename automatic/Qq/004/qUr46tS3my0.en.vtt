00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.719
 so good afternoon here's another report on 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.330
 completed order as necessary 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.049
 send far beyond to the scalp of a person 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.890
 No, so I post the video here for 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.789
 one can someone come in handy from 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.369
 this design so let's say so 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.099
 functional 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.579
 the questions are not all done to me in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.120
 according to the tasks that I 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:41.690
 It was delivered as well in electronics 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.690
 This is a standard switching power supply. 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:54.840
 here 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:59.390
 the controller board itself is there and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.379
 all say so and the signet is still in the blog 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.430
 micro sd card 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.920
 here it said kai well and this is a driver 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.950
 stepper motor 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.380
 if anyone interested in the scheme lay out 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:19.770
 miscalculations everything is let's say so all this 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.890
 the design makes the construction of taxis 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.150
 that's just such a type of device 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.500
 south air control system 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.390
 damper is priorovsky 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.829
 the USA drive it hot right away I say it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.829
 the design is just a model for 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.869
 demonstrations that is done over 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:49.200
 two days with a soldering iron and 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:58.020
 pliers so I say aesthetics 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:02:02.189
 not really a small block let's say 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 contacts now try to sharpen 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.829
 so the reed switches can be used not 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.259
 reed switches can mikriki any 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.200
 to put 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.459
 anything I found two reed switch here 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.079
 postal 2 reed switch 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:21.909
 and a pair of magnets such a construction 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.409
 so what was ordered was done 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.870
 turn on 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.920
 naturally output on the recharge column 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.200
 battery 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.829
 throttle closed means this 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.409
 yes by the way it was not it specifically for 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.970
 customer this was not in those jobs but 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:46.940
 I had a couple of exits I did 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.370
 control switch for hiv battery 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.519
 just here's a grass tronic key 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.760
 tronic rules off maybe 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.370
 battery require replacement here 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.389
 put 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.209
 it will control the battery 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:08.209
 here on the wire 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:12.319
 divider resistive wire by plus by 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:19.489
 battery minus and sound 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:22.730
 battery discharge alert so 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:27.069
 Well now those basic functions 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:31.040
 the first was an order just a signal and 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:35.260
 turn off the parking sensors ok 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.269
 tronic is ok ok tronic be filling and 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:43.609
 registrar nag i am registrar 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:48.319
 off here the same question was a choice 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:50.680
 voices here's a plug on earth 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:56.470
 and changing 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.470
 parking sensors turned on parking sensors off 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.109
 DVR is on 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:09.430
 DVR is turned off well this is 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:12.680
 voices now on the carburetor so here 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.650
 it's all a short to ground that is 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.729
 What buttons do you do there or 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.200
 just switch it already so he 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.200
 wish you already in place 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.130
 the throttle is open all 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.919
 throttle open reported 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.610
 now how much did you press open 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:42.720
 nothing will be there is no ball 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:55.470
 there is no overload say so 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:56.880
 action on another throttle pin 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.120
 damper shut down country 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.560
 Well then, there are similar but 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.789
 really all intermediate 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.669
 the state of everything remains that is you can 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:17.370
 like that to walk there with a button how many 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:25.470
 please everybody think twice in 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:28.340
 the other side here is the throttle 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.340
 is open 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.910
 bro strong flap closed everything 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.430
 the main condition was that 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:48.770
 nothing anywhere absolutely i will turn off 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:54.410
 to flip everything absolutely cold 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:59.910
 here the driver counted everything here everything 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:03.270
 absolutely cold criticism 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.180
 why not microcircuit lq 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:10.250
 elke bask immediately I say you need it 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:13.560
 there was a radiator noise and the customer was exactly 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.170
 the question of not heating anything 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.790
 because as I understood it already suffered with 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:25.290
 various designs souza all here 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:30.990
 absolutely everything is cold that is such 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:33.950
 Here is the design for the control valve 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.950
 throttle
