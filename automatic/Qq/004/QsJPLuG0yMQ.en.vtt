00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
so we already started doing this with a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.790 
so we already started doing this with a
consumer<00:00:59.809> model<00:01:00.809> pressure<00:01:01.170> washer<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.680> we

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
consumer model pressure washer that we

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.910 
consumer model pressure washer that we
bought<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.980> Walmart<00:01:02.660> said<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:03.960> standard<00:01:04.379> 1800

bought a Walmart said your standard 1800
psi<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:06.439> little<00:01:07.439> unit<00:01:07.740> there<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.869> think<00:01:09.869> this

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
psi a little unit there I think this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.740 
psi a little unit there I think this
part<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.650> took<00:01:10.860> about<00:01:11.070> three<00:01:12.000> hours<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.630> do

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
part here took about three hours to do

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
part here took about three hours to do
which<00:01:13.170> isn't<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:14.130> not<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> very<00:01:14.610> big<00:01:14.790> piece

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
which isn't it's not a very big piece

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.620 
which isn't it's not a very big piece
and<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.439> see<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> actually<00:01:16.950> left

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
and as you can see it actually left

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.170 
and as you can see it actually left
quite<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:19.549> of<00:01:20.549> residual<00:01:22.580> leftover<00:01:23.580> moss

out<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.130> wand<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.610> see<00:01:55.759> what<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.000> can<00:01:56.240> do<00:01:56.330> to

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
out the wand and see what that can do to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.249 
out the wand and see what that can do to
get<00:01:56.540> rid<00:01:56.659> of<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:58.780> okay<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.080> pretty

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
get rid of that okay this is pretty

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.060 
get rid of that okay this is pretty
basic<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.710> use<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:03.170> just<00:02:03.320> got<00:02:03.470> your<00:02:03.590> off<00:02:03.740> on

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
basic to use you just got your off on

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.399 
basic to use you just got your off on
switch<00:02:04.430> here<00:02:04.789> just<00:02:05.210> turn<00:02:05.390> that<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.289> is

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
switch here just turn that on this is

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.500 
switch here just turn that on this is
the<00:02:06.500> first<00:02:06.649> time<00:02:06.830> we've<00:02:06.979> actually<00:02:07.130> tried<00:02:07.430> this

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.680 

there's<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.660> choke<00:02:11.959> right<00:02:12.560> here<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:14.480> then<00:02:14.660> just

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
there's a choke right here and then just

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.390 
there's a choke right here and then just
give<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> slight<00:02:15.470> pull<00:02:15.890> yet<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.250> do<00:02:16.310> you

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
give that a slight pull yet so do you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.979 
give that a slight pull yet so do you
don't<00:02:16.519> need<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.700> crank<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.030> too<00:02:17.180> hard<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.569> then

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
don't need to crank it too hard and then

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.360 
don't need to crank it too hard and then
as<00:02:18.110> soon<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.470> fires<00:02:18.650> up<00:02:18.860> push<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.100> choke

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
as soon as it fires up push the choke

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.170 
as soon as it fires up push the choke
back<00:02:21.280> well<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.580> crank<00:02:22.850> it

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
back well you have to crank it

00:02:23.180 --> 00:03:19.700 
back well you have to crank it
you<00:02:23.569> can't<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:23.900> tuck<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.350> okay<00:02:24.769> shut<00:02:25.069> up

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:28.730 

you

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.800 

you
