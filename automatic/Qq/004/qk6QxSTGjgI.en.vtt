now let me just take these off as far as

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.840 
now let me just take these off as far as
articulation<00:00:14.559> goes<00:00:14.680> this<00:00:14.950> is<00:00:15.129> a<00:00:15.160> pretty<00:00:15.250> well

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:15.850 
articulation goes this is a pretty well

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.820 
articulation goes this is a pretty well
articulated<00:00:16.209> kit<00:00:16.840> considering<00:00:17.470> as<00:00:17.650> to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
articulated kit considering as to

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.499 
articulated kit considering as to
balance<00:00:18.189> out<00:00:18.369> such<00:00:18.610> a<00:00:18.640> big<00:00:18.910> backpack<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.529> first

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
balance out such a big backpack so first

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:29.310 
balance out such a big backpack so first
yeah<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.710> head<00:00:26.860> goes<00:00:27.099> up<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.779> far<00:00:29.079> and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
yeah so the head goes up that far and

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
yeah so the head goes up that far and
then<00:00:29.710> down<00:00:29.980> but<00:00:30.809> this<00:00:31.809> far<00:00:32.079> it<00:00:32.950> can<00:00:33.070> rotate

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
then down but this far it can rotate

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.709 
then down but this far it can rotate
side<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:34.420> side<00:00:35.100> pretty<00:00:36.100> far<00:00:36.370> out<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:40.480> not

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
side to side pretty far out and it's not

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.990 
side to side pretty far out and it's not
on<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.170> ball<00:00:41.350> joint<00:00:41.620> it's<00:00:41.950> actually<00:00:42.309> like<00:00:42.519> on

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
on the ball joint it's actually like on

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.869 
on the ball joint it's actually like on
a<00:00:43.030> peg<00:00:43.359> and<00:00:43.600> this<00:00:44.050> is<00:00:44.109> a<00:00:44.260> hinge<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.890> there's

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
a peg and this is a hinge and there's

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.259 
a peg and this is a hinge and there's
another<00:00:46.120> hinge<00:00:46.480> that<00:00:46.600> lets<00:00:47.019> it<00:00:47.140> go<00:00:47.289> side<00:00:47.620> to

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
another hinge that lets it go side to

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:54.259 
another hinge that lets it go side to
side<00:00:49.269> like<00:00:49.690> so<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.620> yeah<00:00:51.219> clear<00:00:51.670> red<00:00:51.789> piece

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.239 

all<00:00:55.269> right<00:00:55.359> take<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.260> backpack<00:00:56.440> off<00:00:56.829> so<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.100> can

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
all right take the backpack off so I can

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:06.420 
all right take the backpack off so I can
show<00:00:57.489> you<00:01:00.659> these<00:01:01.659> shoulders<00:01:02.260> go<00:01:03.330> forward<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
show you these shoulders go forward that

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.590 
show you these shoulders go forward that
far<00:01:06.700> back<00:01:07.600> not<00:01:07.930> as<00:01:08.080> far<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.620> go<00:01:09.550> they<00:01:10.479> are

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
far back not as far to go they are

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.780 
far back not as far to go they are
separate<00:01:11.020> so<00:01:11.530> they<00:01:11.770> can<00:01:11.979> wiggle<00:01:12.370> here<00:01:12.670> in

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
separate so they can wiggle here in

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.410 
separate so they can wiggle here in
their<00:01:12.960> arms<00:01:13.960> go<00:01:14.260> out<00:01:15.190> about<00:01:15.430> this<00:01:15.760> far<00:01:16.260> rotate

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
their arms go out about this far rotate

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.900 
their arms go out about this far rotate
360<00:01:19.420> without<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.470> gender<00:01:21.160> holders<00:01:21.640> on<00:01:23.910> but

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
360 without the gender holders on but

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.850 
360 without the gender holders on but
with<00:01:25.060> them<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:26.590> can<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:29.020> only<00:01:29.560> really

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
with them on they can can only really

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.800 
with them on they can can only really
rotate<00:01:30.220> about<00:01:31.860> yay<00:01:32.860> high<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:34.120> thrusters<00:01:34.630> on

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
rotate about yay high the thrusters on

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.560 
rotate about yay high the thrusters on
the<00:01:34.900> backpack<00:01:35.110> are<00:01:35.680> on<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:35.920> hinge<00:01:36.400> move<00:01:37.210> up<00:01:37.420> and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
the backpack are on a hinge move up and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.080 
the backpack are on a hinge move up and
down<00:01:37.750> with<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:39.570> um<00:01:40.830> actually<00:01:41.830> rotates<00:01:42.310> below

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
down with so um actually rotates below

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.130 
down with so um actually rotates below
the<00:01:43.240> shoulder<00:01:44.460> two<00:01:45.460> joints<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:46.450> up<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.020> the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
the shoulder two joints to up and the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.820 
the shoulder two joints to up and the
elbow<00:01:48.120> up<00:01:49.120> here<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:53.620> get<00:01:53.770> a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
elbow up here and here so you get a

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.660 
elbow up here and here so you get a
pretty<00:01:55.080> nice<00:01:56.080> been<00:01:56.410> considering<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.070> design

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
pretty nice been considering the design

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
pretty nice been considering the design
of<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.000> arm<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.590> wrist<00:02:00.460> will<00:02:00.700> also<00:02:01.090> move<00:02:01.270> up

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
of the arm the wrist will also move up

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.059 
of the arm the wrist will also move up
and<00:02:03.510> down<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:06.990> hands<00:02:07.990> are<00:02:08.140> actually<00:02:08.259> on<00:02:08.920> a

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
and down the hands are actually on a

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.460 
and down the hands are actually on a
pretty<00:02:09.690> nice<00:02:10.690> peg<00:02:11.340> system<00:02:12.340> there's<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.670> peg<00:02:12.879> or

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
pretty nice peg system there's a peg or

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.199 
pretty nice peg system there's a peg or
peg<00:02:14.470> hinge<00:02:14.739> system<00:02:14.920> actually<00:02:15.489> pegs<00:02:15.849> into<00:02:16.120> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
peg hinge system actually pegs into the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.569 
peg hinge system actually pegs into the
arm<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.599> they<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.620> move<00:02:17.830> back<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.280> forth

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
arm and they can move back and forth

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.410 
arm and they can move back and forth
like<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.689> also<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.439> know<00:02:20.530> rotate<00:02:21.420> by

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
like that and also you know rotate by

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.569 
like that and also you know rotate by
itself<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.260> come<00:02:23.469> off<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:24.700> can<00:02:24.819> also<00:02:24.939> go<00:02:25.560> and

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
itself and come off you can also go and

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.839 
itself and come off you can also go and
and<00:02:27.579> then<00:02:28.299> out<00:02:28.859> the<00:02:29.859> hands<00:02:30.370> are<00:02:30.519> of<00:02:30.640> course

like<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:20.739> take<00:03:21.159> off<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:22.529> white<00:03:23.529> part

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
like so and you take off the white part

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:32.980 
like so and you take off the white part
from<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:26.260> regular<00:03:26.799> hand<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:28.359> you<00:03:28.569> tap<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.139> on

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.190 

and<00:03:34.030> there<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.210> have<00:03:35.240> it<00:03:36.010> all<00:03:37.010> right<00:03:38.200> moving

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
and there you have it all right moving

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.900 
and there you have it all right moving
on<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.800> chest<00:03:40.070> yes<00:03:40.460> I<00:03:40.580> was<00:03:40.670> trying<00:03:40.850> to

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
on to the chest yes I was trying to

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.990 
on to the chest yes I was trying to
suggest<00:03:41.260> these<00:03:42.260> parts<00:03:42.770> these<00:03:43.460> blue<00:03:43.610> parts<00:03:43.910> are

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
suggest these parts these blue parts are

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.290 
suggest these parts these blue parts are
actually<00:03:44.090> separate<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.020> what<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.290> can<00:03:45.440> do<00:03:45.650> is

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
actually separate so what you can do is

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.410 
actually separate so what you can do is
have<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.450> wiggle<00:03:47.660> my<00:03:47.900> place<00:03:48.620> but<00:03:49.150> up<00:03:50.150> there

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
have to wiggle my place but up there

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:58.060 
have to wiggle my place but up there
yeah<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.590> yeah<00:03:55.000> they<00:03:56.000> can<00:03:56.240> go<00:03:56.450> forward<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.650> lot

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
yeah so yeah they can go forward a lot

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.070 
yeah so yeah they can go forward a lot
more<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.640> then<00:03:58.760> backwards<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.420> lot<00:03:59.600> more<00:03:59.810> too

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
more and then backwards a lot more too

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.490 
more and then backwards a lot more too
and<00:04:00.350> then<00:04:01.280> they<00:04:01.850> can<00:04:02.000> also<00:04:02.150> help<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.080> arm<00:04:03.260> move

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
and then they can also help the arm move

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.030 
and then they can also help the arm move
all<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:03.980> way<00:04:04.100> up<00:04:04.810> like<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.350> kind<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.740> looks

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
all the way up like so it kind of looks

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.230 
all the way up like so it kind of looks
weird<00:04:07.250> but<00:04:08.090> it's<00:04:08.480> nice<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:09.020> have<00:04:09.140> that<00:04:09.290> option

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
weird but it's nice to have that option

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.810 
weird but it's nice to have that option
the<00:04:11.240> waist<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:12.050> on<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.230> ball<00:04:12.560> joint<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:15.410> goes

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
the waist is on a ball joint so it goes

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.090 
the waist is on a ball joint so it goes
down<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.360> then<00:04:17.660> it's<00:04:17.930> also<00:04:18.260> on<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.560> hinge<00:04:18.739> so

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
down and then it's also on the hinge so

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.890 
down and then it's also on the hinge so
then<00:04:19.220> go<00:04:19.340> side<00:04:19.670> very<00:04:20.570> far<00:04:21.040> inside<00:04:22.360> almost<00:04:23.360> very

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
then go side very far inside almost very

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.070 
then go side very far inside almost very
unnaturally<00:04:24.560> looking<00:04:25.480> it<00:04:26.480> is<00:04:26.660> connected<00:04:27.050> to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
unnaturally looking it is connected to

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.260 
unnaturally looking it is connected to
the<00:04:27.400> waist<00:04:28.400> view<00:04:28.640> wall<00:04:28.880> joint<00:04:31.060> these<00:04:32.060> side

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
the waist view wall joint these side

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.340 
the waist view wall joint these side
skirts<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.140> ball<00:04:33.290> joint<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:35.170> then<00:04:36.170> this

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
skirts on the ball joint and then this

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.339 
skirts on the ball joint and then this
is<00:04:36.500> on<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.710> hinge<00:04:39.700> the

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
is on the hinge the

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.980 
is on the hinge the
beam<00:04:42.919> sabers<00:04:43.339> are<00:04:43.639> also<00:04:44.149> articulated<00:04:44.719> it<00:04:44.869> can

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
beam sabers are also articulated it can

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.309 
beam sabers are also articulated it can
go<00:04:45.139> side<00:04:45.889> to<00:04:45.919> side<00:04:48.879> leg<00:04:49.879> is<00:04:49.999> on<00:04:50.119> a<00:04:50.149> tear<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.199> the

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
go side to side leg is on a tear of the

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.730 
go side to side leg is on a tear of the
thighs<00:04:52.159> on<00:04:52.399> the<00:04:52.520> like<00:04:52.729> and<00:04:52.969> PEG<00:04:54.189> the<00:04:55.189> ties<00:04:55.669> on<00:04:56.180> a

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
thighs on the like and PEG the ties on a

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.239 
thighs on the like and PEG the ties on a
peg<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:58.009> hinge<00:04:58.669> system<00:04:58.969> so<00:04:59.569> they<00:05:00.289> go<00:05:00.439> up<00:05:00.680> there

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:01.249 
peg and hinge system so they go up there

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.089 
peg and hinge system so they go up there
they<00:05:01.369> go<00:05:01.520> out<00:05:01.729> about<00:05:02.059> that<00:05:02.270> far<00:05:02.539> they<00:05:02.990> go<00:05:03.169> back

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
they go out about that far they go back

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.070 
they go out about that far they go back
about<00:05:04.520> that<00:05:04.729> far<00:05:04.969> you<00:05:05.839> can<00:05:06.110> slide<00:05:06.529> them<00:05:06.680> down

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
about that far you can slide them down

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.170 
about that far you can slide them down
so<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.649> can<00:05:09.770> have<00:05:09.949> them<00:05:10.069> go<00:05:10.189> out<00:05:10.430> a<00:05:10.819> bit

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
so you can have them go out a bit

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.709 
so you can have them go out a bit
further<00:05:11.449> and<00:05:11.839> back<00:05:12.229> a<00:05:12.589> little<00:05:12.830> bit<00:05:13.009> further<00:05:13.719> if

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:14.719 
further and back a little bit further if

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.409 
further and back a little bit further if
you<00:05:14.779> have<00:05:15.080> them<00:05:15.589> up<00:05:15.770> they<00:05:16.219> can<00:05:16.399> go<00:05:16.580> out<00:05:16.819> but

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
you have them up they can go out but

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.510 
you have them up they can go out but
that<00:05:17.659> far<00:05:17.899> before<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.529> side<00:05:18.770> skirts<00:05:19.129> start<00:05:19.399> to

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
that far before the side skirts start to

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.369 
that far before the side skirts start to
pop<00:05:19.669> off<00:05:19.990> move<00:05:20.990> them<00:05:21.110> down<00:05:21.139> they<00:05:21.649> can<00:05:21.830> go<00:05:22.279> all

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
pop off move them down they can go all

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:29.199 
pop off move them down they can go all
all<00:05:24.379> the<00:05:24.529> way<00:05:24.619> out<00:05:27.069> does<00:05:28.069> rotate<00:05:28.369> below<00:05:28.939> the

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:29.209 
all the way out does rotate below the

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:36.339 
all the way out does rotate below the
eye<00:05:29.860> there<00:05:33.789> and<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:34.909> two<00:05:35.089> points<00:05:35.449> up<00:05:35.779> here<00:05:36.110> and

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
eye there and the two points up here and

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:45.449 
eye there and the two points up here and
down<00:05:37.099> here<00:05:37.599> so<00:05:38.599> you<00:05:38.659> do<00:05:38.990> get<00:05:39.259> a<00:05:41.740> full<00:05:43.509> 90<00:05:44.509> degree

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:45.459 
down here so you do get a full 90 degree

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:49.079 
down here so you do get a full 90 degree
bend<00:05:46.459> what's<00:05:46.759> nice<00:05:47.089> about<00:05:47.120> it<00:05:47.599> is<00:05:47.719> that<00:05:48.559> this

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.089 
bend what's nice about it is that this

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:52.739 
bend what's nice about it is that this
little<00:05:50.089> flap<00:05:50.300> here<00:05:50.330> moves<00:05:50.930> up<00:05:51.319> and<00:05:51.529> down<00:05:51.620> too

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:52.749 
little flap here moves up and down too

00:05:52.749 --> 00:06:00.960 
little flap here moves up and down too
so<00:05:53.749> it<00:05:53.839> doesn't<00:05:54.139> hinder<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:57.610> leg<00:05:58.610> Bend

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.600 

the<00:06:01.660> ankle<00:06:01.990> armor<00:06:02.350> moves<00:06:02.590> up<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:04.300> down<00:06:05.610> same

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
the ankle armor moves up and down same

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.860 
the ankle armor moves up and down same
with<00:06:06.730> the<00:06:06.850> back<00:06:07.500> ankle<00:06:08.500> moves<00:06:08.920> side<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:09.870> the

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
with the back ankle moves side to the

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.100 
with the back ankle moves side to the
side<00:06:11.050> about<00:06:11.200> that<00:06:11.470> far<00:06:12.270> so<00:06:13.270> I<00:06:13.300> can't<00:06:13.660> do<00:06:13.780> a<00:06:13.810> full

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
side about that far so I can't do a full

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.080 
side about that far so I can't do a full
split<00:06:14.320> but<00:06:14.860> I<00:06:14.890> can<00:06:15.100> come<00:06:15.310> pretty<00:06:15.460> close<00:06:15.700> with

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
split but I can come pretty close with

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.490 
split but I can come pretty close with
his<00:06:16.180> feet<00:06:16.620> touching<00:06:17.620> the<00:06:17.770> ground<00:06:18.960> it<00:06:19.960> goes<00:06:20.200> up

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
his feet touching the ground it goes up

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.040 
his feet touching the ground it goes up
and<00:06:20.740> down<00:06:20.830> about<00:06:21.490> that<00:06:21.670> far<00:06:21.730> you<00:06:22.390> move<00:06:22.570> these

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050

back they do the Jan Drive holders go

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.590 
back they do the Jan Drive holders go
out<00:07:15.550> about<00:07:15.790> that<00:07:16.000> far<00:07:16.300> and<00:07:17.280> not<00:07:18.280> and<00:07:18.580> in<00:07:19.090> not

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:19.600 
out about that far and not and in not

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.450 
out about that far and not and in not
all<00:07:19.750> that<00:07:19.870> much<00:07:20.080> but<00:07:20.650> what<00:07:20.919> you<00:07:21.010> can<00:07:21.160> do<00:07:21.310> with

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
all that much but what you can do with

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.490 
all that much but what you can do with
these<00:07:21.640> is<00:07:21.970> you<00:07:22.030> lock<00:07:22.540> it<00:07:24.780> with<00:07:25.780> this<00:07:26.020> you<00:07:26.230> slide

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.500 
these is you lock it with this you slide

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.010 
these is you lock it with this you slide
this<00:07:26.680> up<00:07:26.950> and<00:07:27.340> it<00:07:28.030> basically<00:07:28.150> locks<00:07:28.720> it<00:07:28.900> in

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
this up and it basically locks it in

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.710 
this up and it basically locks it in
this<00:07:29.169> position<00:07:30.450> so<00:07:31.450> if<00:07:31.690> you<00:07:31.840> want<00:07:32.020> to<00:07:32.110> have<00:07:32.260> the

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 
this position so if you want to have the

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.020 
this position so if you want to have the
double-o<00:07:34.720> riser<00:07:34.960> parts<00:07:35.800> like<00:07:36.460> spread<00:07:37.000> out

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
double-o riser parts like spread out

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.840 
double-o riser parts like spread out
it'll<00:07:37.930> stay<00:07:38.169> and<00:07:38.470> it<00:07:38.590> won't<00:07:38.740> droop<00:07:39.190> down<00:07:39.430> which

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:39.850 
it'll stay and it won't droop down which

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.590 
it'll stay and it won't droop down which
is<00:07:40.000> a<00:07:40.030> pretty<00:07:40.540> good<00:07:40.750> idea<00:07:40.780> as<00:07:41.650> for<00:07:42.010> the<00:07:42.100> cockpit

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
is a pretty good idea as for the cockpit

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.180 
is a pretty good idea as for the cockpit
all<00:07:43.600> you<00:07:43.780> have<00:07:43.870> to<00:07:43.990> do<00:07:44.140> really<00:07:44.410> is<00:07:44.650> just<00:07:44.680> like
