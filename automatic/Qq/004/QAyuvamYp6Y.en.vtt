ball works let me tell you about our

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.260 
ball works let me tell you about our
driver<00:01:17.619> we've<00:01:18.619> got<00:01:18.800> a<00:01:18.830> thin<00:01:19.190> beta<00:01:19.550> titanium

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
driver we've got a thin beta titanium

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.630 
driver we've got a thin beta titanium
face<00:01:20.570> which<00:01:20.930> means<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.710> golf<00:01:21.920> ball<00:01:22.160> Rockets

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
face which means the golf ball Rockets

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.640 
face which means the golf ball Rockets
off<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.970> face<00:01:23.180> at<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.450> higher<00:01:23.660> speed<00:01:23.930> which

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
off the face at a higher speed which

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.950 
off the face at a higher speed which
means<00:01:24.860> more<00:01:25.100> distance<00:01:25.580> you've<00:01:26.420> also<00:01:26.600> got<00:01:26.930> a

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
means more distance you've also got a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.219 
means more distance you've also got a
larger<00:01:27.410> Club<00:01:27.650> at<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.979> normal<00:01:28.400> it's<00:01:28.600> 475<00:01:29.600> CCS

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
larger Club at the normal it's 475 CCS

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.920 
larger Club at the normal it's 475 CCS
and<00:01:30.920> what<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:31.310> translates<00:01:31.820> into<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.660> more

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
and what that translates into is a more

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.620 
and what that translates into is a more
stable<00:01:33.229> club<00:01:33.680> head<00:01:33.890> off<00:01:34.430> center<00:01:34.759> gift<00:01:35.000> which

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
stable club head off center gift which

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.719 
stable club head off center gift which
means<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.020> hit<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.320> ball<00:01:36.470> straighter<00:01:36.920> so

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
means to hit the ball straighter so

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.999 
means to hit the ball straighter so
straighter<00:01:38.090> farther<00:01:38.800> translates<00:01:39.800> into

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
straighter farther translates into

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.900 
straighter farther translates into
better<00:01:40.280> golf<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.420> high<00:01:41.570> technology<00:01:41.869> head

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
better golf is the high technology head

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.580 
better golf is the high technology head
lastly<00:01:43.910> we've<00:01:44.119> got<00:01:44.149> higher<00:01:44.690> loft<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.259> some<00:01:45.500> of

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
lastly we've got higher loft on some of

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.560 
lastly we've got higher loft on some of
these<00:01:45.680> clubs<00:01:46.039> so<00:01:46.670> for<00:01:46.880> people<00:01:47.060> with<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.420> low
