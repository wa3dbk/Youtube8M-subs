 dog owner has a baby herself 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.540

 Of course that also means 24 hours 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.630
 Around the clock as with the little baby 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.810

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.310
 Behave and stick us on the heel 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.799
