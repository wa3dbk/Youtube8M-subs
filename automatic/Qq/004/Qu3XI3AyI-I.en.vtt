00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.750
 Welcome to Houston Causa 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.060
 today's episode is about the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.910
 fabled attempt of success 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.860
 qualified the line today first 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.480
 a few basic things we do 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.469
 you the matter and the construction of the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.050
 people want to bring the experiment in advance 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.700
 the success is qualified delikt 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.520
 Not hard 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.219
 there are very many similar ones 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.590
 The concepts one later in the 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.539
 fullness of the system as a whole 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.850
 probably no longer confused exactly 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.690
 can separate from each other if that 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.059
 happened the klausur ran therefore 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.609
 when we have a great thought together 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.850
 developing a system that should mean 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:01.629
 we will be a simple one if that 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.820
 then have the system 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.590
 we always have to do that 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.229
 and then arrive automatically 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.370
 Correct result means nothing else 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.680
 if you have the same system 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.160
 it is internalized here a whole 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.920
 simple number but first in advance 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.660
 some preliminary remarks we will become some 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.900
 get to know the concepts 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.120
 which we must know by heart 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.350
 memorized so that we can 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.480
 not understood with similar 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.330
 confound 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.370
 It is always mentioned 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.130
 note some exceptions like 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.470
 always in criminal law it must be us completely 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.290
 be clear and important that we 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.400
 understand that the exceptions only 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.280
 exceptions are 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.980
 shall mean our thoughts steam may 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.660
 not be falsified because we only have the 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.320
 know complicated exception 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.370
 no, a normal case must also 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.930
 recognized 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.230
 that is important and then too 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.110
 We can now be solved 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.880
 thought system even here it will be 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.040
 give all super survey 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.149
 this survey is our complete one 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.099
 thought system 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.590
 We have to learn them and then only 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.330
 Step by step, undo these 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.060
 comes in the next video and on 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.640
 next but also here first 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.860
 again a preliminary remark to the thought 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.069
 system the thought system too 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.859
 mastering is cool 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.019
 but if you do not realize that here 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.859
 at the attempt of the success qualification 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.069
 is the real shit is therefore the 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:39.129
 first note our thought system 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.530
 will be triggered if we are one of the two 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.750
 following constellations in one 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.030
 Have a clerk 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.659
 someone has a homicide without that 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.819
 One dies also takes the takes 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.969
 to settle death in buying that 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.419
 thoughts system automatically off or 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.959
 now the second constellation someone 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:03.129
 dies 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.989
 no matter how that means we will remember soon 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.579
 Someone has something to do 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.319
 We automatically think of the success 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.599
 qualified attempt or tried 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.389
 success mitigation the same thing happens 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.849
 us if someone dies someone wants 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.980
 kill someone or someone dies completely 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.750
 Just do these two things as soon as we do 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.290
 always remember the thought 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.469
 to steer 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.810
 It sounds so easy, but it does 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:28.659
 always has to force himself 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.409
 as soon as someone has an abortion or 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:35.489
 one bothers me directly automatically 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.930
 thought differently system 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.579
 that was actually all the preliminary remarks 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.409
 in the next video we will start 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.489
 right 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.489
 as far as europe gate
