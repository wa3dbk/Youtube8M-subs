mob<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:03.959> dead<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.470> today<00:00:04.740> i<00:00:04.770> thought<00:00:05.040> i

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
mob of the dead and today i thought i

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.860 
mob of the dead and today i thought i
would<00:00:05.220> show<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.549> what<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:06.060> probably<00:00:06.569> one<00:00:06.839> of

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
would show you what is probably one of

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.830 
would show you what is probably one of
the<00:00:07.020> best<00:00:07.200> solo<00:00:07.680> strategies<00:00:08.309> for<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:08.970> map<00:00:09.269> so

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
the best solo strategies for this map so

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.810 
the best solo strategies for this map so
if<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.440> find<00:00:10.650> yourself<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.280> public<00:00:11.610> lobby

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
if you find yourself in a public lobby

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.400 
if you find yourself in a public lobby
and<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.210> don't<00:00:12.389> have<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> teammate<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.200> roll

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
and you don't have a teammate to roll

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.320 
and you don't have a teammate to roll
with<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.309> probably<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> better

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
with this is probably one of the better

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.450 
with this is probably one of the better
strategies<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> guys<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.130> although

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
strategies that you guys can do although

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.220 
strategies that you guys can do although
i<00:00:17.789> would<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.240> note<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.109> going

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
i would like the note that this is going

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.960 
i would like the note that this is going
to<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.439> boring<00:00:19.680> game<00:00:20.189> played<00:00:20.430> you're

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
to be boring game played you're

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.490 
to be boring game played you're
basically<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.750> be<00:00:21.810> sitting<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.439> this

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
basically going to be sitting in this

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.290 
basically going to be sitting in this
ledge<00:00:22.890> right<00:00:23.130> here<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:23.939> you're<00:00:24.119> playing

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
ledge right here and if you're playing

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.630 
ledge right here and if you're playing
to<00:00:24.510> win<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> spot<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.039> go<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:26.550> if

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
to win this is a spot to go to but if

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.339 
to win this is a spot to go to but if
you<00:00:26.789> wanna<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.150> fun<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> run<00:00:27.930> around<00:00:28.199> this

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
you wanna have fun and run around this

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.439 
you wanna have fun and run around this
probably<00:00:28.890> isn't<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> spot<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.060> want<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> be

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
probably isn't the spot you want to be

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.810 
probably isn't the spot you want to be
in<00:00:30.619> basically<00:00:31.619> what<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.579> go

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
in basically what you want to do is go

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
in basically what you want to do is go
to<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.090> very<00:00:33.300> top<00:00:33.600> floor<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.500> cell<00:00:34.829> block

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to the very top floor of the cell block

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.910 
to the very top floor of the cell block
area<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.730> camp<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.750> catwalk<00:00:37.260> area<00:00:37.530> right

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
area in camp on this catwalk area right

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.190 
area in camp on this catwalk area right
here<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.579> reminds<00:00:38.910> me<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.120> lot<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.750> strategy

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
here it reminds me a lot of the strategy

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350 
here it reminds me a lot of the strategy
on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> map<00:00:40.739> die<00:00:40.950> I'm<00:00:41.280> sorry<00:00:41.579> Duriez<00:00:41.969> where

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
on the map die I'm sorry Duriez where

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.940 
on the map die I'm sorry Duriez where
you<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.690> sit<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> catwalk<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.739> shoot

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you just sit on the catwalk and shoot

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.619 
you just sit on the catwalk and shoot
anything<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> comes<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.910> front<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
anything that comes in front of you and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.299 
anything that comes in front of you and
for<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.140> most<00:00:46.320> part<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.710> strategy<00:00:47.129> works

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
for the most part the strategy works

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.979 
for the most part the strategy works
pretty<00:00:47.520> well<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.969> spawns<00:00:48.329> come<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> nice

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
pretty well the spawns come in a nice

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.779 
pretty well the spawns come in a nice
pace<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:49.649> don't<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.950> too<00:00:50.100> overwhelming

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
pace and they don't get too overwhelming

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.279 
pace and they don't get too overwhelming
keep<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.420> mind<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.690> zombies<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
keep in mind the zombies are going to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.959 
keep in mind the zombies are going to
come<00:00:52.469> from<00:00:52.739> two<00:00:52.949> spots<00:00:53.309> they're<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
come from two spots they're going to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
come from two spots they're going to
either<00:00:54.090> crawl<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> railing<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.230> they're

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
either crawl up the railing or they're

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.810 
either crawl up the railing or they're
gonna<00:00:55.559> come<00:00:55.860> from<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.160> front<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.579> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
gonna come from in front of you so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.430 
gonna come from in front of you so
you'll<00:00:56.969> notice<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.989> steady

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you'll notice I'm going to get a steady

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
you'll notice I'm going to get a steady
flow<00:00:58.680> zombies<00:00:59.219> coming<00:00:59.460> from<00:00:59.670> right<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
flow zombies coming from right here and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.479 
flow zombies coming from right here and
then<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:01.050> gonna<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.680> smaller<00:01:02.190> flow

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
then I'm gonna get a smaller flow

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
then I'm gonna get a smaller flow
zombies<00:01:03.000> coming<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.660> front<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.989> me

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
zombies coming from in front of me

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.570 
zombies coming from in front of me
you'll<00:01:04.589> notice<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.549> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you'll notice this is going to be a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.090 
you'll notice this is going to be a
fairly<00:01:05.909> easy<00:01:06.299> strategy<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.380> my<00:01:07.650> purse

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
fairly easy strategy but my purse

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
fairly easy strategy but my purse
selection<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:08.970> weapon<00:01:09.299> choices<00:01:09.659> are<00:01:09.869> very

this is the basic strategy it's pretty
easy<00:03:02.710> although<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.400> can<00:03:03.610> get<00:03:03.820> pretty<00:03:03.880> intense

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
easy although it can get pretty intense

in<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.750> 20s<00:03:05.170> although<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.590> should<00:03:05.860> be<00:03:06.010> able

in the 20s although you should be able
to<00:03:06.250> do<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:06.640> if<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.090> have<00:03:07.300> teammates<00:03:07.660> it

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
to do it and if you have teammates it

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.750 
to do it and if you have teammates it
can<00:03:07.930> become<00:03:08.080> even<00:03:08.590> easier<00:03:08.770> but<00:03:09.250> if<00:03:09.640> you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
can become even easier but if you
