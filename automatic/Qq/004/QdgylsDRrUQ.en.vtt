because this is a loopy yarn you won't

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.380 
because this is a loopy yarn you won't
have<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.920> be<00:03:44.099> as<00:03:44.189> careful<00:03:44.459> with<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.939> stitches

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
have to be as careful with the stitches

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.160

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.600 
but if you're using just on worsted
weight<00:03:49.349> and<00:03:49.620> make<00:03:49.799> sure<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.159> match<00:03:50.340> your
