 well guys, I'll pass it on to you guys 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.619
 the equipment I'm using here 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.550
 bertioga to be able to fish for bass with 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.500
 floater 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.730

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.540
 Behind 20 pounds, I'm fine. 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.090
 using a 50-pound leader shock 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.480
 because it was stuck taking a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.920
 great bass and large mouth bass in 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.200
 big bass here 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.149
 he is very think he comes and how 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:55.379
 I'm doing it, I've prepared it now. 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.399
 It's true, I'm not going to fish with bait. 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.690
 artificial 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:05.640
 look there to fish prepared with care 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.400
 with scut floor very well there that I made one 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.700
 generator is looking here 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.090
 a June 3 generator not you place the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.350
 clamp with the buoy on the other you put the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:24.119
 Leader the hook to steal it to dig 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.170
 upra shrimp 2/0 of those to whom nÃ© 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.659
 then it looks like it's easy to hitch fast if 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.369
 you want to fish artificial lure only 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:40.829
 you take it look here it picks up the inep places 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.189
 here it's ready, it's ready, it works well 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.770

 well done so I can get it is to steal 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.500
 Look, it's more or less here 50 55 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.219
 centimeters in length 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.329
 the stride here is that you when 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.860
 It's near the antler you leave more or 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.740
 less the distance the ball because otherwise 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.030
 shrimp goes there is a hint if 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.160
