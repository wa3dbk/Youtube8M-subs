hello<00:00:04.630> there<00:00:04.900> today<00:00:05.740> we<00:00:06.010> got<00:00:06.160> a<00:00:06.220> little<00:00:06.730> issue

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
hello there today we got a little issue

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.039 
hello there today we got a little issue
of<00:00:07.180> the<00:00:07.240> water<00:00:07.450> heater<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:09.719> little<00:00:10.719> bit<00:00:10.870> of<00:00:10.960> a

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
of the water heater a little bit of a

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.279 
of the water heater a little bit of a
leak<00:00:11.230> at<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.469> top<00:00:11.770> end<00:00:12.100> of<00:00:12.250> it<00:00:12.400> here<00:00:13.289> the

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:14.289 
leak at the top end of it here the

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.670 
leak at the top end of it here the
person<00:00:14.709> was<00:00:14.940> quite<00:00:15.940> concerned<00:00:16.480> as<00:00:17.320> they<00:00:17.470> seen

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
person was quite concerned as they seen

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.760 
person was quite concerned as they seen
a<00:00:17.710> puddle<00:00:18.010> of<00:00:18.070> water<00:00:18.130> on<00:00:18.520> the<00:00:18.609> floor

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
a puddle of water on the floor

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.270 
a puddle of water on the floor
fortunately<00:00:20.770> in<00:00:20.860> this<00:00:21.010> case<00:00:21.070> it's<00:00:23.250> not<00:00:24.250> a

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
fortunately in this case it's not a

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.660 
fortunately in this case it's not a
leaking<00:00:24.910> tank<00:00:25.300> but<00:00:25.600> a<00:00:25.630> leaking<00:00:26.080> fitting<00:00:26.670> so

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
leaking tank but a leaking fitting so

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.340 
leaking tank but a leaking fitting so
we're<00:00:27.820> gonna<00:00:27.910> pull<00:00:28.450> that<00:00:28.480> fitting<00:00:29.020> out<00:00:29.170> of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
we're gonna pull that fitting out of

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.980 
we're gonna pull that fitting out of
there<00:00:29.560> take<00:00:30.490> a<00:00:30.520> look<00:00:30.789> for<00:00:30.970> any<00:00:31.119> tank<00:00:31.480> damage

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
there take a look for any tank damage

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.889 
there take a look for any tank damage
and<00:00:32.610> that's<00:00:33.610> see<00:00:33.850> if<00:00:33.940> we<00:00:34.059> can't<00:00:34.300> get<00:00:34.420> this<00:00:34.660> leak

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
and that's see if we can't get this leak

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.920 
and that's see if we can't get this leak
stopped<00:00:35.230> up<00:00:35.500> today<00:00:36.150> so<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.180> lot<00:00:37.480> of<00:00:37.660> water

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
stopped up today so a lot of water

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.020 
stopped up today so a lot of water
heaters<00:00:38.200> develop<00:00:38.980> these<00:00:39.160> leaks<00:00:39.520> around<00:00:39.730> the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
heaters develop these leaks around the

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.910 
heaters develop these leaks around the
top<00:00:41.579> due<00:00:42.579> to<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.820> metals<00:00:43.239> not<00:00:43.800> liking<00:00:44.800> each

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
top due to the metals not liking each

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.400 
top due to the metals not liking each
other<00:00:45.160> basically<00:00:46.090> we<00:00:46.210> got<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.390> steel<00:00:46.720> tank<00:00:47.110> on

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
other basically we got a steel tank on

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.940 
other basically we got a steel tank on
the<00:00:48.040> water<00:00:48.250> heater<00:00:48.610> and<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:50.200> put<00:00:50.530> in<00:00:50.649> a<00:00:50.710> brass

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
the water heater and we put in a brass

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.229 
the water heater and we put in a brass
fitting<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:53.190> basically<00:00:54.190> you<00:00:54.430> have<00:00:54.579> chemical

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
fitting and basically you have chemical

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.770 
fitting and basically you have chemical
reactions<00:00:55.809> between<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.350> two<00:00:56.730> materials

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
reactions between the two materials

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.259 
reactions between the two materials
which<00:00:58.780> causes<00:00:59.910> oxidization<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.800> leakage<00:01:02.800> so

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
which causes oxidization and leakage so

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.550 
which causes oxidization and leakage so
hopefully<00:01:04.269> we<00:01:04.420> can<00:01:04.540> get<00:01:04.659> these<00:01:04.839> fittings<00:01:05.290> out

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
hopefully we can get these fittings out

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.800 
hopefully we can get these fittings out
and<00:01:05.740> get<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:05.950> cleaned<00:01:06.219> up<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.759> get<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.630> leak

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
and get it cleaned up and get the leak

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.919 
and get it cleaned up and get the leak
stopped<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.439> the<00:01:08.590> unit<00:01:09.149> you<00:01:10.149> can<00:01:10.329> see<00:01:10.569> on<00:01:10.749> the

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
stopped on the unit you can see on the

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:17.279 
stopped on the unit you can see on the
side<00:01:11.229> here<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.670> it's<00:01:15.789> actually<00:01:16.359> been

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
side here that it's actually been

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.230 
side here that it's actually been
leaking<00:01:17.709> from<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.009> top<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.609> coming<00:01:18.819> down<00:01:19.029> the

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
leaking from the top and coming down the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
leaking from the top and coming down the
side<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.719> water<00:01:19.899> heater<00:01:20.639> so<00:01:21.639> we're<00:01:22.270> gonna

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
side of the water heater so we're gonna

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.090 
side of the water heater so we're gonna
shut<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.130> main<00:01:24.310> water<00:01:24.670> supply<00:01:24.969> off<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:26.100> see

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
shut the main water supply off and see

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.639 
shut the main water supply off and see
if<00:01:27.189> we<00:01:27.369> can't<00:01:27.639> get<00:01:27.759> that<00:01:27.969> fitting<00:01:28.389> out<00:01:28.649> so

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
if we can't get that fitting out so

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.999 
if we can't get that fitting out so
let's<00:01:29.859> see<00:01:30.039> what<00:01:30.189> we<00:01:30.310> can<00:01:30.490> do<00:01:30.609> here<00:01:31.679> in<00:01:32.679> some

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
let's see what we can do here in some

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.800 
let's see what we can do here in some
cases<00:01:33.310> you're<00:01:33.639> going<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:33.789> be<00:01:33.939> lucky<00:01:34.149> enough<00:01:34.329> to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
cases you're going to be lucky enough to

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.050 
cases you're going to be lucky enough to
have<00:01:34.959> a<00:01:35.319> hot<00:01:35.529> and<00:01:35.649> cold<00:01:35.859> water<00:01:35.950> shut-off<00:01:36.579> valve

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
have a hot and cold water shut-off valve

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.859 
have a hot and cold water shut-off valve
above<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:38.079> water<00:01:38.289> heater<00:01:39.270> which<00:01:40.270> we<00:01:40.450> have<00:01:40.659> on

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
above the water heater which we have on

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.609 
above the water heater which we have on
this<00:01:41.049> on<00:01:41.889> this<00:01:42.219> unit<00:01:42.579> here<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.990> some<00:01:44.319> cases

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
this on this unit here in some cases

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.139 
this on this unit here in some cases
however<00:01:44.950> you're<00:01:45.459> not<00:01:45.490> going<00:01:45.849> to<00:01:45.939> have<00:01:46.119> that

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
however you're not going to have that

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.699 
however you're not going to have that
you'll<00:01:46.630> need<00:01:46.779> to<00:01:46.840> shut<00:01:47.139> the<00:01:47.289> main<00:01:47.439> water

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
you'll need to shut the main water

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.580 
you'll need to shut the main water
supply<00:01:48.189> off<00:01:48.399> to<00:01:48.669> your<00:01:48.729> house<00:01:49.259> once<00:01:50.259> you've

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
supply off to your house once you've

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.469 
supply off to your house once you've
gotten<00:01:50.919> the<00:01:51.099> water<00:01:51.340> shut<00:01:51.729> off<00:01:51.759> we<00:01:52.119> need<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.359> get

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
gotten the water shut off we need to get

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.739 
gotten the water shut off we need to get
the<00:01:52.659> pressure<00:01:53.200> off<00:01:53.529> of<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:53.979> tank<00:01:54.249> and<00:01:54.749> so

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
the pressure off of the tank and so

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.999 
the pressure off of the tank and so
basically<00:01:56.200> as<00:01:56.439> I'm<00:01:56.709> going<00:01:56.829> to<00:01:56.889> do<00:01:57.069> is<00:01:57.340> pull<00:01:57.849> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
basically as I'm going to do is pull the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.999 
basically as I'm going to do is pull the
plug<00:02:00.009> on<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.369> bottom<00:02:00.520> basically<00:02:00.939> or<00:02:01.569> open

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
plug on the bottom basically or open

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.499 
plug on the bottom basically or open
open<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.099> drain<00:02:03.369> up<00:02:03.609> and<00:02:03.880> just<00:02:04.060> take<00:02:04.239> some<00:02:04.299> of

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
open the drain up and just take some of

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.449 
open the drain up and just take some of
the<00:02:04.630> pressure<00:02:04.869> off<00:02:05.289> of<00:02:05.529> that<00:02:05.679> off<00:02:06.189> of<00:02:06.249> the

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
the pressure off of that off of the

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.359 
the pressure off of that off of the
heater<00:02:06.639> here<00:02:06.989> you<00:02:07.989> can<00:02:08.170> do<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.470> by<00:02:08.770> turning

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
heater here you can do that by turning

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.830 
heater here you can do that by turning
that<00:02:09.550> Valve<00:02:10.710> counterclockwise<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:12.630> take<00:02:13.630> out

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
that Valve counterclockwise and take out

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.480 
that Valve counterclockwise and take out
a<00:02:13.870> half<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.230> gallon<00:02:14.620> or<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.160> that's<00:02:15.250> going

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
a half a gallon or so and that's going

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
a half a gallon or so and that's going
to<00:02:15.550> be<00:02:15.670> enough<00:02:16.000> to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
to be enough to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.869 
to be enough to
just<00:02:16.720> get<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.049> water<00:02:17.230> down<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.010> little<00:02:18.340> bit<00:02:18.580> so

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
just get the water down a little bit so

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.850 
just get the water down a little bit so
you're<00:02:19.030> not<00:02:19.090> making<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.170> mess<00:02:20.319> when<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.650> break

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
you're not making a mess when you break

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.949 
you're not making a mess when you break
the<00:02:21.010> connections<00:02:21.549> open<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.360> their<00:02:25.659> pressure

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
the connections open and their pressure

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.490 
the connections open and their pressure
is<00:02:26.200> pretty<00:02:26.379> well<00:02:26.650> off<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:28.120> some<00:02:28.870> cases<00:02:29.140> you'll

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
is pretty well off in some cases you'll

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.410 
is pretty well off in some cases you'll
open<00:02:29.799> these<00:02:29.890> valves<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.670> nothing<00:02:31.150> will<00:02:31.239> come

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
open these valves and nothing will come

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.059 
open these valves and nothing will come
out<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:34.319> ninety<00:02:35.319> percent<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.860> time

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
out but ninety percent of the time

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.180 
out but ninety percent of the time
that's<00:02:36.310> not<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.579> case<00:02:37.620> they<00:02:38.620> recommend<00:02:39.129> that

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
that's not the case they recommend that

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.280 
that's not the case they recommend that
you<00:02:39.340> drain<00:02:39.579> a<00:02:39.879> little<00:02:40.569> bit<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.780> water<00:02:40.930> out<00:02:41.170> of

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
you drain a little bit of water out of

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.990 
you drain a little bit of water out of
your<00:02:41.409> water<00:02:41.560> heater<00:02:41.920> at<00:02:42.400> least<00:02:42.579> once<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.970> month

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
your water heater at least once a month

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.910 
your water heater at least once a month
of<00:02:43.420> what<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.720> does<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.109> keeps<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.470> sediment

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
of what that does is keeps the sediment

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.080 
of what that does is keeps the sediment
from<00:02:44.950> building<00:02:45.340> up<00:02:45.459> in<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.609> bottom<00:02:45.909> of<00:02:45.970> your

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
from building up in the bottom of your

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.809 
from building up in the bottom of your
tank<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:47.379> allows<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.950> water<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.549> come<00:02:48.730> out

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
tank and allows the water to come out

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.910 
tank and allows the water to come out
when<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.120> need<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.299> open<00:02:49.629> it<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:50.680> we<00:02:50.769> got

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
when you need to open it so so we got

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.530 
when you need to open it so so we got
the<00:02:51.010> pressure<00:02:51.220> off<00:02:51.549> so<00:02:51.579> we're<00:02:51.879> gonna<00:02:52.000> close

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
the pressure off so we're gonna close

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.289 
the pressure off so we're gonna close
that<00:02:52.599> valve<00:02:52.989> up<00:02:53.409> and<00:02:53.769> move<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.639> up<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.269> top

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
that valve up and move on up to the top

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:02.069 
that valve up and move on up to the top
end<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:56.220> all<00:02:57.220> right<00:02:57.459> we<00:02:57.639> got<00:02:57.879> that<00:02:58.150> out<00:02:58.980> and<00:03:01.079> of

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
end now all right we got that out and of

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.160 
end now all right we got that out and of
course<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.829> fitting<00:03:03.250> itself<00:03:03.780> hard<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.930> see

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
course the fitting itself hard to see

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.319 
course the fitting itself hard to see
here<00:03:05.940> was<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.120> real<00:03:07.420> real<00:03:07.690> bad<00:03:07.930> shape<00:03:08.379> it

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
here was in real real bad shape it

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.300 
here was in real real bad shape it
appears<00:03:10.329> that<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.750> plumber<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.799> put<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.190> in

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
appears that the plumber that put it in

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.119 
appears that the plumber that put it in
didn't<00:03:12.639> seal<00:03:12.909> it<00:03:13.120> at<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.230> top<00:03:14.440> end<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.040> the

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
didn't seal it at the top end and the

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.619 
didn't seal it at the top end and the
water<00:03:15.340> was<00:03:15.549> just<00:03:15.609> kind<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.060> trickling<00:03:16.420> down

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
water was just kind of trickling down

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.289 
water was just kind of trickling down
the<00:03:16.659> side<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.379> so<00:03:17.730> fortunately<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.970> didn't

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
the side of it so fortunately it didn't

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.530 
the side of it so fortunately it didn't
damage<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.139> tank<00:03:20.440> any<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.940> with<00:03:22.359> the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
damage the tank any and so with the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.750 
damage the tank any and so with the
replacement<00:03:23.349> of<00:03:23.379> this<00:03:23.530> fitting<00:03:23.949> we'll<00:03:24.609> be

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
replacement of this fitting we'll be

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.009 
replacement of this fitting we'll be
back<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.000> shape<00:03:25.449> here<00:03:27.150> all<00:03:28.150> right<00:03:28.389> so<00:03:28.690> we<00:03:28.840> got

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
back in shape here all right so we got

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.400 
back in shape here all right so we got
our<00:03:29.169> new<00:03:29.319> nipple<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.769> place<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:31.090> pipe<00:03:32.079> joined

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
our new nipple in place and pipe joined

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.099 
our new nipple in place and pipe joined
at<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.620> bottom<00:03:33.010> end<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.840> however<00:03:34.840> after

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
at the bottom end of that however after

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.589 
at the bottom end of that however after
looking<00:03:35.650> things<00:03:35.919> over<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:37.109> realized<00:03:38.109> that

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
looking things over I realized that

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.379 
looking things over I realized that
there<00:03:40.599> was<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.780> fitting<00:03:41.199> put<00:03:41.410> on<00:03:42.060> this<00:03:43.060> line

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
there was a fitting put on this line

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.539 
there was a fitting put on this line
here<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.690> didn't<00:03:44.169> really<00:03:44.949> belong<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.459> what

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
here that didn't really belong and what

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.490 
here that didn't really belong and what
it's<00:03:45.760> done<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.239> collapsed<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.870> inside<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.410> the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
it's done is collapsed the inside of the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.789 
it's done is collapsed the inside of the
tube<00:03:47.739> here<00:03:48.510> also<00:03:49.510> these<00:03:49.870> are<00:03:49.930> copper<00:03:50.590> and

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
tube here also these are copper and

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.530 
tube here also these are copper and
we're<00:03:51.400> tying<00:03:51.609> them<00:03:51.819> onto<00:03:51.970> galvanized

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
we're tying them onto galvanized

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.949 
we're tying them onto galvanized
fittings<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.379> that<00:03:53.859> causes<00:03:54.329> oxidization<00:03:55.329> so

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
fittings so that causes oxidization so

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.809 
fittings so that causes oxidization so
we're<00:03:56.139> gonna<00:03:56.230> pull<00:03:56.500> out<00:03:56.530> all<00:03:56.919> the<00:03:57.099> copper

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
we're gonna pull out all the copper

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.030 
we're gonna pull out all the copper
we're<00:03:58.540> gonna<00:03:58.690> go<00:03:58.840> with<00:03:58.959> some<00:03:59.169> new<00:03:59.319> stainless

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
we're gonna go with some new stainless

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.780 
we're gonna go with some new stainless
steel<00:04:00.069> lines<00:04:01.139> which<00:04:02.139> will<00:04:02.319> take<00:04:02.470> care<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.829> that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
steel lines which will take care of that

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.830 
steel lines which will take care of that
problem<00:04:04.799> so<00:04:05.799> we'll<00:04:06.069> put<00:04:06.280> these<00:04:06.459> on<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.000> see

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
problem so we'll put these on and see

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.339 
problem so we'll put these on and see
what<00:04:07.989> happens<00:04:09.090> all<00:04:10.090> right<00:04:10.419> the<00:04:10.629> new<00:04:10.750> lines<00:04:11.049> are

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
what happens all right the new lines are

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:17.189 
what happens all right the new lines are
on<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:13.319> holding<00:04:14.319> pressure<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:16.599> the<00:04:16.750> leak<00:04:16.959> has

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
on and holding pressure and the leak has

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:23.990 
on and holding pressure and the leak has
been<00:04:17.229> solved

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
