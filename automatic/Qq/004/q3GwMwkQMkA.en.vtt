recommend<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.750> use<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.500> color<00:01:37.979> corrector

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
recommend is use a color corrector

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.460 
recommend is use a color corrector
underneath<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.540> apply<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.229> top

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
underneath and then apply this on top

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.069 
underneath and then apply this on top
and<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:40.950> works<00:01:41.340> beautifully<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.810> like
