successfully<00:01:20.580> managed<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.270> into<00:01:21.450> orbit

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
successfully managed to get into orbit

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
successfully managed to get into orbit
although<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.590> did<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> small<00:01:23.460> problem

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790

although they did have a small problem
with<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> second<00:01:24.900> stage<00:01:25.080> relighting<00:01:25.650> once

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
with the second stage relighting once

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
with the second stage relighting once
was<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.400> orbit<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.880> wasn't<00:01:27.210> able<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.659> reignite

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
was in orbit it wasn't able to reignite

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.830 
was in orbit it wasn't able to reignite
that<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> problem<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.030> supposedly

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that was a problem and supposedly

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.140 
that was a problem and supposedly
they've<00:01:31.200> done<00:01:31.439> some<00:01:31.710> slight<00:01:32.009> modifications

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
they've done some slight modifications

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.100 
they've done some slight modifications
to<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> ses-8<00:01:34.590> Falcon<00:01:35.549> 9<00:01:35.729> launch<00:01:36.450> rocket

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
to this the ses-8 Falcon 9 launch rocket

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
to this the ses-8 Falcon 9 launch rocket
thingy<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> second<00:01:38.400> stage<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:39.180> have

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
thingy with the second stage they have

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.170 
thingy with the second stage they have
added<00:01:39.930> some<00:01:40.229> extra<00:01:40.320> insulation<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.759> fuel

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
added some extra insulation to the fuel

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.850 
added some extra insulation to the fuel
lines<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:43.110> stop<00:01:43.320> them<00:01:43.500> from<00:01:43.530> freezing

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
lines to stop them from freezing

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 
lines to stop them from freezing
apparently<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.790> came<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.119> contact<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.689> some

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
apparently it came in contact with some

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.840 
apparently it came in contact with some
of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> liquid<00:01:46.409> oxygen<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.640> really

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
of the liquid oxygen and it got really

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.060 
of the liquid oxygen and it got really
cold<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.110> course<00:01:49.140> that's<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.649> bad<00:01:49.799> thing

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
cold and of course that's a bad thing

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.039 
cold and of course that's a bad thing
but<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.549> fixed<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.360> probably<00:01:51.869> gonna

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
but they fixed that it's probably gonna

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.859 
but they fixed that it's probably gonna
be<00:01:52.140> okay<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.740> we're<00:01:52.860> gonna<00:01:52.950> watch<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.549> know

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
be okay but we're gonna watch you know

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.090 
be okay but we're gonna watch you know
hesitantly<00:01:54.869> nonetheless<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> little

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
hesitantly nonetheless and be a little

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.999 
hesitantly nonetheless and be a little
bit<00:01:56.340> worried<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.990> basically<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.680> last

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
bit worried but basically the last

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.620 
bit worried but basically the last
flight<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.640> sixth<00:01:59.909> one<00:02:00.060> was<00:02:00.270> about<00:02:00.479> two

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
flight the sixth one was about two

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.569 
flight the sixth one was about two
months<00:02:00.780> ago<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.200> September<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.189> well<00:02:02.399> as

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
months ago in September and as well as

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.010 
months ago in September and as well as
being<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.909> successful<00:02:03.299> flight<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:03.810> also

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
being a successful flight it was also

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
being a successful flight it was also
the<00:02:04.200> first<00:02:04.560> attempt<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.579> recover<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.270> first

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the first attempt to recover the first

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
the ocean surface that did not go

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.880 
the ocean surface that did not go
exactly<00:02:14.120> according<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.989> plan<00:02:15.079> I<00:02:15.500> would<00:02:15.680> say<00:02:15.829> it

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
exactly according to plan I would say it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.600 
exactly according to plan I would say it
was<00:02:15.980> about<00:02:16.310> as<00:02:16.459> seventy<00:02:17.060> percent<00:02:17.299> success<00:02:17.840> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
was about as seventy percent success and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.890 
was about as seventy percent success and
unfortunately<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:20.000> will<00:02:20.180> not<00:02:20.239> be<00:02:20.420> able<00:02:20.689> to

unfortunately we will not be able to

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
rundown of what a geosynchronous orbit

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.059 
rundown of what a geosynchronous orbit
is<00:03:05.150> or<00:03:05.389> a<00:03:05.420> geostationary<00:03:06.260> orbit<00:03:06.680> as<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:06.920> may

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
is or a geostationary orbit as you may

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.670 
is or a geostationary orbit as you may
know<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.420> we're<00:03:08.420> gonna<00:03:08.540> look<00:03:08.840> at<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.409> solar

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
know it we're gonna look at the solar

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.619 
know it we're gonna look at the solar
system<00:03:10.189> you<00:03:10.519> guys<00:03:10.670> know<00:03:10.909> the<00:03:11.060> mercury<00:03:11.510> is

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
system you guys know the mercury is

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.690 
system you guys know the mercury is
close<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.139> Sun<00:03:12.379> right<00:03:12.680> mercury<00:03:13.519> goes

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
close to the Sun right mercury goes

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.150 
close to the Sun right mercury goes
around<00:03:13.939> the<00:03:14.030> Sun<00:03:14.120> pretty<00:03:14.629> fast<00:03:14.989> in<00:03:15.349> fact<00:03:15.889> if

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
around the Sun pretty fast in fact if

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.099 
around the Sun pretty fast in fact if
you<00:03:16.340> want<00:03:16.609> to<00:03:16.669> know<00:03:16.790> how<00:03:17.000> long<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.239> mercury<00:03:17.720> year

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
you want to know how long a mercury year

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.920 
you want to know how long a mercury year
is<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.530> about<00:03:18.739> 88<00:03:19.190> days<00:03:19.449> venus<00:03:20.449> is<00:03:20.599> further

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
is it's about 88 days venus is further

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.710 
is it's about 88 days venus is further
out<00:03:21.169> it<00:03:21.470> goes<00:03:21.769> around<00:03:21.919> the<00:03:22.160> Sun<00:03:22.299> slower<00:03:23.299> at

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
out it goes around the Sun slower at

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.289 
out it goes around the Sun slower at
about<00:03:24.430> 225<00:03:25.430> days<00:03:26.150> earth<00:03:26.690> as<00:03:27.340> 365<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.639> course

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
about 225 days earth as 365 of course

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.089 
about 225 days earth as 365 of course
and<00:03:29.599> Mars<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.889> what<00:03:32.260> 687<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.530> have<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:33.889> written

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
and Mars is what 687 I have it written

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.580 
and Mars is what 687 I have it written
down<00:03:34.250> right<00:03:34.669> here<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.449> basically<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.139> idea<00:03:36.169> is

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
down right here so basically the idea is

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.559 
down right here so basically the idea is
the<00:03:36.889> closer<00:03:37.250> something<00:03:37.760> orbits<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.449> the

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
the closer something orbits to the

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.050 
the closer something orbits to the
celestial<00:03:39.079> body<00:03:39.349> it<00:03:39.560> goes<00:03:39.769> around<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.340> faster

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
celestial body it goes around the faster

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.520 
celestial body it goes around the faster
it<00:03:41.150> goes<00:03:41.239> around<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.750> alright<00:03:42.349> that's

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
it goes around it alright that's

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.990 
it goes around it alright that's
wonderful<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.159> same<00:03:43.370> thing<00:03:43.549> happens<00:03:43.909> with

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
wonderful the same thing happens with

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.500 
wonderful the same thing happens with
earth<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:44.569> our<00:03:44.720> satellites<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:47.000> looking<00:03:47.359> at

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
earth and our satellites so looking at

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.659 
earth and our satellites so looking at
this<00:03:47.629> wonderful<00:03:48.139> little<00:03:48.290> gift<00:03:48.680> that's<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.159> very

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
this wonderful little gift that's a very

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.430 
this wonderful little gift that's a very
very<00:03:49.849> low<00:03:50.060> quality<00:03:50.389> but<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.810> basically<00:03:50.959> gets

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
very low quality but it basically gets

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.069 
very low quality but it basically gets
the<00:03:51.620> idea<00:03:51.739> if<00:03:52.609> you<00:03:52.849> have<00:03:53.120> a<00:03:53.389> satellite<00:03:53.780> that's

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
the idea if you have a satellite that's

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.420 
the idea if you have a satellite that's
very<00:03:54.290> close<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.560> Earth<00:03:54.769> that's<00:03:55.010> going<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.340> go

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
very close to Earth that's going to go

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.460 
very close to Earth that's going to go
around<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.790> earth<00:03:55.819> much<00:03:56.599> faster<00:03:57.139> than<00:03:57.319> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
around the earth much faster than the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.349 
around the earth much faster than the
earth<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.799> rotating<00:03:57.979> if<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:59.209> have<00:03:59.329> a

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
earth is rotating if you have a

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.199 
earth is rotating if you have a
satellite<00:03:59.750> all<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.440> way<00:04:00.530> out<00:04:00.560> here<00:04:01.030> then<00:04:02.030> it's

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
satellite all the way out here then it's

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.939 
satellite all the way out here then it's
going<00:04:02.419> to<00:04:02.540> revolve<00:04:03.049> around<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.500> earth<00:04:03.560> much

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
going to revolve around the earth much

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:05.890 
going to revolve around the earth much
slower<00:04:04.400> than<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:04.760> earth<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.150> rotating<00:04:05.299> there

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
slower than the earth is rotating there

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.050 
slower than the earth is rotating there

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
where you will revolve around the earth

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.860 
where you will revolve around the earth
at<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.470> same<00:04:15.979> speed<00:04:16.729> that<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.510> earth<00:04:17.659> is

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
at the same speed that the earth is

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.270 
at the same speed that the earth is
rotating<00:04:18.079> this<00:04:18.590> means<00:04:18.829> that<00:04:18.919> from<00:04:19.159> the

telecommunications you know things like
that<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:38.930> that's<00:04:39.320> what<00:04:39.530> ses-8<00:04:40.100> is<00:04:40.670> and<00:04:41.390> this<00:04:41.690> is

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
that so that's what ses-8 is and this is

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.720 
that so that's what ses-8 is and this is
what<00:04:42.020> they<00:04:42.140> are<00:04:42.170> going<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.530> attempt<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:42.920> do<00:04:43.100> the

problem with this is that generally
before<00:04:46.490> everything<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.690> spacex<00:04:48.110> has<00:04:48.170> done

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
before everything the spacex has done

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.840 
before everything the spacex has done
has<00:04:48.470> been<00:04:48.530> quite<00:04:48.950> close<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.400> Earth<00:04:49.490> low-earth

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
sure what Delta V is you guys should

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.440 
sure what Delta V is you guys should
really<00:05:25.070> watch<00:05:25.610> our<00:05:25.820> kerbal<00:05:26.210> space<00:05:26.240> program

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
really watch our kerbal space program

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.409 
really watch our kerbal space program
series<00:05:27.260> but<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.400> save<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.730> satellite<00:05:28.910> about

series but to save the satellite about

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.750

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
and eighty six kilometers all the way to

and eighty six kilometers all the way to
about<00:05:39.800> eighty<00:05:40.340> thousand<00:05:41.000> which<00:05:41.120> I<00:05:41.240> can't<00:05:41.450> even

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
about eighty thousand which I can't even

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.780 
about eighty thousand which I can't even
go<00:05:41.840> to<00:05:41.900> on<00:05:42.350> my<00:05:42.560> screen<00:05:42.830> because<00:05:43.160> you<00:05:43.400> know<00:05:43.520> my

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
go to on my screen because you know my

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.760 
go to on my screen because you know my
screen<00:05:44.090> isn't<00:05:44.390> big<00:05:44.540> enough<00:05:44.660> but<00:05:45.650> they're

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
screen isn't big enough but they're

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.260 
screen isn't big enough but they're
going<00:05:45.919> all<00:05:46.130> the<00:05:46.220> way<00:05:46.310> out<00:05:46.340> to<00:05:46.460> 80,000

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.820 
going all the way out to 80,000
kilometers<00:05:47.419> for<00:05:48.140> those<00:05:48.260> of<00:05:48.410> you<00:05:48.500> who<00:05:48.680> use

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
kilometers for those of you who use

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.920 
kilometers for those of you who use
miles<00:05:49.340> that's<00:05:49.669> forty<00:05:50.030> nine<00:05:50.180> thousand<00:05:50.630> seven

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
miles that's forty nine thousand seven

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.170 
miles that's forty nine thousand seven
hundred<00:05:50.960> and<00:05:51.320> nine<00:05:51.590> miles<00:05:51.979> and<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.880> reason

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
hundred and nine miles and the reason

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.290 
hundred and nine miles and the reason
they're<00:05:53.300> doing<00:05:53.570> that<00:05:53.720> is<00:05:53.870> because<00:05:54.130> with<00:05:55.300> the

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
they're doing that is because with the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.630 
they're doing that is because with the
highest<00:05:56.600> point<00:05:57.020> in<00:05:57.229> your<00:05:57.260> orbit<00:05:57.530> our<00:05:57.860> AP<00:05:58.490> if

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
highest point in your orbit our AP if

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.360 
highest point in your orbit our AP if
you<00:05:58.760> play<00:05:58.940> kerbal<00:05:59.300> space<00:05:59.330> program<00:06:00.220> with<00:06:01.220> it

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
you play kerbal space program with it

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.440 
you play kerbal space program with it
all<00:06:01.580> the<00:06:01.700> way<00:06:01.790> out<00:06:01.820> there<00:06:02.090> it's<00:06:02.270> much<00:06:02.419> easier

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
all the way out there it's much easier

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.719 
all the way out there it's much easier
to<00:06:02.840> make<00:06:03.050> inclination<00:06:03.560> changes<00:06:04.340> they<00:06:04.520> need<00:06:04.700> a

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
to make inclination changes they need a

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.520 
to make inclination changes they need a
certain<00:06:05.000> inclination<00:06:05.390> for<00:06:05.810> this<00:06:06.140> satellite

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
certain inclination for this satellite

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.550 
certain inclination for this satellite
and<00:06:07.090> changing<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.210> inclination<00:06:08.570> to<00:06:09.080> close<00:06:09.380> to

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
and changing the inclination to close to

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.830 
and changing the inclination to close to
Earth<00:06:09.740> is<00:06:10.040> just<00:06:10.610> very<00:06:10.820> very<00:06:11.120> expensive<00:06:11.360> for

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
Earth is just very very expensive for

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.060 
Earth is just very very expensive for
the<00:06:11.930> satellite<00:06:12.380> so<00:06:12.530> they're<00:06:12.680> going<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:12.860> try<00:06:13.040> to

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
the satellite so they're going to try to

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.280 
the satellite so they're going to try to
save<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.669> satellite<00:06:13.850> some<00:06:14.300> Delta<00:06:14.630> V<00:06:14.780> by

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
save the satellite some Delta V by

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.110 
save the satellite some Delta V by
changing<00:06:15.830> the<00:06:15.950> inclination<00:06:16.310> all<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:17.000> way<00:06:17.090> out

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
changing the inclination all the way out

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.930 
changing the inclination all the way out
here<00:06:17.300> and<00:06:17.840> then<00:06:18.260> after<00:06:18.560> that's<00:06:18.680> done<00:06:18.979> pull<00:06:19.790> it

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
here and then after that's done pull it

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.940 
here and then after that's done pull it
back<00:06:20.120> into<00:06:20.419> a<00:06:20.570> geosynchronous<00:06:21.080> orbit<00:06:21.710> so

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
back into a geosynchronous orbit so

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.950 
back into a geosynchronous orbit so
that's<00:06:22.130> very<00:06:22.220> complex<00:06:22.880> but<00:06:23.240> it's<00:06:23.510> well

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
that's very complex but it's well

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.659 
that's very complex but it's well
understood<00:06:24.229> the<00:06:24.530> orbital<00:06:24.890> mechanics<00:06:25.040> of<00:06:25.520> that

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
understood the orbital mechanics of that

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.700 
understood the orbital mechanics of that
hopefully<00:06:26.510> SpaceX<00:06:26.960> will<00:06:27.140> be<00:06:27.260> able<00:06:27.350> to<00:06:27.470> pull<00:06:27.680> it

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
hopefully SpaceX will be able to pull it

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.159 
hopefully SpaceX will be able to pull it
off<00:06:27.890> and<00:06:28.190> to<00:06:28.729> close<00:06:29.060> this<00:06:29.360> after<00:06:29.840> I've

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
off and to close this after I've

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.570 
off and to close this after I've
explained<00:06:30.680> all<00:06:30.830> of<00:06:30.860> this<00:06:31.070> i<00:06:31.190> just<00:06:31.370> want<00:06:31.520> to
