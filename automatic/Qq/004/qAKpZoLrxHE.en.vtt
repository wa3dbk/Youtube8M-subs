00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
have to do a little bit of a touch-up

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.950 
have to do a little bit of a touch-up
there's<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:37.000> little<00:01:37.119> bit<00:01:37.330> pro<00:01:37.540> right<00:01:37.750> there<00:01:39.960> on

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
there's a little bit pro right there on

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.710 
there's a little bit pro right there on
the<00:01:41.020> border<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.610> then<00:01:42.880> she<00:01:43.119> wanted<00:01:43.390> someone

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
the border and then she wanted someone

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.480 
the border and then she wanted someone
to<00:01:43.840> incorporate<00:01:44.290> rattles<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:44.950> just<00:01:45.250> could

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
to incorporate rattles and I just could

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.730 
to incorporate rattles and I just could
not<00:01:45.700> think<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.210> how<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.810> incorporate<00:01:47.049> rattles

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
not think of how to incorporate rattles

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.999 
not think of how to incorporate rattles
on<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:47.979> sides<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.610> decided<00:01:49.299> on<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.659> top<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:50.170> did

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
on the sides I decided on the top I did

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.620 
on the sides I decided on the top I did
like<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.310> little<00:01:51.490> sea<00:01:51.729> scroll<00:01:52.150> then<00:01:52.420> did<00:01:52.600> the

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
like the little sea scroll then did the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.319 
like the little sea scroll then did the
rattles<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:54.130> know<00:01:54.280> in<00:01:54.490> between<00:01:54.939> them<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.270> I

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
rattles you know in between them and I

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.069 
rattles you know in between them and I
thought<00:01:55.509> that<00:01:55.570> was<00:01:55.840> pretty<00:01:56.770> ingenious<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.790> me

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
thought that was pretty ingenious of me

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.870 
thought that was pretty ingenious of me
so<00:01:59.079> it<00:01:59.200> didn't<00:01:59.590> take<00:01:59.890> away<00:02:00.130> from<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.490> design

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
so it didn't take away from the design

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.410 
so it didn't take away from the design
so<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.290> our<00:02:02.700> Indian<00:02:03.700> baby<00:02:04.030> shower<00:02:04.659> cake<00:02:05.140> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
so that is our Indian baby shower cake I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.900 
so that is our Indian baby shower cake I
thought<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.570> came<00:02:07.659> out<00:02:07.810> pretty<00:02:08.049> good<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.910> this

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
thought it came out pretty good and this

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.870 
thought it came out pretty good and this
is<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> design<00:02:10.479> i've<00:02:10.690> done<00:02:10.929> before<00:02:11.530> on<00:02:11.799> a<00:02:12.519> couple

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
is a design i've done before on a couple

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.690 
is a design i've done before on a couple
