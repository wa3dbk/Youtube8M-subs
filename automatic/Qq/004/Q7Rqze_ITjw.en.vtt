00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.700
 very good guys here we are in a 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.289
 new video of gta 5 and in this case os 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.669
 I bring a new interest as a mystery 

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:08.260
 whatever you want to call him and good guys 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:09.580
 right now bringing on screen the 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.320
 location in which you have to come 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.310
 to see this interest in case you want 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.900
 do it from your own 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.240
 playstation3 and well then if it is 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.560
 just the house of esther that 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.880
 right now I will explain how to enter 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.650
 inside is ok since we can not enter by 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.599
 the door and good guys because I know 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.630
 what is this interest or mystery about 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.369
 well basically it's about star trek 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.349
 which is a kind of series that has already 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.419
 many many years in which then it 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.890
 it's about a spaceship which is going 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.140
 for the space that mind why that 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.790
 flame spaceship and then then 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.650
 basically it goes through space and goes 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.030
 visiting different planets and 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.380
 knowing different people and good 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.120
 because already and the plot is based there is no 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.710
 adventure there are planets that get along 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.880
 with them and planets that have the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.620
 war with it et cetera et cetera no 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.660
 I put there is not a planet in which 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.650
 they inhabit a species a kind of 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.620
 species called the Vulcans and this 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.000
 species greets in a pretty way 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.740
 little current not that good at the same be 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.900
 seeing on screen an image of how 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.520
 greet this kind of series this 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.990
 I train that Vulcans are greeting 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.200
 as with an open hand but with 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.149
 two of two on one side is a kind of 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.829
 health somewhat strange so good then 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.380
 basically this greeting what it means 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.360
 it's good, I want you to live a 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.310
 prosperous prosperous and long life is to say 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.320
 that you live well and that you live long enough 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.539
 no time then because that's what 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.610
 means this greeting the greeting of the 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.049
 of the Vulcans then well this one 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.399
 interest develops just inside 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.869
 from the house of lester and good first thing 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.520
 as we enter inside the house of 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.320
 externally you are asking me so very 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.630
 easy what we have to do is go to 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.280
 where I went to get upstairs 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.179
 of the roof of the house of lester and 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.190
 then, nothing comes up 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.020
 just above the house of Lester and 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.490
 we go to the middle of the house to the middle 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.440
 from the roof once we are in the middle 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.909
 from the roof as we open the phone and 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.830
 We accept any invitation that we 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.209
 have sent me that closed like a kingfisher or 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.890
 lester anyone if you do not have any 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.330
 as requested and it then as 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.979
 nothing then you will enter a mission and 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.509
 just when you are inside you do not 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.740
 dais to confirm adjustments is worth the jce al 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.360
 circle and you feel of the mission 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.100
 just when you leave the mission 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.569
 would appear inside the house of the estuary 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.069
 there are times that it appears and there are times 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.270
 that appears inside, but it is good if 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.520
 he tries and two other times surely 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.630
 enter inside guys well for once 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.340
 that you are inside you are going to see that there is 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.890
 affected house of things I love the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.569
 house is full of it that looks 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.920
 here I all left comics the truth that 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.680
 It's pretty cool the house full of 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.050
 tele computers I like it then 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.580
 basically right in the middle of the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.290
 home here, to teach, I have to go 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.600
 there is a kind of box 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.890
 on top of a shelf in which yes 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.440
 we look there with a kind of 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.180
 sticker with the same greeting of forgiveness 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.280
 with the same greeting from the Vulcans of 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.660
 star trek yes indeed and as you see 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.040
 puts up and down 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.450
 right now I'm conceiving what is 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.650
 seeing you I doing right now 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.720
 I'm watching the video but with some 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.220
 life something if we go the same as 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.320
 means the greeting then 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.200
 basically that is a clear reference 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.910
 to the star trek series but good as 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.680
 you see the greeting is completely identical 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.360
 with fingers with two fingers to the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.860
 lateral I do not know well as I say is 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.269
 a clear reference and as I say also 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.190
 it appears above and below the words 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.560
 lifelong or something like that you live a life 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.480
 long and prosperous and nothing because the truth to 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.040
 a pretty pretty curious interest and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.880
 well the truth would appreciate that 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.410
 the comments what do you think? 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.150
 because what I like to know about you 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.650
 opinion about these things and the truth 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.030
 that I really like that this 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.650
 disc put these mysteries there super 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.120
 hidden just when you discover them then 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.230
 the truth is that it's pretty good that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.500
 I'm saying that I discovered it 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.180
 obviously so basically 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.180
 quite quite curious as I say nothing 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.480
 and you can subscribe and we do not see anything in 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.480
