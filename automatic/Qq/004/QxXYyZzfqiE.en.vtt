00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.510
 the network that helps your channel to 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.740
 grow and also have good support 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.900
 I'll introduce you to the network. 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.780
 is a network that I believe and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.850
 I trust and the network offers 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.120
 benefits mainly to those who are 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.400
 beginning and does not understand much of this 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.760
 network business it offers a 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.709
 minimum payment of $ 1, that is, if the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.340
 your car yields at least $ 1 per 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.850
 month 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.130
 You get that money something else. 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.100
 network has a temporary contract of 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.380
 three months you can stay in the network 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.810
 for three months if you do not like it 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.519
 just ask them they cancel 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.760
 your contract in case you want 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.180
 continue your contract is only one 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.530
 year and finally it was something I think more 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.510
 interesting 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.030

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.860
 Portuguese and also support in 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.670

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.890

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.400
