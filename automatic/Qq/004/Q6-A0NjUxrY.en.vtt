00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
in the parade been in parades about four

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.000 
in the parade been in parades about four
or<00:02:10.580> five<00:02:10.729> times<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.300> thought<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.569> was<00:02:11.660> old<00:02:11.780> hat

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
or five times and thought it was old hat

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.740 
or five times and thought it was old hat
I'm<00:02:13.010> 49<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.760> I've<00:02:13.880> never<00:02:14.060> been<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.450> parade
