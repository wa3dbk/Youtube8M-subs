today<00:00:08.220> I'm<00:00:08.309> going<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.460> be<00:00:08.550> showing<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.880> how<00:00:09.000> to

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
today I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.150 
today I'm going to be showing you how to
set<00:00:09.300> up<00:00:09.330> an<00:00:09.510> axis<00:00:09.870> using<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.410> lock<00:00:10.650> motion<00:00:11.070> of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
set up an axis using a lock motion of

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.150 
set up an axis using a lock motion of
hollow<00:00:11.340> three<00:00:11.580> motion<00:00:11.910> controller<00:00:13.160> first

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
hollow three motion controller first

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.230 
hollow three motion controller first
thing<00:00:14.309> we're<00:00:14.429> going<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:15.030> make<00:00:15.210> sure

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
thing we're going to do is make sure

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.830 
thing we're going to do is make sure
that<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.750> axis<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.760> enabled<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.660> here

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
that the axis is enabled so going here

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.870 
that the axis is enabled so going here
to<00:00:18.900> config<00:00:19.260> ports<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.740> pins<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.699> motor

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
to config ports and pins and motor

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.849 
to config ports and pins and motor
outputs<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:21.930> setting<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.289> x-axis

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
outputs and we're setting up the x-axis

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.070

here<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.269> it<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.420> enabled

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
here and it is enabled

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.170 
here and it is enabled
other<00:00:25.470> than<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> enable<00:00:26.340> checkbox<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:27.060> the

fields<00:00:29.460> matter<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.750> Palfrey<00:00:31.260> doesn't

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
fields matter it the Palfrey doesn't

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.810 
fields matter it the Palfrey doesn't
actually<00:00:31.710> even<00:00:31.920> look<00:00:32.040> at<00:00:32.160> them<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.520> they<00:00:32.669> can

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
actually even look at them so they can

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually even look at them so they can
be<00:00:32.850> set<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> whatever<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.600> want<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:34.230> default

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
be set to whatever you want we default

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.770 
be set to whatever you want we default
them<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.010> zero<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.910> both<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.390> step

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
them to zero and have both of the step

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.619 
them to zero and have both of the step
direction<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.320> Direction<00:00:37.890> low<00:00:37.980> active

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
direction and Direction low active

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.650 
direction and Direction low active
checkboxes<00:00:39.629> set<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.290> red<00:00:41.300> now<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.450> we've<00:00:42.540> got

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
checkboxes set to red now that we've got

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.360 
checkboxes set to red now that we've got
the<00:00:42.780> axis<00:00:43.050> enabled<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.680> should<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.010> motion

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the axis enabled we should have motion

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.510 
the axis enabled we should have motion
so<00:00:44.879> I'll<00:00:45.210> clear<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> reset<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.070> then<00:00:47.070> I'm

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
so I'll clear the reset and then I'm

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.340 
so I'll clear the reset and then I'm
going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> jog<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> x-axis<00:00:48.629> there<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.200> can

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
going to jog the x-axis there you can

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.240 
going to jog the x-axis there you can
see<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.530> moving<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:51.410> it's<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.559> scaled<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> what

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
see it moving so it's not scaled to what

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.040 
see it moving so it's not scaled to what
I<00:00:53.280> want<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.670> now<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.480> I'm<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> come<00:00:55.020> up

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I want right now so I'm going to come up

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.360 
I want right now so I'm going to come up
here

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
here

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.500 
here
to<00:00:58.059> config<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.809> then<00:00:59.250> motor<00:01:00.250> tuning<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.820> in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
to config and then motor tuning and in

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.259 
to config and then motor tuning and in
this<00:01:01.629> case<00:01:01.809> I'm<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:02.530> know<00:01:02.949> that<00:01:03.340> my<00:01:03.550> steps<00:01:04.030> per

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
this case I'm I know that my steps per

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.859 
this case I'm I know that my steps per
is<00:01:06.479> 125,000<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:09.430> going<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.700> hit<00:01:09.790> save<00:01:10.450> axis

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
is 125,000 I'm going to hit save axis

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.719 
is 125,000 I'm going to hit save axis
settings<00:01:11.049> and<00:01:11.619> I'm<00:01:12.280> going<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.490> set<00:01:12.640> my

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
settings and I'm going to set my

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.899 
settings and I'm going to set my
velocity<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.450> 200<00:01:14.050> an<00:01:14.979> acceleration<00:01:15.520> at<00:01:15.580> 40<00:01:15.850> is

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
velocity to 200 an acceleration at 40 is

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.730 
velocity to 200 an acceleration at 40 is
good<00:01:16.180> and<00:01:16.740> hit<00:01:17.740> OK<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.490> now

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.460 

that's<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.430> positive<00:01:22.820> move<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:24.140> that's<00:01:24.350> a

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
that's a positive move and that's a

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.890 
that's a positive move and that's a
negative<00:01:24.770> move<00:01:24.980> exact<00:01:25.610> same<00:01:25.760> speed<00:01:26.180> it's

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
negative move exact same speed it's

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.060 
negative move exact same speed it's
going<00:01:27.170> a<00:01:27.260> lot<00:01:27.380> farther<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:29.210> that's<00:01:29.690> correct<00:01:30.070> so

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
going a lot farther so that's correct so

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.960 
going a lot farther so that's correct so
now<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.280> next<00:01:31.550> step<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:33.310> I'm<00:01:34.310> going<00:01:34.550> to<00:01:34.640> change

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
now the next step is I'm going to change

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.469 
now the next step is I'm going to change
the<00:01:35.330> direction<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:36.400> on<00:01:37.400> this<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:38.000> a<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:38.390> a

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
the direction so on this it's a just a

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.880 
the direction so on this it's a just a
test<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.290> direction<00:01:39.530> doesn't

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
test and so the direction doesn't

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.170 
test and so the direction doesn't
actually<00:01:40.130> matter

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
actually matter

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.390 
actually matter
but<00:01:41.540> before<00:01:42.290> elapses<00:01:42.619> systems<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.160> want<00:01:43.250> the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
but before elapses systems you want the

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.420 
but before elapses systems you want the
axis<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.850> go<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.000> certain<00:01:44.150> way<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:45.080> all<00:01:45.369> it's<00:01:46.369> a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
axis to go a certain way and all it's a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.760 
axis to go a certain way and all it's a
reverse<00:01:46.670> direction<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:47.240> go<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.420> config<00:01:47.869> then

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
reverse direction you go to config then

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.940 
reverse direction you go to config then
humming<00:01:49.369> slash<00:01:49.610> limits<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.200> then<00:01:51.200> here<00:01:51.650> we're

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
humming slash limits and then here we're

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.620 
humming slash limits and then here we're
since<00:01:52.130> we're<00:01:52.280> setting<00:01:52.490> up<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.700> x-axis<00:01:53.240> or

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
since we're setting up the x-axis or

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.260 
since we're setting up the x-axis or
you'll<00:01:53.840> check<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.590> reversed<00:01:55.119> now<00:01:56.119> if<00:01:56.180> you

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
you'll check the reversed now if you

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.670 
you'll check the reversed now if you
have<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.509> latest<00:01:56.660> version<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.290> Apollo<00:01:57.530> 3

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
have the latest version of the Apollo 3

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.770 
have the latest version of the Apollo 3
plug-in<00:01:58.100> you're<00:01:58.850> done<00:01:59.030> here<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.600> all<00:01:59.690> you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
plug-in you're done here this is all you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.560 
plug-in you're done here this is all you
have<00:01:59.899> to<00:02:00.020> do<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.410> that's<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.040> if<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.280> have<00:02:02.180> an

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
have to do and that's it if you have an

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.030 
have to do and that's it if you have an
older<00:02:02.869> version<00:02:03.050> you'll<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.649> following

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040

and so you'll have to go to config
config<00:02:10.670> plugins<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.390> then<00:02:12.260> click<00:02:12.650> on<00:02:12.800> the

then that brings up the Apollo 3 haikon
plugin<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.640> then<00:02:20.390> on<00:02:20.830> whatever<00:02:21.830> channel

plugin and then on whatever channel
you're<00:02:22.489> on<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:22.970> x<00:02:23.209> axis<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.720> going<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.930> be

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
you're on so x axis is going to be

you're on so x axis is going to be
channel<00:02:24.890> 0<00:02:25.130> you'll<00:02:25.610> switch<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.150> hardware

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540

plug-in<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.930> doesn't<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:33.530> not<00:02:33.860> necessary

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
plug-in this doesn't is not necessary

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.120 
plug-in this doesn't is not necessary
and<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.780> will<00:02:35.959> automatically<00:02:36.620> detect<00:02:36.920> that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
and so it will automatically detect that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.070 
and so it will automatically detect that
so<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:37.970> case<00:02:38.150> I'm<00:02:38.360> not<00:02:38.390> going<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.870> change

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
so in this case I'm not going to change

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.350 
so in this case I'm not going to change
it<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:39.739> if<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.190> was<00:02:40.430> going<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.790> did<00:02:41.030> need<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.239> I

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
it but if I was going to did need to I

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.330 
it but if I was going to did need to I
would<00:02:41.720> hit<00:02:41.900> update<00:02:42.560> icon<00:02:42.739> here

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
would hit update icon here

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.699 
would hit update icon here
system<00:02:44.150> configuration<00:02:44.269> downloaded<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.320> then

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
system configuration downloaded and then

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.280 
system configuration downloaded and then
hit<00:02:45.890> OK<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.400> close<00:02:46.640> out<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:46.880> those<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.840> now<00:02:48.019> my

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
hit OK and close out of those so now my

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.100 
hit OK and close out of those so now my
axis<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:48.980> reversed<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.730> I'm<00:02:50.600> going<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.840> run<00:02:51.019> it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
axis is reversed and I'm going to run it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.670 
axis is reversed and I'm going to run it
here

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
here

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.660 
here
so<00:02:53.250> there's<00:02:53.579> positive<00:02:54.409> and<00:02:55.409> there's<00:02:56.370> negative

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
so there's positive and there's negative

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.530 
so there's positive and there's negative
the<00:02:57.569> last<00:02:57.950> step<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.340> configuring<00:02:59.790> an<00:03:00.000> axis<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
the last step for configuring an axis is

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.390 
the last step for configuring an axis is
defining<00:03:01.019> which<00:03:01.290> direction<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.890> goes<00:03:02.040> when<00:03:02.310> it

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
defining which direction it goes when it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.569 
defining which direction it goes when it
homes<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:03.950> when<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.040> hit<00:03:05.220> -<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.069> change

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
homes so when you hit - so to change

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.030 
homes so when you hit - so to change
that<00:03:08.849> you<00:03:09.120> go<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.299> config<00:03:09.829> plumbing<00:03:10.829> slash

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
that you go to config plumbing slash

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.520 
that you go to config plumbing slash
limits<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.810> here<00:03:12.810> we've<00:03:12.959> got<00:03:13.049> our<00:03:13.109> reversed

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
limits and here we've got our reversed

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.710 
limits and here we've got our reversed
but<00:03:14.010> then<00:03:14.159> if<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.700> want<00:03:14.879> to<00:03:14.939> change<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.540> end

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
but then if you want to change the end

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.979 
but then if you want to change the end
of<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.260> axis<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.069> homes<00:03:17.250> at<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:18.060> say<00:03:18.659> it

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
of the axis that it homes at so say it

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.589 
of the axis that it homes at so say it
homes<00:03:19.980> over<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:20.700> corner<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.150> your<00:03:21.269> table

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
homes over on this corner of your table

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.770 
homes over on this corner of your table
and<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.140> want<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.409> to<00:03:22.560> home<00:03:22.739> over<00:03:23.579> here<00:03:23.790> you

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
and you want it to home over here you

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.140 
and you want it to home over here you
would<00:03:25.079> hit<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.829> home<00:03:26.010> negative<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.639> it<00:03:26.970> won't

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
would hit the home negative and it won't

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.420 
would hit the home negative and it won't
reverse<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.629> axis<00:03:28.019> all<00:03:28.260> we'll<00:03:28.709> do<00:03:28.859> is<00:03:29.129> change

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
reverse the axis all we'll do is change

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.390 
reverse the axis all we'll do is change
the<00:03:29.700> direction<00:03:29.849> that<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.359> goes<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.870> home<00:03:31.400> and

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
the direction that it goes to home and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.309 
the direction that it goes to home and
that<00:03:32.609> will<00:03:32.879> automatically<00:03:33.629> change<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:34.109> I

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
that will automatically change that I
