00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.550
 fly like this 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.930
 I want to present this work what now 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.540
 we are going to do it 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.699
 in a step by step 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:11.969
 it turns out almost all are 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.879
 very cute for any birthday 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.879
 with an ornament will avoid the intention of the 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.480
 we are going to work 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.589
 with spheres 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.029
 with farra earmuffs technique 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.369
 sphere number 3 and wait number 4 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.369
 with which we are going to make the body and the head 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.560
 now let's start 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.310
 then everything 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.510
 we were going to talk 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.510
 a little bit of proportions 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.400
 per cent cold porcelain this one 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.830
 trinity 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.900
 a fluent coloring now 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900
 if you can pretend make it porcelain coloring 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.500
 let's occupy a little more 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.450
 that the size of the tour can be 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.420
 one here told me mohamed and end 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.860
 7 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.860
 they take into account the measures 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.100
 the porcelain always protest the air because that's where it dries 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.240
 a volcano fil 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.909
 there more or less calculated one and a half of the sphere 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.909
 this morning it will be that they will occupy 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.550
 we are going to 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.040
 to integrate well the color and the humidity that the dough has 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.180
 we were going to do 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.980
 a scene 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.220
 of massa 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.290
 yes 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.290
 we're left with cracks where the crack is 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.090
 we support the star 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.710
 we have covered the sphere and it has to be an extension, that is, as a 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.170
 way of t 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.050
 For that 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.260
 by branches 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.640
 with a tent 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 It is actively final about three millimeters 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.729
 in the lower part at this time the lecce is not staying on topic 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.769
 let's turn, we can run away with the finger of the big toe because 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:17.469
 this will be the music 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.859
 then it allows us to work with our fingers 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.659
 we embrace the mace 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.519
 and we try to serrat is everything 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.079
 at a point 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.079
 in a port on the upper pole of the fec 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.729
 we close 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.499
 we put pressure on the palm 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.499
 from the hand to erase 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.549
 that label 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.549
 between the palms 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.729
 we made all the marks that remained of fingers 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.889
 or in the lining 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.769
 the little body 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.060
 which has as we discussed earlier the form of t 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.660
 the wait that is the part 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.749
 lower 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.749
 and what remains in the rest of the former manager 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.969
 we follow by the legs 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.789
 as percent 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.249
 hear 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:20.019
 I fear a number 3 sphere here comes in and that size is going to have 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.869
 that mass size 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.869
 March entity to have portfolio 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.549
 also both 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.900
 that is fundamental 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.969
 knead 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:42.339
 in this side mode do not make any crack 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.989
 pressure on Iran 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.739
 about the mass too 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.739
 and we try that our pretty worth coming 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.289
 with the diagonal hand 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.199
 let's make a cylinder that this one 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.199
 finest at one end 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.059
 we make 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.059
 the other in the same way 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:20.379
 a little more in arms 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.379
 the next years 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.669
 the ball as always 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.669
 without cracks 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:39.629
 the crack that remains 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.639
 like at the beginning a cylinder 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.749
 more cinema with the finest diagonal hand at one end 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.809
 the thinnest part will be where your shoe fits 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:52.809
 and the thickest part the mus 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.950
 these are the legs to give amica movement 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.039
 of each one we make two marks ouna 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:05.490
 pretty deep if we want 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.490
 double 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.370
 We speak 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.659
 The other part 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.370
 and we can help you with a z 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.830
 To make pressure 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.830
 and mark where the little body will go 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.219
 we put glue on the brand we wanted 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.809
 especially the wolf 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.800
 because the mass on shrinking 7 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.099
 take off 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.409
 is to ensure the work well 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.409
 we put in the marks we make pressure 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:01.669
 there we have left 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.139
 the body any 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.630
 this step by step I'm going to her 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.820
 percent 'in time and form' also because what we do now is what we 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.119
 it has to be 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:15.930
 oliart osÃ© car 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.270
 at least 24 hours so they can continue the work better 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:22.800
 this 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.879
 we make 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.559
 head 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:27.069
 and then
