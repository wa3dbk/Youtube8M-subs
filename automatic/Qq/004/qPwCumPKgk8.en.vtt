00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.580 
rifle before the patch and he was aiming
at<00:02:28.910> me<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.720> should<00:02:29.930> have<00:02:30.050> killed<00:02:30.200> me<00:02:30.319> if<00:02:30.380> he

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.920 
shot me in the toe I would have been
dead<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.020> let<00:02:33.560> me<00:02:33.590> go<00:02:34.130> over<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.360> technical

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
dead so let me go over the the technical

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.290 
dead so let me go over the the technical
aspects<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.739> patch<00:02:37.190> they<00:02:37.640> changed<00:02:38.120> the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
aspects of this patch they changed the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.650 
aspects of this patch they changed the
fire<00:02:38.540> time<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.590> was<00:02:39.920> point<00:02:40.790> two<00:02:41.150> seconds

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
fire time that was point two seconds

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.430 
fire time that was point two seconds
another<00:02:42.140> drop<00:02:42.470> shot<00:02:42.500> tomahawk<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:44.510> was<00:02:44.750> two

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
another drop shot tomahawk it was two

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.699 
another drop shot tomahawk it was two
seconds<00:02:45.890> now<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:46.519> point<00:02:47.239> four<00:02:47.540> seconds<00:02:48.080> for

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
seconds now it's point four seconds for

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.910 
seconds now it's point four seconds for
the<00:02:48.950> fire<00:02:49.190> time<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:50.120> they're<00:02:50.860> doubling<00:02:51.860> that

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
the fire time so they're doubling that

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.370 
the fire time so they're doubling that
as<00:02:52.310> well<00:02:52.850> as<00:02:53.090> they<00:02:53.420> were<00:02:53.480> chamber<00:02:53.900> time<00:02:54.110> was

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
as well as they were chamber time was

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.930 
as well as they were chamber time was
the<00:02:54.530> second<00:02:54.950> now<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:56.110> 1.1<00:02:57.110> seconds<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.489> me

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
the second now it's 1.1 seconds so to me

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.570 
the second now it's 1.1 seconds so to me
just<00:02:59.480> as<00:03:00.319> a<00:03:00.380> call<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.860> duty<00:03:00.890> player<00:03:01.310> that

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
just as a call of duty player that

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.400 
just as a call of duty player that
doesn't<00:03:01.819> really<00:03:02.060> mean<00:03:02.420> anything<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:03.230> me<00:03:03.380> I

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
doesn't really mean anything to me I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.610 
doesn't really mean anything to me I
can't<00:03:03.890> relate<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:05.180> numbers<00:03:05.989> like<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.410> add

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
can't relate to like numbers like I add

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.830 
can't relate to like numbers like I add
I<00:03:06.890> don't<00:03:07.130> understand<00:03:07.549> point<00:03:07.819> 12<00:03:08.269> seconds<00:03:08.720> on

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
I don't understand point 12 seconds on

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.809 
I don't understand point 12 seconds on
the<00:03:08.870> reload<00:03:09.319> time<00:03:09.350> like<00:03:09.950> what<00:03:10.370> does<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.640> even

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
the reload time like what does that even

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.330 
the reload time like what does that even
mean<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.840> basically<00:03:12.380> like<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.040> was<00:03:13.130> saying

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
mean so basically like I was saying

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.520 
mean so basically like I was saying
earlier<00:03:13.549> it's<00:03:14.000> all<00:03:14.180> about<00:03:14.420> response<00:03:14.930> time<00:03:15.260> and

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
earlier it's all about response time and

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.380 
earlier it's all about response time and
call<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.860> duty<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.220> it's<00:03:16.760> got<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.030> make<00:03:17.209> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
call of duty and it's got to make the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.720 
call of duty and it's got to make the
gun<00:03:17.630> feel<00:03:18.260> different<00:03:18.799> for<00:03:18.980> snipers<00:03:19.400> because

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
gun feel different for snipers because

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.150 
gun feel different for snipers because
they<00:03:20.269> got<00:03:20.780> into<00:03:21.049> like<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.410> rhythm<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.130> know

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
they got into like a rhythm you know

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.240 
they got into like a rhythm you know
they<00:03:22.489> know<00:03:22.970> how<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.209> snipe<00:03:24.049> woohoo<00:03:24.680> tomahawks

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250

they know how to snipe woohoo tomahawks
and<00:03:25.519> they<00:03:26.299> know<00:03:26.510> how<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.720> do<00:03:27.019> it<00:03:27.170> right<00:03:27.350> and

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
and they know how to do it right and

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.979 
and they know how to do it right and
they<00:03:27.920> have<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.310> certain<00:03:28.730> rhythm<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.540> certain

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
they have the certain rhythm the certain

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.240 
they have the certain rhythm the certain
like<00:03:30.799> button<00:03:31.600> strategy<00:03:32.600> or<00:03:32.930> like<00:03:33.250> muscle

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
like button strategy or like muscle

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.120 
like button strategy or like muscle

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
past few months now they have to change

past few months now they have to change
it<00:03:40.160> up<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.579> learn<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.209> different<00:03:41.900> it's<00:03:42.799> the

how to use it and relearn how to use it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.890 
how to use it and relearn how to use it
and<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:48.470> made<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.430> worse<00:03:49.459> which<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.359> don't<00:03:50.840> know

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
and it made it worse which I don't know

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.099 
and it made it worse which I don't know
how<00:03:51.019> that's<00:03:51.230> got<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.590> play<00:03:51.829> for<00:03:51.890> online<00:03:52.579> play<00:03:52.760> I
