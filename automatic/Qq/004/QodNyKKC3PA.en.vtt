 50 fps in battlefield 4 high 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.500
 settings 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.170
 50 fps in call of duty go 50 fps 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.290
 world of tanks is not bad for a laptop 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.739
 new gigabyte p25 definitely can 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.680
 surprise 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.239
 laptop looks cool glossy bright 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.309
 yellow cap with chrome rim 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.470
 ground metal around 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.330
 keyboard and touchpad inside thanks 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.280
 This fingerprint on the case 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.949
 notebook becomes almost invisible 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.629
 practical and beautiful solution on the left 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.299
 side arranged in r connector 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.150
 combined usb2 0 and sata connector and 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.949
 divid from hi lady mala 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.439
 order the version with the newest writing 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.180
 drive blue-ray ax bidet with another 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.329
 side of the laptop is gigabit 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.380
 ethernet port hdmi card reader 2 yusb 30 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.960
 ports and connectors 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.299
 headphones and microphone for playing such 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 hdmi and vga are enough for a set 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.200
 interfaces to connect any 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.969
 external monitor 3 usb port for 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.859
 connect mouse and even keyboard 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.880
 which need 2 yusbi connectors for 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.829
 full work 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.350
 native keyboard is also quite good 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.119
 click very clear control keys like 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.490
 put the gaming laptop far left 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.889
 so you can't confuse it with the fn button 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.899
 radiator cooling system is located 

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:42.600
 here tests showed that gigabyte 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.759
 p25 very well remove heat in the dough 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.189
 furmark graphics card temperature average 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.689
 did not exceed 81 degrees and it is very 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.880
 good result with the body 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.709
 the laptop practically did not heat it 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.020
 it was easy to keep on your lap even 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.490
 during the test and this is at the maximum 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.889
 load that during normal play 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.509
 achieve impossible noise from working on 

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:02.249
 the full power of the fans is also not 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.959
 caused inconvenience compared to 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:07.799
 many other gaming laptops 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.690
 p25 is just a quiet screen laptop matt 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.970
 so no glare and less 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.780
 eye strain resolution of course 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.819
 full hd 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.170
 the brightness margin is just huge with such 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.660
 the display can be easily surfed on the Internet 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.010
 on a sunny day especially as 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.410
 here is a special 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.480
 anti-reflective coating still turned on 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.790
 yourself attention excellent viewing angles here 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.130
 even though the usual matrix is â€‹â€‹set, but 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.630
 it produces no saturated colors 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.630
 of problems 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.250
 we noticed everything in the dark for games too 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.380
 switchable backlight is provided 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.510
 the keyboard will not let the keys get tangled 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.030
 with a lack of lighting but still 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.070
 main arguments p25 hidden under the hood 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.740
 there installed a new intel processor 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.890
 core i7 4700 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.200
 art gifors gtx770 m with incredible 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.120
 three gigabytes of memory processor 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.100
 of course quad-core frequency 2 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.040
 as many as four tenths gigahertz in mode 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.080
 turbo boost it will stand for 3.4 gigahertz 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.450
 which is enough for games in the tests 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.330
 Sundance gigabyte p25 showed such 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.690
 results open gl 57 frame processor 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.250
 just over 6 points with 3d mark 06 too 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:16.310
 everything is fine 19 thousand points in version 11 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.100
 3d mark test extreme laptop issued 1800 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.410
 points and in performance mode 5200 points 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.050
 it's very good for a gaming laptop 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.760
 but synthetic tests are one thing so 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.850
 now let's move on to the tests 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.350
 real games call of duty gost you 25 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.320
 issued 30 frames per second at 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.870
 maximum settings battlefield 4 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.640
 30 35 frames per second full hd 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.620
 resolution and maximum settings 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.670
 and while reducing them to a high level 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.790
 laptop gave a stable 45-50 frames 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.140
 world of tanks 5055 frames per second 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.520
 of course such performance is merit 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.190
 not just a fast processor and 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.630
 video cards and 25 comes with ssd 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.970
 drive for at least one hundred and twenty 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.280
 eight gigabytes of this is certainly not enough 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.500
 even for 4 5 modern games so 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.330
 Immediately you should think about expanding 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.459
 disk subsystem if desired here 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.790
 2 m sata can be installed simultaneously 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.800
 ssd disk up to 256 gigabytes each 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.270
 and one standard sata hard drive 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.580
 up to 1 terabyte 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.680
 installed in our model ssd issued 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.640
 almost 500 megabytes when reading and 300 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.859
 megabytes when writing 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.840
 but if you deliver the second here create 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.790
 drive and create a raid array then speed 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.800
 will grow and double even though 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.810
 current performance is enough to run 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.460
 any modern game is standard in 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.310
 laptop installed 8 gigabytes 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.790
 RAM running on frequency 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.980
 1600 megahertz 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.380
 but it can also be increased to 16 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.720
 gigabyte maximum true of slot 2 so 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.430
 memory can only be replaced from others 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.910
 laptop chips worth noting these 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.050
 buttons 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.510
 the first two are responsible for managing 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 volume and the second is the smart menu 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.690
 manager 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.550
 here you can quickly change the brightness mode 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.190
 power consumption sound settings 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.830
 bluetooth wipes and more with 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.780
 p25 sound is also okay four 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.940
 speaker and subwoofer produces loud and 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.670
 the main clear sound will be heard 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.710
 even in a public place gigabyte fi 25 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.630
 serious gaming laptop while he 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.880
 not very heavy and big balance 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.590
 power and convenience a great combination 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.670
 which is among the gaming laptops 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.670
 very rare
