lot of the home improvement stuff is

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.089 
lot of the home improvement stuff is
only<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.120> spring<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.629> summer<00:02:39.810> mmm<00:02:40.620> so

but this is rough enough that I don't

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.650 
but this is rough enough that I don't
keep<00:02:42.810> his<00:02:42.989> beak<00:02:43.200> worn<00:02:43.500> down<00:02:43.709> if<00:02:43.920> he<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.280> film<00:02:45.180> he

pretty high in fibers hey Nigel pretty
high<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.430> fiber<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.940> there's<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.390> decent

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
high in fiber is there's a decent

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.339 
high in fiber is there's a decent
variety<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:02.760> as<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.060> note<00:03:03.209> one<00:03:04.049> thing

they're eating spinach they still have
the<00:03:22.430> ability<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.459> get<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.700> pyramid<00:03:24.269> shell<00:03:24.720> I

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
the ability to get a pyramid shell I

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.920 
the ability to get a pyramid shell I
talked<00:03:25.769> about<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.130> in<00:03:26.160> my<00:03:26.370> other<00:03:26.519> video

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
talked about that in my other video

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.599 
talked about that in my other video
pyramiding<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.049> when<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.859> scoot<00:03:29.160> material

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
pyramiding is when the scoot material

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.000 
pyramiding is when the scoot material
stacks<00:03:29.940> up<00:03:30.239> on<00:03:30.450> top<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.380> each<00:03:31.470> other<00:03:31.620> instead

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
stacks up on top of each other instead

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.400 
stacks up on top of each other instead
of<00:03:32.190> growing<00:03:32.430> smoothly<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:34.109> get<00:03:34.290> these

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
of growing smoothly and you get these

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.650 
of growing smoothly and you get these
little<00:03:34.470> Peaks<00:03:34.919> or<00:03:35.190> bumps<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.329> look<00:03:36.510> like

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
little Peaks or bumps that look like

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.949 
little Peaks or bumps that look like
pyramids<00:03:37.700> that's<00:03:38.700> really<00:03:38.970> bad<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.480> means<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
pyramids that's really bad it means the

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.400 
pyramids that's really bad it means the
shell<00:03:40.169> is<00:03:40.319> porous<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.780> not<00:03:43.019> as<00:03:43.139> hard<00:03:43.319> as

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
shell is porous and it's not as hard as

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.780 
shell is porous and it's not as hard as
it<00:03:43.560> should<00:03:43.769> be<00:03:43.919> which<00:03:44.190> means<00:03:44.400> it's<00:03:44.549> not<00:03:44.579> going

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
it should be which means it's not going

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.879 
it should be which means it's not going
to<00:03:44.880> protect<00:03:45.239> as<00:03:45.359> well<00:03:45.510> as<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.750> should<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.829> you

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
to protect as well as it should so you

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.039 
to protect as well as it should so you
want<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.459> try<00:03:47.639> and<00:03:47.790> prevent<00:03:47.970> that<00:03:48.419> with

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
want to try and prevent that with

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.770 
want to try and prevent that with

is<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.990> ISM<00:04:42.669> tortoises<00:04:43.669> do<00:04:43.910> p<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.690> they<00:04:45.169> do<00:04:45.230> p

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
is to ISM tortoises do p and they do p

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.430 
is to ISM tortoises do p and they do p
quite<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:45.950> bit<00:04:46.480> it's<00:04:47.480> how<00:04:47.660> they<00:04:47.840> control<00:04:48.260> their

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
quite a bit it's how they control their

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.120 
quite a bit it's how they control their
um<00:04:48.680> or<00:04:49.669> help<00:04:49.850> control<00:04:50.210> their<00:04:50.330> environments

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
um or help control their environments

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.620 
um or help control their environments
they<00:04:52.130> pee<00:04:52.400> in<00:04:52.550> their<00:04:52.700> burrows<00:04:53.090> because<00:04:53.510> it

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
they pee in their burrows because it

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.890 
they pee in their burrows because it
raises<00:04:53.810> humidity<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:55.479> humidity<00:04:56.479> helps<00:04:56.750> with

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
raises humidity and humidity helps with

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.690 
raises humidity and humidity helps with
shell<00:04:57.139> growth<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:58.100> that<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.370> something<00:04:58.490> that

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
shell growth so that is something that

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.120 
shell growth so that is something that
they<00:04:58.910> would<00:04:59.060> do<00:04:59.180> in<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.419> wild<00:04:59.570> to<00:04:59.900> help<00:05:00.169> grow

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
they would do in the wild to help grow

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.940 
they would do in the wild to help grow
properly<00:05:01.510> so<00:05:02.510> you<00:05:02.930> do<00:05:03.169> have<00:05:03.320> to<00:05:03.500> change<00:05:03.740> the

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
properly so you do have to change the

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.909 
properly so you do have to change the
bedding<00:05:04.100> pretty<00:05:05.090> often<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.750> starts<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.650> smell

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
bedding pretty often it starts to smell

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.430 
bedding pretty often it starts to smell
kind<00:05:06.979> of<00:05:07.370> like<00:05:07.520> rabbit<00:05:08.000> p<00:05:08.270> after<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.960> while<00:05:09.139> if

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440

couple things when I spot clean but a

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.860 
couple things when I spot clean but a
bin<00:05:29.840> like<00:05:30.080> this<00:05:30.320> works<00:05:31.310> really<00:05:31.669> well<00:05:31.820> for<00:05:32.330> a
