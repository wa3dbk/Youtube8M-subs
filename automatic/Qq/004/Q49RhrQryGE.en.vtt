00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.670

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.890
 your mind is returning to the beloved place 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.890
 towards his childhood place 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.910

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.659
 Oh God 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.400
 the song has already started 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.400
 there must be more memories 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.700
 and if he is not living or is 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.880

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.100
 from this to the mother to be playing 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.619

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.880
 going fast I think it 's moving 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:16.270

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.760

 we will have a hand this time you will not win 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.760
 I have the advantage of 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.620
 because we can not give any memory 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.250
 no longer normal 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.250

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.790
 and you will not be able to phone 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.120
 there is no need to fear extend the hand is 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.120
 back there 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.110
 I can not find anything 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.810
 and a bathroom in this bathroom there are four 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.810

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.780
 because I can not find anything 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.139
 on this side there is one more room 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.270
 dark 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.189
 remember the advice is that if they run 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.780
 faster because it's lenderman is 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.849
 stepping on your heels right now is not 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.180
 near us so there's no 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.180

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.770

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.560

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.130

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.000
