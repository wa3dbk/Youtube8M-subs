00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:15.019
 5 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.970
 you are also nuanced 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.970
 why 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.970
 i 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.929
 m 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.929
 ah 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.120
 very good to all kids I would be in 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.860
 May I extract a new trick on the map 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.450
 of call of the dead this trick is for 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.030
 be off the map and do a lot 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.200
 action inside the lighthouse is worth more 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.580
 comfort maps to an inaccessible area 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.440
 as well as one the first thing that you have to 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.580
 to do is to do the command george and os 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.170
 you have to come here next to the 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.760
 staircase and you have to put the crosshead 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.320
 of the weapon between ladder and staircase 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.970
 where you have seen in the video and 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.410
 you have to when you are well placed 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.180
 you have to point to georg and work 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.350
 and you will be on the railing of the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.120
 staircase goes where you saw in the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.110
 video I also have to say that 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.879
 You can also arrive by making a 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.160
 simple strix is ok but it is very much 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.140
 more difficult so well I recommend you 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.910
 that you read with command is worth as 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.140
 you have seen in the video that good a 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.490
 time is on top of the big day another 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.350
 player has to approach here to the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.610
 side of the lighthouse doors and other 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.259
 player has to hit a jump and has 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.090
 that falling here on top of the barrier is 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.380
 invisible once you are here you will die for 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.300
 the pach and the other game has it 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.710
 reanimate it already reanimates the other player 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.720
 you have to go running to this part 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.250
 It's worth to this area and in this area is where 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.930
 it has to be right next to the lighthouse 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.399
 It has to be as close as possible to the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.140
 beacon possible so that he does not die for the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.360
 patch because it is that if it is not going to die and 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.430
 if he skips he also dies because there is a 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.170
 patch over the head so good 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.750
 it is simply to bend and lift 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.970
 you're worth you can not do anything 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.620
 you can also move a tad for the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.570
 right, but what happens is that no 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.680
 will serve no purpose other than not 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.810
 is going to create the heap action you are not going to 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.979
 do nothing so good nothing else alex 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.540
 the credit for this god for 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.190
 achilles 18 the channel you have in the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.630
 description he has passed me the client 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.700
 when he did the trick it's because he recorded 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.190

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.530
