00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.130 

so<00:00:04.180> here's<00:00:04.330> the<00:00:04.450> door<00:00:04.600> that<00:00:04.779> I'll<00:00:04.870> put<00:00:05.020> the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.140 
so here's the door that I'll put the

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.619 
so here's the door that I'll put the
patch<00:00:05.470> in<00:00:05.830> that<00:00:06.100> bottom<00:00:06.670> corner<00:00:06.970> here<00:00:07.000> I'm

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:07.629 
patch in that bottom corner here I'm

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:09.470 
patch in that bottom corner here I'm
just<00:00:07.930> finishing<00:00:08.080> out<00:00:08.379> the<00:00:08.410> top<00:00:09.070> part<00:00:09.280> here

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
just finishing out the top part here

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.119 
just finishing out the top part here
where<00:00:10.480> the<00:00:10.570> steel<00:00:11.170> is<00:00:11.320> all<00:00:11.440> scaled<00:00:11.770> up<00:00:11.920> around

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.129 
where the steel is all scaled up around

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.090 
where the steel is all scaled up around
this<00:00:12.279> area<00:00:12.459> here<00:00:12.629> so<00:00:13.680> what<00:00:14.680> I'm<00:00:14.770> gonna<00:00:14.860> do<00:00:15.010> is

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
this area here so what I'm gonna do is

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.330 
this area here so what I'm gonna do is
obviously<00:00:15.940> cut<00:00:16.420> this<00:00:16.539> out<00:00:16.720> but<00:00:16.930> I'm<00:00:17.020> going<00:00:17.230> to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
obviously cut this out but I'm going to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.480 
obviously cut this out but I'm going to
press<00:00:18.340> some<00:00:18.730> steel<00:00:18.970> in<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:20.650> steel<00:00:21.070> tube<00:00:21.310> so

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
press some steel in this steel tube so

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.499 
press some steel in this steel tube so
basically<00:00:21.849> this<00:00:22.359> is<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.730> correct<00:00:25.300> diameter

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
basically this is the correct diameter

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.230 
basically this is the correct diameter
as<00:00:26.079> you<00:00:26.199> can<00:00:26.320> see<00:00:26.439> pour<00:00:26.679> that<00:00:27.119> curvature<00:00:28.119> in

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
as you can see pour that curvature in

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.939 
as you can see pour that curvature in
the<00:00:28.300> door<00:00:28.449> there<00:00:28.630> so<00:00:29.439> it's<00:00:29.529> just<00:00:29.589> a<00:00:29.710> matter<00:00:29.740> of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
the door there so it's just a matter of

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.700 
the door there so it's just a matter of
me<00:00:30.099> cutting<00:00:30.400> out<00:00:30.490> some<00:00:30.609> flat<00:00:30.849> still<00:00:31.089> now<00:00:31.269> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
me cutting out some flat still now and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160 
me cutting out some flat still now and
pressing<00:00:32.710> this<00:00:32.800> down<00:00:32.860> on<00:00:33.130> top<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.400> steel

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
pressing this down on top of the steel

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.140 
pressing this down on top of the steel
to<00:00:35.170> get<00:00:35.320> that<00:00:35.470> shape<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.760> that's<00:00:37.000> what<00:00:37.090> I'm

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
to get that shape so that's what I'm

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.000 
to get that shape so that's what I'm
gonna<00:00:37.240> do<00:00:37.420> now<00:00:37.570> and<00:00:38.320> see<00:00:38.500> how<00:00:38.620> it<00:00:38.680> fits<00:00:38.890> in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
gonna do now and see how it fits in

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.400 
gonna do now and see how it fits in
there<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.510> here's<00:00:40.660> my<00:00:40.780> first<00:00:40.960> patch<00:00:41.230> that's

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
there so here's my first patch that's

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
there so here's my first patch that's
going<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.710> then<00:00:41.860> I'm<00:00:41.950> gonna<00:00:42.040> put<00:00:42.280> that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
going on then I'm gonna put that

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.210 
going on then I'm gonna put that
curvature<00:00:42.760> in<00:00:43.030> -<00:00:43.180> so<00:00:44.020> that<00:00:44.710> piece<00:00:44.920> of<00:00:45.070> pipe

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
curvature in - so that piece of pipe

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.680 
curvature in - so that piece of pipe
that<00:00:45.250> I've<00:00:45.460> just<00:00:45.580> shown<00:00:45.820> you<00:00:45.880> earlier<00:00:46.030> is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
that I've just shown you earlier is

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.270 
that I've just shown you earlier is
where<00:00:47.140> around<00:00:47.410> this<00:00:47.560> came<00:00:47.740> from<00:00:47.860> basically

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
where around this came from basically

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.100 
where around this came from basically
I've<00:00:48.460> just<00:00:48.580> cut<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.760> piece<00:00:48.820> off<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.450> end<00:00:50.020> here

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
I've just cut a piece off the end here

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.190 
I've just cut a piece off the end here
and<00:00:51.010> I've<00:00:51.130> cut<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.310> cross<00:00:51.520> section<00:00:51.880> off<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:52.240> this

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
and I've cut a cross section off so this

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.720 
and I've cut a cross section off so this
is<00:00:53.320> pretty<00:00:53.770> much<00:00:53.860> acting<00:00:54.280> there's<00:00:54.400> a<00:00:54.430> molder

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
is pretty much acting there's a molder

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.950 
is pretty much acting there's a molder
you<00:00:54.820> can<00:00:54.940> see<00:00:55.090> so<00:00:55.300> it's<00:00:55.420> just<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.630> matter<00:00:55.750> of<00:00:55.840> me

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
you can see so it's just a matter of me

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.000 
you can see so it's just a matter of me
grabbing<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.640> opposite<00:00:58.000> side<00:00:58.210> such<00:00:58.660> as<00:00:59.010> the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
grabbing the opposite side such as the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.220 
grabbing the opposite side such as the
other<00:01:00.160> piece<00:01:00.310> of<00:01:00.430> pipe<00:01:00.720> over<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.900> top<00:01:02.050> of<00:01:02.080> that

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
other piece of pipe over the top of that

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.540 
other piece of pipe over the top of that
metal<00:01:02.470> I'm<00:01:02.530> just<00:01:02.710> crushing<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.190> in<00:01:03.310> a<00:01:03.370> vise

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
metal I'm just crushing it and in a vise

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.719 
metal I'm just crushing it and in a vise
and<00:01:03.850> that<00:01:04.089> gives<00:01:04.269> me<00:01:04.330> that<00:01:04.479> perfect<00:01:04.960> shape<00:01:05.170> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and that gives me that perfect shape to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:19.560 
and that gives me that perfect shape to
fit<00:01:06.729> into<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.030> door

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.820 

so<00:01:20.570> that's<00:01:20.720> pretty<00:01:20.900> well<00:01:21.110> squashed<00:01:21.470> in<00:01:21.650> there

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
so that's pretty well squashed in there

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.710 
so that's pretty well squashed in there
and<00:01:22.460> that's<00:01:22.610> gonna<00:01:22.730> be<00:01:22.910> the<00:01:22.940> shape<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.450> that

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
and that's gonna be the shape of that

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.680 
and that's gonna be the shape of that
pipe<00:01:23.990> which<00:01:24.200> is<00:01:24.790> about<00:01:25.790> 40<00:01:26.150> mil<00:01:26.300> diameter

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
pipe which is about 40 mil diameter

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.340 
pipe which is about 40 mil diameter
which<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.470> roughly<00:01:27.890> what<00:01:28.390> that<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:30.110> shape

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
which is roughly what that that shape

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.609 
which is roughly what that that shape
inside<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.830> impaler's<00:01:31.160> door<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:32.440> so<00:01:33.440> here's

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
inside the impaler's door is so here's

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.740 
inside the impaler's door is so here's
all<00:01:33.740> those<00:01:33.920> patches<00:01:34.160> that<00:01:34.430> I've<00:01:34.520> cut<00:01:34.670> out

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
all those patches that I've cut out

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.320 
all those patches that I've cut out
there's<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.580> curved<00:01:37.580> piece<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.970> metal<00:01:38.150> there

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
there's the curved piece of metal there

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.830 
there's the curved piece of metal there
that<00:01:38.450> fits<00:01:38.630> nicely<00:01:40.240> second<00:01:41.240> piece<00:01:41.390> there<00:01:41.630> I've

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
that fits nicely second piece there I've

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.990 
that fits nicely second piece there I've
got<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:42.020> couple<00:01:42.260> little<00:01:42.470> smaller<00:01:43.460> ones<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
got a couple little smaller ones on the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.280 
got a couple little smaller ones on the
side<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.300> this<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.600> just<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.840> replace<00:01:45.080> this<00:01:45.200> guy

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
side and this is just a replace this guy

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.950 
side and this is just a replace this guy
with<00:01:45.560> metal<00:01:45.860> then<00:01:46.790> of<00:01:46.880> course<00:01:47.060> this<00:01:47.240> corner

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
with metal then of course this corner

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.480 
with metal then of course this corner
piece<00:01:49.360> bottom<00:01:50.360> here<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.680> now<00:01:51.920> it's<00:01:52.040> just<00:01:52.070> time

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
piece bottom here so now it's just time

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.270 
piece bottom here so now it's just time
to<00:01:52.790> cut<00:01:53.060> all<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:53.390> out<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:53.990> put<00:01:54.200> these<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.560> so

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
to cut all this out and put these in so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.130 
to cut all this out and put these in so
there's<00:01:55.460> all<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.670> patch<00:01:55.850> panels<00:01:56.180> gone<00:01:56.360> in<00:01:56.509> one

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
there's all the patch panels gone in one

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.620 
there's all the patch panels gone in one
of<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.320> corners<00:01:57.619> in<00:01:57.740> place<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:59.300> this<00:01:59.479> long

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
of the corners in place and this long

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
there now next thing I've got to do now

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.219 
there now next thing I've got to do now
what<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:04.910> found<00:02:05.149> is<00:02:05.360> stripping<00:02:05.720> back<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.930> paint

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229

on<00:02:06.380> this<00:02:06.500> there's<00:02:06.920> all<00:02:07.039> these<00:02:07.160> little<00:02:07.340> holes

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
on this there's all these little holes

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.210 
on this there's all these little holes
here<00:02:07.820> across<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.660> skin<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.739> it's<00:02:09.860> basically

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
here across the skin and it's basically

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.650 
here across the skin and it's basically
when<00:02:10.429> someone's<00:02:10.700> put<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:10.940> dent<00:02:11.150> fall<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.510> there

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
and pull it out for some dents so I can

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.520 
and pull it out for some dents so I can
see<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.850> creases<00:02:14.090> coming<00:02:15.050> along<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.320> skin

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
of thing and it just takes forever to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
didn't have to do too much was this

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.180

and the left hand front door which was

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.550 
and the left hand front door which was
really<00:03:30.640> just<00:03:30.940> stripping<00:03:31.930> paint<00:03:32.140> back<00:03:32.350> and

putting it back in primer this rear door
was<00:03:36.970> probably<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.720> worst<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.380> lot<00:03:38.940> this

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
was probably the worst of a lot this

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.460 
was probably the worst of a lot this
door<00:03:40.120> here<00:03:40.300> once<00:03:40.690> again<00:03:40.930> had<00:03:41.050> another<00:03:41.290> huge

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
over that and and work that in so that

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.290 
over that and and work that in so that
you<00:04:22.720> can't<00:04:22.960> see<00:04:23.169> it<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:24.340> can<00:04:24.460> see<00:04:24.669> under<00:04:25.270> a

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
you can't see it you can see under a

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.909 
you can't see it you can see under a
certain<00:04:25.660> shade<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:26.080> light<00:04:26.320> or<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:26.530> look<00:04:26.800> that

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
certain shade of light or just look that

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.190 
certain shade of light or just look that
up<00:04:27.010> a<00:04:27.100> little<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:28.630> can<00:04:28.750> see<00:04:28.900> through<00:04:29.080> that

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
up a little you can see through that

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.740 
up a little you can see through that
light<00:04:29.410> where<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.710> body<00:04:29.890> filler<00:04:30.070> was<00:04:30.540> now<00:04:31.540> when

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
light where the body filler was now when

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.420 
light where the body filler was now when
the<00:04:31.870> high-build<00:04:32.560> primer<00:04:32.590> goes<00:04:33.070> over<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.370> top

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
the high-build primer goes over the top

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.400 
the high-build primer goes over the top
of<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:34.419> you<00:04:34.510> really<00:04:34.930> want<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.080> ever<00:04:35.230> see

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
of that and you really want to ever see

00:04:35.410 --> 00:05:15.300 
of that and you really want to ever see
any<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.620> that

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.400 

so<00:05:16.310> there<00:05:16.430> are<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.610> fenders<00:05:16.940> in<00:05:17.200> three<00:05:18.200> coats

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
so there are the fenders in three coats

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.400 
so there are the fenders in three coats
of<00:05:18.530> high<00:05:18.680> build<00:05:18.920> primer<00:05:20.080> now<00:05:21.080> I'm<00:05:21.170> not<00:05:21.290> going

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
of high build primer now I'm not going

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.320 
of high build primer now I'm not going
to<00:05:21.500> block<00:05:21.950> seeing<00:05:22.190> this<00:05:22.340> of<00:05:22.460> course<00:05:22.490> this<00:05:23.090> is

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
to block seeing this of course this is

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.600 
to block seeing this of course this is
pretty<00:05:24.050> much<00:05:24.170> where<00:05:25.070> it's<00:05:25.190> going<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.370> stay

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
pretty much where it's going to stay

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.790 
pretty much where it's going to stay
until<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.150> whole<00:05:26.420> car<00:05:26.660> is<00:05:26.870> put<00:05:27.380> in<00:05:27.470> high<00:05:27.620> build

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
until the whole car is put in high build

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.030 
until the whole car is put in high build
primer<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:29.470> eventually<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:30.590> whole<00:05:30.680> lot<00:05:30.890> will

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
primer and eventually the whole lot will

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.410 
primer and eventually the whole lot will
all<00:05:31.130> go<00:05:31.280> back<00:05:31.430> together<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:31.820> then<00:05:31.940> all<00:05:32.090> locks

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
all go back together and then all locks

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.180 
all go back together and then all locks
in<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.720> hall<00:05:32.840> like<00:05:33.500> waltz<00:05:33.920> on<00:05:34.040> the<00:05:34.130> car<00:05:36.190> doing

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
in the hall like waltz on the car doing

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.430 
in the hall like waltz on the car doing
this<00:05:37.280> now<00:05:37.460> is<00:05:37.730> I<00:05:38.150> really<00:05:38.450> don't<00:05:39.050> have<00:05:39.200> to<00:05:39.290> worry

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
this now is I really don't have to worry

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.700 
this now is I really don't have to worry
about<00:05:39.470> rust<00:05:39.830> coming<00:05:40.730> back<00:05:40.970> through<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.710> the

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
about rust coming back through the the

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.410 
about rust coming back through the the
undercoat<00:05:43.100> or<00:05:43.220> anything<00:05:43.370> like<00:05:43.520> that<00:05:43.580> it's<00:05:44.300> in

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
undercoat or anything like that it's in

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.120 
undercoat or anything like that it's in
high-build<00:05:44.690> primer<00:05:44.720> so<00:05:45.200> that<00:05:45.320> is<00:05:45.440> now<00:05:45.590> as<00:05:45.950> good

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
high-build primer so that is now as good

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.400 
high-build primer so that is now as good
as<00:05:46.220> sealed

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.080 

and<00:05:51.410> now<00:05:51.920> I<00:05:51.950> move<00:05:52.430> on<00:05:52.580> to<00:05:52.700> the<00:05:53.000> next<00:05:53.090> parts

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090
