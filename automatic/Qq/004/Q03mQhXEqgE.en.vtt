the device has a 13 megapixel camera it
only<00:00:48.480> shoots<00:00:48.750> burst<00:00:49.110> mode<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.559> 1280<00:00:50.370> by<00:00:50.489> 720

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
only shoots burst mode in 1280 by 720

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.049

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
over here it's gonna this square wave

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
over here it's gonna this square wave
it's<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.900> show<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:08.130> gonna<00:01:08.369> show

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
still going on stall so a thousand five

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.630
