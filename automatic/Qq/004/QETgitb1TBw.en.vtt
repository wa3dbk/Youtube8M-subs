00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.000 

like<00:00:29.810> I<00:00:29.960> mentioned<00:00:30.140> in<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.500> previous<00:00:30.710> video

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
like I mentioned in the previous video

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.990 
like I mentioned in the previous video

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
it was about 20 below zero last night

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.600 
it was about 20 below zero last night
and<00:00:35.440> it's<00:00:36.440> about<00:00:36.650> four<00:00:36.860> or<00:00:36.980> five<00:00:37.160> below<00:00:37.400> right

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
and it's about four or five below right

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.220 
and it's about four or five below right
now

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.300 

and<00:00:41.740> that's<00:00:41.890> without<00:00:42.070> windchill

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:54.600 

cycle<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.150> great<00:00:47.390> heaters<00:00:47.660> twice

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.950 

pretty<00:00:55.210> sure<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.420> have<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.690> get<00:00:55.780> some<00:00:55.930> new

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
pretty sure I have to get some new

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:08.830 
pretty sure I have to get some new
batteries<00:00:56.200> for<00:00:56.590> this<00:00:56.680> truck

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.749 

so<00:01:09.439> this<00:01:09.590> wouldn't<00:01:09.890> start<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.250> Jeep<00:01:10.430> wouldn't

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
so this wouldn't start the Jeep wouldn't

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.139 
so this wouldn't start the Jeep wouldn't
start<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:12.470> course<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.890> 2011<00:01:13.460> Commons<00:01:13.790> started

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
start of course the 2011 Commons started

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.830 
start of course the 2011 Commons started
but

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
but

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.260 
but
even<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.409> protested<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> little

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.080 

now<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.330> we're<00:01:21.450> gonna<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.870> to<00:01:22.020> start

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.359 

just<00:01:25.719> plug<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.140> in<00:01:26.200> i<00:01:26.350> guess<00:01:26.560> i<00:01:26.590> mean<00:01:27.250> it's

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
just plug it in i guess i mean it's

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.620 
just plug it in i guess i mean it's
plugged<00:01:27.579> in<00:01:27.700> now<00:01:27.850> but<00:01:28.030> I<00:01:28.060> guess<00:01:28.210> I'll<00:01:28.359> separate

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
plugged in now but I guess I'll separate

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:59.660 
plugged in now but I guess I'll separate
leave<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.810> plugged<00:01:29.079> in<00:01:29.229> for<00:01:29.380> like<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.560> day

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:42.300 

and<00:02:00.150> coughed<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.630> least

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:03:15.680 

and<00:02:43.000> even<00:02:43.180> cough<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.630> time

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.360 

let's<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.470> last<00:03:16.680> try<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.070> then<00:03:17.160> I'll<00:03:17.250> just

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
let's be the last try and then I'll just

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.530 
let's be the last try and then I'll just
leave<00:03:17.520> it<00:03:17.550> on<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.700> battery<00:03:17.940> charger<00:03:18.390> and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
leave it on the battery charger and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:42.430 
leave it on the battery charger and
plugged<00:03:18.720> in

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.760 

so<00:03:43.440> it's<00:03:43.650> too<00:03:43.860> cold<00:03:44.130> for<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.490> blue<00:03:44.640> comment<00:03:45.770> at

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
so it's too cold for the blue comment at

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.140 
so it's too cold for the blue comment at
least<00:03:46.980> with<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.220> current<00:03:47.490> batteries<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.030> it

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
least with the current batteries that it

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.300 
least with the current batteries that it
has
