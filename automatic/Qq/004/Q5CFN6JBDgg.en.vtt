just not showing up bright enough for me

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.200 
just not showing up bright enough for me
even<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.739> see<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:23.250> one<00:04:23.400> shows<00:04:23.640> up<00:04:23.670> very<00:04:23.880> good

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
even to see that one shows up very good

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.280 
even to see that one shows up very good
okay<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.650> can<00:04:26.030> maneuver<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.300> around<00:04:27.360> move

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
okay so you can maneuver it around move

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.470 
okay so you can maneuver it around move
it<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:30.150> have<00:04:30.390> other<00:04:30.810> options<00:04:32.060> flip<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.150> upside

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
it you have other options flip it upside

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.200 
it you have other options flip it upside
down<00:04:33.890> if<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:35.160> had<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.340> left<00:04:35.610> or<00:04:35.760> right<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.000> can

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
down if you had a left or right you can

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.740 
down if you had a left or right you can
mirror-image<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:37.140> you<00:04:37.860> can<00:04:38.040> copy<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:39.570> can

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
mirror-image it you can copy it you can

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.410 
mirror-image it you can copy it you can
size<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.140> so<00:04:40.740> here<00:04:40.980> I<00:04:41.010> can<00:04:41.160> reduce<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.880> size<00:04:42.150> of

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
size it so here I can reduce the size of

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.330 
size it so here I can reduce the size of
it<00:04:43.460> which<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:45.240> now<00:04:46.140> going<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.560> allow<00:04:47.010> me<00:04:47.310> to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
it which is now going to allow me to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.380 
it which is now going to allow me to
copy<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.330> have<00:04:48.690> two<00:04:49.050> hearts<00:04:50.000> so<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.030> can

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
copy it and have two hearts so I can

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.970 
copy it and have two hearts so I can
copy<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:52.310> move<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.490> over<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.530> have<00:04:55.710> two

can spread them further apart bring them
closer<00:05:47.760> together<00:05:48.090> so<00:05:49.080> see<00:05:49.230> how<00:05:49.350> you<00:05:49.410> can

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
closer together so see how you can

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.700 
closer together so see how you can
customize<00:05:50.010> a<00:05:50.730> design<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.110> way<00:05:52.260> you<00:05:52.320> want

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
then you also have a memory file folder

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.070 
then you also have a memory file folder
in<00:05:57.289> here<00:05:57.520> where<00:05:58.520> you<00:05:58.550> can<00:05:58.939> store<00:05:59.360> it<00:05:59.539> in<00:05:59.749> the
