00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.850
 out 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.490
 Welcome back to general 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.710
 aviation help with the last tutorial 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.960
 we already have the area of 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.070
 leave ground and roll cards and 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.029
 We are now on the approach cards 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.790
 I already have the garden head 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.980
 already explained in the previous tutorials 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.670
 That's why we just go on now 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.290
 the things that have changed 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.530
 of course that would be the first one 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.420
 numbering the map we felt on 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.760
 the card numbers now exist 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.160
 no longer from two numbers but 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.660
 Already from three numbers the 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.670
 split up as follows 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.280
 The first indicator is here too 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.860
 back to the chapter in the case 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.430
 chapter number three in this chapter 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.620
 are all approach cards 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.600
 the zero in the middle is a section 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.520
 or a subchapter in the case the 0 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.220
 Which one tells us that we are 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.130
 here in the subchapter minimum rader 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.500
 vectoring are located 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.830
 the 1 is then again with this map 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.880
 the number of pages is not necessarily 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.090
 must be continuous 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.680
 but also after the 1 could 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.350
 also quite the three for example 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.360
 consequences 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.140
 Also added here is this indication 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.000
 transition altitude 5000 for those 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.660
 among you who still do not know what the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.870
 transition tid is i want this 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.310
 explain briefly 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.250
 transition altitude means in German 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.440
 translates transition altitude this altitude 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.510
 in Germany is always 5000 feet 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.040
 then reach the transition height in 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.890
 climb must be without a request 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.760
 through the etc my altimeter from 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.840
 current used for the state 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.479
 switch to the atmospheric 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.090
 This standard was printed by the EU 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.930
 set at 10 132 5 hectopascals 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.780
 respectively 299 two inches of 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.150
 Mercury after reaching one 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.670
 Transitional altitude, one speaks then also 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.540
 no longer from one place or one 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.659
 flying height in foot 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.689
 but only from a flight level 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:36.180
 So if we have the etc then a new one 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:39.569
 He will always say , he will always say 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.989
 climb to flight level and no more 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.939
 climb on so many feet of course 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.530
 then I have the heights that mine 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.959
 Agency passes by as flight level 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.569
 read back 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.459
 what is that good for now that claps 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.310
 Change always changes constantly 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.349
 you would only work with the teenager 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.569
 would the etc with the transmission of the 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.400
 constantly updated and chan all 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.709
 Aircraft in his area quickly 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.389
 to reach its limits and the plane 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.290
 graduation after the height would be very 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.720
 be risky 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.939
 if a pilot times from the provided 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.290
 wrong teenage uses around 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.569
 ensure that everyone is with the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.659
 same value so fly 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.709
 you have this atmospheric standard 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.870
 pressure introduced so we know about 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.879
 the transition altitude will be any 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.489
 plane with this atmospheric 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.669
 standard printing fly and this 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.180
 makes it so much easier for the etc 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.180
 graduation levels 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.350
 Now we will look more closely at the map 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.150
 enter 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.740
 Although I am afraid that for this card in 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.820
 the world of flight simulation hardly 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.490
 need to be used 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.430
 but there is the motto of ev once 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.510
 Is it real assets, I will tell you 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.910
 explain anyway 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.570
 First and foremost it is for the parents 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.970
 thought 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.780
 You need the card to carry it out 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.060
 of the so-called sectors 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.920
 approach procedure at this 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.330
 Approach procedure follows the pilot no 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.940
 published standard 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.010
 approach procedure but is from the low to 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.280
 with indication of flight directions and heights 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.080
 led into the final approach and was one 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.060
 collision with ground objects too 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.790
 will prevent the pilot through this 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.680
 map with the so-called mrv den 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.660
 minimum rada vectoring all the tips 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.430
 provided 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.470
 they are at least as high as the 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.420
 during the turn of vectors not 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.460
 should be fallen below 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.290
 how is this minimum altitude 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.750
 you can put together the box above 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.460
 on the left take for those of you the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.430
 I can not speak English so well 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.560
 once translated the mini 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.180
 morata vectoring youtube sit down 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.780
 together from the minimum security 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.510
 flight height 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.850
 this is 1000 feet above the highest 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.520
 obstacle within an eight kilometer 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.560
 radius and the lowest limit of the 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.320
 controlled airspace plus one 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.810
 buffer of 500 feet 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.580
 furthermore, we can do the box 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.890
 see that a shortfall 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.200
 this height is only allowed if one 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.070
 published afa procedure this 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.350
 is required in the third section 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.200
 explained that the height indication on the 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:17.660
 map in 100 foot steps 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.220
 So a 21 stands for 2100 feet the 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.050
 fourth paragraph explains and that the 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.050
 additional height information in the 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.610
 square brackets in some sectors 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.230
 are described only in the 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.420
 winter months between the months 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.420
 november and march are to be used 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.060
 Now we finally come to the map 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.039
 itself on her is the near area of 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.630
 airport days represents the gray 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.880
 solid dashed and 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.560
 dotted lines show us the 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.169
 different controlled air spaces 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.940
 in the vicinity of the airport of course 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.850
 including her airspace class and the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.710
 lower and upper limits too 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.360
 some navigation devices for 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.130
 the various landing approach procedures 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.470
 needed are shown here 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.060
 the most important for this card are 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.699
 However, the black rimmed 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.389
 areas of our nva sectors 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.190
 represent 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.370
 Let's look at all these sectors 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.259
 more precisely to the circled is the 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.150
 numbering of the sector which still 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.860
 once it becomes important when we look at the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.169
 look at the second page of the map 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.919
 the two boldface numbers 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:24.770
 below that, the mvs are the top one without 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.800
 clinging counts in the summer months the 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:32.110
 including during the winter months like us 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.110
 could just read in the box 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.790
 Now we go to the second page of the 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.040
 map on this sheet we find the 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.600
 Sectors numbered again 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.060
 number columns next to them show the 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.030
 exact coordinates of each corner of the 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.280
 of course find the relevant sector 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.470
 Here we have every sector of the map 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.550
 is pictured 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.530
 The side should be added for us 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.180
 but completely irrelevant are the 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.780
 For the sake of completeness, I wanted her 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.510
 show you once 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.410
 and that would be the end of the day for us 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.389
 arrived 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.010
 before I want to say goodbye 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.020
 I apologize to you for it 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.610
 that I am publishing with 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.520
 let this video take so long 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.370
 but unfortunately I just could not find it 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.810
 the time to finish the video 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.220
 yes I hope you understand that 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.560
 and will continue to be true to me 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.530
 So stay tuned until next time 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.840
 we will devote ourselves to the star approach map 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.500
 See you soon flip your virtual aviation flip 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.500
 help 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.539
 the 

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.600
 out
