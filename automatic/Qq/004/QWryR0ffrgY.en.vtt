00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
down the sleep button just as you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.939 
down the sleep button just as you
normally<00:00:51.449> would<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> power<00:00:52.350> off<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:52.680> device

power<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.340> your<00:00:56.640> device<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.750> you'd<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
power down your device so you'd have to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.369 
power down your device so you'd have to
run<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.739> computer<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> boot<00:01:00.359> tethered<00:01:00.870> so

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
run to a computer and boot tethered so

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.049 
run to a computer and boot tethered so
that's<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.859> helpful<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.550> guys<00:01:02.730> have
