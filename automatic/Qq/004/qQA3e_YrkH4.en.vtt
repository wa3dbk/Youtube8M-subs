00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
DVD set which for the time I'm sure was

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.430 
DVD set which for the time I'm sure was
great<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.400> now<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.030> dated<00:02:03.440> you

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
great but now it's a little dated you

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.580 
great but now it's a little dated you
can<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:05.180> off<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.450> side<00:02:06.630> though<00:02:06.840> this

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
can do that off to the side though this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.320 
can do that off to the side though this
is<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> much<00:02:08.039> more<00:02:08.069> lavish<00:02:08.670> presentation

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
is a much more lavish presentation

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.660 
is a much more lavish presentation
anyway<00:02:09.780> there's<00:02:10.409> a<00:02:10.500> lot<00:02:10.890> more<00:02:10.920> pictures

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
anyway there's a lot more pictures

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.790 
anyway there's a lot more pictures
behind<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.240> scenes<00:02:12.480> stuff<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:13.530> know<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
behind the scenes stuff you know the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.600 
behind the scenes stuff you know the
information<00:02:14.220> might<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> same<00:02:15.180> but

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
information might be the same but

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.450 
information might be the same but
the<00:02:15.700> graphics<00:02:16.120> are<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.840> much<00:02:17.080> better<00:02:17.460> the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
the graphics are so much better the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.870 
the graphics are so much better the
design<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.300> nicer<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.550> information

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
design is just nicer to the information

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.400 
design is just nicer to the information
still<00:02:22.270> good<00:02:22.480> regardless<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:23.110> what<00:02:23.290> you're

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410

still good regardless of what you're
reading<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.920> on<00:02:24.130> or<00:02:24.520> in<00:02:25.320> but<00:02:26.320> definitely<00:02:27.010> this

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
reading it on or in but definitely this

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.440 
reading it on or in but definitely this
is<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.370> way<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.580> read<00:02:27.820> it<00:02:27.940> if<00:02:28.030> you're<00:02:28.150> going<00:02:28.330> to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
counted these but I'm going to guess

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.990
