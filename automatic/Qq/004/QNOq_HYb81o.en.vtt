00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.830
 It was the seventh time I was in the build while I was sleeping. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.150
 Minecraft Pocket Edition The update is getting really fast 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.359
 It 's a good thing, it 's Jo Hyun Sang . 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.160
 In this seventh case, 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:33.750
 The fifth time I was not Thomas, the Aden Shock shocked me. 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 This seventh looks like the call center is an option. 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.410
 101 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:46.489
 So when you operate the controller, the delay is now 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.570
 I say no, but I do not know. I 'll go into the survival first. 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.570
 Now and Future 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:00.030
 Now Hull and movements should have anything gatgido If you think you have one 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.530
 Yeah, but I do not know if this is funny, Galaxy. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.150
 Give me a racial trait. 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:11.140
 I do not know if you are like me, there's the state jeongtaein put off moving lights 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.080
 And turning on the Galaxy 4 moving lights, the printer. 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:20.260
 I do not know if this is another cover. 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:24.100
 I think particularly severe in the galaxy So I live off the moving lights 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:29.530
 It looks soft. I do not think it's real 60 frames . 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:35.229
 Hometown 50 In the late 40s, 54 would not come out 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:40.260
 Well , let's look at what 's changed first. 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.260
 Well uh lay in bed chatting variety hadeoraguyo 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.330
 It's not Laura. 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.540
 Yes, but the salivary glands can come and chat. 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.450
 I'll be right there. 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.180
 Next time we can chat 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.130
 De la ah yes this this 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:08.190
 Be modified market would touch the arrow on the side rattling'll keep time 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.179
 By the way, when I put the item, 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.420
 time 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.599
 Draw the shape that the item helped with the arrow keys 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.630
 I know this is gonna get buried . 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.630
 5 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.940
 No, it is not. 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.340
 Occurred 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.849
 Ah, but the number of characters 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:38.730
 I left the ip on the left. 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:38.730
 Then the first pick went fast enough to get back to the diamond. 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.630
 Yes 5 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.720
 Trumpet to be 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.810
 It's not a big difference. 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.750
 I have two little inde two teeth 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.860
 Really 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.400
 I discard the original server, easy going easy 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.030
 I think this guy's a little faster anyway. 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.640
 Here we go. 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.750
 Then the modified part 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.750
 Let's make it easy for members . 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.400
 Oh by iron iron 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.400
 Here you are. 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.470
 Let's see. 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:35.510
 Let's be more than the original would produce a colon 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.810
 Determine to do so 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.170
 Handling Golems now has new items 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.170
 It's coming out. 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.990
 That's it. 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:53.730
 Come on. 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.690
 It 's unbreakable. 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.630
 It then fell on the iron 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.410
 To make a caste kass 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.270
 Why did you make it? 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.150
 Is not it 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.740
 You're throwing it away. 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.440
 I dropped a give value Castel tears and body items 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.769
 let's see 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.150
 4 5 Dropping experience 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.910
 Anyway, I did not see the tears Kirsty dropping to zero or items 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.330
 The clothes were going to check 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.040
 I had to go to the plate with a squid . 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.040
 I'm talking about Ozzie. 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:41.090
 Squid hope likewise o 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:45.170
 Same squid ink 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.560
 Could not make ink 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:51.470
 I'm raining the ink. 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:56.600
 It 's the same as Japan. 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:59.900
 I should have eaten 4 nights 4 Some of these have been added in this way. 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.110
 Rather than actually modifying the Act 4 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.510
 I have to add a few more things. 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.110
 The horse came right out. 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.110
 That's it. 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:18.220
 Anyway, if the item is not changed , 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:23.020
 I think it's okay. 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:28.260
