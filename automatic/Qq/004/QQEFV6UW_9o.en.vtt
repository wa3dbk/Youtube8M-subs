00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.210
 so could 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.160
 minutes 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.690
 felt hours 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.160
 I donate friend of these chimney 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.939
 think that's barbecuing for people who like it 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.340
 have a hurry 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.410
 but unfortunately I do not have any left here 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.150
 Choice as I said because the shells 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.279
 no holes have where one 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.860
 Air supply is given and he will be forever 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:39.379
 The charcoal burns out 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:42.470
 briquettes are a short topic 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.980
 you will become the meat of the spit 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.540
 see 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.760
 I always have to go here once in a while 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.290
 I'll make a small cut here 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.379
 do it alone and accordingly 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.450
 nobody can take over the camera work 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.620
 I have all the meat now 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.920
 traditionally made 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.170
 These are neck steaks that are good with 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.000
 seasoned with dry spices rubbed 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.670
 I have been then for me 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.229
 a bit with olive oil and there is 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.600
 nothing special is there now 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.700
 not that you reinvent the wheel here 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.259
 with what else do you use it 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.270
 a bit sharper but otherwise 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.220
 traditionally simple neck steaks very much 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.440
 You can cut thin at the butcher 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.110
 order extra and then as I said one 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.880
 great spices which spices in there 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.509
 that could come in anywhere 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.149
 read up 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.250
 there are enough of them and then 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.569
 just with a bit of olive oil 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.289
 enriched that well by having noticed 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:36.319
 I let 24 hours so and then 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.420
 where impaled but more about it 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.990
 you'll see that when the spit on 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.990
 the grill is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.490
 so now the time has come 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:54.150
 as you can see they do not see that here 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:57.130
 a motor death his side 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.370
 pursues execution-and here in the online 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.980
 this is not looking for now 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.450
 a lot of and but easily enough for two 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.250
 people that's 16 steaks now 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.040
 black coals are the ones in between 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.750
 are now slowly going through the area 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.490
 from the already coaling and by 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.600
 So of course I extend the 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.010
 time span when the now slow synonymous 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.710
 then again I put on the most glowing 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.020
 always a handful again and again 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.150
 so I always have a uniform 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.970
 heat and when one goes out is the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.400
 other is afoot here again 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.320
 to see again what I always have 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 in the first video with technology and 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.590
 Application has probably the advantage 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.090
 at song smoke he is if now that 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.910
 meat as far as that is me 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.160
 I can solve cuts right and left 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.720
 just the spangen push the advice 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.880
 this one down here comes one after 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.350
 bowl and can do this without that 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.209
 I come in contact with the heat 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.000
 clean cut down 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.390
 that's the advantage back later more 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.489
 if that was something cooked through 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.730
 looks a bit yummy but looks here 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.500
 here you can see touched 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.110
 actually the right and left of the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.810
 roast or accordingly jetzt.de the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.670
 idea of the office does not come in 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.430
 direct contact with the coal 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.800
 that is, nothing drips into it 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.810
 I have downstairs now because I unfortunately 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.060
 no matching scarf had with all 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.019
 Paper a shell tinkered that is 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.180
 but does not matter now 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.100
 the main thing that he is the fat of 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.930
 do not pour the gravy directly into the coal 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.820
 pure thunder because then we have again 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.810
 a cancer risk and we want that 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.370
 Of course not 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.630
 Now everyone would say it looks 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.610
 of course the heat on the right side 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.430
 left over and we have stop 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.690
 our ceiling make the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.980
 like that and more later 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.110
 of course we want the big meat 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.290
 also give a subtle smoke aroma 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.660
 that's why I have a handful of hickory 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.410
 Wood before half an hour in the water 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.530
 calmly 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.349
 very little beech with it 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.730
 not too deep and the smoke flavor has 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.810
 one does not have that with the greeks either and 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.019
 it's supposed to be a bit authentic 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.080
 note so temperature is in the picture 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.580
 moment at 130 degrees 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.590
 and that is quite enough for how 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.470
 said sideways he gets right and 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.419
 the quasi direct heat and left 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.500
 This will make it nice and crunchy, though 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:25.509
 more about that right now 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:30.009
 so now let's have a look 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:32.319
 already winter where you can not anymore 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:37.599
 the brightness i am doing now 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:44.129
 car after 20 minutes sees the already 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:45.849
 excellent and I think so 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:52.139
 quarter of an hour may be the first time 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:52.139
 cut as I said later more 

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:56.749
 so friends of good taste now 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.289
 we have the first meat 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:01.909
 cut down so it looks and 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.309
 There is again the advantage of the joker 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:07.789
 unscrewed screws unscrewed 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:09.979
 Spies pulled over under the cup am 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.550
 I do not hesitate with the heat in the contact 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:16.759
 just cut off and judis and buzzes 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.539
 Now it's nice to see that 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.539
 same is on the plate
