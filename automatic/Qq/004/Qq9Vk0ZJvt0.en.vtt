is enable we can start sharing files so
this<00:00:51.210> device<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:52.770> an<00:00:53.010> image

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
this device here I can go into an image

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.420 
this device here I can go into an image
gallery<00:00:56.329> see<00:00:57.329> if<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.840> opportunity<00:00:58.430> so

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
gallery see if I have one opportunity so

once you open the image you want you to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.630 
once you open the image you want you to
do<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.810> tap<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.560> two<00:01:07.830> device<00:01:08.100> together<00:01:08.460> like

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
do just tap the two device together like

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
do just tap the two device together like
this<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.470> instead<00:01:10.470> tap<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.920> bed<00:01:11.159> touch<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
this and instead tap to bed touch to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.480 
this and instead tap to bed touch to
beam<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.540> I'm<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:13.020> touch<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> swing<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
beam so I'm not touch on the swing and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
beam so I'm not touch on the swing and
the<00:01:14.580> file<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.939> then<00:01:15.060> beam<00:01:15.330> over<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.990> total

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the file is then beam over to total

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
the file is then beam over to total
device<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.820> slide<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> our

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
device you can see if I slide and our

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.810 
device you can see if I slide and our
notification<00:01:18.990> status<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:20.490> take<00:01:20.700> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
notification status I can take is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.260 
notification status I can take is
receiving<00:01:21.780> an<00:01:21.869> incoming<00:01:22.020> files<00:01:23.119> it's<00:01:24.119> an

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
receiving an incoming files it's an

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.480 
receiving an incoming files it's an
incoming<00:01:24.570> beam<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.680> another<00:01:26.009> flower<00:01:26.280> has

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
incoming beam it's another flower has

incoming beam it's another flower has
been<00:01:26.670> completed<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.290> touch<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.680> beam

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
been completed so you can touch on beam

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.230 
been completed so you can touch on beam
complete<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.759> view<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> file<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.119> can

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
complete to view the file and you can
