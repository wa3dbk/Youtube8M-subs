00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 we have learned the open agreements 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.389
 we tried to play the second one 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.540
 alternating rhythms and I hope that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.269
 you managed to get gods 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.789
 quick positions of safe positions 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.900
 and clean regarding the sound 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.570
 now what we're going to see that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.970
 we will try is the next step that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.150
 which will then give you a way to start 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.880
 to really play ie chord changes 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.300
 on the subject of changes of agreement 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.620
 present a very simple rule search 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.620
 to be a movement economizer 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.079
 that is, move as little as possible because 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.559
 the less things must move the faster you will be 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.629
 in making the changes then even if you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.050
 had to find in front of a song by 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.539
 who knows the agreements try to see them 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.920
 first and understand what the movements are 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.329
 in common that there are between the various agreements 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.670
 I'll show you right away starting with 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.640
 of the examples quite simple the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.400
 first in absolute the passage from me 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.710
 minor you love greater than I believe that not 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.330
 should really give you problems because it is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.890
 one of the first things we saw 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.890
 therefore from the mime the minor 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.770
 just this name step 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.299
 the important thing, however, at this point 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.259
 if you haven't already done your own 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:37.539
 initiative and to change them in time 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:39.789
 angles then here it is necessary that I 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.610
 I ask you to do something when you do 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.170
 armies on the changes of the agreements must 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.329
 first of all always have a reference 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.069
 of time therefore always uses a 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:54.460
 metronome otherwise being committed to 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.409
 see position of the right hand of the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.140
 left hand feel remembered 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.849
 agreements etcetera etc. will end that not 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.030
 I would be more careful instead of the duration 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:07.000
 exact of every agreement for which it uses 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.579
 always a metronome and always starts from 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.049
 simple rhythms then six 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.049
 free to complicate you as much as you 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.910
 uses the metronome also because if 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.989
 decide to play 4 chords a chord e 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.790
 4 beats of a second agreement if 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.860
 should you happen to fail 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.220
 change the agreement well on the first one 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.840
 beat tries to recover yours 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.260
 mistake don't stop time don't take 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.870
 the agreement and then left but try to ok 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.850
 I was wrong about the first wrong beat 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.980
 on the second I can get on 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.600
 third I will play third and fourth but then to the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.160
 first beat again 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.889
 I must be ready to change 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.769
 the agreement because if you think about it try to 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:56.109
 emerge all in real music if you 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.700
 you have to play with someone you do as if 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.400
 if only you were the one who made mistakes 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.500
 others never make mistakes will never happen 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.880
 however, in order to practice you it is better 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.610
 do so 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.830
 the more he does worse the one who stops is far 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.870
 stop everyone rather than recover 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.400
 a small mistake and falls into 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.380
 song at the right time then 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.160
 let's take an example always with the 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.020
 metronome this time a minor island e 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:34.100
 for the second for the second agreement if 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:37.680
 rondÃ² ok vino 2 3 4 1 2 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.810
 three four and change 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.340
 2 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.340
 4 change 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.980
 how much 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.970
 changes again 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.970
 2 if you feel confident change the rhythm 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.990
 notices something on the kind of rhythm that 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.820
 I used foresees the literate 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:23.520
 alternating on 4 then at the point where 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.080
 you are about to change the agreement to the non 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.460
 only the app lettered down but 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.040
 also the one upwards and this can 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.500
 be an element of difficulty in more 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.840
 so if you see that it is too much for the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.300
 moment maybe using the plethora of 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.920
 alternating on the other beats and not on the 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.190
 fourth because this is more time for 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.530
 think of the change of arrangement we make a 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.170
 example of an agreement changed badly for 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.330
 make you understand what I meant before 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.940
 then excuse first of all we choose 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.470
 the agreements we make use of 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.970
 we use the major and me major 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.520
 then first of all when I talked to you about 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.830
 economy of movements looks well 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.830
 positions 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.030
 after which it is easy to observe that in the 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.790
 passage from the greater hooks greater 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.670
 middle and ring fingers that are attached 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.680
 together for the agreement there remain 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.020
 stuck together for me agree 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.920
 so in reality you're not moving three 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.410
 fingers but a block of two fingers and a third 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:30.800
 second finger then the index drops 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:35.670
 while mean and annular then rise the 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:39.980
 try the change a few times before 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:42.810
 to start playing and you'll see that 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.680
 doing so will become everything 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:51.710
 a little simpler 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:51.710
 let's start 12 34 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.560
 yet 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.100
 ok now i'm wrong 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:32.000
 34 allotment recovery 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:34.910
 if you're wrong here there should be 12 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.700
 34 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:42.680
 2 this is what i mean when you 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.000
 I say strive to recover on a 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.880
 possible error because it will make you find 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.720
 faster to change space 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.720
 the agreements
