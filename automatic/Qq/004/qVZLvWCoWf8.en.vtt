00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:19.509 
trellises on the two foxes that we made

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.530 
trellises on the two foxes that we made
really<00:00:19.810> easy<00:00:20.460> first<00:00:21.460> thing<00:00:21.640> you<00:00:21.759> got<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:21.970> do<00:00:22.270> is

really easy first thing you got to do is

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.380 
really easy first thing you got to do is
take<00:00:22.980> chunks<00:00:23.980> of<00:00:24.099> rebar<00:00:24.550> you<00:00:24.970> can<00:00:25.090> get<00:00:25.210> the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
take chunks of rebar you can get the

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.929 
take chunks of rebar you can get the
hardware<00:00:26.020> store<00:00:26.259> about<00:00:26.439> 18<00:00:26.980> inches<00:00:27.310> long<00:00:27.369> 2

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
hardware store about 18 inches long 2

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.790 
hardware store about 18 inches long 2
feet<00:00:28.150> long<00:00:28.390> we're<00:00:29.260> going<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.439> drive<00:00:29.590> them<00:00:29.740> in

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
feet long we're going to drive them in

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.900 
feet long we're going to drive them in
the<00:00:29.890> ground<00:00:30.100> at<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.279> corners

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
the ground at the corners

00:00:30.910 --> 00:01:27.840 
the ground at the corners
I'll<00:00:31.029> show<00:00:31.269> you<00:00:35.850> pretty<00:00:36.850> easy

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:41.190 

over<00:01:28.850> here

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.649 

okay<00:01:42.200> what<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:42.470> did<00:01:42.619> was<00:01:43.159> I<00:01:43.579> took<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:44.119> ten<00:01:44.479> foot

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
okay what I did was I took a ten foot

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.899 
okay what I did was I took a ten foot
piece<00:01:44.899> of<00:01:45.049> conduit<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:46.220> I<00:01:46.310> cut<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.549> in<00:01:46.759> half

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
piece of conduit and I cut it in half

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.469 
piece of conduit and I cut it in half
and<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.210> gave<00:01:47.420> me<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.600> two<00:01:47.930> long<00:01:48.500> uprights

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
and that gave me the two long uprights

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.499 
and that gave me the two long uprights
then<00:01:50.479> I<00:01:50.600> took<00:01:50.840> when<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:51.110> cut<00:01:51.350> one<00:01:51.619> here<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:53.360> have

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
then I took when I cut one here you have

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.779 
then I took when I cut one here you have
to<00:01:53.689> subtract<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.500> difference<00:01:55.009> of<00:01:55.579> the

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
to subtract the difference of the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.359 
to subtract the difference of the
fitting<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.360> each<00:01:56.479> side<00:01:56.950> if<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.100> have<00:01:58.189> to<00:01:58.310> do

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
fitting in each side if you have to do

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.850 
fitting in each side if you have to do
that<00:01:58.549> by<00:01:58.729> trial<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.119> error<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.479> can<00:01:59.720> but<00:02:00.049> it

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
that by trial and error you can but it

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.440 
that by trial and error you can but it
comes<00:02:01.100> out<00:02:01.310> pretty<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.880> comes<00:02:02.149> out<00:02:02.299> pretty

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
comes out pretty it comes out pretty

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.039 
comes out pretty it comes out pretty
easy<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.170> then<00:02:03.560> I<00:02:03.590> attach<00:02:03.799> these<00:02:04.280> conduit<00:02:05.049> 90

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
easy and then I attach these conduit 90

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.779 
easy and then I attach these conduit 90
degree<00:02:06.350> elbows<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.069> just<00:02:07.100> screwed<00:02:07.700> it

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
degree elbows and just screwed it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.050 
degree elbows and just screwed it
together<00:02:08.229> then<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.319> took<00:02:09.530> these<00:02:09.649> little<00:02:10.060> twist

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
together then I took these little twist

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.920 
together then I took these little twist
size<00:02:11.269> or<00:02:12.519> zip<00:02:13.519> strips<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.120> electrician's<00:02:14.690> use

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
size or zip strips the electrician's use

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.970 
size or zip strips the electrician's use
wire<00:02:15.440> strips<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:17.180> suspended<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:18.019> burpies

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
wire strips and I suspended a burpies

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.190 
wire strips and I suspended a burpies
net<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.599> second<00:02:20.959> year<00:02:20.989> I've

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
net and this is the second year I've

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.589 
net and this is the second year I've
used<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.650> one<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.880> held<00:02:23.090> up<00:02:23.269> all<00:02:23.450> winter

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
used this one and it held up all winter

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.150 
used this one and it held up all winter
and<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:24.110> folded<00:02:24.470> up<00:02:24.620> like<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.980> saw

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
and I just folded up like you saw

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.550 
and I just folded up like you saw
earlier<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.849> it<00:02:26.540> really<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.840> was<00:02:26.989> easy<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.290> put

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
earlier and it really it was easy to put

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.759 
earlier and it really it was easy to put
back<00:02:27.709> up<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.630> don't<00:02:29.840> Chris<00:02:30.230> if<00:02:30.709> you

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
back up but if you don't Chris if you

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.420 
back up but if you don't Chris if you
don't<00:02:31.540> shortcut<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:34.040> wanted<00:02:34.280> any

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
don't shortcut it you wanted any

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.270 
don't shortcut it you wanted any
problems<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:36.170> other<00:02:36.319> thing<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.709> if<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:36.920> do

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
problems the other thing is if you do

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.960 
problems the other thing is if you do
have<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:38.230> access<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.500> tubing<00:02:40.040> vendor<00:02:40.519> you

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
have the access to a tubing vendor you

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.660 
have the access to a tubing vendor you
could<00:02:41.150> actually<00:02:41.299> event<00:02:41.840> these<00:02:42.109> and<00:02:43.100> maybe<00:02:43.370> put

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
could actually event these and maybe put

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.180 
could actually event these and maybe put
a<00:02:43.700> union<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.299> here<00:02:44.510> somewhere<00:02:44.959> but<00:02:45.320> I<00:02:45.650> just

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
a union in here somewhere but I just

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.580 
a union in here somewhere but I just
went<00:02:46.400> with<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.700> connections<00:02:47.329> that<00:02:47.600> way<00:02:48.380> if<00:02:48.500> I

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
went with the connections that way if I

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.729 
went with the connections that way if I
had<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.980> take<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.340> apart<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:50.390> transport<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
had to take it apart to transport it it

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.970 
had to take it apart to transport it it
could<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.819> this<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.079> trellises<00:02:54.590> for<00:02:54.829> this

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
could so this is the trellises for this

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.420 
could so this is the trellises for this
year<00:02:56.109> later<00:02:57.109> on<00:02:57.200> I'll<00:02:57.470> show<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.680> how<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:58.130> put

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
year later on I'll show you how I put

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.340 
year later on I'll show you how I put
the<00:02:58.670> fence<00:02:58.880> around<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.420> keep<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.810> rabbits<00:03:00.170> out

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
the fence around it keep the rabbits out

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.900 
the fence around it keep the rabbits out
rabbits<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.200> put<00:03:03.500> these<00:03:03.709> really<00:03:04.100> nice<00:03:04.310> posts

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
rabbits so I put these really nice posts

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.309 
rabbits so I put these really nice posts
in<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.120> ground<00:03:05.269> I<00:03:06.010> got<00:03:07.010> from<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:08.019> farm<00:03:09.019> fleet

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
in the ground I got from the farm fleet

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.009 
in the ground I got from the farm fleet
store<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.280> just<00:03:10.579> simple<00:03:10.940> chicken<00:03:11.810> wire

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
store and just simple chicken wire

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.920 
store and just simple chicken wire
around<00:03:12.319> it<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.359> turns<00:03:14.600> out<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.900> be

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
around it and if this turns out to be

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.620 
around it and if this turns out to be
too<00:03:15.200> tall<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.889> might<00:03:16.370> go<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:16.760> get<00:03:16.940> some<00:03:17.180> shorter

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
too tall I might go and get some shorter

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.860
