00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
to use so it's pretty simple we are

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.700 
to use so it's pretty simple we are
going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.720> use<00:00:25.340> one<00:00:26.340> tablespoon<00:00:26.449> of<00:00:27.710> organic

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

yogurt<00:00:28.920> one<00:00:29.640> egg<00:00:30.000> white<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.720> separated<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.619> off

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
yogurt one egg white I separated it off

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
yogurt one egg white I separated it off
camera<00:00:32.160> because<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.940> sometimes<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
camera because it sometimes can be a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.600 
camera because it sometimes can be a
little<00:00:34.110> bit<00:00:34.320> tricky<00:00:34.739> getting<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> yolk<00:00:35.399> out

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
little bit tricky getting the yolk out

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.709 
little bit tricky getting the yolk out
and<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.579> 1<00:00:38.579> tablespoon<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and I'm going to do 1 tablespoon of

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.470 
and I'm going to do 1 tablespoon of
warmed<00:00:40.379> honey<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.730> use<00:00:41.879> warmed<00:00:42.270> honey

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
warmed honey I like to use warmed honey

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.389 
warmed honey I like to use warmed honey
just<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.160> bit

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
just because I think it's a little bit

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.639 
just because I think it's a little bit
easier<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> work<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:45.840> when<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.530> little

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
easier to work with when it's a little

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.650 
easier to work with when it's a little
bit<00:00:46.800> warmed<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:47.910> bit<00:00:48.059> looser<00:00:48.480> in

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
bit warmed it's a little bit looser in

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.799 
bit warmed it's a little bit looser in
the<00:00:48.899> bowl<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.940> we're<00:00:50.940> also<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.539> use

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the bowl and we're also going to use

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.799 
the bowl and we're also going to use
almond<00:00:52.350> oil<00:00:52.699> almond<00:00:53.699> oil<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.120> an<00:00:54.270> incredible

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
almond oil almond oil is an incredible

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.600 
almond oil almond oil is an incredible
ingredient<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> skin<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
ingredient for the skin because it is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.110 
ingredient for the skin because it is
anti-aging<00:00:56.850> its<00:00:57.780> anti-inflammatory<00:00:59.120> but

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
anti-aging its anti-inflammatory but

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.029 
anti-aging its anti-inflammatory but
it's<00:01:00.300> also<00:01:00.539> very<00:01:01.050> hydrating<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.949> skin

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it's also very hydrating for the skin

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.310 
it's also very hydrating for the skin
you<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.270> only<00:01:03.420> need<00:01:03.570> half<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.680> teaspoon<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
you really only need half a teaspoon of

you really only need half a teaspoon of
the<00:01:07.320> almond<00:01:08.010> oil

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the almond oil

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
the almond oil
and<00:01:09.660> then<00:01:09.900> I'm<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> add<00:01:10.980> my<00:01:11.780> egg<00:01:12.780> yolk<00:01:13.250> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and then I'm going to add my egg yolk to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.540 
and then I'm going to add my egg yolk to
my<00:01:14.460> honey<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> my<00:01:15.540> almond<00:01:15.990> oil<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:19.550> finally

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
my honey and my almond oil and finally

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:32.210 
my honey and my almond oil and finally
I'm<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:23.240> add<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.510> yogurt<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> mix

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.050 

so

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.380 
so
I<00:01:35.090> like<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:36.110> use<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.680> fork<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:38.350> I'm<00:01:39.350> blending

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
I like to use a fork and I'm blending

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.899 
I like to use a fork and I'm blending
masks<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.690> have<00:01:41.830> egg<00:01:42.830> yolk<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.400> them<00:01:43.580> just

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
masks that have egg yolk in them just

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.140 
masks that have egg yolk in them just
because<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.299> find<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.840> easier<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.290> use<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:46.790> can

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
because I find it easier to use you can

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.740 
because I find it easier to use you can
use<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.810> whisk<00:01:48.080> or<00:01:49.000> whatever<00:01:50.000> implement<00:01:50.659> you

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
use a whisk or whatever implement you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.480 
use a whisk or whatever implement you
think<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.170> just<00:01:51.350> easiest<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.220> blend

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
think is just easiest to blend

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.160 
think is just easiest to blend
everything<00:01:52.640> together<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.720> really<00:01:54.020> want

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
everything together but you really want

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.649 
everything together but you really want
to<00:01:54.259> make<00:01:54.409> sure<00:01:54.440> that<00:01:54.830> all<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.100> ingredients

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
to make sure that all the ingredients

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.359 
to make sure that all the ingredients
blend<00:01:56.659> together<00:01:57.050> properly<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.250> your

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
blend together properly so that your

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.100 
blend together properly so that your
skin<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:58.850> get<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.090> benefit<00:01:59.540> of<00:01:59.570> everything

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
skin can get the benefit of everything

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.630 
skin can get the benefit of everything
that<00:02:00.350> you're<00:02:00.560> using<00:02:01.720> it<00:02:02.720> just<00:02:02.930> takes<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.350> minute

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
that you're using it just takes a minute

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.090 
that you're using it just takes a minute
and<00:02:05.440> so<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.500> just<00:02:06.890> want<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.250> apply<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:09.100> thin

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
and so you just want to apply a thin

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.759 
and so you just want to apply a thin
layer<00:02:10.729> of<00:02:10.789> everything<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.500> if<00:02:12.620> you've

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
layer of everything and if you've

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.400 
layer of everything and if you've
blended<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.340> properly<00:02:13.790> your<00:02:14.420> skin<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.080> really

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
blended it properly your skin is really

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.620 
blended it properly your skin is really
going<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.620> get<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.890> benefit<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.630> every

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
going to get the benefit of every

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.020
