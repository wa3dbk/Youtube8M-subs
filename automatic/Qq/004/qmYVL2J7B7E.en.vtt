well I really like how the necklace the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.760 
well I really like how the necklace the
beaded<00:03:08.060> necklace<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> Cell<00:03:08.870> matches<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.560> color

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
beaded necklace a Cell matches the color

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.030 
beaded necklace a Cell matches the color
of<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.190> elephant<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:10.910> bull<00:03:12.040> because

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
of the elephant and the bull because

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.820 
of the elephant and the bull because
most<00:03:13.310> necklaces<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.180> buy<00:03:14.450> there<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.530> chain

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
most necklaces you buy there the chain

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.710 
most necklaces you buy there the chain
is<00:03:15.860> always<00:03:16.340> silver<00:03:16.760> or<00:03:16.880> gold<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.390> thought

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
is always silver or gold so I thought

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.930 
is always silver or gold so I thought
this<00:03:17.870> was<00:03:18.020> pretty<00:03:18.200> unique<00:03:18.620> how<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.430> necklace

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
this was pretty unique how the necklace

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.780 
this was pretty unique how the necklace
matches<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.920> I'm<00:03:21.980> guessing<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.460> could<00:03:22.610> take

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
matches so I'm guessing you could take

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.310 
matches so I'm guessing you could take
the<00:03:22.910> elephant<00:03:23.360> out<00:03:23.480> if<00:03:23.630> you<00:03:23.750> want<00:03:23.960> and<00:03:24.170> add

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
the elephant out if you want and add

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.990 
the elephant out if you want and add
your<00:03:24.440> own<00:03:24.500> charm<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.220> too<00:03:25.520> so<00:03:25.730> it's<00:03:25.850> pretty

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
your own charm to it too so it's pretty

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.710 
your own charm to it too so it's pretty
