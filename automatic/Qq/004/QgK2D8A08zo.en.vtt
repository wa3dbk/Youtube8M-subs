00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 god we come to the film part of five 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.300
 tactics and we want all that 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.179
 we showed you in tactics 1234 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.269
 have communicated in part 5 so pack 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.320
 that there is a training session also in the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.760
 Club could give so to the complete 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.400
 Repeat often we make a small one 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 democrat where I keep saying that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.710
 what I'm doing right now what 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.619
 just gone 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.510
 where he has not spoken since then 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.510
 so attacked is where just me 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.239
 so as I said that handshake with the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.610
 I explain to you directly that means you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.480
 before training the sativa opponent 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.969
 confronts 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.559
 Everyone has their couch in the pants thinking 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.450
 I have my coach there arises 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.430
 stand then it goes forward 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.469
 fighting lines directly to the front 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.809
 Exactly and then it just says of 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.359
 umpire if he now the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.489
 you have to take care handshake 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.809
 not a place i would get him 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.180
 Still , impacts were easy 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.700
 drive and then you fit a bit 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.310
 up and good as soon as you get there 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.530
 has taken dominion place 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.290
 create space right behind yourself completely 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.560
 important what was the first direction 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.360
 we always hit the page 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.369
 is called pink simulated here now 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.369
 actually directly a direct attack 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.280
 should elicit 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.140
 actually I should attack here 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.060
 actually I should attack the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.700
 thing was that I get motivation and 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.310
 that I have the attack for anyway 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.420
 I told you to safety yes 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.520
 short is endless 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.950
 That's what makes you that means we 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.709
 make the handshake security is too 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.369
 still directly my technology that means with 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:59.149
 to test the leg what is the pass? 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.500
 So what does he responded again 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:07.740
 out out about something 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:12.799
 to watch the possibility okay now the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.799
 come together that she settles instead 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.700
 in the blow and my points also in the hole 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:27.060
 attack but just when settling technique 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.380
 out again and won so come 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.600
 the story with the fooling it 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.170
 means to need rhythm 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.440
 I hope I have my points 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.909
 done simulates that in exactly the same way 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.159
 move us 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:43.930
 The book means I'm unsettling mine 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:46.599
 attack enemy 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.580
 I 've made my points the time 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.769
 expires 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.170
 I withdraw from the fight and 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.269
 say okay she has to come now anyway 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.370
 I know that I have created that 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:05.739
 this basis and that's exactly what I take 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:12.910
 but now that I'm ok time 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:13.980
 runs maybe yes and derek 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.650
 shoot open 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.290
 next stop to get some time air 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.659
 because I hit a hard hit building tie 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.159
 but supposedly time is running and that 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:30.310
 is to your advantage and that calls all 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.510
 tactical and thus can be just 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.819
 Fighter succeeded quite well 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.690
 Just how to get the glove to cancer yet 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.920
 not say 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.380
 it looks like this then I would say a 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.450
 demo fight why little demo came for 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.000
 white already made 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.000
 the next part of the apa
