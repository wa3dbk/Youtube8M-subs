00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.069
 the end of the web to minecraft suits 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.069
 to the volume that is there 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.080
 Hi everyone guys it's me 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 welcome to this new video is 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.500
 rabbits for shopping see here the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.039
 a wide range of hardware that I 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.220
 I 'm let myself be brought into these 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.080
 days are mine I do n't know mine 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.599
 choices that you could always have 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.820
 comment in comments if when good or 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.820
 they go wrong or you don't like them anyway 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.030
 both story mode by going to my pc 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.329
 the project that 53 16 32 this video 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 these videos will go into that playlist 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.800
 like saying I chose a lot of things from it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.570
 I chose as he did already seen in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.170
 version of what is called the kage il 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.600
 that the storm storm trooper roupts 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.230
 for inversion guys big enough 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.180
 it's quite inconvenient to say why 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.369
 just find a place and a big tour 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.170
 where to put it but it is quite comfortable for 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.400
 me for all the aquariums surveyors inside 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.520
 you have seen the project when for 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.189
 be the dissipator video card says 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.619
 lots of bulky stuff 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.740
 let's say one thing to another thing 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.210
 I'm changing and just the power supply 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.619
 This down here I do not know if I receive it 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.400
 see and the power supply precisely or 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.650
 presumed a thousand 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.990
 I was just wrong and faults 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.240
 events I don't remember which model 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.579
 however, lately I've noticed that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.990
 power dropped in the sense that at 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.869
 sometimes they even send me a card 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.270
 very usb video connected all together 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.579
 they didn't go where to connect some for 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.380
 then connect the other notes of 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.840
 tension then I chose half a thousand 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.240
 I should be okay hopefully later 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.660
 I repeat I am not a magician I am not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.940
 hardware and from the dark 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.410
 I don't know these confused excuses for the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.350
 glasses guys but there is the lighthouse of 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.990
 facing the born and using nothing true 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.640
 then the one I chose was the one I chose 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.670
 also noticed the offices lately 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.979
 do not always cool it as it was supposed to 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.020
 which I will now rely on for ventilation 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.660
 all the rest of the pc while for the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.210
 processor 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.150
 I will rely on liquid cooling e 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.840
 that's why I chose the hotel from the 40 l 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.230
 taken me 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.290
 a liquid cooling kit now 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.610
 you see it closes boxed but anyway 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.010
 if you want he 'll show you too 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.290
 unboxing, that is when the world also 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.550
 if you want I will show you pc already assembled 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.230
 as you prefer 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.120
 then let's move on to the bullshit there is a 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.290
 little smaller than back there 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.820
 my project pc 33 and 16 as 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.540
 see churches small enough and 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.470
 inside it's all compressed yes 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.500
 the service overheated 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.200
 warmed what is not much for 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.880
 regarding ventilation the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.209
 i prefer the router hopefully go 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.670
 better 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.500
 then oh well some fell guys it 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.150
 I take as you see the carpet on 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.700
 mouse pad and the one a little bit 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.140
 bigger so I'm a little bit 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.760
 more comfortable because the other I had is 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.810
 quite small I also changed the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.610
 mouse 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.519
 if you remember I also had a 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.280
 sentinel the previous one this one is 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.190
 the sentinel ii advanced should 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.110
 little change the part i dpi etcetera 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.390
 I don't know how to tell the kids about things 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.100
 technical data sheets because they are 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.739
 you know when you dry off 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.959
 however I will find you I will show you 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.420
 you have not rightly if you will see mine 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.130
 online videos made well etc. 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.720
 to say that pci was perfectly waxed if 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.900
 you don't want my videos I combined 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.370
 all the mess broke out then from 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.680
 mat are passed to the mouse from 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.000
 mouse we pass to the headphones I chose 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.450
 these headphones guys because they are 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.060
 really daughters and you can also notice 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.150
 the base has then already that it leans on 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.129
 table with volume 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:59.290
 other keys I have to see to whom it seems 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:00.810
 I don't know double USB attack then there is the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.909
 connection for the headphones themselves 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.950
 they would be with the fund even if not 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.519
 you see I focus you should 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.890
 see them are placed here of cm 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.500
 storm are the sirius so many fears 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.180
 they know I 've taken several of them 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.639
 headphones i gotta be honest i have 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.190
 got a lot of cuffee in my bow 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.210
 youtube between mouse headsets I have changed 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.650

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.900
 they drop etc. 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.979
 start to rumble as you see this too 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.510
 you should feel a little better I hope 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.340

 video camera the one who is watching me 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.410
