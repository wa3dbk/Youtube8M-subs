project<00:00:18.190> so<00:00:19.350> let's<00:00:20.350> continue<00:00:20.740> where<00:00:20.980> we<00:00:21.010> quit

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 
project so let's continue where we quit

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.270 
project so let's continue where we quit
last<00:00:21.970> time<00:00:22.240> we<00:00:22.420> created<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.900> user<00:00:23.890> and<00:00:24.070> a

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
last time we created a user and a

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.900 
last time we created a user and a
database<00:00:25.150> for<00:00:28.140> what<00:00:29.140> you<00:00:29.320> call<00:00:29.440> it<00:00:29.619> is<00:00:30.039> forum

database for what you call it is forum

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.740 
database for what you call it is forum
for<00:00:31.690> our<00:00:31.780> ranking<00:00:32.289> system<00:00:32.649> and<00:00:32.800> we<00:00:32.890> also

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
for our ranking system and we also

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920 
for our ranking system and we also
installed<00:00:34.860> active<00:00:35.860> pearl<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:36.460> some<00:00:37.420> scripts

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
installed active pearl and some scripts

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.830 
installed active pearl and some scripts
some<00:00:38.680> perl<00:00:38.860> scripts<00:00:39.220> and<00:00:39.430> created<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.300> SCMP

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
some perl scripts and created the SCMP

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.389 
some perl scripts and created the SCMP
file<00:00:41.110> for<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:41.920> ranking<00:00:42.220> system<00:00:42.579> so<00:00:42.790> mm<00:00:43.690> I<00:00:44.530> will

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
file for the ranking system so mm I will

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.729 
file for the ranking system so mm I will
actually<00:00:45.670> have<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:45.880> be<00:00:45.970> going<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:46.690> test<00:00:46.960> the

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
actually have to be going to test the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.220 
actually have to be going to test the
ranking<00:00:48.160> system<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:48.730> in<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.920> tutorial<00:00:51.180> in

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
ranking system and in this tutorial in

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.319 
ranking system and in this tutorial in
the<00:00:53.230> i<00:00:53.530> will<00:00:53.739> make<00:00:53.890> app<00:00:54.160> review<00:00:54.579> tutorial<00:00:54.760> when

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
the i will make app review tutorial when

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.500 
the i will make app review tutorial when
we<00:00:55.510> have<00:00:55.690> everything<00:00:56.170> set<00:00:56.559> up<00:00:56.590> running<00:00:57.070> and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
we have everything set up running and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.459 
we have everything set up running and
then<00:00:58.510> then<00:00:58.899> we<00:00:58.989> can<00:00:59.140> see<00:00:59.910> how<00:01:01.469> everything

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
then then we can see how everything

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.819 
then then we can see how everything
works<00:01:02.649> together<00:01:02.829> I<00:01:03.370> have<00:01:03.790> actually<00:01:04.119> got<00:01:04.329> my

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
works together I have actually got my

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:06.810 
works together I have actually got my
physical<00:01:05.829> server<00:01:06.040> up<00:01:06.219> and<00:01:06.310> running<00:01:06.399> so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
physical server up and running so

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.949 
physical server up and running so
there's<00:01:07.030> no<00:01:07.180> need<00:01:07.329> of<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.539> virtual<00:01:07.810> machine

00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:07.959 
there's no need of the virtual machine

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:11.910 
there's no need of the virtual machine
but<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:10.090> off<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.020> server<00:01:11.229> system<00:01:11.649> is<00:01:11.770> in

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
but all off the server system is in

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.129 
but all off the server system is in
Danish<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.490> not<00:01:13.359> just<00:01:13.959> this<00:01:15.240> PHP<00:01:16.240> my<00:01:16.929> admin

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.139 
Danish and not just this PHP my admin

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:21.359 
Danish and not just this PHP my admin
system<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:18.329> so<00:01:19.709> that<00:01:20.709> would<00:01:20.829> be<00:01:20.859> a<00:01:21.009> little<00:01:21.189> bit

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
system and so that would be a little bit

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.359 
system and so that would be a little bit
stupid<00:01:22.359> to<00:01:22.810> do<00:01:22.929> so<00:01:23.109> I<00:01:23.319> will<00:01:23.709> create<00:01:24.039> everything

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
stupid to do so I will create everything

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.139 
stupid to do so I will create everything
and<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:24.909> here<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.630> course<00:01:25.929> have<00:01:26.759> copy<00:01:27.759> on<00:01:28.029> it

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
and this here of course have copy on it

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.629 
and this here of course have copy on it
on<00:01:28.299> my<00:01:28.569> server<00:01:29.109> I'll<00:01:29.259> just<00:01:29.439> redo<00:01:30.130> what<00:01:30.369> I<00:01:30.399> did

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:30.639 
on my server I'll just redo what I did

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.269 
on my server I'll just redo what I did
on<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:30.819> server<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.509> I'm<00:01:31.779> gonna<00:01:32.469> get<00:01:32.859> an<00:01:32.950> exact

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:33.279 
on the server so I'm gonna get an exact

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:35.010 
on the server so I'm gonna get an exact
clone<00:01:33.429> of<00:01:33.579> what<00:01:33.969> I<00:01:33.999> have<00:01:34.420> made<00:01:34.630> on<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:34.810> server

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
clone of what I have made on the server

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.789 
clone of what I have made on the server
so<00:01:35.939> anyway<00:01:36.939> never<00:01:37.929> let<00:01:38.079> me<00:01:38.170> show<00:01:38.349> you<00:01:38.380> in<00:01:38.649> the
