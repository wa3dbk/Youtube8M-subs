00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
tensions and they are these ones I've

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510

looked all over the place for extensions
and<00:00:38.940> always<00:00:39.510> try<00:00:39.719> out<00:00:39.870> new<00:00:40.050> places<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.860> this

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
is I think these must be only half a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.100 
is I think these must be only half a
head<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.520> they're<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.570> thick<00:00:45.840> but

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
head because they're that thick but

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.209 
head because they're that thick but
because<00:00:46.440> I've<00:00:46.620> got<00:00:47.570> extensions<00:00:49.010> if<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.100> would

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
two clips I like these because they've

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.950

got really massive clips on them and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.990 
got really massive clips on them and
they<00:01:18.960> feel<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.500> much<00:01:19.740> secure<00:01:20.460> than<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:20.880> my

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.910 
other extensions I've had my think these
are<00:01:23.040> quite<00:01:23.250> good<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.820> they've<00:01:24.000> got<00:01:24.270> huge

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
hanging around there's quite a lot of

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.080 
hanging around there's quite a lot of
them<00:04:29.010> actually<00:04:29.900> like<00:04:30.900> here<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:32.040> can<00:04:32.190> see<00:04:32.490> but

them actually like here you can see but

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.860 
them actually like here you can see but
I've<00:04:33.300> layered<00:04:33.570> them<00:04:33.780> in<00:04:33.930> between<00:04:34.080> my<00:04:34.440> old<00:04:34.590> ones

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
I've layered them in between my old ones

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.600 
I've layered them in between my old ones
but<00:04:36.870> they've<00:04:37.020> really<00:04:37.260> really<00:04:37.950> made<00:04:38.190> such<00:04:38.580> a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
but they've really really made such a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.970 
but they've really really made such a
difference<00:04:38.880> because<00:04:39.590> my<00:04:40.590> hair<00:04:40.710> extensions

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
difference because my hair extensions

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.530 
difference because my hair extensions
were<00:04:41.190> really<00:04:41.430> scraggly<00:04:41.790> there<00:04:42.120> wasn't<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.390> lot

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
were really scraggly there wasn't a lot

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.080 
were really scraggly there wasn't a lot
of<00:04:43.080> length<00:04:43.410> anymore<00:04:44.250> there<00:04:44.490> was<00:04:44.580> just<00:04:44.760> width

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
of length anymore there was just width

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.080 
of length anymore there was just width
but<00:04:45.900> these<00:04:46.020> have<00:04:46.200> really<00:04:46.410> brought<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:47.010> out<00:04:47.670> and

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
but these have really brought it out and

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.910 
but these have really brought it out and
I<00:04:48.180> really<00:04:48.750> recommend<00:04:48.870> getting<00:04:49.410> them<00:04:49.590> if<00:04:49.770> you

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
I really recommend getting them if you

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.290 
I really recommend getting them if you
need

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
need

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.060 
need
he<00:04:51.540> was<00:04:51.720> thickening<00:04:52.080> up<00:04:52.260> or<00:04:52.530> if<00:04:52.680> you've<00:04:52.830> got

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
he was thickening up or if you've got

he was thickening up or if you've got
like<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.490> said<00:04:53.670> if<00:04:53.760> you<00:04:53.850> got<00:04:53.970> thin<00:04:54.180> hair<00:04:54.420> then

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
like I said if you got thin hair then

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.780 
like I said if you got thin hair then
they'll<00:04:55.500> be<00:04:55.590> perfect<00:04:56.160> because<00:04:56.400> my<00:04:56.610> hair<00:04:56.760> is

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
they'll be perfect because my hair is

they'll be perfect because my hair is
