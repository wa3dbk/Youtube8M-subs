00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.440
 we show you how to make a pizza of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.949
 fried endive with dough a 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.900
 lactic fermentation short minutes like 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.000
 we got the endive the endive 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 we blanched it in water and salt 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.900
 very abundant so that the color 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.560
 stay alive and where we jumped into 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.720
 oil garlic capers and anchovies some e 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.309
 of tradition put white raisins 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.230
 the fussy passes 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.750
 in this case to your liking 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 you may also like to put it as 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.120
 let's do then we cut it looks like one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:52.969
 part of the dough to make us ours 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:56.960
 pizza do the round and to do the 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.960
 we spread very well 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.180
 I recommend that the endive are must 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.120
 be well and dry to make oneself 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.510
 reshuffle does not suffer too much and you can 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.240
 break we take it to the endive that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:22.080
 put in the center with the caper olives 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.290
 and now we are going to close this one 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.290
 Pizza 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:39.920
 there are always well closed or good 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.000
 use of a fork 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.000
 but be careful not to vote 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:56.130
 just always nice and boiling at 180 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.380
 degrees and throw in and important 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.119
 the boiling oil you would not have absorbed 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.100
 too much oil and therefore we will have a result 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:08.429
 I use a lot of them to fry trying to 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.560
 I remember that besides the scarole we could 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.910
 also use other vegetables who don't 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.569
 sa high rating 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.769
 on this hard stage we do pretend 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.769
 of jane I call fried pizza 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.850
 the fact that it is pulled very thin by 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.770
 a higher speed one in the 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.150
 so cooking of life is one 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.950
 very important because the pizza 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.900
 always remain crunchy on the outside but all 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.930
 a very wet year's interior is dead 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.750
 our fried pizza is ready 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:50.200
 let's go up and eat well 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:53.520
 hot we are from a pizza then 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.580
 very crunchy love feels right 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.830
 the little one with the pizza dough 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.150
 then we check in this case 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.790
 I repeat we used the endive 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.040
 because it is the of very frequent in this 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.070
 period use them 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.230
 but nobody stops you from using any 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.130
 other vegetables to add mozzarella 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.900
 use ricotta and mozzarella spinach everything 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.010
 what you may have in ours 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.959
 handouts 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.300
 the important thing I remind you to use 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.260
 always high quality products is that 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.260
 are around you
