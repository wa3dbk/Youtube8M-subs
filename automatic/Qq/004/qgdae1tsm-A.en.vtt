00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
approached Bugatti again but at that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.150 
approached Bugatti again but at that
time<00:00:35.690> Bugatti<00:00:36.290> wasn't<00:00:36.620> really<00:00:36.770> interested<00:00:36.920> in

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
time Bugatti wasn't really interested in

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.580

being<00:00:37.340> in<00:00:37.520> video<00:00:37.790> games<00:00:38.059> but<00:00:38.390> video<00:00:39.290> games

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
being in video games but video games

being in video games but video games
today<00:00:39.829> have<00:00:40.070> broadened<00:00:40.370> out<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:40.940> they're

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
today have broadened out and they're

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.790 
today have broadened out and they're
actually<00:00:41.150> part<00:00:41.540> of<00:00:41.629> mass<00:00:41.840> media<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:42.650> I<00:00:42.680> think

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
actually part of mass media so I think
