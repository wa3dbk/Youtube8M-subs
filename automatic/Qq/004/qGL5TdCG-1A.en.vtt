00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.679 

I

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:02.689 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.259 

okay<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.810> first<00:00:03.959> stage<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:05.700> chop<00:00:05.939> up<00:00:06.120> the

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:06.269 
okay the first stage is to chop up the

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.290 
okay the first stage is to chop up the
fat<00:00:06.649> with<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.800> flower<00:00:08.010> as<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.000> can<00:00:09.120> see<00:00:09.210> I've

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
fat with the flower as you can see I've

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.600 
fat with the flower as you can see I've
got<00:00:09.330> large<00:00:09.719> chunks<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.230> cold<00:00:10.530> fat<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
got large chunks of cold fat and the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.339 
got large chunks of cold fat and the
flatter<00:00:11.849> mixing<00:00:12.330> I'm<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.660> using<00:00:12.839> two<00:00:13.110> knives

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
flatter mixing I'm just using two knives

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.700 
flatter mixing I'm just using two knives
and<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.490> reason<00:00:14.789> I<00:00:14.910> aim<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.059> use<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> knife<00:00:15.809> like

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
and the reason I aim to use a knife like

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.930 
and the reason I aim to use a knife like
this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.400> because<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.880> want<00:00:18.540> to<00:00:19.550> avoid<00:00:20.550> eating

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
this is because you want to avoid eating

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.220 
this is because you want to avoid eating
up<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.270> butter<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.810> melting<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:23.300> because<00:00:24.300> if

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
up the butter and melting it because if

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.740 
up the butter and melting it because if
you<00:00:25.470> melt<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.950> butter<00:00:25.980> if<00:00:26.700> this<00:00:27.210> gives<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
you melt the butter if this gives the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.700 
you melt the butter if this gives the
pastry<00:00:28.200> sort<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.590> fatties<00:00:30.320> texture<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.530> taste

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
pastry sort of fatties texture and taste

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.750 
pastry sort of fatties texture and taste
and<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> coiled<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.579> that's<00:00:35.579> why

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and if it is coiled it so that's why

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.729 
and if it is coiled it so that's why
this<00:00:35.820> cold<00:00:36.179> weather<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.199> good<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.620> making

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
this cold weather is is good for making

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.380 
this cold weather is is good for making
pastry<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.890> object<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.579> handle<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
pastry so the object is to handle the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.599 
pastry so the object is to handle the
pastry<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.469> little<00:00:43.859> as<00:00:43.920> possible<00:00:44.159> the<00:00:44.429> other

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
pastry as little as possible the other

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.450 
pastry as little as possible the other
reason<00:00:45.089> is<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.929> handle<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.159> flour

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
reason is that if you handle the flour

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.790 
reason is that if you handle the flour
and<00:00:47.789> work<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.449> flower<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.170> work<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and work the flower then you work the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.450 
and work the flower then you work the
gluten<00:00:50.339> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> flour<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.289> make<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.920> tougher

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
gluten in the flour and make it tougher

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.180 
gluten in the flour and make it tougher
you<00:00:53.640> made<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.819> pastry<00:00:54.390> target<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.800> idea<00:00:56.159> is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you made a pastry target and the idea is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.579 
you made a pastry target and the idea is
to<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.550> pastry<00:00:56.999> as<00:00:57.120> short<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.870> possible<00:00:57.899> as

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
to have a pastry as short as possible as

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.369 
to have a pastry as short as possible as
sort<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.949> melt<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.429> the<00:00:59.460> mouth<00:01:00.109> texture<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
sort of melt in the mouth texture and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.790 
sort of melt in the mouth texture and
very<00:01:01.649> crumbly<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.339> light<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.569> for<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.470> you

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
very crumbly and light and for that you

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.920 
very crumbly and light and for that you
want<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.220> work<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.909> flower<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.509> little<00:01:06.869> as

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
want to work the flower as little as

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.530 
want to work the flower as little as
possible<00:01:07.759> and<00:01:08.759> now<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.090> ready<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.360> start

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
possible and now we're ready to start

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.740 
possible and now we're ready to start
rubbing<00:01:10.079> in<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.469> that<00:01:11.299> is<00:01:12.299> where<00:01:12.509> you<00:01:12.570> just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
rubbing in and that is where you just

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.950 
rubbing in and that is where you just
rub<00:01:12.990> your<00:01:13.200> fingers<00:01:13.649> and<00:01:13.829> thumbs<00:01:14.340> together<00:01:14.960> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
rub your fingers and thumbs together and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.429 
rub your fingers and thumbs together and
let<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.360> fragments<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.600> fall<00:01:18.899> through<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
let the fragments just fall through the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.429 
let the fragments just fall through the
air<00:01:19.469> like<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.630> until<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:21.750> gradually<00:01:22.200> get

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
air like this until they gradually get

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
air like this until they gradually get
smaller<00:01:22.469> and<00:01:22.950> smaller<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:25.610> you're<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.789> very

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
smaller and smaller and you're just very

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.490 
smaller and smaller and you're just very
like<00:01:27.149> Liam<00:01:27.689> bristly<00:01:28.409> rubbing<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.789> that

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
like Liam bristly rubbing in like that

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.740 
like Liam bristly rubbing in like that
rubbing<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.799> back<00:01:32.270> into<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.359> flour<00:01:33.539> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
rubbing the back into the flour and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.830 
rubbing the back into the flour and
we've<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:34.109> two<00:01:34.320> kinds<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.770> facts<00:01:35.009> butter<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
we've got two kinds of facts butter and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.219 
we've got two kinds of facts butter and
lard<00:01:37.579> lard<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:39.000> shortness<00:01:39.710> butter<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:41.189> taste

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
lard lard for shortness butter for taste

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.899 
lard lard for shortness butter for taste
if<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.439> make<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.859> with<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.640> laws

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
if you just make it with a with all laws

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.060 
if you just make it with a with all laws
it's<00:01:45.359> very<00:01:45.509> short<00:01:45.929> but<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.469> taste<00:01:46.679> won't<00:01:46.950> be

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
it's very short but the taste won't be

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980 
it's very short but the taste won't be
as<00:01:47.159> good<00:01:47.189> father<00:01:47.670> gives<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.179> very<00:01:48.450> rich<00:01:48.630> taste

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990

make it long putter as well of course if

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.840 
make it long putter as well of course if
you<00:01:54.450> want<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.869> proportions<00:01:55.439> I've<00:01:55.619> used<00:01:55.979> but

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you want the proportions I've used but

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.050 
you want the proportions I've used but
this<00:01:57.030> pastry<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.810> mince-pies<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.670> six<00:01:59.670> ounces

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
this pastry for mince-pies is six ounces

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.319 
this pastry for mince-pies is six ounces
of<00:02:00.240> flour<00:02:00.450> two<00:02:01.070> three<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.310> us<00:02:02.490> at<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:02.999> lard

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
of flour two three of us at one of lard

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.429 
of flour two three of us at one of lard
so<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> ratio<00:02:04.200> six<00:02:04.649> flower<00:02:05.179> 24<00:02:06.179> fats<00:02:06.570> which<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
so a ratio six flower 24 fats which is a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.609 
so a ratio six flower 24 fats which is a
high<00:02:07.799> fat<00:02:08.220> ratio<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:08.729> mean<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.149> really<00:02:09.619> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
high fat ratio I mean you can really the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.840 
high fat ratio I mean you can really the
higher<00:02:10.860> about

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
higher about

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.990 
higher about
a really<00:02:12.330> cool<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:13.140> taste<00:02:13.820> but<00:02:14.820> it's<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000

the thing is you want to use as little

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.570 
the thing is you want to use as little
water<00:03:47.250> as<00:03:47.610> possible<00:03:48.590> it's<00:03:49.590> best<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.130> use<00:03:50.190> just

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
possible because that can have negative

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.560 
possible because that can have negative
