00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.940 
more killing for mods this one's going
to<00:00:02.970> be<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> UMP<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:03.840> of<00:00:04.200> course<00:00:04.410> showing<00:00:04.620> it<00:00:04.799> to

to be a UMP and of course showing it to

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.700 
to be a UMP and of course showing it to
you<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.279> lockout<00:00:05.910> map<00:00:06.290> now<00:00:07.290> surprisingly

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
you on the lockout map now surprisingly

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.020 
you on the lockout map now surprisingly
enough<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.160> thought<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.610> going<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.880> be<00:00:09.000> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
enough I thought this is going to be a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.180 
enough I thought this is going to be a
field<00:00:09.660> medic<00:00:09.809> gun<00:00:10.080> since<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.559> know<00:00:10.650> smg's

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
field medic gun since you know smg's

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.009 
field medic gun since you know smg's
tend<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.610> be<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> medic<00:00:12.240> type<00:00:12.450> thing<00:00:12.780> with<00:00:12.929> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
tend to be a medic type thing with the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.470 
tend to be a medic type thing with the
exception<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> m7<00:00:14.040> a3<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.360> is

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
exception of the m7 a3 but this is

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.529 
exception of the m7 a3 but this is
actually<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.990> fire<00:00:16.619> bug<00:00:16.949> gun<00:00:17.190> which<00:00:18.119> also<00:00:18.300> makes

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
actually a fire bug gun which also makes

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.179 
actually a fire bug gun which also makes
sense<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.869> mean<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.109> does<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> Mac<00:00:19.590> 11<00:00:19.980> so

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
sense I mean it does have the Mac 11 so

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.710 
sense I mean it does have the Mac 11 so
it<00:00:20.310> wouldn't<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> first<00:00:20.789> time<00:00:20.970> an<00:00:21.150> SMG<00:00:21.449> was

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
it wouldn't be the first time an SMG was

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.509 
it wouldn't be the first time an SMG was
consider<00:00:22.410> arounds<00:00:22.859> would<00:00:23.070> go<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> fire

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
consider arounds would go to the fire

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.980 
consider arounds would go to the fire
bugs<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.670> textures<00:00:27.090> uh<00:00:27.119> they

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
bugs and here it is the textures uh they

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.240 
bugs and here it is the textures uh they
seem<00:00:28.199> okay<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:29.519> gun<00:00:29.640> overall<00:00:29.910> looks<00:00:30.330> okay

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
seem okay the gun overall looks okay

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
seem okay the gun overall looks okay
front<00:00:32.250> sight<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.790> little<00:00:33.690> bit<00:00:33.780> odd<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> it's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
front sight a little bit odd and it's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.100 
front sight a little bit odd and it's
red<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.730> way<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.090> aim<00:00:36.390> over<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.780> isn't

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
red and that way you aim over all isn't

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.650 
red and that way you aim over all isn't
entirely<00:00:37.469> lined<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.420> couldn't<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.510> pic

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
entirely lined up I couldn't get pic

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:49.369 
entirely lined up I couldn't get pic
about<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.440> okay<00:00:48.379> okay

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
about it but you know it's okay okay

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.959 
about it but you know it's okay okay
it's<00:00:49.649> pretty<00:00:49.770> obvious<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> mod<00:00:50.700> but

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it's pretty obvious that it's a mod but

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:46.839 
it's pretty obvious that it's a mod but
you<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.449> I've<00:00:51.570> seen<00:00:51.750> worse<00:00:51.960> things

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.789 

have<00:02:50.340> noticed<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.880> sights<00:02:51.120> are<00:02:51.709> like<00:02:52.709> I

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
have noticed that the sights are like I

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:53.780 
have noticed that the sights are like I
mentioned<00:02:53.099> before<00:02:53.130> they're<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.489> little<00:02:53.610> bit

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
mentioned before they're a little bit

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:11.259 
mentioned before they're a little bit
odd<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.150> they're<00:02:54.269> also<00:02:54.390> not<00:02:54.629> correct<00:02:54.840> an<00:02:55.230> UMP

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.900
