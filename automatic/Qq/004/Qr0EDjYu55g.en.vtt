00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hi guys, I'm dark and like the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.400
 video title today I teach them to play 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.370
 the mario 64 multiplayer 1.3 already patched 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.990
 well the first thing they have to do is 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.990
 download the game in mega 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.830
 inside the winrar you will find the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.830
 proper project to make it run 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
 there will be a notebook if they want it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.790
 open there will appear the changes of the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.790
 game 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.460
 if this error should appear 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.739
 you just have to go to options and 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.120
 settings and change the input box 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.120
 control plugins to this 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.060
 there are two ways to play this game 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.040
 first we will see without a server should 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.110
 go to options and configure controls 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.500
 show off to the first player make it up 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.500
 to your taste 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.659
 now comes the second player remember 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.520
 that for the second player to move 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.520
 you have to have this box checked 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.350
 now comes the way to play in 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.420
 cooperative if they want to play in 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.179
 cooperative with your friend have to 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.740
 have a server kyler if they do not know how 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:51.030
 do so click on the video on the screen 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.159
 well let's continue 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.840
 the other way is going to be net fly 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.840
 copy the english address machine 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.270
 once being in his truthful being in the 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.270
 game room 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.250
 as you will see everyone has his bar 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.250
 lifetime 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.450
 they can also help each other 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.990
 now the second player may 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.990
 interact with the npcs 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.770
 last interesting by chance 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.340

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.340
 shell 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.579
