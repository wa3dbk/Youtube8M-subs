00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
but they get do get progressively more

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.340 
but they get do get progressively more
difficult<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.690> there<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.989> eight

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
difficult as you go on there are eight

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.650 
difficult as you go on there are eight
battles<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.950> total<00:00:41.309> ending<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> den<00:00:42.390> of

battles in total ending with the den of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.799 
battles in total ending with the den of
ice<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.579> main<00:00:44.760> purpose<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.450> video

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
ice so the main purpose of this video

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.500 
ice so the main purpose of this video
though<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.860> alert<00:00:47.129> newer<00:00:47.489> players<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.390> the

though is to alert newer players to the
fact<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:50.100> quest<00:00:50.579> chain<00:00:50.730> actually<00:00:51.719> does

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
fact that this quest chain actually does

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.250 
fact that this quest chain actually does
serve<00:00:52.710> some<00:00:53.190> purpose<00:00:53.570> even<00:00:54.570> though<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.960> seems

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
serve some purpose even though it seems

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.110 
serve some purpose even though it seems
like<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> rewards<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.460> much<00:00:56.489> much<00:00:57.059> smaller

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
like the rewards are much much smaller

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.990 
like the rewards are much much smaller
than<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.379> rewards<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> would<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.640> for

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
than the rewards that you would get for

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
than the rewards that you would get for
raiding<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.660> player's<00:01:01.079> base<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:01.800> attacking

raiding a player's base or attacking
another<00:01:02.489> player<00:01:03.890> for<00:01:04.890> Ville<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.339> also<00:01:05.580> be

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
another player for Ville can also be

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.050 
another player for Ville can also be
used<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> dragon<00:01:06.960> roost<00:01:07.260> which<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.490> why

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
used with the dragon roost which is why

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
used with the dragon roost which is why
many<00:01:09.119> players<00:01:09.659> realize<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.619> quest

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
many players realize that this quest

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.640 
many players realize that this quest
chain<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> lot<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:12.810> important

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
chain is actually a lot more important

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.330 
chain is actually a lot more important
than<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.220> seems<00:01:15.229> again<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.619> rewards

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
than it really seems again the rewards

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.850 
than it really seems again the rewards
almost<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.360> seem<00:01:18.689> worth<00:01:18.960> using<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.530> battle

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
almost don't seem worth using a battle

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.969 
almost don't seem worth using a battle
stone<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.700> each<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.740> Ville<00:01:22.950> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
stone on each one but for Ville is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.060 
stone on each one but for Ville is
really<00:01:23.580> useful<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.560> particularly<00:01:25.560> if

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
really useful to have particularly if

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280 
really useful to have particularly if
you<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> dragon<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:27.869> roost

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
you do not have a dragon in your roost

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.219 
you do not have a dragon in your roost
yet<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.340> will<00:01:29.610> probably<00:01:30.299> need<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:31.020> this

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
yet you will probably need to do this

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.789 
yet you will probably need to do this
quest<00:01:31.619> chain<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.189> order<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.710> having<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
quest chain in order to get one having a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.700 
quest chain in order to get one having a
dragon<00:01:35.310> adds<00:01:35.579> an<00:01:35.820> extra<00:01:36.049> offensive<00:01:37.049> unit<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
dragon adds an extra offensive unit to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.039 
dragon adds an extra offensive unit to
your<00:01:37.829> arsenal<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:39.060> also<00:01:39.240> has<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> special

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
your arsenal and it also has a special

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.380 
your arsenal and it also has a special
attack<00:01:40.170> however<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.520> would<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:41.909> recommend

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
attack however I would not recommend

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.100 
attack however I would not recommend
using<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.200> special<00:01:43.590> attack<00:01:44.210> because<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.990> my

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
using the special attack because for my

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.859 
using the special attack because for my
personal<00:01:46.619> experience<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.790> tends<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.329> expose

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
personal experience it tends to expose

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
personal experience it tends to expose
your<00:01:49.079> dragon<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.220> suddenly<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
your dragon and make it suddenly the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.840 
your dragon and make it suddenly the
primary<00:01:51.540> target<00:01:52.079> whereas<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> dragon<00:01:53.670> is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
primary target whereas if the dragon is

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.330 
primary target whereas if the dragon is
sitting<00:01:54.240> behind<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.810> main<00:01:55.259> forces<00:01:55.680> shooting

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
sitting behind your main forces shooting

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.600 
sitting behind your main forces shooting
at<00:01:57.090> whatever<00:01:57.600> target<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
at whatever target you have then it

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.280 
at whatever target you have then it
won't<00:01:59.790> go<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.299> won't<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.630> killed<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.020> quickly

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
won't go it won't be killed as quickly

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.429 
won't go it won't be killed as quickly
so<00:02:02.030> let's<00:02:03.030> quickly<00:02:03.270> talk<00:02:03.600> about<00:02:03.930> four<00:02:04.229> veil
