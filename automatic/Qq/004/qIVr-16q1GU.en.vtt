00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 let's see I have experience with the subject and 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.629
 blogs this records or does not record 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.939
 hello all giucich so welcome from 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.270
 new a new video today we are in a 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.890
 little review of the glasses I do not look for that 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.419
 I arrived a few days ago and in fact 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.150
 It was a blog that I had yet to do 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:29.059
 already and said goes of today does not happen today I do the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.029
 blog so here we are in the little 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:34.610
 review of this piece of gafotas that 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.680
 basically they serve to protect from the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.360
 light be the blue light of the screens that 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.800
 it comes to our eyes because this is like 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.980
 a kind of filter if you look 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.289
 let's say painted as orange and 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.289
 now look how the screen looks there 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.620
 are blind in these profiles os 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.089
 it would be like this because it 's these layers what 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.679
 they basically do that is to protect you from 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.170
 the one of the blue light let's say of the 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.729
 English screens studying a lot 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.739
 said in a couple of directors class and 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.139
 Hence the focus perfect've taken a 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.550
 couple of direct we have two models that 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:10.180
 I have clear in the store and more direct 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.510
 they are also cool 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.180
 it has been said more 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.920
 look for me more because people miss phase 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.490
 It's something that I quite like the subject 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.890
 good to protect my eyes and look 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.960
 search was searching and I found some 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.610
 but they were much more expensive 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.620
 these are glasses because this one or that 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.190
 they are for 30 thirty euros with gas 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.440
 toxic with either sends 70 something 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.730
 35 something like that and the truth that they are super 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.060
 cool is as I said there were two 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.250
 models really be here is also 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.200
 If you wear glasses or if you wear glasses 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.479
 see let's say the computer screen 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.630
 You can get on top of that because if you 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.790
 you can see how they are prepared we are going 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.430
 so that you here can place the 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.780
 other glasses everything is going perfect and these 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.910
 other glasses, if you do not have a need 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.010
 to put yours after here you have 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.830
 a few more tenths more 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.680
 fashion's the truth that and both glasses 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.649
 they are super well said I have tried them 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.030
 for about two weeks before doing 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.580
 the kinship review was for 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.310
 approve them helpers to tell you anything and 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.410
 because that basically nothing that 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.670
 surely the direct ones take them 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.550
 big piece basically because it 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.490
 adapts better to my head shape 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:32.020
 to the little ones but also so 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.690
 you only see with these pieces of 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.190
 glasses and nothing to say that simply if 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.050
 you want to catch them the truth is that 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.660
 they are so cool or simply they are 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.820
 I say it is so cool they are not 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.520
 extremely expensive to be a pair of glasses 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.960
 of computer and they are pretty wade without 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.430
 that the description in a small link 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.380
 who wants to go from there to look 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.420
 out of curiosity you know even if he hears what 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.310
 it is it then you can can the page 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.400
 there you will also find information 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.670
 more technical as really that since you 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.900
 protect these these crystals here and 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.550
 nothing else 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.470
 I think that if you really liked it, 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.080
 you will have seen I do not know how to do so 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.820
 see me 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.320
 well, this has been all I hope that 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.690
 be liked the little video and got 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.310
 put the front camera so that I 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.140
 you could see during and so on while 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.690
 dismissal and nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.130
