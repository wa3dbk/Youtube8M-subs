00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
your SHSH blobs on 4.1 absolutely is

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.080 
your SHSH blobs on 4.1 absolutely is
imperative<00:03:32.200> because<00:03:32.440> these<00:03:32.890> jailbreaks<00:03:33.459> this

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
imperative because these jailbreaks this

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.490 
imperative because these jailbreaks this
is<00:03:34.209> going<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.420> be<00:03:34.540> looking<00:03:34.780> like<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.290> best

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
is going to be looking like the best

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.229 
is going to be looking like the best
firmware<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.220> jailbreak<00:03:36.640> in<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.910> very<00:03:37.090> long

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
firmware to jailbreak in a very long

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.000 
firmware to jailbreak in a very long
time<00:03:37.299> because<00:03:37.720> pretty<00:03:38.110> much<00:03:38.200> every<00:03:38.739> device

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
time because pretty much every device

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.400 
time because pretty much every device
everything<00:03:39.640> will<00:03:39.850> be<00:03:39.880> supported<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:40.959> highly

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
tutorial you don't even need to be

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.410 
tutorial you don't even need to be
jailbroken<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.400> go<00:03:51.519> ahead<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:51.730> back<00:03:52.030> up<00:03:52.090> your

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
jailbroken so go ahead and back up your

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.949 
jailbroken so go ahead and back up your
SHSH<00:03:53.079> blobs<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.890> now<00:03:54.150> just<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.239> just<00:03:55.660> use<00:03:55.780> use

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
SHSH blobs and now just you just use use

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.590 
SHSH blobs and now just you just use use
uses<00:03:56.620> tiny<00:03:56.829> umbrella<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:58.030> all<00:03:58.180> it<00:03:58.329> does<00:03:58.450> is

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
uses tiny umbrella so all it does is

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.599
