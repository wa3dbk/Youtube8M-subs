import one thing from one blood to file
to<00:00:13.710> another<00:00:13.860> print<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> file<00:00:14.460> now<00:00:14.790> some<00:00:15.509> of

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
to another print the file now some of

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.029 
to another print the file now some of
you<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.780> may<00:00:15.990> be<00:00:16.049> obvious<00:00:16.260> you've<00:00:16.619> ended<00:00:16.920> it

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
you this may be obvious you've ended it

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:17.750 
you this may be obvious you've ended it
for<00:00:17.070> ages

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
for ages

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.310 
for ages
but<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.330> know<00:00:18.680> that<00:00:19.699> because<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:21.000> word<00:00:21.180> oh<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.930> did

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
but I know that because a word oh I did

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.370 
but I know that because a word oh I did
that<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.650> do<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.850> severely<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:25.260> know

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that to do and it severely you know

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380 
that to do and it severely you know
stopped<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:25.859> being<00:00:26.070> able<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.670> loads

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
stopped you from being able to do loads

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.490 
stopped you from being able to do loads
of<00:00:27.570> things<00:00:27.630> really

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
of things really

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.450 
of things really
and<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.260> took<00:00:31.439> me<00:00:31.590> ages<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.099> figure<00:00:32.369> out

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and so and it took me ages to figure out

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.670 
and so and it took me ages to figure out
how<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:33.840> suddenly<00:00:34.170> popped<00:00:34.500> up

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
how to do it it just suddenly popped up

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.940 
how to do it it just suddenly popped up
in<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:34.980> tutorial<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.390> had<00:00:36.960> no<00:00:37.410> idea<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
in one tutorial and I had no idea how to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.970 
in one tutorial and I had no idea how to
do<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.190> before<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.829> thought

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
do it before that and so I just thought

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.119 
do it before that and so I just thought
I'd<00:00:44.129> make<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> quick<00:00:44.399> tip<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.890> case

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
I'd make a quick tip on it this in case

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.229 
I'd make a quick tip on it this in case
anyone<00:00:47.910> wants<00:00:48.059> or<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> know<00:00:48.809> anyway<00:00:49.620> so

now<00:01:47.689> without<00:01:48.689> importing<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.560> would<00:01:49.740> have

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
now without importing we would have

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.760 
now without importing we would have
anyway<00:01:50.430> cadets<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.540> blender<00:01:51.780> file<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
anyway cadets in that blender file to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.490 
anyway cadets in that blender file to
this<00:01:52.979> blender<00:01:53.369> file<00:01:53.579> there's<00:01:54.000> no<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.270> of

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
this blender file there's no way of

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.569 
this blender file there's no way of
copying<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.799> pasting<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.219> now<00:01:59.340> I'm

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579

gonna show you how to do is how to get

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.469 
gonna show you how to do is how to get
it<00:02:02.909> from<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.170> julia<00:02:04.340> by<00:02:05.340> using<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:08.479> function

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it from one julia by using this function

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.360 
it from one julia by using this function
here<00:02:09.750> under<00:02:10.110> file<00:02:10.440> which<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.370> called<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:12.000> attend

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
here under file which is called a attend

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.150 
here under file which is called a attend
and<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.550> shipped<00:02:14.790> f1<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.349> click<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.129> I

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and it's shipped f1 so if you click so I

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.720 
and it's shipped f1 so if you click so I
can<00:02:17.310> click<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.989> then<00:02:18.989> go<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.319> where<00:02:20.099> your

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:31.190 

thing<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:28.520> let<00:02:29.520> me<00:02:29.640> see<00:02:29.819> we<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.330> our<00:02:30.569> cube<00:02:30.989> in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
thing is let me see we have our cube in

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.479 
thing is let me see we have our cube in
our<00:02:31.620> scene<00:02:33.709> let's<00:02:34.709> say<00:02:34.800> we<00:02:34.920> don't<00:02:35.010> want<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.250> cube

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
our scene let's say we don't want a cube

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.070 
our scene let's say we don't want a cube
we<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.849> wanted<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:37.489> something<00:02:38.489> else<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.080> shift

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
we just wanted a something else so shift

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.140 
we just wanted a something else so shift
f1<00:02:40.379> go<00:02:40.980> out<00:02:41.510> I'm<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:42.569> gonna<00:02:42.750> find<00:02:44.150> something

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
f1 go out I'm just gonna find something

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:54.110 
f1 go out I'm just gonna find something
random<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.080> put<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.379> let's<00:02:47.340> say<00:02:49.430> let's<00:02:52.730> say<00:02:53.730> a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
random to put in let's say let's say a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.990 
random to put in let's say let's say a
2.5<00:02:55.050> dark<00:02:55.560> now<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.010> not<00:02:56.160> sure<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.760> very

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
2.5 dark now I'm not sure this is a very
