I'm ready to hit it hard next time and
so<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.119> decisions<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
so that's just the kind of decisions you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
so that's just the kind of decisions you
have<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> make<00:01:34.409> occasionally<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:36.000> wasn't

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have to make occasionally I wasn't

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.050 
have to make occasionally I wasn't
disappointed<00:01:37.159> just<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
disappointed just because I know that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.810 
disappointed just because I know that
it'll<00:01:39.930> come<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:41.430> pretty<00:01:41.640> good

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it'll come and I have some pretty good

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.359 
it'll come and I have some pretty good
ideas<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.240> why<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.720> feeling<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.140> way<00:01:43.369> but

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
ideas of why I was feeling that way but

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.190 
ideas of why I was feeling that way but
other<00:01:44.880> things<00:01:45.119> are<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:45.659> well<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
other things are going really well and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.740 
other things are going really well and
that<00:01:46.619> also<00:01:47.009> includes<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> opportunity<00:01:48.600> that

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that also includes the opportunity that

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.950 
that also includes the opportunity that
