00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 you 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.510
 hello how are my name is anabella and 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.190
 I'm here to get all those fears 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.570
 that they have to the kitchen they will see that 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.340
 after watching the videos everything is going to 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.869
 seem a little easier and they are going to 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.700
 learn a lot of recipes and 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.890
 new combinations like the kitchen that 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.930
 I'm gonna need is plenty of 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.620
 help and for that I have my friend read me 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.990
 Hi, read me 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.580
 and me is a little shy so I do not 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.560
 it shows on camera but it's always 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.450
 here at the bottom of the letter today I propose 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.560
 make a sautéed peanut rice with 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.560
 sea prawns 2 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.730
 the base of this dish is rice 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.979
 yellow similar to the normal grain except 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.839
 which is a little more redondito and a little 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.420
 more toasted to prepare our rice 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.789
 we need first to nacre what we put a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.219
 little oil in a pan and then 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.949
 we throw dry like that as it comes we put 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.769
 then the rice has to be mixed well 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.109
 that all the grains are filled with oil 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.030
 olive school because for me it gives a 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.979
 much richer flavor we leave a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.439
 minute to nacre 'no and then we're going to 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.679
 put the broth remember that the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.990
 proportion is one part of rice for two 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:14.850
 of broth and cooking will be ready 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.530
 when the water evaporates I leave 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.090
 cooking my mel rice and I'm going to 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.369
 take care of it and take it out when the liquid 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.530
 has already evaporated I now I'm going to 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.530
 marinate emery prawns 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.410
 good here we have the prawns that 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.890
 you can get it that way 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.720
 and cooked or they also come with the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.160
 skin that can be removed is very easy to 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.010
 clean up what are we going to do with these 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.170
 beautiful prawns that we have here what 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.920
 let's marinate in this let's put back 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.080
 then garlic parsley chopped well 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.670
 minced a little salt 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.610
 pepper there goes 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.550
 and olive oil 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.280
 and lemon you have to get that one 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.230
 that is well well juicy well so 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.560
 You get the most amount of 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.080
 juice and a few drops of lemon and that's it 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.400

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.750
 vegetables and then sauteed 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.550
 while our prawns marinate 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.410
 we finite this part because it is 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.420
 So cute that afterwards it does not go wrong and 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.790
 we repeat better not then is the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.630

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.110
 we have our cooked rice the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.730
 prawns that are marinating and already 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.980
 we cut all the vegetables so 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.020
 let's start sautéing to start 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.480
 you need a pan that you're going to 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.489
 put olive and garlic and now if I need 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.650
 vegetables 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.910
 half thanks someday you're going to Paris 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.320
 latina otters 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.840
 let's put these ingredients first 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.209
 they are green onion carrot 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.890
 onion and red bell pepper it is important that 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.459
 the carrot go first because it's the 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.459
 harder and let's leave for 5 minutes 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.500
 to be cooked and once 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.590
 5 minutes they passed we will incorporate 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.390
 the other vegetables that we cut many 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.120
 thank you read me 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.950
 we put them like this the bean sprouts the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.340
 peas and mushrooms which is what 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.110
 faster it is cooked and the villagers 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.239
 once we have the vegetables 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.220
 skipping, let's put a little bit of 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.930
 salt and a little pepper and let's 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.030
 incorporate the ingredients that we 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.129
 they were reserved first let's go to 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.379
 put the rice look how nice that I 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.470
 we are going to incorporate it in the 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.949
 sautéed there goes and also we do not 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.959
 we forget our prawns do not you 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.110
 lose of trying them we put them in the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.479
 sautéed with the marinade also and now 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.520
 if we stir, I chose the prawns 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.470
 because I love them like that in a 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.310
 sautéed or I like also pancakes and 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.540
 fried 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.160
 but good you can choose what 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.200
 you want so when you chicken you can 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.330
 put meat as a final touch you're going to 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.310
 put a little bit of soy sauce that 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.540
 will give a spectacular taste to them 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.389

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.380
