please um so chances are the server will
be<00:06:33.720> getting<00:06:34.080> a<00:06:34.230> new<00:06:35.090> map<00:06:36.090> and<00:06:37.050> then<00:06:37.200> move<00:06:38.160> on

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
be getting a new map and then move on

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.510 
be getting a new map and then move on
from<00:06:38.460> there<00:06:39.590> but<00:06:40.590> i'm<00:06:40.980> mainly<00:06:41.340> looking

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
from there but i'm mainly looking

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.990 
from there but i'm mainly looking
forward<00:06:42.180> to<00:06:42.450> the<00:06:43.580> water<00:06:44.580> it<00:06:44.700> looks<00:06:44.850> different

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
forward to the water it looks different

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.660 
forward to the water it looks different
seemingly<00:06:45.810> i'm<00:06:46.140> mainly<00:06:46.530> looking<00:06:46.680> forward<00:06:47.370> to

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
seemingly i'm mainly looking forward to

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.230 
seemingly i'm mainly looking forward to
the<00:06:49.040> new<00:06:50.040> recording<00:06:50.520> session<00:06:50.880> or<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.150> new

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
the new recording session or the new

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.450 
the new recording session or the new
recordings<00:06:51.690> that<00:06:51.780> we<00:06:51.930> will<00:06:52.050> be<00:06:52.170> having<00:06:52.350> on<00:06:52.680> 1.8

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
recordings that we will be having on 1.8

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.110 
recordings that we will be having on 1.8
are<00:06:53.970> no<00:06:54.360> classic<00:06:54.750> water<00:06:54.960> physics<00:06:55.350> too<00:06:55.860> bad<00:06:56.120> so

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
are no classic water physics too bad so

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.230 
are no classic water physics too bad so
i<00:06:57.510> guess<00:06:57.870> until<00:06:58.470> then<00:06:58.740> i<00:06:59.100> will<00:06:59.460> see<00:07:00.090> you<00:07:00.180> guys
