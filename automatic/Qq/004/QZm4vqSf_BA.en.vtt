00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:08.010
 I watched and listened very carefully and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.360
 discover the enigma hopefully discover it there 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.090
 they have it today we turn 35 years of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.430
 married is not wonderful 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:22.020
 how are we going to celebrate it like 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.770
 I do not always know what you think I think 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.609
 that we should celebrate it differently than 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.609
 the other times you know that in another way 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.820
 no, but you're not far, look, we could 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.700
 take advantage that you are on vacation 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.210
 so we can make a separate trip 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.820
 each one by his side seems perfect to me 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.200
 I also take advantage and go to republic 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.680
 Dominican 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.690
 and I want to know, I'm going with 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.379
 what we have saved this year we can 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.379
 travel quietly 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.250
 [Music] 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.060
 Y 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.240
 I enjoyed sir from miami thank you 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:28.409
 [Music] 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:31.610
 and as we are well I met a brunette 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.480
 30 years and I'm having a lot of fun 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.890
 potatoes 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:42.090
 Oh, how happy my love is, I too 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.250
 I'm having a good time and look 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.790
 what a coincidence is also 30 years 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.240
 but I 'm having fun twice as much 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.630
 you 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.149
 twice and how can you know what is 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.939
 double because you say that simple 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:09.250
 mathematical my love because 30 goes into 70 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:12.319
 and 60 does not go into 30 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.319
 [Applause] 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.239
 you understand it I think it's not 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.670
 Mathematically the subject matter of good 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.760
 surely you already understood it 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.950
 let's talk now about the fear of flying has 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.200
 you fear to fly to ride a 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.349
 plane to jump from a parachute 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.830
 today we have something very special a fact 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.190
 from fear of heights that fear of 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.370
 fly 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.170
 in this area we have patients who 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.260
 We are trying to take away the fear of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.260
 fly 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.240
 and that man who does mounted on a 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.680
 bicycle we accustom patients 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.260
 to lose the fear of heights 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.570
 little by little first they lose their fear 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.140
 of a bicycle that was 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.300
 lower height as you suppose 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.300
 allows me to talk to him if I do not like 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.400
 efe 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.400
 Excuse me, you're afraid to fly 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.210
 because he is so interested in dominating 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.610
 that panic 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.830
 good for my work I fly 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.130
 frequently 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.020
 are you traveling agent representative of 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.290
 some international company or 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.220
 journalist like me no no I am a pilot 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.610

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.300
 [Applause] 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.300

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.690

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.069
 gonzález 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.280
 how is it possible for an athlete like you 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.579
 be afraid to fly no no longer 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.190
 removed like this this morning by the way I'm 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.570
 playing an airplane from maracaibo up 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.150
 here and look there was a torrential downpour 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.740
 but terrible of that not but just ready 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.310
 look at the plane moved like a washing machine 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.800
 and I calm there in my seat 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.410
 then why are you here good 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.690
 because they are trying to get rid of me 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.690
 the fingers of the arm of the seat 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.589
 [Applause] 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.870
