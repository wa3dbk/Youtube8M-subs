if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.870> take<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.200> your<00:01:19.290> test<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:20.430> pass

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
if you just take in your test just pass

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
if you just take in your test just pass
your<00:01:20.760> test<00:01:21.000> something<00:01:21.870> like<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.470> be

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
your test something like this will be

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.440 
your test something like this will be
ideal<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:22.980> you<00:01:23.370> have<00:01:23.760> you<00:01:23.909> done<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:24.240> dash

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
ideal for you have you done the dash

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.560 
ideal for you have you done the dash
then<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.310> write<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.490> straight<00:01:26.790> away<00:01:26.970> have

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
then you can write it straight away have

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.000 
then you can write it straight away have
you've<00:01:27.750> done<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:28.050> test<00:01:28.260> on<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.770> five

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
you've done your test on a one to five

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.820 
you've done your test on a one to five
then<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.909> bike<00:01:30.450> lends<00:01:30.750> itself<00:01:31.080> very<00:01:31.320> well<00:01:31.620> to
