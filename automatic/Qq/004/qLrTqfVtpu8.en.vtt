step<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.020> that's<00:00:43.199> just<00:00:43.470> from

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
step out of here and that's just from

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.970 
step out of here and that's just from
the<00:00:43.860> rubber<00:00:44.370> gaskets<00:00:45.059> taking<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.989> apart<00:00:46.290> all

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.180 

now<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.780> wanted<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.680> let<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.890> run

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
now if you wanted to you can let it run

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.759 
now if you wanted to you can let it run
like<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:57.000> four<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.110> five<00:00:58.289> minutes

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
like this for four or five minutes

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.279 
like this for four or five minutes
because<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.760> leak<00:01:00.030> was<00:01:00.269> a<00:01:00.300> slow<00:01:00.719> leak<00:01:01.019> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
because that leak was a slow leak to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.979 
because that leak was a slow leak to
begin<00:01:01.620> with<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:03.030> first<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.540> didn't<00:01:03.839> show
