lot<00:02:33.490> more<00:02:33.520> that<00:02:34.060> starting<00:02:34.600> um<00:02:35.260> mostly<00:02:35.830> the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
lot more that starting um mostly the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.280 
lot more that starting um mostly the
southeast<00:02:36.520> some<00:02:37.240> of<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.420> Midwest<00:02:37.780> Missouri

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
southeast some of the Midwest Missouri

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.800 
southeast some of the Midwest Missouri
um<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.070> think<00:02:39.970> there's<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.150> lot<00:02:40.180> more<00:02:40.270> interest

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
um I think there's a lot more interest

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.830 
um I think there's a lot more interest
in<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.739> species<00:02:42.220> with<00:02:42.550> both<00:02:42.810> state<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
in the species with both state and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.290 
in the species with both state and
federal<00:02:44.320> agencies<00:02:44.739> Alicia<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.670> were<00:02:45.880> talking

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
federal agencies Alicia you were talking

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.960 
federal agencies Alicia you were talking
I<00:02:46.420> was<00:02:46.900> talking<00:02:47.260> yesterday<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.650> said<00:02:47.980> something

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
I was talking yesterday I said something

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.910 
I was talking yesterday I said something
like<00:02:49.209> primitive<00:02:49.780> doesn't<00:02:50.140> mean<00:02:50.260> stupid<00:02:50.560> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
like primitive doesn't mean stupid and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.530 
like primitive doesn't mean stupid and
then<00:02:51.010> what<00:02:51.160> did<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.400> say<00:02:51.550> they're<00:02:52.180> not<00:02:52.270> print

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
then what did you say they're not print

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.150 
then what did you say they're not print
of<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.690> ancient<00:02:53.080> their<00:02:53.350> ancient<00:02:53.860> they're<00:02:53.980> not

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
of the ancient their ancient they're not

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.979 
of the ancient their ancient they're not
primitive<00:02:54.400> are<00:02:54.940> he<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.360> they're<00:02:55.810> certainly

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
primitive are he and they're certainly

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.180 
primitive are he and they're certainly
not<00:02:56.170> stupid<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:56.770> one<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.070> most

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
not stupid it's one of the most

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.520 
not stupid it's one of the most
intelligent<00:02:57.690> fish<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.140> course<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.440> would

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
intelligent fish and of course it would

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.130 
intelligent fish and of course it would
have<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.920> be<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:01.239> how<00:03:01.420> many<00:03:01.600> million<00:03:01.840> years

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
have to be to how many million years

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.160 
have to be to how many million years
does<00:03:02.320> have<00:03:02.470> been<00:03:02.590> are<00:03:02.680> 150<00:03:03.430> million<00:03:03.610> Wow

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
does have been are 150 million Wow

does have been are 150 million Wow
there's<00:03:05.170> no<00:03:05.380> game<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.800> persistent<00:03:06.430> huh

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
there's no game is persistent huh

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.240 
there's no game is persistent huh

we<00:03:19.000> held<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.330> fish<00:03:19.570> out<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:19.989> water<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:20.680> long

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
we held that fish out of water so long

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.740 
we held that fish out of water so long
and<00:03:21.160> people<00:03:21.489> are<00:03:21.730> not<00:03:21.940> used<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.300> seeing<00:03:22.540> fish

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
and people are not used to seeing fish

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.840 
and people are not used to seeing fish
out<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:22.959> water<00:03:23.080> but<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.410> say<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.920> can<00:03:24.580> keep

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
out of water but you say you can keep

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.190 
out of water but you say you can keep
them<00:03:25.000> out<00:03:25.120> for<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.360> long<00:03:25.510> we've<00:03:25.750> had<00:03:25.959> him<00:03:26.050> out

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
them out for a long we've had him out

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.960 
them out for a long we've had him out
for<00:03:26.380> hours<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:26.950> mean<00:03:27.340> I'd<00:03:27.430> recommend<00:03:27.730> that

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
for hours but I mean I'd recommend that

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.910 
for hours but I mean I'd recommend that
you<00:03:28.090> get<00:03:28.209> him<00:03:28.330> back<00:03:28.480> in<00:03:28.660> as<00:03:28.780> fast<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.140> right<00:03:29.410> but

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
you get him back in as fast as right but

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.640 
you get him back in as fast as right but
they<00:03:30.730> can<00:03:30.880> air<00:03:31.030> breathe<00:03:31.269> um<00:03:31.959> some<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.590> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
they can air breathe um some of the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.050 
they can air breathe um some of the
things<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:32.800> makes<00:03:32.920> him<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:33.220> unique<00:03:33.489> okay<00:03:33.910> how

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
things that makes him so unique okay how

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.360 
things that makes him so unique okay how
old<00:03:34.090> do<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.390> think<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.600> fish<00:03:34.870> was<00:03:35.370> depending

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
old do you think that fish was depending

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.220 
old do you think that fish was depending
on how<00:03:36.640> fast<00:03:36.880> they<00:03:37.150> grow<00:03:37.330> that's<00:03:38.080> an

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
on how fast they grow that's an

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.120 
on how fast they grow that's an
efficient<00:03:38.590> anywhere<00:03:38.950> from<00:03:39.840> maybe<00:03:40.840> 20<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.590> 35

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
efficient anywhere from maybe 20 to 35

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.370 
efficient anywhere from maybe 20 to 35
Wow<00:03:42.640> I'm<00:03:42.880> just<00:03:43.060> depending<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.260> a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
Wow I'm just depending so this is a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.250 
Wow I'm just depending so this is a
long-lived<00:03:44.920> fish<00:03:45.340> they<00:03:45.820> do<00:03:45.880> live<00:03:46.150> what<00:03:46.450> 50<00:03:46.810> 60

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
long-lived fish they do live what 50 60

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.080 
long-lived fish they do live what 50 60
yeah<00:03:47.530> then<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.890> max<00:03:48.100> was<00:03:48.310> probably<00:03:48.519> by<00:03:48.609> 75

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
yeah then the max was probably by 75

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.630 
yeah then the max was probably by 75
years

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
years

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.150 
years
Wow<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:50.780> how<00:03:50.990> do<00:03:51.050> these<00:03:51.319> fish<00:03:51.620> we're<00:03:51.860> on<00:03:52.010> this

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
Wow so how do these fish we're on this

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.400 
Wow so how do these fish we're on this
sandbar<00:03:52.670> here<00:03:52.910> now<00:03:53.090> maybe<00:03:53.330> 150<00:03:53.870> yards<00:03:54.260> long

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
sandbar here now maybe 150 yards long

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.890 
sandbar here now maybe 150 yards long
how<00:03:54.709> do<00:03:54.770> they<00:03:54.980> feed<00:03:55.370> what<00:03:55.790> do<00:03:55.850> they<00:03:55.970> do<00:03:56.030> they'll

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
how do they feed what do they do they'll

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.590 
how do they feed what do they do they'll
go<00:03:57.050> at<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.380> telly<00:03:58.040> sandbars<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:58.910> work<00:03:59.390> their

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
go at the telly sandbars and work their

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.150 
go at the telly sandbars and work their
way<00:03:59.720> up<00:03:59.750> through<00:04:00.110> here<00:04:00.290> looking<00:04:00.650> for<00:04:00.800> fishing

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
way up through here looking for fishing

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.320 
way up through here looking for fishing
over<00:04:01.370> there<00:04:01.520> that<00:04:01.730> are<00:04:01.850> in<00:04:01.940> here<00:04:02.120> in<00:04:02.209> this

grass and in the shallow water and you
see<00:04:05.270> now<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.510> rivers<00:04:05.840> really<00:04:06.140> flooded<00:04:06.380> it's

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
see now the rivers really flooded it's

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.530 
see now the rivers really flooded it's
probably<00:04:06.860> up<00:04:06.980> yep<00:04:07.490> Dean<00:04:07.700> 16<00:04:08.120> feet<00:04:08.300> higher<00:04:08.510> than

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
probably up yep Dean 16 feet higher than

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.130 
probably up yep Dean 16 feet higher than
normal<00:04:08.900> um<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:11.060> any<00:04:11.360> of<00:04:11.450> these<00:04:11.570> sand<00:04:11.930> bars

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
normal um but any of these sand bars

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.990 
normal um but any of these sand bars
were<00:04:12.320> you<00:04:12.410> typically<00:04:12.740> seeing<00:04:13.100> fish<00:04:13.280> role<00:04:13.550> as

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
were you typically seeing fish role as

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.490 
were you typically seeing fish role as
long<00:04:14.510> as<00:04:14.600> you're<00:04:14.690> seeing<00:04:14.870> them<00:04:15.050> rolled<00:04:15.260> you

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
long as you're seeing them rolled you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.810 
long as you're seeing them rolled you
can<00:04:15.650> set<00:04:15.860> their<00:04:16.040> anything<00:04:16.250> but<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.519> biggest

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
can set their anything but the biggest

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.520 
can set their anything but the biggest
mistake<00:04:16.940> you're<00:04:17.359> saying<00:04:17.660> is<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:18.230> know<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.350> lot

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
mistake you're saying is you know a lot

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.740 
mistake you're saying is you know a lot
of<00:04:18.560> people<00:04:18.680> like<00:04:18.980> if<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.250> was<00:04:19.400> catfishing<00:04:20.060> you

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
of people like if I was catfishing you

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.870 
of people like if I was catfishing you
know<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.140> was<00:04:21.500> set<00:04:21.680> up<00:04:21.829> for<00:04:21.859> honor<00:04:22.310> for<00:04:22.700> flat

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
know I was set up for honor for flat

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.270 
know I was set up for honor for flat
heads<00:04:23.120> on<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.360> sandbar<00:04:23.740> but<00:04:24.740> I<00:04:24.770> would<00:04:25.100> also

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
heads on the sandbar but I would also

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.950 
heads on the sandbar but I would also
fish<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.760> hole<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.300> it's<00:04:26.480> not<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.810> whole

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
fish the hole and it's not the whole

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.540 
fish the hole and it's not the whole
that's<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.350> sandbar<00:04:27.800> it's<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:28.010> flat<00:04:28.220> side

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
that's the sandbar it's a flat side

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.730 
that's the sandbar it's a flat side
right<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.360> we've<00:04:29.510> got<00:04:29.690> bait<00:04:29.870> set<00:04:30.110> in<00:04:30.230> 12<00:04:30.530> feet

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
right so we've got bait set in 12 feet

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.800 
right so we've got bait set in 12 feet
of<00:04:30.860> water<00:04:31.040> right<00:04:31.400> yes<00:04:31.700> exactly<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.480> that's

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
of water right yes exactly and that's

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.240 
of water right yes exactly and that's
that's<00:04:33.050> where<00:04:33.320> they<00:04:33.410> typically<00:04:33.830> want<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.070> feed

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
that's where they typically want to feed

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.070 
that's where they typically want to feed
