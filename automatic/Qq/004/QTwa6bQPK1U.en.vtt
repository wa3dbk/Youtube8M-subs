00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.860
 Hello dear viewers and subscribers 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.599
 my channel here I am here for real and 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.220
 it means that we are with you 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.760
 continue our passage on gta 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.040
 Vasiti 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.070
 which we seek out secrets and easter eggs 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.259
 who left lance developers this 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.150
 episode number 9 and it will be great 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.189
 part of sober as we 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.039
 touch on the riddle today and ufo and 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.419
 combine this topic with the film studio 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.539
 as this is quite a mysterious place 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.970
 new so not stupid i think that everything is all 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.060
 get comfortable, but we 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.060
 getting started 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.129
 why i decided to combine the movie studio and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.199
 UFO 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 but it's just because at the film studio 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.120
 there are channel references ok but just 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.570
 Now we are going to the movie studio x we will 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.570
 to understand 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.060
 but here we are now I have arrived 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.850
 stumbled upon an incomprehensible object in the sky 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.200
 which you can't see but it shows how 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.930
 object leaving a trail 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.600
 Maybe this is on the street although who knows 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.770
 here you can build a whole bunch of conjectures and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.009
 come to a common opinion 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.080
 here he even flashes darkness i by the way i 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.210
 found another oddity which 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.229
 sends us episode pro victor lenso 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.899
 brother lance 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.950
 well you have to remember the episode okay 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:45.720
 Moving on, but referring to the fact that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.619
 in the game at least somewhere before must 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.020
 be it on and ufo 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.810
 now you say yes it is absurd how are you 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.729
 you can say no guys i'm sure 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.610
 that in the game she is I will try to you 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.829
 prove let's go to the scene 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 whom we were looking for ghost victor advance 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.170
 in one of the episodes myth and legend gta 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170
 wai city 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.680
 here we are 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.560
 let's look at bell blue sky 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.969
 here you see this here they are unidentified 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.670
 flying objects 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:22.730
 but this is my personal guess since here 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.959
 it's really not clear what flies in the sky 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.469
 strange flight path of these 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.329
 unidentified flying objects by the way 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:34.290
 they can be seen only in this place 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:36.480
 no longer where you see them okay 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.639
 son scrap we kind of small 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.269
 figured out what is coming back 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.269
 film studio 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.330
 so I came across a rather interesting 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.220
 hangar you he says nothing 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.819
 first glance the most ordinary film set 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.340
 playground 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.739
 but it is only at first glance as I already 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.560
 said in gta nothing ever happens 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.959
 just okay I explain everything to you 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.829
 how you should know first 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.629
 a space flight 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.739
 carried out the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.019
 gagarin in 1961 precisely at that time 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.019
 there was a technological race between the USSR 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.599
 and america so here's a soviet man 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.120
 first flew into space and and uttered 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.430
 the legendary went before the start well 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.819
 America in turn after learning that 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.349
 Soviet Russia 1 visited space 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.870
 decided to make a fabricated film about 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.870
 the fact that they say America was the first 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.709
 space, although their development lagged behind 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.680
 USSR so America shouted that they 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.409
 straddled the cosmos even taking the view from the moon 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.730
 but what the hell when experts started 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.000
 study videos 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.329
 they agreed that 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.980
 America fabricated its space flight 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.310
 since the flag cannot evolve on 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.139
 the moon and a number of questions arose where did 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.750
 funnel that was supposed to stay 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:13.470
 after landing the ship on the moon why 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.810
 the sun's rays fall unevenly 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.829
 reflection through astronaut's helmet 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.799
 reflect 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.069
 spotlight so we understand that 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.050
 even rockstar games in gta wai city 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:29.050
 show how silly and ridiculous it looks 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.719
 the deception that America organized and here 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.990
 by and see how would this very studio in 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:40.960
 which was filmed already flying into space 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.400
 Here are the things guys, but here it is 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.069
 time to take stock of today 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.449
 episode before the episode turned out pretty 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.849
 short but quite informative 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.590
 I can finally cut the video again 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.080
 only now I will do it on 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.699
 weekends here for example now preparing 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.439
 Mafia release one 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.360
 continue since some 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:01.939
 subscribers ask me to continue 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.740
 shoot a video of this nature all the more 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.729
 they are pretty positive unlike 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.729
 myths and legends 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.259
 but myths and legends I will not cast 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.870
 why did the video come out very rarely 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:14.479
 I will try to explain the fact that 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.879
 it's summer study is over a yes 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.620
 means you have to go to work 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.419
 I work from Monday to Friday 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.240
 that's why now the videos will be 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.699
 go out the weekend 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.610
 but for example Saturday I will lay out and without 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.830
 the passage of the mafia is one such drove 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.349
 I do not apologize for my so long 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.030
 the lack of channel but here I will 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.509
 coming to you every weekend with 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.729
 hope you are still waiting for me 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.889
 something like this but for now I want to thank 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.380
 Thank you for telling everyone great 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.300
