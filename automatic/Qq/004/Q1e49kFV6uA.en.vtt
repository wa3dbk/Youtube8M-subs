computer so first you need to open up
start<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.980> works<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.519> all

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.089 

XP<00:00:28.439> Vista<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.099> Windows<00:00:29.220> 7<00:00:30.349> just<00:00:31.349> open<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.040> your

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
XP Vista and Windows 7 just open up your

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.780 
XP Vista and Windows 7 just open up your
Start<00:00:32.669> menu<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.320> go<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> computer<00:00:34.980> but

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
Start menu and go to computer but

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.900 
Start menu and go to computer but
right-click<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
properties and I think XP brings up just

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.940 
properties and I think XP brings up just
like<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:47.059> owl<00:00:48.350> make<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> separate<00:00:49.860> one
