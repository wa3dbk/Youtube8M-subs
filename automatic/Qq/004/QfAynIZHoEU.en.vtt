00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello dear viewers imagine 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.330
 your attention incredible interesting 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.330
 animal facts 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.190
 science already knows the fact that pigeons 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.320
 are abstract thinkers a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.330
 also that herons make their 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.270
 own fishing lures but 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.490
 believe it or not 2013 canadian 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.380
 scientists Pierre legally and simon ducats 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.269
 demonstrate that the birds 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.820
 pay attention to the restriction 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.800
 speeds this is especially impressive when 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.949
 you understand that not all people are 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.949
 make 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 sea ​​urchins will save the world scientists recently 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.790
 found that sea urchins can 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.980
 offer a solution to one of the largest 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.219
 world problems problems global 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.690
 warming hedgehogs are born larvae and in 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.120
 the time of their larval stage 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 below converts carbon dioxide to carbonate 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.800
 calcium material from which create 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.170
 cement and plaster casts group 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.539
 scientists conducted experiments and discovered 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.760
 what their skeleton sea urchin contains 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.129
 a large amount of nickel is sufficient 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.290
 in order to devour the whole surrounding 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.659
 carbon dioxide and turn it into 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.580
 harmless calcium carbonate while 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.680
 nickel not only makes sea urchin with 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.330
 age similar to the thorny man 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.009
 he can also save the planet us 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.259
 It is known that animals use 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.490
 various adaptations to 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.229
 make your life easier 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.740
 researchers managed to document 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.880
 a case with reptiles that enjoys 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.829
 a device to catch 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.329
 currently prey 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.119
 american alligator used stick 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.259
 to catch a bird 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.479
 clinging building material to 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.280
 his nest and discovers that 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.009
 several very suitable beams 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.259
 floating on the water trying and pick up and 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.780
 understanding nothing turns into the mouth 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.880
 reptiles even more surprising is the fact 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.220
 that crocodiles use traps from 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.220
 sticks only during the nesting season of the heron 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.649
 grasshopper you hamster is insanely serial 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.500
 killer unlike most rodents 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.020
 these guys love meat very much they hunt 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.330
 lizards and insects, arachnids 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.430
 also on other mice and before 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.530
 kill their prey they stand up 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.470
 and let out a terrifying howl 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.160
 recently scientists have discovered that grasshopper 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.799
 you are their aniki 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.110
 immune to scorpion venom usually 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.790
 when a poisonous creature fries a rodent then 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.930
 toxins enter sodium channels 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.030
 nerve cells 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.069
 this way over or spread out by 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.000
 cells and sends the brain a signal about 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.430
 severe pain 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.650
 nevertheless this individual is so strong 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.290
 that a special channel blocks the flow 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.540
 sodium which actually turns poison 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.430
 in more satisfying consequences of this 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.530
 discoveries can be very serious 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.930
 because like pharmaceutical companies 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.060
 finally got a chance to figure out how 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.170
 block sodium channels in the body 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.209
 human according to research males 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.190
 chameleon using color make it clear 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.530
 his opponent who will leave today 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.359
 home a winner while scientists 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.290
 knew that before the battle to the millions fall 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.269
 each other signals 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.280
 they weren't sure what the change was 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.600
 color indicate exactly the level 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.340
 combat preparedness 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.680
 until you have organized 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.150
 competition between reptiles in order 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.840
 to look more in the eyes 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.090
 adversary 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.549
 chameleon includes certain strips 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.190
 chameleon colors and with brighter stripes 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.190
 As a rule, suppress the opponent's shift 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.349
 bright even before the battle begins depending on 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.299
 how fast is the male during the fight 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.569
 changes colors and determined the winner 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.549
 contractions the researchers believe that these 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.650
 quick color change likely 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.209
 connectedness how much energy 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.209
 have lizards 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:44.010
 termites are quite expensive pests 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.010
 annually around the world they cause damage 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.510
 worth more than 40 million dollars for 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.330
 last 50 years scientists have tried 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.879
 exterminate non termites with 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.220
 biological weapons but from this so far 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.200
 nothing happened 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.239
 scientists found out that termites have 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.250
 disgusting habit to use 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.920
 his litter for the construction of their own 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.690
 nests with no one and nothing loves 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.940
 call termites as much as 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.160
 actin bacteria they settle on 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.700
 termites on the lake in exchange for free 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.650
 nutrition 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.989
 thus active bacteria 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.030
 provide these pests with chemical 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.650
 substances that kill fungi and 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.870
 which make them resilient 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.330
 exposure to biological weapons 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.550
 if bacteria actively help with termite 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.380
 then maybe someday they will help and 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.510
 us create some new antibiotics 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.030
 animals like dogs understand 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.919
 concept of gestures but they need to be taught 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.139
 however there is one creature that 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.200
 she does not need to train 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.780
 elephants are a kind of Enstein and 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.729
 animal world scientists believe that elephants 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.220
 understand human gestures without 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.470
 pre study researcher 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.930
 and smith conducted a first test it 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.880
 the llama fruit was shown then unnoticed 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.479
 from the animal laid him in one of two 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.090
 buckets 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.190
 further buckets showed break and she 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.830
 He is pointing the finger at the bucket in which 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.090
 is the fruit of the sleep did the right 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.220
 choice in 67.5 percent of cases a person in 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.150
 age 12 months with a similar 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.460
 test gives the right answer at 72.7 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.560
 percent of cases are essentially elephants so 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.210
 smart as a one year old baby 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.980
 cats are so sensitive that with 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.140
 using nerve endings on the paws 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.830
 feel the mouse for a few dozen more 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.860
 meters 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.130
 these animals are called live seismograph 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.390
 ami 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.330
 because they are able to predict 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.520
 earthquakes in some cats the day before 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.010
 earthquake wool stands on end 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.470
 some anxiously run from room to 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.670
 room trying to get out of the house of others 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.300
 meow loudly 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.640
 and tremble according to this study 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.680
 teams from the university son andreev 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.960
 dolphins use real names 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.320
 to distinguish one another from one another 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.900
 friend 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.880
 a group of scientists recorded the whistle of dolphins 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.830
 then they broadcast the received 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.840
 records underwater and found that 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.910
 Dolphins began to answer the example 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.830
 suppose there was one among the dolphins 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.960
 named Winnie the researcher 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.650
 turned on the sound of Andy underwater 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.900
 whistle led 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.360
 this particular dolphin reacted by 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.940
 especially if they included random 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.100
 sounds then this dolphin was silent proving 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.260
 that he doesn't make sounds just for the sake of 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.180
 the sounds are pretty amazing 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.250
 discovery given that no others 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.900
 animal species except maybe 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:31.730
 parrots do not use names sole 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.220
 potentially immortal being on 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.010
 earth is a jellyfish gi droid having 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.200
 diameter of only 45 millimeters unique 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.420
 an animal that is able to rejuvenate 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.610
 themselves usually jellyfish die after 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.650
 breeding however it can 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.230
 return and adult stage jellyfish to 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.570
 children's stage theoretically this cycle 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.640
 able to repeat to infinity 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.320
 what makes this creature potentially 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.420
 immortal this jellyfish 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.000
 discovered in warm tropical waters 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.520
 however, scientists suspect that this species 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.470
 spread to other regions but 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.540
 present day marine biologists and 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.370
 genetics are studying the jellyfish intently 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.040
 strongly follow the process of turning 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.640
 cells from one form to another known 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.740
 science as trans differentiation thanks 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.570
 subscribe to the channel for attention 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.420
 so as not to miss further release 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.540
 leave comments all good luck and to 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.540
 meeting
