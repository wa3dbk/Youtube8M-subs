00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
really well with the black body as well

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.299 
really well with the black body as well
um<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:36.200> couple<00:00:37.200> things<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.590> lens<00:00:37.800> this

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
um a couple things with this lens this

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.970 
um a couple things with this lens this
is<00:00:38.489> probably<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.480> sharpest<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.500> definitely

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
is probably the sharpest but definitely

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.170 
is probably the sharpest but definitely
actually<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> sharpest<00:00:41.820> lens

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
actually the sharpest lens

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.910 
actually the sharpest lens
I<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:43.290> ever<00:00:43.770> used<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:48.110> fast<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.469> autofocus

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
I have ever used it is fast to autofocus

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.840 
I have ever used it is fast to autofocus
generally<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.079> creates<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.360> very<00:00:54.360> creamy

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
generally and just creates a very creamy

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.369 
generally and just creates a very creamy
bouquet<00:00:58.370> when<00:00:59.370> shooting<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.969> 1.8<00:01:00.600> but

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
bouquet when shooting it like 1.8 but

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.049 
bouquet when shooting it like 1.8 but
actually<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:01.980> even<00:01:02.100> achieve<00:01:02.670> really

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
actually you could even achieve really

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.990 
actually you could even achieve really
good<00:01:03.270> background<00:01:04.170> blur<00:01:04.379> even<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.880> know

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
good background blur even up to you know

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.929 
good background blur even up to you know
had<00:01:06.210> f4<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.659> f5<00:01:07.159> just<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.700> such<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
had f4 or f5 just because it is such a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.870 
had f4 or f5 just because it is such a
long<00:01:09.450> focal<00:01:09.780> length<00:01:11.299> um<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> does<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> 75<00:01:14.610> mil

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
long focal length um so does a 75 mil

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.170 
long focal length um so does a 75 mil
and<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.630> gives<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> an<00:01:16.200> equivalent<00:01:18.229> 150<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
and that gives it an equivalent 150 on a

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.590 
and that gives it an equivalent 150 on a
35<00:01:21.180> mil<00:01:21.420> full-frame<00:01:22.310> sensor<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
35 mil full-frame sensor so it is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.730 
35 mil full-frame sensor so it is
definitely<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.409> long<00:01:25.920> lens<00:01:26.990> it's<00:01:28.850> basically<00:01:29.850> I

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
definitely a long lens it's basically I

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
definitely a long lens it's basically I
decided<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> purchase<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.430> lens<00:01:32.670> because<00:01:33.060> I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
decided to purchase this lens because I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.819 
decided to purchase this lens because I
I<00:01:33.570> actually<00:01:34.290> owned<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> 45<00:01:35.670> 1.8<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.829> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
I actually owned the 45 1.8 and I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.560 
I actually owned the 45 1.8 and I
actually<00:01:38.310> found<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.790> lens<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.270> really

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
actually found that lens to be really

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.730 
actually found that lens to be really
cool<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.369> I<00:01:41.369> managed<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.990> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.049> adapt<00:01:43.439> my

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
cool and I managed to kind of adapt my

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.600 
cool and I managed to kind of adapt my
shooting<00:01:44.130> style<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.000> could<00:01:45.270> still

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
shooting style so that I could still

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.080 
shooting style so that I could still
incorporate<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.909> lot<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.549> you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.790> lot<00:01:51.000> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
incorporate a lot of you know a lot of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
incorporate a lot of you know a lot of
different<00:01:51.390> environments<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.049> settings<00:01:52.470> even

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
different environments and settings even

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
different environments and settings even
though<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.549> was<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.000> longer<00:01:54.780> focal<00:01:54.960> length<00:01:55.320> then

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
though it was a longer focal length then

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
though it was a longer focal length then
I<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.740> normally<00:01:56.040> shoot<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> 75

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
I was normally shoot with the 75

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.530 
I was normally shoot with the 75
obviously<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.229> longer<00:01:59.270> but<00:02:00.270> having

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
obviously it is longer but having

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
obviously it is longer but having
practice<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.110> practice<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
practice at the practice on there on the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.230 
practice at the practice on there on the
45<00:02:02.909> by<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:04.500> find<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.520> I'm<00:02:05.670> able<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.939> use

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
45 by now I find that I'm able to use

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.580 
45 by now I find that I'm able to use
this

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.260 
this
quite<00:02:08.069> effectively<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:08.789> well<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.830> would

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
quite effectively as well I would

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.390 
quite effectively as well I would
basically<00:02:12.530> assume<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.740> lot<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.010> people

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
basically assume that a lot of people

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.920 
basically assume that a lot of people
they<00:02:14.880> open<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.209> be<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.360> case<00:02:15.540> with<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> lot<00:02:15.780> of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
they open to be the case with a lot of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.530 
they open to be the case with a lot of
people<00:02:16.520> simply<00:02:17.520> because<00:02:17.790> they're<00:02:18.209> not<00:02:18.300> used

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
people simply because they're not used

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.290 
people simply because they're not used
to<00:02:18.720> shooting<00:02:20.390> such<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.830> such<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> long<00:02:23.300> focal

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
to shooting such a such a long focal

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.120 
to shooting such a such a long focal
length<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:26.390> but<00:02:27.390> basically<00:02:28.380> even<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:28.980> you

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
length and but basically even if you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.070 
length and but basically even if you
aren't<00:02:29.340> used<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.880> shooting<00:02:30.480> long<00:02:30.720> focal

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
aren't used to shooting long focal

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.500 
aren't used to shooting long focal
lengths<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.620> what<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.400> basically<00:02:32.580> means<00:02:33.000> is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
lengths and what that basically means is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.710 
lengths and what that basically means is
that<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:34.410> kind<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.709> restricted<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.720> portrait

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that it's kind of restricted to portrait

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.300 
that it's kind of restricted to portrait
shots<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:40.040> yeah

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
shots and yeah

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
shots and yeah
they<00:02:41.850> say<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.060> portraits<00:02:43.910> whereas<00:02:44.910> if<00:02:45.120> you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
they say just portraits whereas if you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.130 
they say just portraits whereas if you
do<00:02:45.630> adapt<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.650> your<00:02:47.569> everyday<00:02:48.569> shooting

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
do adapt this to your everyday shooting

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.680 
do adapt this to your everyday shooting
style<00:02:49.440> then<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.709> can<00:02:49.920> actually<00:02:50.069> get<00:02:50.400> some

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
style then you can actually get some

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.330

now when I say sharp I'm talking like a

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.710

thousand dollars I mean just considering

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.670

the fact that it is one of the sharpest
in<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.890> world<00:03:38.840> then<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:40.200> thousand<00:03:40.829> dollars

really isn't all that much considering

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.720

you know even Zeiss glass and what Lang
the<00:03:47.579> glass<00:03:47.820> costs<00:03:48.329> more<00:03:48.570> than<00:03:48.630> this<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:50.180> you

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
the glass costs more than this and you

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.120 
the glass costs more than this and you
know<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:52.049> is<00:03:52.170> definitely<00:03:52.290> shot<00:03:52.799> within<00:03:52.980> your

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130

know this is definitely shot within your
typical<00:03:53.430> point<00:03:53.549> there<00:03:53.790> though<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:55.549> yeah

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
typical point there though so yeah

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.650 
typical point there though so yeah
basically<00:03:57.000> competing<00:03:57.420> against<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:58.140> oh<00:03:58.640> um

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
basically competing against like oh um
