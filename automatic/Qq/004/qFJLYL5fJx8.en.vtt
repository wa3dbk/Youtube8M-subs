00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.450
 how to set the filter clock 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.190
 automation is done from here 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.430
 they may have different 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.320
 appearances but the operation remains 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.140
 the same 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.930
 here we have a needle that we 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.360
 shows them approximately in 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:47.449
 the occurrence we see is pretty much 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:51.470
 at 2 pm here two needles that I 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:54.500
 just turned the little one who we 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.150
 tell us the big time we 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.150
 indicate the minutes precisely 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:06.680
 so we see it is 4:45 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.280
 we can read it here we can see that we 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.090
 is before 5 pm after 4 pm so 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.979
 it's 4:45 pm 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:22.130
 the switch here so in position 0 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.960
 the clock is stopped in clock position 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.210
 so it's the clock that starts so 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.710
 the programming we have done here is 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.710
 a manual of 20 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.299
 on position 1 and a forced march 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.640
 for the clock 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.539
 so if we put ourselves on it's like 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:48.610
 if we were on the move to settle 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:53.939
 the clock to adjust during the game so he 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:57.450
 is 14 hours so we will adjust the time 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.450
 that he is currently 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.599
 we will turn with the finger we go 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.239
 turn with each other until you reach 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:13.980
 here just before 14 hours around 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:18.640
 14 hours to adjust precisely 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.620
 turned the dotted minutes to the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.799
 desired position and so we see here 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.049
 about 14 hours and 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.060
 precisely 14 hours and three or four 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.870
 minutes on this clock we have 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.500
 the indication that when the pico are at 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.440
 interior 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.359
 we are in position 0 so this is the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.750
 when filtration will not work 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.410
 not the pico to the outside we are in 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.799
 position 1 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.510
 so this is the moment when filtration 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:53.410
 works in our case we're going 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.160
 operate the morning filtration 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.510
 in the evening 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:04.750
 from 8h to 20h which would mean that 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:07.060
 it is water at 24 degrees since 24/2 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.780
 equals 12 the filtration time of a 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.540
 equal to half the temperature 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.569
 of minimum water so we will dream 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.709
 our clock for it runs 12h 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.709
 for that and well so we'll do 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.709
 go out 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:37.610
 the bicots from 8h to 20h 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:41.350
 from 8h to 20h and we will return the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.350
 filter the filter pond useless 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.100
 here we have dreamed the clock for 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.400
 that it works for that 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.220
 the application works from 8h to 20h 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:58.880
 without stopping if we want to make a 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:02.060
 cut we push the pico to 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.220
 inside and that would be a break from 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.560
 filtration during the day 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.530
 however, I do not advise you 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.070
 since you are going to use your pump on 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.070
 consume electricity 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.050
 it is better to filter during the day
