00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
motion down Lane than the other two I

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.009 
motion down Lane than the other two I
would<00:04:20.489> say<00:04:20.700> this<00:04:21.150> sounds<00:04:21.420> good<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.840> would

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
would say this sounds good so this would

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.860 
would say this sounds good so this would
be<00:04:22.140> a<00:04:22.170> good<00:04:22.470> pleasing<00:04:22.950> second<00:04:23.430> game<00:04:23.580> ball<00:04:23.870> you

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
be a good pleasing second game ball you

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.390 
be a good pleasing second game ball you
could<00:04:25.050> probably<00:04:25.230> use<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.710> on<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.950> fresh<00:04:26.160> if

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
could probably use it on the fresh if

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.730 
could probably use it on the fresh if
you<00:04:26.580> build<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:28.110> be<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.260> little<00:04:28.470> bit<00:04:28.590> more

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
you build it to be a little bit more

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.670 
you build it to be a little bit more
aggressive<00:04:29.540> like<00:04:30.540> if<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:30.810> put<00:04:30.990> pin<00:04:31.200> down<00:04:31.350> and

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
aggressive like if you put pin down and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.730 
aggressive like if you put pin down and
pick<00:04:32.010> up<00:04:32.130> early<00:04:32.490> enough<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.760> be<00:04:33.140> a<00:04:34.140> good

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
pick up early enough to be a good

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.250 
pick up early enough to be a good
straight<00:04:35.160> first<00:04:35.520> out<00:04:35.700> of<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.880> game<00:04:36.060> ball<00:04:36.270> if

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
straight first out of the game ball if

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.650 
straight first out of the game ball if
you<00:04:37.320> leave<00:04:38.040> it<00:04:38.220> pin<00:04:38.370> up<00:04:38.520> it'd<00:04:38.700> be<00:04:38.910> good<00:04:39.150> second

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
you leave it pin up it'd be good second

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.300 
you leave it pin up it'd be good second
third<00:04:39.990> game<00:04:40.200> ball<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:42.510> entire<00:04:42.990> Divas<00:04:43.740> series
