 I finished formatting what they see there 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.520
 our external disk is ready 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.220

 our keyboard the enter key 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.920
 let's go to our local disk c 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.620
 we go to the folder that we created and opened 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.540
 this install point win 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.460
 by doing this we will appear the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.160
 installation options of our 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.800
 operating system that we want we choose 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.060
 the desired in this case is the 2 center 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.470
 Now let's choose the letter that 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.360
 corresponds to our hard drive in this 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:35.379
 case is the g we write it enter 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.050
 again we write the lyrics again 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.080
 which corresponds to our hard drive 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.240
 whole 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.120
 now of course we are using 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.970
 our external hard drive through 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.659

 all right now what are we going to do 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:03.979
 is to restart our pc to do the 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.629
 installation of our operating system 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.810
 first of all you have to configure the 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:12.759
 bios to enter directly from 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.759
 your external hard drive 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.410
 the first screen that will appear 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.410
 is this 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.210
 and good once I finish 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.610
 configure all this is going to 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.919
 appear this first screen where 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.080
 let's choose the language as you know in 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.000

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.729
 we give you the next one to jump this 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:41.580
 step we give you over the little blue button 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.490
 which is marked we accept the terms 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.520
 of the license here we configure our 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.710
 network we put the password of the same and 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.569
 next we give in this second 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.569
 option to configure 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.290
 and we deactivate all the boxes 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.430

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.520
 we uncheck all 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.470
 following 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.009
 here we wait for it to end we do not move 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.559
 nothing 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.229
 until the next screen here 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:21.719
 we can place our mail 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.610
 electronic, which as you know, does not 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:26.249

 finish with this we have finished the 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.800
 installation of this operating system 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.800
 inside our external hard drive 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.199
