are exactly the same when you fold them
in<00:02:27.140> half<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.739> will<00:02:27.890> actually<00:02:28.100> be<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.700> size

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
in half that will actually be the size

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.580 
in half that will actually be the size
of<00:02:29.030> your<00:02:29.330> bag<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:30.530> as<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.070> see<00:02:31.280> right<00:02:31.310> now

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.690 
now because I cut my second piece of
fabric<00:02:35.570> by<00:02:35.930> accident<00:02:36.560> into<00:02:36.890> two<00:02:37.100> separate

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
fabric by accident into two separate

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.210 
fabric by accident into two separate
rectangles<00:02:38.390> instead<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:39.050> one<00:02:39.230> big<00:02:39.260> rectangle

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
rectangles instead of one big rectangle

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.330 
rectangles instead of one big rectangle
I<00:02:40.370> had<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:41.000> soar<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.780> two<00:02:41.989> together<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.069> i<00:02:43.100> got

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
I had to soar the two together so i got

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.180 
I had to soar the two together so i got
the<00:02:43.489> edges<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.120> pinned<00:02:44.569> them<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.230> now<00:02:46.069> I'm

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.860 

now<00:03:11.890> this<00:03:12.069> step<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.670> optional<00:03:12.849> but<00:03:13.269> before

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
sowing birth pieces of fabric together I

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.300 
sowing birth pieces of fabric together I
turd<00:03:17.709> on<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.310> rectangle<00:03:19.000> for<00:03:19.420> my<00:03:19.989> iron<00:03:20.889> on

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
turd on a rectangle for my iron on

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.199 
turd on a rectangle for my iron on
transfer<00:03:22.180> now<00:03:23.049> I'm<00:03:23.409> sewing<00:03:23.799> both<00:03:24.370> pieces<00:03:24.879> of

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
transfer now I'm sewing both pieces of

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.860 
transfer now I'm sewing both pieces of
fabric<00:03:25.480> together<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:27.430> put<00:03:27.879> first<00:03:28.239> good

fabric together and I put first good

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.089 
fabric together and I put first good
sides<00:03:29.200> facing<00:03:29.799> out<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.829> what<00:03:36.010> it

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
sides facing out so this is what it

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.250 
sides facing out so this is what it
looks<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:36.430> after<00:03:36.669> I<00:03:36.879> sewed<00:03:37.299> both<00:03:37.629> pieces<00:03:37.959> of

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
looks like after I sewed both pieces of

looks like after I sewed both pieces of
fabric<00:03:38.439> together<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.340> as<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:39.939> can<00:03:40.090> see

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
fabric together and as you can see

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.659 
fabric together and as you can see
there's<00:03:40.629> little<00:03:41.049> edges<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.889> aren't<00:03:42.370> very

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669
