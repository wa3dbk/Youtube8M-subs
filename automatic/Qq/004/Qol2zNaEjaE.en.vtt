two practice ropes is great

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.170 
two practice ropes is great
when<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.680> are<00:02:13.830> actually<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.520> zone<00:02:14.760> you're

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
when you are actually in the zone you're

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.340 
when you are actually in the zone you're
just<00:02:15.390> doing<00:02:15.660> like<00:02:16.280> one<00:02:17.280> two<00:02:17.670> BAM<00:02:18.030> one<00:02:18.420> two<00:02:18.660> BAM
