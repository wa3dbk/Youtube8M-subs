instead<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:49.399> you<00:00:50.399> know<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.760> those<00:00:51.030> growing

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
instead of you know just those growing

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.299 
instead of you know just those growing
up<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.930> down<00:00:52.110> find<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> option<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.160> won't

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
up and down find the option you won't

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.939 
up and down find the option you won't
use<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.449> i<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.110> will<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.590> written

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
use so i think this will be in written

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.799 
use so i think this will be in written
little<00:00:56.250> bit<00:00:56.370> more<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.629> right

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
little bit more because actually right

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.630 
little bit more because actually right

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
now as you can see here i'm having three

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
now as you can see here i'm having three
atoms<00:01:00.270> which<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> photo<00:01:01.140> modeling<00:01:01.440> tool

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
cloud generator light fill tools etc you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
cloud generator light fill tools etc you
may<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.619> own<00:01:04.920> add-ons<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.760> are

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
may have your own add-ons that are

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.690 
may have your own add-ons that are
actually<00:01:06.090> following<00:01:06.510> every<00:01:07.350> single<00:01:07.830> tab<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
actually following every single tab and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.219 
actually following every single tab and
this<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.390> bit<00:01:09.510> disturbing<00:01:09.900> perhaps

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
this is a little bit disturbing perhaps

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.550 
this is a little bit disturbing perhaps
they<00:01:10.320> will<00:01:10.439> add<00:01:10.619> something<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:12.470> let's<00:01:13.470> say

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
they will add something like let's say

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.950 
they will add something like let's say
nodame<00:01:14.100> tab<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.640> don't<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.090> everything<00:01:15.869> is

other chains is the ability to have a
walk<00:01:52.799> camera<00:01:53.280> instead<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.479> fly<00:01:54.899> camera

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
walk camera instead of a fly camera

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
walk camera instead of a fly camera
actually<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.040> books<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> same<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.850> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
press shift F the mouse will won't work

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.730 
press shift F the mouse will won't work
anymore<00:01:59.549> the<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.509> used<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.750> work<00:02:00.810> but

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
anymore the way it used to work but

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.480 
anymore the way it used to work but
right<00:02:02.640> now<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.880> have<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.479> press<00:02:04.140> W<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.340> go

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
right now you have to press W to go

back to the right to the left of course

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.240 
back to the right to the left of course
you<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.130> aim<00:02:21.430> by<00:02:21.700> using<00:02:21.970> your<00:02:22.300> mouse<00:02:23.250> almost

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
you can aim by using your mouse almost

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.400 
you can aim by using your mouse almost
like<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.550> first<00:02:24.700> person<00:02:24.880> shooter<00:02:25.330> game<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:25.900> in

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
like the first person shooter game so in

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
to go under user preferences input and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.590 
to go under user preferences input and
switch<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.250> view<00:02:36.280> navigation<00:02:36.940> from<00:02:37.150> work<00:02:37.390> to

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
switch the view navigation from work to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.920 
switch the view navigation from work to
fly<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.200> everything<00:02:39.130> will<00:02:39.280> be<00:02:39.400> back<00:02:39.930> normal

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
fly and everything will be back normal

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.320 
fly and everything will be back normal
you<00:02:41.230> know<00:02:41.350> nothing<00:02:41.709> tape<00:02:42.069> but<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.940> really<00:02:43.180> like

case you want to have an animation let's

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.070 
case you want to have an animation let's
say<00:02:48.220> an<00:02:48.340> architectural<00:02:49.090> visualization<00:02:49.390> or

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
say an architectural visualization or

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.780 
say an architectural visualization or
something<00:02:50.380> like<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:51.220> really<00:02:51.370> good<00:02:51.489> and

something like this it's really good and
also<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.630> can<00:02:52.840> change<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.739> mouth

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
also you can change the mouth

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.210 
also you can change the mouth
sensitivity<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:55.690> teleport<00:02:56.319> duration<00:02:56.769> walk

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
sensitivity the teleport duration walk

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.050 
sensitivity the teleport duration walk
spin<00:02:57.790> speed<00:02:58.030> factor<00:02:58.269> gravity<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.790> can<00:03:00.940> also

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
spin speed factor gravity you can also

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.539 
spin speed factor gravity you can also
have<00:03:01.720> changes<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.620> gravity<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.310> hide

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
have changes in the gravity of you hide

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.520 
have changes in the gravity of you hide
some<00:03:04.000> height<00:03:04.299> basically<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.350> have

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
some height basically you have

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.830 
some height basically you have
summarized<00:03:06.160> all<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.760> changes<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.180> happen

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
summarized all the changes that happen

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.530 
summarized all the changes that happen
in<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.530> user<00:03:08.739> interface<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.580> think<00:03:10.299> that

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
in the user interface I think that

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.160 
in the user interface I think that
tutorial<00:03:11.049> was<00:03:11.170> helpful<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.590> bye-bye
