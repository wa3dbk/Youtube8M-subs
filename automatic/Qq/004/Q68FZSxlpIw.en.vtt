00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
can see there the gauge is still the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799 
can see there the gauge is still the
same<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> extinguisher<00:00:48.390> running<00:00:48.690> between

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
same on the extinguisher running between

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.490 
same on the extinguisher running between
110<00:00:49.710> psi<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.239> pump<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.690> at

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
110 psi in it and I just pump that up at

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.430 
110 psi in it and I just pump that up at
the<00:00:52.559> little<00:00:52.890> fill<00:00:53.070> point<00:00:53.750> which<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.079> once

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the little fill point which is also once

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
the little fill point which is also once
again<00:00:55.530> stock<00:00:55.920> standard<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.489> water

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
again stock standard from the water

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.130 
again stock standard from the water
extinguisher<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.390> I'll<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.750> top<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:57.930> up

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
extinguisher and I'll just top that up

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.209 
extinguisher and I'll just top that up
with<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.649> my<00:00:58.680> standard<00:00:59.129> air

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
with that with my standard air

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.939 
with that with my standard air
compressor<00:01:00.140> you'll<00:01:01.140> notice<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.620> I've<00:01:01.739> got

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
compressor you'll notice that I've got

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.349 
compressor you'll notice that I've got
two<00:01:02.100> instead<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.550> running<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.059> straight

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
two instead of running just a straight

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.780 
two instead of running just a straight
air<00:01:03.570> hose<00:01:03.809> that's<00:01:04.080> where<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> water<00:01:04.700> used<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
air hose that's where the water used to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.950 
air hose that's where the water used to
come<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:05.970> through<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> hose<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
come out through the hose in the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
come out through the hose in the
extinguisher<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:08.670> outlet<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.240> I've<00:01:09.360> just

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
extinguisher the outlet so I've just

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.950 
extinguisher the outlet so I've just
basically<00:01:09.659> used<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.380> coiled<00:01:11.150> air<00:01:12.150> hose<00:01:12.450> instead

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
basically used a coiled air hose instead

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.840 
basically used a coiled air hose instead
of<00:01:13.080> fixing<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> permit<00:01:13.920> onto<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> onto<00:01:14.670> the

of fixing a permit onto the onto the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.870 
of fixing a permit onto the onto the
extinguisher<00:01:15.470> I<00:01:16.470> want<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
extinguisher I want to go to have a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.539 
extinguisher I want to go to have a
remote<00:01:18.330> firing<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.040> either<00:01:20.130> stick<00:01:20.430> it

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
remote firing so we can either stick it

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.399 
remote firing so we can either stick it
around<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.790> corner<00:01:21.030> we'll<00:01:21.750> stick<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> under<00:01:22.259> one

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
around a corner we'll stick it under one

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.469 
around a corner we'll stick it under one

someone's growing have the extinguishers
stretched<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:30.900> back<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.770> another<00:01:32.040> sleep

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
stretched right back at another sleep

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.289 
stretched right back at another sleep
and<00:01:32.579> unbeknownst<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.090> them<00:01:34.250> yeah<00:01:35.280> fired<00:01:36.030> off

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and unbeknownst to them yeah fired off

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.330 
and unbeknownst to them yeah fired off
and<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.869> they'll<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.110> no<00:01:37.320> idea<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and and they'll have no idea what the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.460 
and and they'll have no idea what the
hell's<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.729> happen<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> reason

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
hell's just happen so that's the reason

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.810 
hell's just happen so that's the reason
for<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:42.150> coiled<00:01:42.509> air<00:01:42.630> hose<00:01:43.549> it's<00:01:44.549> rated

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
for the the coiled air hose it's rated

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.240 
for the the coiled air hose it's rated
to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.970> 125<00:01:46.520> decibels<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.729> believe<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.560> yeah

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to be 125 decibels I believe and yeah

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460 
to be 125 decibels I believe and yeah
that's<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> bit<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.329> we'll<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.170> give<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that's a bit so we'll go and give it a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440 
that's a bit so we'll go and give it a
test

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
test

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.170 
test
but<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.710> we're<00:01:55.950> we're<00:01:56.759> gonna<00:01:56.850> give<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
but I so we're we're gonna give it a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.070 
but I so we're we're gonna give it a
test<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.400> see<00:01:59.759> how<00:01:59.909> goes<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
test and you see how goes with the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:24.860 
test and you see how goes with the
yarder<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:21.860> awesome
