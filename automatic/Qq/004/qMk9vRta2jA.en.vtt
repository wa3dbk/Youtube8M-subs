 camcorder from sony to hdr pj 200 that does 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.379
 part of sony camcorders bj line 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.070
 which brings as differential a projector 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.130
 integrated 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.010
 You can shoot and enjoy the presence 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.260
 of this project already to reproduce is this 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.660
 content without the need for example 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.240
 from a high-definition screen or up 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.940
 even go through a dvd and blu ray and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.960
 play these players this model he 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.730
 has a 2.7-inch widescreen display 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.079
 With you, you see here she is. 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.270
 touchscreen like most 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.629
 camcorders today are here you are giving 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:51.329
 a better look at this menu it brings a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.370
 30 x optical zoom is 30 times or 300 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.110
 combined with the digital 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.629
 here you are seeing the control of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.910
 zoom here also has the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.000
 shot since you can shoot 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.939
 and it's at the same time while you're filming 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.659
 You could also have photographed or 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.580
 only 5.3 megapixel photos of 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.270
 resolution if you are seeing here that you are 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.830
 movie and agent mode by clicking 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.640
 here the mute button already changes the 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.220
 photo mode 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.170
 the camcorder is very compact I'll close 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.270
 here put in my hand for you 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.930
 have an idea of ​​the size it weighs 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.210
 only 210 grams from above 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.430
 You're seeing the microphone for the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.880
 recording the audio was recorded in 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.979
 digital be the double digital 2.0 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.659
 which helps to simulate your audi for whom 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.970
 has for example a home system 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.220
 the lenses of milk systems 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 sony zon she uses the causal is not 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.049
 How is it based? 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.720
 is a lens haiti and still have one here 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.040
 protection key for us to close and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.340
 protect this lens 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.799
 You are seeing here the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.890
 holding the camera has one thing very 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.409
 cool that the integrated usb are seeing 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.780
 here usb also comes with integrated cable 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.090
 USB adapter then recharge 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.930
 directly charge the battery to the battery 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.840
 of the camera 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.519
 or connect to an extender the battery is 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.829
 here you are watching she films in HD 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.680
 1980 and it is the HDTV 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:30.180
 hdtv resolution there is no full resolution 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.489
 hd and it brings here the hdmi output for 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.060
 who wants to use with high tv 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.519
 setting and yet another usb input 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.980
 the hdmi cable is very cool here in my 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.260
 hand it accompanies the product is a cable 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.950
 mini hdmi so it's minimal of me to 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.989
 academy are watching here to use with 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.609
 these high definition TVs have many 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.040
 features have smily detector 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.590
 face stabilizer 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.989
 images with image stabilizer is 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.549
 active type so that sony says that he 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.930
 ten times more efficient 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.870
 efficient than previous models 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.510
 but without doubt the great 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.969
 differential is related here to 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.480
 this key projection key 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.829
 just push us to come 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.769
 the display message 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.049
 telling us if we want to use the projector 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.590
 teaching what the commands have here 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.229
 O 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.870
 the specific focus projector then the people 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:28.799
 can come here and there is the focus of 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.840
 projector and also from blue and select 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.970
 with these commands from above normal 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.699
 I'll show you around now. 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.919
 the quality of the projected images and I 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:40.019
 to pay for the light I'm going to 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.689
 I can assure you that it is surprising for 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.419
 a pico projector with limited resolution 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:49.799
 640 for coming here for you to see 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:51.629
 Light on is a 640 by 360 projector 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.699
 resolution pixels 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.919
 is a low resolution but it is a relation 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:58.799
 very cool to us and produce in 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:01.019
 white walls and any surface 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.699
 It has 10 ansi lumens of brightness. 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.669
 is enough for a room with a 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:08.310
 dark illumination or more illumination 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:11.489
 controlled image reproduction with 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.349
 of a certain quality and also with colors 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.970
 You need to be the one who most called me the 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.199
 attention and that's what'll show 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.289
 you now 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.370
 I'm here with the camcorder. 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.409
 seeing that I 'm not with the room 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.980
 totally dark light walks back to 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.500
 lusa 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.200
 off but the curtain lights are off. 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.050
 erased but the curtain is open 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.270
 I'm already projecting on the wall a 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.420
 image I'll show you now 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.540
 You are seeing that it is enough. 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.810
 brightness we can see the 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.790
 these scenes clearly with clarity 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.160
 of course they are washed because it is 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.040
 very bright only 10 ansi lumens of brightness 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.170
 my pico projector but still the 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.920
 people can see that even with 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.710
 plenty of light on the projector 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.550
 he still manages to play the pictures 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.610
 on the wall 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.770
 sony says that a distance of up to 33 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.890
 meters we can project the 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.640
 60-inch image in our tests 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.920
 it seemed to us as up to 42 inches 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.110
 the images were good enough 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.450
 so good images even with a good 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.250
 Good contrast leather level I go 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.010
 turn off the lights now for you to give 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.140
 a look as is the projector and 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.780
 use and totally dark environment that is the 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.760
 ideal is done by selecting that the 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.710
 Image 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:38.040
 and then you can already see that he really 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.440
 It has a nice glow to the dark rooms 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.870
 Colors you can fix, too. 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.830
 here as bad the open screen more or less 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:49.140
 here in 36 inches but I did tests 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.680
 here and with 40 inches people 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.660
 can get good pictures clear images 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.030
 over 40 already loses some of the 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.840
 the speakers are played back. 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.820
 audio 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.380
 you can listen and when this wing does not 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.180
 There is a lot of the environment as it is 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.940
 There's a lot of ambient sound in the room. 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.110
 occurring is enough if we listen 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.030
 have fun 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.890
 This is a sony solution with a 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.630
 integrated projector and that I found it well 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.670
 especially nice for those who like 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.410
 shoot and want to meet with the 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.410
 family to enjoy these moments
