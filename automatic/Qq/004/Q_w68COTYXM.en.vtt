not aware of a you know any tricks like

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.069 
not aware of a you know any tricks like
there<00:01:48.759> wasn't<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.090> last<00:01:49.240> step<00:01:49.600> so<00:01:49.659> you<00:01:49.899> just

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
got to keep doing it so let's go for it

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.760 
got to keep doing it so let's go for it
here<00:01:55.350> installation<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.439> border<00:01:58.679> it's<00:01:59.679> very

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
here installation of border it's very

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.809 
here installation of border it's very
important<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.189> you<00:02:00.310> don't<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.700> repeat

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
important that you don't just repeat

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.880 
important that you don't just repeat
step<00:02:01.270> 16<00:02:01.780> for<00:02:01.990> this<00:02:02.109> you<00:02:02.229> have<00:02:02.319> to<00:02:02.439> repeat

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
step 16 for this you have to repeat

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.669 
step 16 for this you have to repeat
steps<00:02:03.219> 13<00:02:03.850> through<00:02:04.600> 16<00:02:04.780> until<00:02:05.319> you<00:02:05.439> get<00:02:05.590> it

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
steps 13 through 16 until you get it

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.520 
steps 13 through 16 until you get it
right<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.159> there<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:06.759> got<00:02:07.179> it<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.689> after<00:02:08.380> doing

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
right and there I got it so after doing

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.300 
right and there I got it so after doing
that<00:02:10.350> selecting<00:02:11.350> update.zip<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:12.190> then

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
that selecting update.zip and then

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.880 
that selecting update.zip and then
hitting<00:02:12.550> update<00:02:13.060> on<00:02:13.240> my<00:02:13.360> terminal<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:14.020> finally

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
hitting update on my terminal it finally

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.400 
hitting update on my terminal it finally
went<00:02:15.010> through<00:02:15.370> after<00:02:15.640> several<00:02:16.330> tries<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.930> I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
went through after several tries and I

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.350 
went through after several tries and I
now<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.740> clockwork<00:02:18.580> recovery<00:02:18.790> mod

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
now have the clockwork recovery mod

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.550 
now have the clockwork recovery mod
which<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:21.269> cyan<00:02:22.269> color<00:02:22.659> alright<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.349> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
which is this cyan color alright so the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.500 
which is this cyan color alright so the
next<00:02:23.590> step<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.159> clockworkmod<00:02:24.819> recovery<00:02:24.849> go<00:02:25.450> to

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
next step in clockworkmod recovery go to

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.309 
next step in clockworkmod recovery go to
the<00:02:25.629> partitions<00:02:26.230> menu<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.830> mount

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
the partitions menu and mount
