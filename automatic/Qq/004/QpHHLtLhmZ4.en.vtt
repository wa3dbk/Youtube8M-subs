00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.850
 that of all his ranks the storm for 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.170
 the geo modulus chain in business on 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.270
 can be found in this video on 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.960
 game presentation this game of racing 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.410
 while miley racing is a game of 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.360
 race 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.540
 video I think you'll understand 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.870
 with this video 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:36.230
 so the game is free on ios for them 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.560
 ipod ipad iphone users i think 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.030
 that you also know well for 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.760
 android users on google 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.470
 play since it's free so 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.630
 there will obviously be a lot of feathers 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.110
 in this game you will find enough 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.490
 frequently 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.160
 it's a bit boring but hey it's 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.570
 free and obviously ignorant hunting 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.820
 which unlike some I so 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.500
 the i never hunt are pretty little 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.300
 present to them let's say we can very 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.410
 easily without passion we find ourselves 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.680
 right now for the features 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.680
 Game 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.470
 so insurgents so the game is composed 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.910
 of two modes 2nd so pretty distinctive 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.430
 so there is the first game mode that 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.440
 you can see on the screen this is the mode 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.440
 free play so one goal of access 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.630
 to destroy everything as many items as possible 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.430
 possible the cars the cars of 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.790
 civilian police cars in 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.710
 rocco and of course avoiding being made 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.540
 to catch by the police blades because 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.220
 that they can inflict damage 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.500
 and when your car died down the 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.990
 part then stops the second two 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.610
 game modes that you can see after 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.940
 the fangs is the game master 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.790
 race so there are 4 4 cars you 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.350
 and the goal of the game is to get the 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.110
 first on the finish line a 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.060
 race alone to red such as on 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.340
 game mode we will win the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.649
 tickets so these tickets allow you 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.210
 to buy new cars and the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.130
 admirals so there are many ways 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.260
 to buy a car so be with 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.360
 good says chip so good said chip 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.060
 what's called the paying currency of 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.000
 game so that can be obtained either in 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.420
 paying so with snipers hunt either 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.600
 by doing nokia missions there are some 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.920
 missions at the beginning of the game for example 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.280
 I did not destroy 50 objects struck in 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.450
 police car 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.760
 so there when you like to see on the screen 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.709
 so that's so I'm dead so at 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.620
 widow the nmes of search so in 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.790
 a lot of games so there is energy 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.269
 which I have there is no energy except 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.739
 that as soon as you finish part ya 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.090
 your level of research that increases 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.010
 so if he means that the feather left 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.880
 will have more policemen it will be harder 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.319
 arrived at search level 10 in 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:07.939
 five years we will win half the 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:10.219
 good said chip in fact so we go 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.609
 the cars are quite varied there are 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.810
 not bad 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.879
 there are cars it is rather for the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.420
 speed of his earlier to enter 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.590
 in everywhere and so that's so if this 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.420
 which is good that you can buy 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.269
 cars either with damon chips or 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.870
 with tickets that we win in part 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.870
 quite simply 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.210
 so so now my opinion on this 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.440
 again so that I do not want it racing 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.260
 it's a game that I will not you 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.640
 hide and for me was a super game 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.860
 so in every way so the 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.870
 graphics are really very good the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.750
 lifetime also so that's good 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.810
 although it's always the same, so 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.380
 always always this is it 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.020
 not bad 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.959
 it is to these sermons GuitÃ© gland 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.810
 dÃ©fouloir we will say 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.450
 the price also very very good so 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.220
 designator really does not hunt 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.050
 mandatory we can do without but 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.620
 really very easily unlike 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.810
 some games or like the glu games 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.700
 the guen for those who know so 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.489
 it's games where you can not can not 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.830
 not play without depending on the money is 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.540
 the only point worse than the others 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.130
 so it's going to stay the gameplay so he 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.760
 sometimes there are small little 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.890
 slowdowns and the principle of 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.390
 always turn finally I do not know if 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.460
 you understood from how I know a 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.700
 little player aaa explained it's rest 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.130
 a little lucky so this is a game that I 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.280
 therefore recommend I will put the link of the 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.840
 written test in the description as well as 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.030
 the two links to download this game 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.919
 on ios and android and so on that I 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.080
 wish you a good evening a good 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.700
 afternoon a good morning a good 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.720
 night 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.130
 I do not know what I'm saying but we 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.330
 will find himself very soon for a 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.100
 new video so that was when 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.640
 even for a moment to the thousand to chain 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.640
 gamer affair
