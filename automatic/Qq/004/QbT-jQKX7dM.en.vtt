00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.720 

the<00:05:42.750> giant<00:05:43.200> carlon<00:05:43.650> tree<00:05:43.950> was<00:05:44.160> planted<00:05:44.190> here

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
the giant carlon tree was planted here

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.820 
the giant carlon tree was planted here
by<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:45.000> elves<00:05:45.420> when<00:05:45.570> they<00:05:45.660> first<00:05:45.900> came<00:05:46.230> as<00:05:46.770> a

guardian to watch over and protect them
this<00:05:50.070> newly<00:05:50.430> reborn<00:05:51.090> tree<00:05:51.510> protects<00:05:52.020> elves

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
this newly reborn tree protects elves

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.490 
this newly reborn tree protects elves
humans<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.910> lives<00:05:54.180> of<00:05:54.480> all<00:05:54.780> those<00:05:54.810> who

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
humans and the lives of all those who

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.000 
humans and the lives of all those who
are<00:05:55.590> caught<00:05:55.830> in<00:05:55.860> between<00:05:57.350> therefore<00:05:58.350> this

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
are caught in between therefore this

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.690 
are caught in between therefore this
tree<00:05:59.600> requires<00:06:00.600> a<00:06:00.780> new<00:06:01.110> name

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.990 

I<00:06:04.820> mean<00:06:05.600> for<00:06:05.630> us

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
I mean for us

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.390 
I mean for us
I<00:06:07.060> mean<00:06:07.780> for<00:06:07.810> everyone's<00:06:08.530> three

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.810 

so<00:06:12.240> this<00:06:12.449> tree<00:06:12.810> is<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.680> link<00:06:14.009> that<00:06:14.280> connects

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
so this tree is the link that connects

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.450 
so this tree is the link that connects
the<00:06:15.000> mud

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:30.910 

okay<00:06:19.120> I<00:06:19.360> got<00:06:19.690> it
