00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.190
 One day in that Lake Yamanaka 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.259
 Why am I up to here update2 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.979
 On the other hand 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:10.509
 It is good but 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.849
 First of all, the next tempo is fast 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.849
 It is not the first time in the US but it is not 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.080
 What I've done up to now is what I've done because I called my sincere 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.169
 It was not 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.109
 US gm 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.689
 Hi Tech I wanted to keep it in myself 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.499
 Most efficient before 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 Well done that cat exchange trade 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 Let's go over this today 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.220
 It is said that this distinction was made outside Yamada of the council 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.080
 Takeda Mae speed is about 2 hours less speed 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.530
 so 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 If it can be the next or landscape data 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.810
 Kagome entwined with a collection of favorite things in one hall 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.490
 Because I was shaving 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.350
 According to the 3 parties that it is not compared to Aichi 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 Because there is a difference in the speed that you can do it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.750
 In this prefecture 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.660
 Maximize your successors and troops 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.660
 It is said that it is the state of water while approaching as it is 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.800
 I'm looking at it 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.440
 At that time that one is still 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.800
 I'm just looking for the next run 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.970
 Yukata Stretch 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.180
 For example 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.830
 It is a place that is a patch area for winter 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.540
 I thought I was an alpine man, and there was a change 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.720
 Say 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.520
 An error occurs later 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.110
 It will be added 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.810
 I think that being able to carry is a great good thing 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.070
 It is also the first 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.030
 In 2 hours 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.530
 For example, His found two out of 82 places 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.230
 Keywords for each car separately 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.950
 It is not only you 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.350
 Michael Bay again 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.350
 Let's do the same place 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.380
 Long-awaited learning makes it more efficient 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.110
 Only once a day 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.350
 trunc beta is said 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.860
 Why is it so wasteful 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.890
 After all 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.049
 Let's put time to become Actel fish 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.009
 of course 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.009
 The wind is falling and the 3 prefectures are amazing 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.249
 Because the carp changes 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.689
 More in the day of the planning day 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.689
 If you try fishing at high pace that 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.759
 It is easy to understand why 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.170
 It will be upgraded Korean films 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.290
 It is an open-collar shirt, but I'm also expanding my efforts 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.929
 ing 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.929
 If the right approach is done 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.939
 Such fish body can be surely found and additional distance 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.849
 Natural resources fall and it is empty summer sea, but byte can not be replaced 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:45.489
 It seems 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.299
 Aggressive swing on removal crate has a great effect 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.139
 Well, though 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.329
 I arranged the pet here 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.569
 Same district color is lineup 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.159
 I'm sorry now 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.449
 I'm there 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.369
 Here 1/2 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.199
 Governor Hirai is the left half in terms of pedigree 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.169
 I will continue to look 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.010
 Because we use 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.229
 On the left 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.099
 I'm wondering if you use it 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.539
 Mr. stad below that talks 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:13.799
 Street light 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.279
 What is a blogger? 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:16.469
 But you know 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.440
 Spring 4 o'clock 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.039
 Because it is used for 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.219
 Is 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.999
 I think it's all about raising silver 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:24.909
 Yeah but 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.099
 In particular, aging advances and becoming a body 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.289
 The punishment is decided from Toyohashi sexual February 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.689
 Go to that late deep place and the color that can erase the presence most 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:37.929
 that 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:41.609
 Close-up dedicated crawfish standing at the top if divided 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:42.709
 Missing fish 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.539
 I'm also hoping for Matsuzaka because I can expect someday 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.959
 From Daytona 10,772 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.259
 It was synchronized 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.859
 There are so many types of landing flushing so far 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:57.480
 21st floor but this is 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.479
 I especially think 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.749
 When you are in trouble 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.329
 When the amount of light is small 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.969
 At the time of the foggy situation 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.919
 This color 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.959
 A little everyday 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.959
 The motives of the line by the beholder 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.539
 Also the face of this day 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.009
 I like chatarey This is after all 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.009
 Everybody knows the day of the rainy day 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.710
 It's a bright color, but I also put it out 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.270
 It was said 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.250
 Because it can be used as a spice of Monet in all time zone, already all of you 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.589
 Please come
