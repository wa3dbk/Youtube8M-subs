00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:04.479
 Hello guys 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.970
 I like it here 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.700
 the future of wallace also incidentally we witnessed jataí 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.729
 that never in his mandate tried to enter that same box here 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.039
 there was an intense struggle between them 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.159
 In the end, they finished. 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.879
 if we divide the 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.149
 and occupying houses in the neighborhood that have or have a chance 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.890
 but it is already established 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 if I have - move around here 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.920
 when the boxes are very close to each other classic works 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.570
 we had already been occupied by chance here by jataí 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.020
 and this one here the body of the jandaíra bee 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.630
 here as a technician 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.710
 a lot of him something is still around 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.570
 plants came here 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.790
 near the river 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.210
 we came a lot of bee 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 still on board 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
 It's interesting that these guys were 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 among several we finish here of boxes of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.500
 North-East and North-East 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 vide the trap that we have several boxes of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.820
 leaving the elderly 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.910
 the third axis is bc established 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 she no more than ten feet and only two boxes 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 up here on top of the roof 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.430
 also in amapá 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.900
 which generates 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.920
 furthermore the group 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.240
 by the people 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 that's why I call it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
 it is the best we have established ourselves 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.870
 I would say that the moment I too is much smaller 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:18.259
 that's it folks
