okay<00:00:06.440> so<00:00:06.520> this<00:00:07.520> is<00:00:07.760> a<00:00:07.840> brief<00:00:08.840> journey<00:00:08.900> around

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
okay so this is a brief journey around

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.220 
okay so this is a brief journey around
the<00:00:09.770> sqn<00:00:10.340> mixer<00:00:13.000> and<00:00:14.000> I'll<00:00:14.629> start<00:00:15.020> at<00:00:15.200> the

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
the sqn mixer and I'll start at the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.720 
the sqn mixer and I'll start at the
beginning<00:00:17.470> this<00:00:18.470> is<00:00:18.530> the<00:00:18.680> chamber<00:00:19.280> where<00:00:19.310> the

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
beginning this is the chamber where the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.350 
beginning this is the chamber where the
AAA<00:00:20.240> batteries<00:00:20.869> how<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:21.650> mixer<00:00:22.160> go<00:00:22.340> six<00:00:23.180> AAA

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
AAA batteries how the mixer go six AAA

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.540 
AAA batteries how the mixer go six AAA
batteries<00:00:23.990> very<00:00:24.230> important<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.190> get<00:00:25.310> them<00:00:25.460> in

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
batteries very important to get them in

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.150 
batteries very important to get them in
the<00:00:25.670> right<00:00:25.790> way<00:00:25.940> around<00:00:26.440> the<00:00:27.440> top<00:00:27.710> channel

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
the right way around the top channel

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.330 
the right way around the top channel
here<00:00:28.810> batteries<00:00:29.810> point<00:00:30.470> downwards<00:00:31.010> so<00:00:31.310> the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
here batteries point downwards so the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.720 
here batteries point downwards so the
negative<00:00:32.210> end<00:00:32.419> is<00:00:33.350> facing<00:00:34.190> out<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.640> the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
negative end is facing out and the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.840 
negative end is facing out and the
cotton<00:00:35.660> channel<00:00:36.020> here<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:37.100> positive<00:00:37.579> end<00:00:37.730> of

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
cotton channel here the positive end of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.849 
cotton channel here the positive end of
the<00:00:37.909> battery<00:00:37.969> must<00:00:38.390> be<00:00:38.539> facing<00:00:38.929> upwards<00:00:41.859> that

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
the battery must be facing upwards that

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.849 
the battery must be facing upwards that
push<00:00:43.219> is<00:00:43.399> closed<00:00:43.940> against<00:00:44.929> this<00:00:45.170> catch<00:00:45.440> and
