00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.950
 red and white chocolate 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.469
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.310
 the next 180 grams of flour 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.190
 wheat 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.770
 100 grams of fruits in red in my case 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.660
 they are frozen and if you enter Spain ' 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.010
 that you can find for example in the 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.650
 Leader 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.450
 50 grams of butter at temperature 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:32.240
 ambient 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:34.970
 125 ml of milk 90 grams of sugar 50 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.360
 grams of white chocolate 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.870
 an egg at room temperature too 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.850
 8 grams of chemical yeast powder 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.010
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.289
 4 grams of vanilla sugar 2 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.539
 and a teaspoon and a half of essence of 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.239
 vanilla or if you do not have the replace 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.800
 for 8 grams of vanilla sugar what 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.289
 first thing we have to do is put 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.329
 the oven to preheat to 170 degrees with 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.190
 Carlos above and below to 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.610
 then we put the butter in 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.990
 a container we add sugar 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.990
 and vanilla sugar 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.770
 and let's beat those that are very well 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770
 integrated 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.080
 that are well integrated we add the 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.310
 egg 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.310
 and we beat again 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.690
 once the egg is integrated we are going to 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.740
 mix to wheat flour 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.740
 the yeast 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:46.119
 and the salt and how they heard from 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.860
 transfer and we also mix the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.860
 Vanilla essence with milk 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.150
 and now to the master we had we are going to 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.840
 add half of this mixture 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.840
 sifting the first 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.870
 and half of the milk and the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.580
 vanilla 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.580
 and we went to beat it 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.210
 we do the same with half 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.050
 what we have left 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.050
 Hahaha 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.510
 we already have everything well mixed though 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.280
 you do not need to beat excessively once 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.080
 that we already have it, we are going to add three 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.319
 quarters of the chocolate that what 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.220
 we cut into smaller pieces 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.220
 we add the dough 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.719
 and we are going to add the fruits 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.150
 reds that we're also going to add to you just 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:47.629
 three fourths 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.610
 and we went to mix it carefully for 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.610
 that the red straight fruits do not split 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.800
 we already have everything mixed and we have 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.900
 prepared the tray in which we are going to 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.940
 make our muffins in a tray 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.220
 for cupcakes and muffins where we have 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.290
 put some capsules if you do not have the 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.600
 tray you can put two capsules like this 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.430
 joined so they do not open if you want 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.810
 know is model pans using what 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.060
 I'll leave it down on a link the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.620
 description and now with a utensil 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.240
 like this one to make ice cream tails 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.690
 let's fill the capsules 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.800
 let's try to catch on each one 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.230
 red fruits and white chocolate and so 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.310
 we are going to fill capsules until 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.310
 we finished the base 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.500
 we have already filled all the capsules and 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.720
 Now let's put over what 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.910
 we had saved that is a bit of 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.970
 White chocolate 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.610
 and a red fruit and so we are going to do with 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.950
 everyone 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.600
 our muffins are ready and as 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.900
 he is not preheated we are going to put 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.900
 the already 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.680
 imitola with more purpose this money we do not go 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.700
 to wash the pots so that after 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.700
 mothers do not get angry 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.110
 in my case, half an hour has passed and 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.030
 done so let's take it out let's 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.400
 check what they are made we put a 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.290
 stick and as you can see comes clean 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.030
 so let's wait a bit for that 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.400
 cool down and get them out of the 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.229
 tray have already cooled we have 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.810
 taken from the tray and I've made some 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.690
 presentation suggestions are ideal 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.580
 for any party and I've also 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.350
