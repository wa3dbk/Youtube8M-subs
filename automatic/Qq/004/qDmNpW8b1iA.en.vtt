00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
post another set of tutorials same thing

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
post another set of tutorials same thing
with<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.890> Pelican<00:00:59.309> once<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.420> finished

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
with the Pelican once I finished

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.590 
with the Pelican once I finished
uploading<00:01:01.020> everything<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.770> did<00:01:01.949> some<00:01:02.600> drastic

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
uploading everything I did some drastic

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.289 
uploading everything I did some drastic
changes<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.519> it's<00:01:05.519> still<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> base<00:01:05.939> same

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
changes to it it's still the base same

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.230 
changes to it it's still the base same
basic<00:01:06.479> design<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:08.189> probably<00:01:08.790> post<00:01:09.090> another

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
basic design so I probably post another

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.560 
basic design so I probably post another
video<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.979> updates<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.330> other

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
video on the updates and then in other

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.280

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
set of tutorials and oh yeah so does it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.660 
set of tutorials and oh yeah so does it
before<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.860> does<00:01:17.189> anybody<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.580> how

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
before I do that does anybody know how

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.429 
before I do that does anybody know how
to<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:17.850> rid<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> black<00:01:18.479> bars<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> side

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
to get rid of the black bars on the side

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
to get rid of the black bars on the side
of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> screen<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:21.000> can't<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.780> my

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
of the screen I can't see it in my

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.080 
of the screen I can't see it in my
camera<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.409> definitely<00:01:22.950> shows<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
camera but it definitely shows up in the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.910 
camera but it definitely shows up in the
uploading<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.500> annoying<00:01:25.740> because

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
uploading it's really annoying because

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.230 
uploading it's really annoying because
it<00:01:26.070> makes<00:01:26.189> everything<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.700> seek<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.060> lot

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
it makes everything you seek a lot

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.420 
it makes everything you seek a lot
thinner<00:01:27.600> than<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.140> real<00:01:28.350> life<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:29.159> I'm

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
thinner than is in real life as I'm

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.330 
thinner than is in real life as I'm
saying<00:01:29.960> my<00:01:30.960> aspect<00:01:31.320> ratio<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.890> I'm<00:01:32.009> filming

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
saying my aspect ratio that I'm filming

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060 
saying my aspect ratio that I'm filming
with<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> 16<00:01:32.939> by<00:01:33.060> 9<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.659> try<00:01:34.259> changing<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> 4<00:01:34.950> by

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
with a 16 by 9 I try changing it to 4 by

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.359 
with a 16 by 9 I try changing it to 4 by
3<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.579> makes<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:36.450> worse<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.369> i

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
3 that just makes it a lot worse and i

those<00:01:40.619> black<00:01:40.799> bars<00:01:41.009> i'm<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.369> wanting<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
those black bars i'm just wanting how to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.429 
those black bars i'm just wanting how to
get<00:01:41.880> rid<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.150> them<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.329> anybody<00:01:43.079> knows<00:01:43.229> how<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
get rid of them if anybody knows how to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.380 
get rid of them if anybody knows how to
tell<00:01:43.770> me<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.700> would<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.750> helpful<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
tell me that would be really helpful and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.060 
tell me that would be really helpful and
then<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.880> i'm<00:01:50.939> thinking<00:01:51.000> after<00:01:51.890> after<00:01:52.890> i'm

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
then so i'm thinking after after i'm

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.889 
then so i'm thinking after after i'm
done<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:54.270> everything<00:01:54.630> else<00:01:54.780> will

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
done with the is everything else will

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.719 
done with the is everything else will
probably<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.229> back<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> head<00:01:58.729> who's

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
probably get back of the head who's

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.440 
probably get back of the head who's
calling<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.119> now<00:02:01.909> hello<00:02:03.920> hey<00:02:04.920> um<00:02:05.460> dude<00:02:06.210> can't

and<00:03:14.060> my<00:03:14.930> heartbeat<00:03:15.530> sensor<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.850> next<00:03:17.150> what<00:03:17.330> I'm

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
and my heartbeat sensor so next what I'm

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.840 
and my heartbeat sensor so next what I'm
doing<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.920> at<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.070> time<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.280> made<00:03:19.490> a<00:03:19.520> grenade
