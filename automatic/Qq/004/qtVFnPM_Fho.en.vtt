00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.260
 Palestine 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.300
 Palestine is one of the best countries in the world 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.400
 Palestine is the plain, the mountain and the vegetables 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.900
 All are on mee 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.000
 Where all religions 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.200
 Where civilization has culture 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.350
 Where all my walk 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.650
 Let me introduce you to the story of Palestine and the occupation 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.010
 Married to some 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.840
 So you are thinking of occupying Palestine 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.910
 Saab Ano thinks about the aesthetic things in it 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.800
 Palestine is not related to the occupation 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.600
 With the hymn 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.730
 Israel 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.990
 The settlers 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.630
 For the invasion of Bethlehem and the siege of the Church of the Nativity 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.000
 I am a unit of people who have 40 days I was in the house 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.100
 But I came to psychological cases, I do not tell 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.900
 I did not have the power to tell 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.000
 Of the fear I have lived 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.100
 I am sure that many people lived 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.400
 So I have problems 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.900
 Stories and occupation a lot 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.620
 And his death destroys me 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.610
 I do not need to be destroyed 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.670
 I have a positive energy reverse 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.600
 And against the challenge of concern 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.670
 Because I have a lot of problems 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.900
 But I am a fanatic theater 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.090
 The army can serve as a violin for a year 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.500
 But I'm down in the place 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.400
 When dancing 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.900
 If I'm what I mean 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.300
 By death 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.800
 But the Bedouin theater is against Israel's policy 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.900
 Or in a community tradition you are against 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.500
 You are in the theater exposed 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.900
 Certainly the power is not necessarily the ruling power 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.900
 Even as a religious authority as a community authority 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.610
 Kamen fights Hada Ashi 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.700
 I am the one who connects his message 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.730
 Lee threw a stone at the street 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.140
 He is the artist who creates music for the stone 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.090
 Who is making a play for the stone 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.800
 I'm right 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.020
 Hai resistance and resistance Hai is important 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.500
 Because they have lost our culture, they have lost us in our culture by stealing it 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.650
 So we did not prove that 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.800
 Let us bathe 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.640
 not important 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.070
 You are a big actor 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.900
 Hollywood Star is not important 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.150
 We have a revolution in the sense of the word 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.100
 Revolution Revolution 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.900
 If you believe in it, welcome my beloved 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.050
 So I did not choose to deal with the political issue 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.060
 With political art as an artist and as an actor 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.900
 But rather imposed on me 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.640
 I'm in ways of having a social problem on stage 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.100
 I wrote social texts 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.200
 It has to do with politics 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.990
 Father killed 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.300
 My uncle was martyred 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.900
 My mother's mother was martyred 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.010
 My neighbors have cited many of them 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.050
 In the people of the great Sahabi martyred 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.300
 In Kater Sahaby prison 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.400
 But I am not better than them 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.300
 Why do people not martyred? 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.200
 Why Mato? 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.900
 Because they are the Doru on their freedom 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.200
 And freedom of their homeland 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.620
 So I need to complete their message 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.400
 And he completed the lechemis, which were the waters of Kano. 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.670
 Documentary film under production 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.660
 Crew and interviews 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.010
 Director and producer 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.400
 The soundtrack of the film 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:13.040
 Support the struggle
