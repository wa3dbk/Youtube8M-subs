round<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.960> little<00:00:10.200> bit<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.530> it's<00:00:11.130> wavy<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
round a little bit it it's wavy in the

round a little bit it it's wavy in the
in<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.660> horizontal<00:00:13.590> plane<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.429> I'm<00:00:14.519> going<00:00:14.670> to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
in the horizontal plane so I'm going to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.330 
in the horizontal plane so I'm going to
turn<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.590> and<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:16.710> I'm<00:00:16.800> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> do<00:00:17.130> is

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
turn this on and what I'm going to do is

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
turn this on and what I'm going to do is
true<00:00:17.670> up<00:00:17.910> or<00:00:18.240> round<00:00:18.570> off<00:00:22.910> again<00:00:23.910> notice<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.480> have

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
true up or round off again notice I have

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.290 
true up or round off again notice I have
my<00:00:25.109> hatin<00:00:25.650> by<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.800> heel<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.430> side<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.119> my

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
my hatin by the heel or the side of my

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.750 
my hatin by the heel or the side of my
hand<00:00:27.599> resting<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> tool<00:00:28.920> rest<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.640> I'm

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
hand resting on the tool rest and I'm

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.690 
hand resting on the tool rest and I'm
moving<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> tool<00:00:31.050> by<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.590> gripping<00:00:34.700> there

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
moving the tool by just gripping there

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.639 
moving the tool by just gripping there
now<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.329> trued<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
now that's all trued up and one of the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.580 
now that's all trued up and one of the
reasons<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.160> chose<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.760> shape<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> can

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
reasons I chose this shape is so I can

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.639 
reasons I chose this shape is so I can
show<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.860> how<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.489> cutter<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.149> go<00:00:45.360> back<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
show you how this cutter can go back and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.160 
show you how this cutter can go back and
in<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.910> let<00:00:48.059> me<00:00:48.149> take<00:00:48.300> another<00:00:48.600> relatively

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
in so let me take another relatively

00:00:49.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
in so let me take another relatively
aggressive<00:00:49.500> cut

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.880 

by<00:01:06.640> pushing<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.270> articulated<00:01:08.049> arm<00:01:08.320> out<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:08.590> can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
by pushing the articulated arm out I can

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:17.010 
by pushing the articulated arm out I can
approach<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.580> bowl<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.509> as<00:01:16.659> you<00:01:16.840> can<00:01:16.960> probably

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
approach the bowl so as you can probably

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.609 
approach the bowl so as you can probably
see<00:01:17.740> what<00:01:17.890> I'm<00:01:18.009> doing<00:01:18.369> is<00:01:19.030> I'm<00:01:19.270> following<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
see what I'm doing is I'm following the

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.580 
see what I'm doing is I'm following the
contour<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.340> outside<00:01:21.930> contour<00:01:22.930> of<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.409> bowl

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
contour the outside contour of the bowl

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.680 
contour the outside contour of the bowl
I'm<00:01:24.250> gonna<00:01:24.399> put<00:01:24.850> this<00:01:24.940> little<00:01:25.179> light<00:01:25.390> down

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
I'm gonna put this little light down

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.590 
I'm gonna put this little light down
here<00:01:26.140> so<00:01:26.679> perhaps<00:01:26.920> you<00:01:27.190> can<00:01:27.340> see<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:28.000> little

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
here so perhaps you can see it a little

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.520 
here so perhaps you can see it a little
bit<00:01:29.080> better<00:01:30.179> that<00:01:31.179> untangled<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:35.170> is<00:01:35.350> my

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
bit better that untangled this is my

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.570 
bit better that untangled this is my
favorite<00:01:35.950> little<00:01:36.069> work<00:01:36.340> light<00:01:40.200> here<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.259> has<00:01:41.380> a

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
favorite little work light here it has a

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.850 
favorite little work light here it has a
magnetic<00:01:42.810> base<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.319> I<00:01:44.380> don't<00:01:44.560> want<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:44.770> to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
magnetic base on and I don't want it to

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.919 
magnetic base on and I don't want it to
be<00:01:45.009> in<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.190> way<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.580> arms<00:01:45.970> let<00:01:46.569> me<00:01:46.659> try<00:01:46.899> it

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
be in the way of the arms let me try it

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.300 
be in the way of the arms let me try it
up<00:01:47.080> here<00:01:47.319> again<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:49.560> will<00:01:50.560> light<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.159> up

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
up here again that will light it up

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.350 
up here again that will light it up
quite<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.580> bit

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.290 

right<00:01:56.050> now<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.290> piece<00:01:56.980> of<00:01:57.190> work<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.700> spinning

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
right now the piece of work is spinning

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:07.470 
right now the piece of work is spinning
at<00:01:58.540> about<00:01:59.500> 1300<00:02:00.340> rpm<00:02:05.820> as<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:06.970> can<00:02:07.120> see<00:02:07.330> it

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
at about 1300 rpm as you can see it

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.150 
at about 1300 rpm as you can see it
right<00:02:07.660> now<00:02:07.840> I'm<00:02:08.050> using<00:02:08.229> my<00:02:08.560> hand<00:02:08.800> as<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.070> is

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
right now I'm using my hand as it is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.430 
right now I'm using my hand as it is
like<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.369> pivot<00:02:09.820> point<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.360> my<00:02:10.570> right<00:02:10.840> hand<00:02:11.170> is

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
like a pivot point and my right hand is

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.740 
like a pivot point and my right hand is
just<00:02:11.650> pushing<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.820> nice<00:02:13.030> thing<00:02:13.300> about<00:02:13.330> this

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
just pushing the nice thing about this

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.500 
just pushing the nice thing about this
system<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.370> establish<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> pivot

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
system is is that you establish a pivot

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.190 
system is is that you establish a pivot
point<00:02:16.540> here<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.400> push<00:02:18.730> your<00:02:19.450> hand<00:02:19.750> here

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
point here and you push your hand here

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.270 
point here and you push your hand here
and<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.920> makes<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.340> quite<00:02:22.030> easy<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:23.070> shape<00:02:24.070> a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
and it makes it quite easy to shape a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:03:15.250 
and it makes it quite easy to shape a
bowl<00:02:24.730> most<00:02:25.090> especially<00:02:25.420> may<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.230> platter

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:24.280 

perhaps<00:03:16.260> being<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.680> little<00:03:16.950> over-aggressive

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.290 

you<00:03:25.290> can<00:03:25.470> see<00:03:25.710> I'm<00:03:25.890> following<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
you can see I'm following the the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.470 
you can see I'm following the the
interior<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.110> curve<00:03:29.070> of<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
interior this curve of that the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:51.470 
interior this curve of that the
workpiece<00:03:49.400> now<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.459> can<00:03:50.640> imagine<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:51.330> this

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
workpiece now you can imagine if this

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.110 
workpiece now you can imagine if this
were<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> deep<00:03:52.350> form<00:03:53.100> such<00:03:53.489> as<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.670> flower<00:03:53.970> vase

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
were a deep form such as a flower vase

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.510 
were a deep form such as a flower vase
or<00:03:54.570> something<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:55.530> would<00:03:55.650> be<00:03:55.800> able<00:03:56.070> to<00:03:56.190> push

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
or something you would be able to push

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.800 
or something you would be able to push
this<00:03:56.790> down<00:03:57.500> inside<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.060> vessel<00:04:00.480> that

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
this down inside of the the vessel that

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.020 
this down inside of the the vessel that
you're<00:04:00.989> turning<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.680> you'd<00:04:02.250> be<00:04:02.430> able<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.820> bore

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
you're turning and you'd be able to bore

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.000 
you're turning and you'd be able to bore
it<00:04:03.120> out<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.140> vessel<00:04:04.440> too<00:04:04.800> it's

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
it out this is this is a vessel too it's

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.740 
it out this is this is a vessel too it's
just<00:04:05.190> obviously<00:04:05.730> shorter<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:06.420> can<00:04:06.570> see

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
just obviously shorter so you can see

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.650 
just obviously shorter so you can see
inside<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.610> what<00:04:08.610> what<00:04:08.880> is<00:04:09.030> still<00:04:09.420> under

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
inside of it what what is still under

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.900 
inside of it what what is still under
development<00:04:10.140> with<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:10.590> articulated<00:04:11.370> arm<00:04:11.640> is

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
development with this articulated arm is

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.840 
development with this articulated arm is
the<00:04:12.360> laser<00:04:12.630> system<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.530> what<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.310> does<00:04:14.550> is

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
the laser system and what that does is

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.690 
the laser system and what that does is
there's<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.380> bar<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.410> goes<00:04:16.739> across<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.400> top

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
there's a bar that goes across the top

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.990 
there's a bar that goes across the top
and<00:04:18.299> shines<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.350> laser<00:04:19.830> down<00:04:20.100> by<00:04:20.370> adjusting<00:04:20.880> the

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
and shines a laser down by adjusting the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.390 
and shines a laser down by adjusting the
bar<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:22.080> shine<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.410> laser<00:04:22.770> little<00:04:23.220> laser

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
bar you you shine a laser little laser

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.060 
bar you you shine a laser little laser
dot<00:04:23.729> right<00:04:24.000> on<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.240> cutter<00:04:24.510> edge<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.080> then

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
dot right on the cutter edge and then

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.050 
dot right on the cutter edge and then
once<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.400> is<00:04:26.729> established<00:04:27.090> then<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:27.900> offset

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
once that is established then you offset

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.240 
once that is established then you offset
the<00:04:30.060> laser<00:04:30.330> from<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.900> cutter<00:04:31.140> edge<00:04:31.800> by<00:04:32.190> the

the laser from the cutter edge by the
the<00:04:32.880> amount<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.270> wall<00:04:33.479> thickness<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:34.080> you

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
the amount of wall thickness that you

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.560 
the amount of wall thickness that you
want<00:04:34.260> in<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.830> bowl<00:04:35.040> because<00:04:35.760> remember<00:04:36.390> that

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
want in the bowl because remember that

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.290 
want in the bowl because remember that
when<00:04:36.720> you're<00:04:36.870> doing<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.410> deep<00:04:37.650> form<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:39.030> cutter

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
when you're doing a deep form the cutter

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.830 
when you're doing a deep form the cutter
tip<00:04:39.630> is<00:04:39.870> down<00:04:40.140> inside<00:04:40.380> of<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:42.120> form<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.690> you

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
tip is down inside of the form and you

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.600 
tip is down inside of the form and you
can't<00:04:43.080> see<00:04:43.410> really<00:04:43.650> what's<00:04:43.919> going<00:04:44.130> on<00:04:44.340> you're

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
can't see really what's going on you're

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.270 
can't see really what's going on you're
cutting<00:04:45.000> by<00:04:45.150> field<00:04:45.510> more<00:04:45.810> so<00:04:46.050> than<00:04:47.010> anything

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
cutting by field more so than anything

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.760 
cutting by field more so than anything
else<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:48.180> know<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.960> could<00:04:49.169> look<00:04:49.320> down<00:04:49.530> in

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
else you know you could look down in

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.900 
else you know you could look down in
there<00:04:49.950> but<00:04:50.100> you're<00:04:50.220> not<00:04:50.280> going<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.550> see<00:04:50.700> much

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
there but you're not going to see much

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.280 
there but you're not going to see much
because<00:04:51.120> it's<00:04:51.419> just<00:04:51.600> probably<00:04:51.900> going<00:04:52.140> to<00:04:52.200> be

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
because it's just probably going to be

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.370 
because it's just probably going to be
full<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.530> chips<00:04:53.540> so<00:04:54.540> by<00:04:54.690> using<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:55.140> laser

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
full of chips so by using that laser

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.409 
full of chips so by using that laser
offset<00:04:56.130> from<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.400> cutter<00:04:56.640> tip<00:04:56.940> say<00:04:57.240> by<00:04:57.390> a

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
offset from the cutter tip say by a

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.350 
offset from the cutter tip say by a
quarter<00:04:57.810> of<00:04:57.900> an<00:04:58.020> inch<00:04:58.169> or<00:04:58.470> 3/8<00:04:58.919> or<00:04:59.190> 1/8<00:05:00.180> or

wall<00:05:03.210> thicknesses<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:04.140> just<00:05:04.919> actually<00:05:05.130> watch

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
wall thicknesses you just actually watch

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.940 
wall thicknesses you just actually watch
the<00:05:05.880> laser<00:05:06.120> dot<00:05:06.479> shining<00:05:07.020> on<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.260> outside<00:05:07.740> of

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
the bowl here and then as the laser

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.000 
the bowl here and then as the laser
drops<00:05:11.910> off<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.570> means<00:05:12.810> you're<00:05:13.050> getting<00:05:13.830> the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
drops off that means you're getting the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.440 
drops off that means you're getting the
thinner<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.430> thinner<00:05:14.580> wall<00:05:14.880> and<00:05:15.090> as<00:05:15.180> soon<00:05:15.360> as

the laser drops off the edge that tells

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.120 
the laser drops off the edge that tells
you<00:05:18.720> that<00:05:18.750> you've<00:05:19.110> reached<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.650> offset

extremely extremely well it is so easy
to<00:05:34.230> control<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:34.890> is<00:05:35.010> just<00:05:35.190> much<00:05:35.430> much<00:05:36.090> easier

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
to control it is just much much easier

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.080 
to control it is just much much easier
to<00:05:36.900> do<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.920> can<00:05:38.070> see<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.430> range<00:05:38.670> of<00:05:38.880> motion

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
to do you can see the range of motion

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.520 
to do you can see the range of motion
that<00:05:39.540> I<00:05:39.720> have<00:05:40.110> with<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.530> cutter<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:42.260> the<00:05:43.260> fact

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
that I have with the cutter and the fact

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.620 
that I have with the cutter and the fact
that<00:05:43.650> it's<00:05:43.830> resting<00:05:44.280> here<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:44.970> off<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:45.540> the

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
that it's resting here and off to the

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.480 
that it's resting here and off to the
right<00:05:45.840> out<00:05:45.870> of<00:05:46.110> camera<00:05:46.470> range<00:05:46.620> at<00:05:47.040> the<00:05:47.070> pivot

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
right out of camera range at the pivot

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.340 
right out of camera range at the pivot
point<00:05:47.540> just<00:05:48.540> makes<00:05:48.780> it<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.170> much<00:05:49.320> easier<00:05:49.380> to

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
point just makes it so much easier to

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.530 
point just makes it so much easier to
control<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.710> cuts<00:05:52.980> just<00:05:53.310> another<00:05:54.150> minute<00:05:54.480> or

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
control the cuts just another minute or
