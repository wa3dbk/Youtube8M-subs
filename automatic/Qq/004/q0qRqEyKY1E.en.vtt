beautiful man I mean those textures
probably<00:03:38.850> have<00:03:39.170> 4000<00:03:40.170> peaks<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.560> did<00:03:40.769> that's

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
probably have 4000 peaks of did that's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.759 
probably have 4000 peaks of did that's
the<00:03:41.549> double<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.390> biggest<00:03:42.750> one<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.170> are

the double of the biggest one and are

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.720 
the double of the biggest one and are
con<00:03:44.010> artists<00:03:44.400> for<00:03:44.549> example<00:03:45.319> it's<00:03:46.319> incredible

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
incredibly detailed in each particle in

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
incredibly detailed in each particle in
