 first presentation diane phaneuf the company 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:16.270
 fifty-five Swiss border she crushes her so rich shot if it gets 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.710
 repeat marca on her website 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.849
 these 600 meters out of 6 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.499
 las we will be able to attend exclusive first round the world 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:32.820
 on the circuit 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.160
 before the first financial sector development tests do not 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.330
 do not know why but it's almost as though it's really 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 attended a super Mass 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.670
 each new 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.020
 reminder this maturity 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.510
 motorized by two motors 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.510
 siemens and last generation saft batteries 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.270
 remarkable 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.320
 that's done is done 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.670
 this prototype in front of you this racing prototype 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.400
 absolutely gorgeous years 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 in alcantara and years 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.290
 digital 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.860
 in mid-February 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.850
 comforting carbon person does not speak 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.850
 the prototype definitely no extra 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 with marked on it at the origin of the project 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.549
 it reveals more this magic console and laval the development console of 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.509
 ares 1 and orion in the secret of the gods we are really on the 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.570
 development consoles of the most mythical of races so as to 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.260
 to be able to change cartography 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.420
 originally 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.820
 even for a period of energy years of braking separation 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.890
 the safest 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.720
 the command mode 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.920
 mapping different models of bankruptcy filing as 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.740
 obviously 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.730
 to change the name of the disciplinary committee 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.280
 for eric kuby development cecile duflot week normally shows the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.859
 youth 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.719
 the services of the highways do not allow the levy either 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.020
 to say everything they touch our action 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.010
 berthelot engine 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.070
 gearbox 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.700
 he died in peace 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.920
 all together energy packaging we learned that I still have a lot 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.819
 working 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.480
 so for me either and what I put it on the plane of 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.359
 test development 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.609
 who are most apt to compete both stand up plan during this 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.450
 request leads 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.029
 performing 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:22.930
 energy savings 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.869
 there are several prototypes of development 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:26.079
 a meeting 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.779
 what about the precious liquid 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.030
 in addition to the triple of two pre-set points 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.659
 which allows us to 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.129
 to work with m 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.040
 with Micheline 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.649
 for all they have for sole purpose as modifications 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:39.549
 the controls from far away in the focus 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.219
 of course I understood that it was development but already yesterday 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.669
 a search of style inside it is wanted it is the chance 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.719
 can not we hit the hexagon is the crisis I think we 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:50.859
 ask me 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.160
 trichet the old continent 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
 before this case of all 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.759
 everything will be seen again the sun of lead 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.019
 Jean Claude 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.959
 transparency we complete rental vehicle 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.299
 we do not know what to do 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.299
 at least that's what matters to me 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.369
 in Turkey 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.079
 I developed this film is going 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.889
 it is very very rare that the builders 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.309
 why at this point 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.629
 to break the charge of the batteries really went 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.769
 and there how long will it take for a full charge it's a 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.029
 quick charger the bouletterie 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.759
 that means what is the minute thirty minutes where everyone 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.150
 string quartet from the primary 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.589
 North Korea 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.589
 but I also read about a sports car like that 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:43.400
 the oldest
