00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.220
 two 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:15.000
 and what for the pole is the gti for the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.580
 citroÃ«n ds3 is the racing now came out at 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.690
 market a cabriolet edition limited to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.760
 100 units 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.369
 well it's not a real cabriolet 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.099
 because the sidebars remain 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.710
 but as compensation the roof can 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.189
 open quickly also walking 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.189
 Quick 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.250
 the enjoyment in summer is then unlimited 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.860
 almost none of its competitors offers 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.280
 a convertible version and less so 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.280
 impetuous 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.580
 the 1.6-liter engine has 152 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.780
 kilowatts of power acceleration in 65 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.680
 seconds from 0 to 100 maximum speed 235 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.680
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.640
 The DS3 is fast it also takes well 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.810
 curves the potential has it but it demands 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.810
 a firm hand 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.350
 there is always a problem in cars 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.440
 powerful with front-wheel drive also 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.330
 in this when you accelerate the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.450
 engine vibrations feel 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.060
 strongly in the direction that's not 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.060
 It happens with full or rear traction 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.150
 The design of DS3 is beautiful also in 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.940
 the convertible variant the normal ds3 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.490
 it's very customizable, not like that 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.240
 cabriolet only offered in color moon 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.240
 dark matt 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.870
 the design is highlighted with many parts 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.990
 carbon is the unusual gate 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.990
 trunk 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.480
 when you want to load something in the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.000
 trunk with open roof 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.120
 you need patience first you have to go up 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.310
 the canvas and only then can the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.730
 trunk mannequins power trunk 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.610
 It has a volume of 245 liters but 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.290
 loading it is not easy has a mouth 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.290
 small and little comfortable 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.120
 before loading something in the trunk is 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.120
 better to close the roof is cooler 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.090
 the uncovered roof has a disadvantage 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.420
 during the march you see little towards the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.420
 saga 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.670
 with the roof open you can not see 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.190
 much backwards either turning the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.350
 head but the mirrors on the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.990
 sides and the large windows 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.690
 reduce the problem and get stuck in adas 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.330
 on 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.490
 in fast corners you have to look at 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.580
 Either way especially towards 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.770
 forward the ds3 is very dynamic in 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.770
 road and supports the driver well 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.100
 the seats I like have great 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.740
 grip the side and the sides are not 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.100
 very hard to say that when you are more 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.100
 width 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.040
 The only thing that does not convince me is the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.460
 seat surface relatively 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.460
 short 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.300
 also in the passenger compartment we find the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.300
 color of the outside and a lot of carbon 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.460
 the sound of the engine impresses 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.989
 with the roof running the sound of the engine 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.780
 you experience more intensely the 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.780
 racing takes its name seriously accelerates 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.900
 quickly takes curves well and has 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.330
 a very dynamic gearbox only the 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.630
 address leaves something to be desired in the 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.630
 curves 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.600
 It's nice to walk with the TS 3 racing 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.639
 cabriolet however I would not pay 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.720
 so much for a car in which the factor 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:05:01.670
 fun far exceeds its usefulness 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:04.280
 price in germany 38 thousand 490 euros no 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.310
 it's little but exclusivity has its 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.800
 price also the enjoyment of driving can 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.370
 push to buy it who wants 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.930
 exclusivity sportsmanship and design can 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.930
 Fall in love with DS3
