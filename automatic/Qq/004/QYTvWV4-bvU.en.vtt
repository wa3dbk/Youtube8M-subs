00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello today we are going to make a video in 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.269
 the one that I'm going to give you a little bit about 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.099
 of my three most recent readings and 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.019
 Well, I'm going to recommend what 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.969
 I was reading and I will tell you a bit about what 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 it is the first of these books that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 I read it was sense and sensitivity that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.020
 I received at Christmas as a gift from friends 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.189
 and I think a friend and on camera and well 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.920
 that the vision I loved from the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.810
 principle and I decided to embark on this 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.750
 length this is a book by jane austen 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.960
 so we know it's from a time 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.120
 oldest and such and that is romance 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.219
 in this case we see the story of two 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.260
 sisters leonor and median as the title 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.570
 I made him feel sensitivity one of them 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 represents meaning and other sensitivity 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.890
 for her Marian ways of thinking is 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.210
 passionate fashions more impulsive is left 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.100
 carry a lot for their emotions and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.500
 drag by them which not many 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 Sometimes it is very prudent and instead if not 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.250
 it is the opposite always always think 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.500
 in the consequences of their actions and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 on how to behave 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.910
 and she is very smart and she is always at 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 so much of everything not then in this book 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.840
 we see how it already faces many 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.450
 difficulties to get to find a 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.400
 happy ending are voted from your home in the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.350
 who lived for someone who comes to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.869
 claim the inheritance and then they have 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.150
 to live somewhere else and get used to 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.550
 to new people and that's when 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.530
 romance arises not now is it going to be a 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.360
 romance with many stumbles and then 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.590
 good they will have to work hard to 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.229
 come to a final crisis so that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.350
 I want this is a book this is a book 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.840
 which I recommend to many people that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.430
 have already read classics can suddenly 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.290
 be very good to start reading joe 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.140
 johnston in the case you have not read 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.780
 many classics before I recommend seeing the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.910
 movie first and suddenly leave it a 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.030
 I'll spend more time and read the book later 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.860
 so the pesadito language is not 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.869
 a lot but in general this one is more 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.780
 I know that 'pride and prejudice' to me 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.850
 seem and well I recommend it 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 the second book I read was the study 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.360
 Scarlet by Sherlock Holmes and then 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.330
 good the books of sherlock holmes 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.420
 many times they are half rare because there are 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.160
 adventures and there are novels and if you do not know 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.259
 well how are they structured can you 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.660
 lose a little bit not the first one that starts 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.489
 to all of Sherlock Holmes is this the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.860
 study in scarlet and then come the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.110
 adventures and then another novel and so on 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.790
 so it is something complex of which I 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.620
 would like to delve deeper into another video 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.569
 about how to read sherlock holmes and 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.459
 why do I also received this one 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.800
 for Christmas and it's about the first 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.470
 adventure that have watson and sherlock 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.130
 together here we see why it is that watson 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.320
 start writing the stories that 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.300
 live with Sherlock Holmes and how does 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.519
 they know because they end up living together and 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.190
 the first case they solve while being 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.920
 together and well it's a very book 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.450
 interesting you see how you get to know 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.160
 really to sherlock holmes and you give 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.739
 account of the first impressions that 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.569
 watson leaves you can see a guasÃ³n 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.000
 trying to decipher a little what he 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.130
 does because basso initially has no 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.290
 no idea what makes you crazy 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.150
 and like trying to discover it himself 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.640
 and decode a little his personality and 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.730
 that's very interesting this book does not 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.080
 is very long and that accompanies the crime or 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.030
 be the story that combines crime 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.700
 so he is very very interesting is situated 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.190
 a point in history that gives a lot for 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.410
 talk so I 'm very interesting and the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.090
 last or the most recent that I read is the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.820
 ocean at the end of the audiovision street 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.040
 I attend lane become lima you know 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.050
 I love the nest a lot because it is 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.020
 guy is amazing I do not know where I got 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.240
 these ideas I swear to you this is a blog 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.750
 that talks about childhood and 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.580
 how a child happens to be an adult and of 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.890
 many things that probably do not 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.450
 we remember now and it speaks to you of the 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.210
 childhood in a beautiful way and the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.370
 capture perfectly and well this is a 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.470
 sci-fi book the genre in the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.110
 game in the story is about a 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.480
 adult who after a funeral goes to the 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.430
 house where he lived when he was little 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.620
 and then memory in his childhood 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.570
 begin to come to mind and those 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.310
 memories take him to visit the farm 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.770
 of the hamsters that is at the end of the 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.740
 way and remember 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.080
 and that at that time I did not think possible 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.600
 that had really happened and then 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.270
 then they take us to the point of view 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.910
 of him when he was a child and they tell us 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.860
 those wonderful and strange things 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.350
 that happened on the farm of the 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:26.190
 hamsters and because of his childhood is a 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.830
 beautiful book is science fiction of the 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.620
 powerful is super super good and is 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.210
 cortito can find the pdf internet

 translated they can read it in English that 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.820
 It is very good and it is something that 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.380
 like much editing is that the leaves 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.500
 they are cut unevenly not 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.230
 so that gives it a special aspect not 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.000
 the part of his character he quoted and 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.160
