training for endurance a trend for
strength<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.250> know<00:01:49.340> what<00:01:49.490> do<00:01:49.550> I<00:01:49.640> want<00:01:49.730> to<00:01:49.850> be

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
strength you know what do I want to be

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.120 
strength you know what do I want to be
doing<00:01:50.230> anatomy<00:01:51.230> so<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.440> know<00:01:51.560> which<00:01:51.710> muscles

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
doing anatomy so you know which muscles

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.220 
doing anatomy so you know which muscles
you're<00:01:52.220> using<00:01:52.550> when<00:01:52.850> all<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.840> recovery

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
you're using when all the recovery

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.480 
you're using when all the recovery
principles<00:01:54.680> whether<00:01:55.010> it's<00:01:55.190> just<00:01:55.310> from<00:01:55.430> the

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
principles whether it's just from the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.300 
principles whether it's just from the
session<00:01:55.790> or<00:01:55.940> from<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.120> major<00:01:56.510> injury<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.310> even

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
session or from a major injury and even

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.800 
session or from a major injury and even
the<00:01:58.370> neurological<00:01:58.820> rehab<00:01:59.150> we<00:01:59.270> do<00:01:59.420> for<00:01:59.630> stroke

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the neurological rehab we do for stroke

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.600 
the neurological rehab we do for stroke
has<00:02:00.020> elements<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.680> transfer<00:02:01.220> across<00:02:01.430> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
has elements that transfer across the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.800 
has elements that transfer across the
training<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.090> everything<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.630> really

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
training and everything is really

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.980 
training and everything is really
helpful<00:02:03.740> for<00:02:04.130> trying<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.790> help<00:02:05.420> your<00:02:05.600> track

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
helpful for trying to help your track

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.960 
helpful for trying to help your track
and<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.320> think<00:02:06.530> Chuck<00:02:06.740> also<00:02:07.070> sometimes<00:02:07.700> brings

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
and I think Chuck also sometimes brings

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.340 
and I think Chuck also sometimes brings
across<00:02:08.210> things<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.540> have<00:02:08.960> made<00:02:08.990> study

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
across things that have made study

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.290 
across things that have made study
easier<00:02:09.740> as<00:02:09.860> well<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.490> I<00:02:10.730> think<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:11.090> having

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
easier as well and I think that having

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.840 
easier as well and I think that having
that<00:02:11.420> outside<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.380> track<00:02:13.190> there's<00:02:13.460> something

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
that outside of track there's something

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.820 
that outside of track there's something
to<00:02:13.940> look<00:02:14.060> forward<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:14.630> well<00:02:14.830> definitely

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
to look forward to as well definitely

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.890 
to look forward to as well definitely
helps<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.070> balance<00:02:16.190> your<00:02:16.430> life<00:02:16.520> out<00:02:16.810> being<00:02:17.810> a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
helps you balance your life out being a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.150 
helps you balance your life out being a
swimmer<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.230> guess<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.560> need<00:02:18.710> access<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
swimmer I guess you need access to the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.150 
swimmer I guess you need access to the
pool<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.900> having<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:20.990> travel<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.830> get<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:21.980> a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
pool and having to travel to get to a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160 
pool and having to travel to get to a
pools<00:02:22.490> a<00:02:22.610> train<00:02:22.850> it's<00:02:23.120> just<00:02:23.420> makes<00:02:23.870> them<00:02:24.020> so

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
pools a train it's just makes them so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.690 
pools a train it's just makes them so
much<00:02:24.260> more<00:02:24.440> convenient<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.430> fact<00:02:25.640> that

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
much more convenient and the fact that

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.230 
much more convenient and the fact that
it's<00:02:25.910> also<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:27.080> an<00:02:27.230> Olympic<00:02:27.590> standard<00:02:27.830> size

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
it's also of an Olympic standard size

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.580 
it's also of an Olympic standard size
that<00:02:29.240> 50<00:02:29.540> meter<00:02:29.720> really<00:02:30.200> gives<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.410> the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
that 50 meter really gives you the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.190 
that 50 meter really gives you the
advantage<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.130> training<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:31.900> know<00:02:32.900> when<00:02:33.080> I've

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
advantage and training so know when I've

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.950 
advantage and training so know when I've
got<00:02:33.380> two<00:02:33.860> hours<00:02:34.040> in<00:02:34.310> between<00:02:34.400> my<00:02:35.240> lectures<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
got two hours in between my lectures and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.440 
got two hours in between my lectures and
my<00:02:36.020> practice<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.590> know<00:02:36.740> I'm<00:02:37.270> straight<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
my practice you know I'm straight to the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.030 
my practice you know I'm straight to the
car<00:02:38.630> grab<00:02:38.960> my<00:02:39.110> stuff<00:02:39.290> straight<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.830> pool

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
the Paralympic Games in November I was

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.050 
the Paralympic Games in November I was
lucky<00:03:16.950> enough<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.460> part<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> team

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
lucky enough to be a part of the team

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.910 
lucky enough to be a part of the team
that<00:03:18.120> qualified<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.080> London<00:03:19.410> Paralympic

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
that qualified for the London Paralympic

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.220 
that qualified for the London Paralympic
Games<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.490> I<00:03:21.120> guess<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.570> gave<00:03:21.780> me<00:03:21.810> an

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
Games and I guess that gave me an

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.610 
Games and I guess that gave me an
insight<00:03:22.440> into<00:03:23.070> how<00:03:23.550> important<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.390> how

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
insight into how important and how

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.380 
insight into how important and how
meaningful<00:03:25.620> it's<00:03:25.860> going<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.220> be<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.880> to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
meaningful it's going to be to to

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.120 
meaningful it's going to be to to
represent<00:03:27.900> Australia<00:03:28.440> at<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.740> paralympics
