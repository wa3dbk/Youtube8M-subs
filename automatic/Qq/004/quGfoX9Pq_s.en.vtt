00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.488
 Well, tell us American, where is the truth? 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.889
 I agree with Boris. 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.612
 Did anyone doubt that? 

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:23.304
 The best way for Russia to protect itself from the Orange Revolution, 

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:25.588
 which is now a great concern for Russia 

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:27.978
 and Putin talked about it on Thursday, didn't he? 

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:33.783
 It is especially what Boris said - it is a democracy, a democratic constitution. 

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:38.932
 Can you enumerate one case where the Orange Revolution - figuratively speaking 

00:00:38.932 --> 00:00:45.673
 it occurred in a democracy, according to some sort of regularity in autocracy where there are no other ways out. 

00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:47.140
 France, Charles de Gaulle, 

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:52.063
 the orange revolution, the legally elected president was overthrown and died shortly afterwards. 

00:00:52.063 --> 00:00:55.393
 Please! France is a democratic country? Please tell me. 

00:00:55.393 --> 00:00:55.673
 Yes. 

00:00:55.673 --> 00:00:59.196
 Didn't they put him down after the demonstration? 

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:01.178
 Remind why he was overthrown. 

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:06.642
 Because he fired NATO from France, they came closer to Belgium. 

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:13.170
 He exchanged dollars for gold. Here is the cause of the orange revolution that overthrew de Gaulle, please. 

00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:20.113
 Secondly, as to the fact that the Americans brought Hitler to power, this is an interesting theory. 

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:25.261
 I hope your version won't get into Russian textbooks 

00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:27.311
 We're working on it. 

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:34.437
 The famous phrase, the famous phrase of the future US president, when he was a senator, 

00:01:34.437 --> 00:01:38.055
 that if the Germans win, they will help the Russians, 

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:41.447
 and if the Russians will help the Germans 

00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:44.891
 and as long as they don't kill each other, as much as possible. 

00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:48.582
 This is the Truman Phrase that is considered a great president. 

00:01:48.582 --> 00:01:53.182
 It was spoken at the beginning of St. War, in Congress. 

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:56.019
 Good. And third, if I can ... 

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:57.842
 Well, of course! 

00:01:57.842 --> 00:02:04.877
 As for ... I always have fun when I hear that the Americans did Maidan, they did Bolotne. 

00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:09.267
 I can say that the FSB did Ferguson, the protests in Ferguson. 

00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:10.242
 But that's not a bad idea at all. 

00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:14.220
 They occupy Wall Street, not bad, but ridiculous. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.484
 No, it is not ridiculous if the President of the United States 

00:02:18.484 --> 00:02:24.068
 quarrel with the Governor of California and go to the Russian Embassy for explanation 

00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:28.200
 So your version that Ferguson organized the FSB will confirm. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.142
 But when the President of the United States 

00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:36.603
 Barack Obama openly declares during his correspondent interview 

00:02:36.603 --> 00:02:43.956
 that they hand over the government from Yanukovich! But who did not say. 

00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:48.969
 While he no longer commented on it, he did not share this idea 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.400
 and before that the US denied its role in this. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.422
 No, you misunderstood him. 

00:02:54.422 --> 00:03:01.817
 So how did I understand him? 

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:05.690
 You may have lost something in translation, it happens. 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.362
 Maybe I could explain to you what he meant. 

00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:11.446
 I can speak English as my mother tongue, so I listen without translation. 

00:03:11.446 --> 00:03:15.120
 My English is a little better. You know English well? 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.693
 Come and measure our English. 

00:03:18.693 --> 00:03:22.673
 That the US helped Ukraine with the transition ... 

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:27.926
 No, it wasn't there. There was the word: "We brokered and deal". 

00:03:27.926 --> 00:03:34.052
 Yes Yes. We helped Ukraine to vote on May 25th. 

00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:37.566
 No no no no no. There was no word on the elections on May 25th. 

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:42.400
 There were specifically: "We brokered a deal, (We broke) 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.949
 to transition power from Janukovich to ... (handing over power from Yanukovich to someone ...) 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.567
 Nothing else. 

00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:52.567
 Yes, we have helped with the process of transition to free elections. 

00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:57.518
 รรกรกรก, so "brokered" is a "process"? 

00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:01.212
 Well, look! 

00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:02.562
 And what's wrong with that? 

00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:06.252
 Well, everything is perfect from your position, it's our crime. 

00:04:06.252 --> 00:04:09.897
 But Vladimir, maybe there were internal reasons 

00:04:09.897 --> 00:04:13.835
 why was Ferguson or the occupation of Wall Street 

00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:15.782
 They could be... 

00:04:15.782 --> 00:04:21.239
 Of course, and when the state solves these problems by itself, it unraveles, 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.949
 when the state translates recipes from outside, extremism occurs sooner or later. 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.103
 Give me at least one example 

00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:36.247
 a state that would do better after the orange or color revolution, at least one. 

00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:38.561
 Ukraine.
