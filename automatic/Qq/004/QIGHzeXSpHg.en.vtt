water and a lipless crankbait like this

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.910 
water and a lipless crankbait like this
can<00:00:47.309> absolutely<00:00:47.899> be<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.110> ticket<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.829> know

yellow water reaction bike by shallow
water<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.039> would<00:00:56.340> say<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.270> majority<00:00:57.449> of

water I would say that the majority of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
water I would say that the majority of
the<00:00:58.050> fish<00:00:58.230> taken<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.890> bait<00:00:59.129> would<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.520> in

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the fish taken on this bait would be in

eight<00:00:59.940> feet<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.449> less<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> reaction

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
eight feet or less and it is a reaction

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490 
eight feet or less and it is a reaction

about it the man can you cover water in

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.770 
about it the man can you cover water in
a<00:01:15.299> day<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.290> drop<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> MinnKota<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:17.689> put<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
a day you drop that MinnKota down put it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.010 
a day you drop that MinnKota down put it
in<00:01:18.960> about<00:01:19.409> 50<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.210> start<00:01:21.210> burning<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
in about 50 and start burning it and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.080 
in about 50 and start burning it and
then<00:01:22.590> when<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.250> particular<00:01:23.880> area

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
then when you get in a particular area

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.630 
then when you get in a particular area
there's<00:01:24.570> there's<00:01:24.810> areas<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.770> MinnKota

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
there's there's areas that are MinnKota

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.539 
there's there's areas that are MinnKota
water<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:28.110> there's<00:01:28.290> areas<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:29.100> are

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
water and then there's areas that are

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.910 
water and then there's areas that are
telling<00:01:29.850> water<00:01:30.530> during<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.650> time<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
telling water during this time of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
telling water during this time of
transition<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.270> joke<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.570> some

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
transition we like to joke that some

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
transition we like to joke that some
spots<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.470> MinnKota<00:01:34.770> spots<00:01:35.220> while<00:01:35.759> others

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
spots are MinnKota spots while others

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.140 
spots are MinnKota spots while others
our<00:01:36.240> talent<00:01:36.630> spots<00:01:37.280> basically<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.820> use<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
our talent spots basically we use the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.640 
our talent spots basically we use the
trolling<00:01:39.420> motor<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.869> comb<00:01:40.049> water<00:01:40.290> quickly

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
trolling motor to comb water quickly

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.880 
trolling motor to comb water quickly
until<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.340> contact<00:01:41.490> fish<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.590> year

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
until we contact fish this time of year

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
until we contact fish this time of year
where<00:01:44.430> there's<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.820> fish<00:01:45.149> there's<00:01:45.509> usually

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
where there's one fish there's usually

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.380 
where there's one fish there's usually
more<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.189> bit<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.970> lower<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
more so if we get bit will lower the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.240 
more so if we get bit will lower the
talents<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.259> lock<00:01:49.439> into<00:01:49.680> place<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
talents so we can lock into place and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.539 
talents so we can lock into place and
fan<00:01:50.430> cast<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.970> area

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.819 

key<00:01:54.549> spots<00:01:54.909> this<00:01:55.270> time<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.689> year<00:01:55.899> are<00:01:56.140> usually

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
key spots this time of year are usually

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.039 
key spots this time of year are usually
shallow<00:01:57.159> rock<00:01:57.520> reefs<00:01:57.850> with<00:01:58.090> boulders<00:01:58.540> for

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
shallow rock reefs with boulders for

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.260 
shallow rock reefs with boulders for
points<00:01:59.590> at<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.799> mouths<00:01:59.950> of<00:02:00.130> Bay's<00:02:00.369> if<00:02:01.060> you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
points at the mouths of Bay's if you

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.240 
points at the mouths of Bay's if you
hook<00:02:01.420> up<00:02:01.659> there's<00:02:02.170> likely<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.590> be<00:02:02.680> more<00:02:02.830> fish

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
hook up there's likely to be more fish

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.889 
hook up there's likely to be more fish
in<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.430> area<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.180> cover<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.570> thoroughly
