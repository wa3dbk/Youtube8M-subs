00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
also get some adrenaline and the match
starts<00:01:44.729> sometimes<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> pain<00:01:45.509> goes<00:01:45.749> away<00:01:45.990> but

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
starts sometimes the pain goes away but

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.969 
starts sometimes the pain goes away but
but<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.579> wasn't<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.420> wasn't<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:49.139> day<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
but this wasn't it wasn't good day that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.969 
but this wasn't it wasn't good day that
it<00:01:50.100> went<00:01:50.310> away<00:01:51.079> unfortunately<00:01:52.079> yeah<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:52.950> sure

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it went away unfortunately yeah for sure

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.309 
it went away unfortunately yeah for sure
i<00:01:53.130> think<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.819> know<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.600> only<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:55.049> third

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
i think you know it's only my third

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.770 
i think you know it's only my third
final<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.009> that's<00:01:56.280> probably<00:01:56.520> why<00:01:57.329> i<00:01:57.359> couldn't

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
final so that's probably why i couldn't

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.809 
final so that's probably why i couldn't
really<00:01:58.079> afford<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.679> just<00:01:58.859> walk<00:01:59.219> away<00:01:59.249> from<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
really afford to just walk away from the

really afford to just walk away from the
match<00:01:59.999> so<00:02:00.709> but<00:02:01.709> still<00:02:01.979> i<00:02:02.009> had<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.249> good<00:02:02.459> week<00:02:02.639> you
