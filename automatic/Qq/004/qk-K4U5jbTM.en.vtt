00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.190 
I'm just solely explaining my

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.770 
experiences and what has already gotten
me<00:02:26.500> these<00:02:27.430> interviews<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:30.480> started<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.569> go<00:02:31.689> on

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
me these interviews I started to go on

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.960 
me these interviews I started to go on
Sdn<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:33.010> was<00:02:33.129> seeing<00:02:33.340> all<00:02:33.459> these<00:02:33.579> people's

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
Sdn and I was seeing all these people's

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:44.849 
Sdn and I was seeing all these people's
GPAs<00:02:35.159> 4.0<00:02:36.299> 3.8<00:02:37.769> dat<00:02:38.769> scores<00:02:39.340> 25<00:02:40.890> 28<00:02:41.970> 24<00:02:43.290> mice<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
GPAs 4.0 3.8 dat scores 25 28 24 mice I

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.000 
GPAs 4.0 3.8 dat scores 25 28 24 mice I
wasn't<00:02:45.579> really<00:02:45.730> even<00:02:46.239> close<00:02:46.659> to<00:02:46.900> that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
wasn't really even close to that

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.990 
wasn't really even close to that
and<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.870> still<00:02:50.139> got<00:02:50.319> interviews<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:51.159> so<00:02:51.970> I

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
and I still got interviews and so I

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.050 
and I still got interviews and so I
think<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.799> admission<00:02:54.310> committees<00:02:54.700> are

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
think that the admission committees are

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.229 
think that the admission committees are
seen<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:56.109> I<00:02:56.139> am<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.769> person<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.730> they<00:02:58.060> are

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
seen that I am a person and they are

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.750 
seen that I am a person and they are
seeing<00:02:58.599> that<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.930> am<00:02:59.230> well<00:02:59.530> rounded<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.159> that's

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
seeing that I am well rounded and that's

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.110 
seeing that I am well rounded and that's
why<00:03:00.939> they've<00:03:01.180> invited<00:03:01.540> me<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:02.049> come<00:03:03.120> for

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
why they've invited me to come for

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.599 
why they've invited me to come for
interviews<00:03:04.659> so<00:03:05.079> my<00:03:05.680> point<00:03:05.980> with<00:03:06.129> this<00:03:06.340> is

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
interviews so my point with this is

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.539 
interviews so my point with this is
don't<00:03:07.180> let<00:03:07.480> Sdn<00:03:08.079> or<00:03:08.500> any<00:03:08.709> other<00:03:08.829> type<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.189> forum
