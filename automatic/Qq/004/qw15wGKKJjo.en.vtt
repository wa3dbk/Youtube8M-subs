really worried about because i used to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.000 
really worried about because i used to
have<00:02:27.930> short<00:02:28.170> hair<00:02:28.230> when<00:02:28.590> i<00:02:28.620> went<00:02:28.830> through<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010

now on it suits me and it suits my

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.210 
now on it suits me and it suits my
personality<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:43.019> was<00:03:43.799> really<00:03:43.980> worried

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
personality and I was really worried

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.729 
personality and I was really worried
because<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.700> am<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> pretty<00:03:45.450> round<00:03:45.810> face<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.680> I

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
because I am a pretty round face so I

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.289 
because I am a pretty round face so I
was<00:03:46.860> really<00:03:46.980> worried<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.519> know<00:03:47.549> short

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
was really worried you know short

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.640 
was really worried you know short
haircuts<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.870> really<00:03:49.049> accentuate<00:03:49.470> round

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
haircuts can really accentuate round

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.350 
haircuts can really accentuate round
faces<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.280> make<00:03:50.400> them<00:03:50.549> look<00:03:50.700> bigger<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.120> I

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
faces and make them look bigger and I

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.360 
faces and make them look bigger and I
was<00:03:51.450> like<00:03:51.570> oh<00:03:51.690> gosh<00:03:52.019> what<00:03:52.470> does<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.830> happens

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
was like oh gosh what does that happens

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.850 
was like oh gosh what does that happens
but<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.570> think<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.110> turned<00:03:55.320> out<00:03:55.440> great<00:03:55.620> i<00:03:55.739> think

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
but I think it turned out great i think

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.350 
but I think it turned out great i think
he<00:03:56.130> did<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.310> great<00:03:56.519> job<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:57.090> know<00:03:57.180> i<00:03:57.209> think

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
he did a great job you know i think

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.539 
he did a great job you know i think
that's<00:03:57.660> just<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.870> lesson<00:03:58.200> for<00:03:58.440> us<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:59.070> learn<00:03:59.220> as

that's just a lesson for us to learn as

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.000 
that's just a lesson for us to learn as
trust<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.720> person<00:04:00.900> who's<00:04:01.260> done<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.769> he

know what they're doing and scary as
that<00:04:11.070> can<00:04:11.430> be<00:04:11.580> because<00:04:11.880> i<00:04:12.000> was<00:04:12.120> talking<00:04:12.360> is

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
that can be because i was talking is

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.670 
that can be because i was talking is
about<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:12.990> it<00:04:13.140> can<00:04:13.260> be<00:04:13.350> really<00:04:13.530> scary

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
about this it can be really scary

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.710 
about this it can be really scary
because<00:04:14.190> like<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.670> takes<00:04:15.150> forever<00:04:15.270> to<00:04:15.480> grow

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
because like it takes forever to grow

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.199 
because like it takes forever to grow
back<00:04:15.960> but<00:04:16.260> honestly<00:04:16.620> it's<00:04:16.920> hair<00:04:17.190> unless<00:04:17.459> it's

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
back but honestly it's hair unless it's

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.020 
back but honestly it's hair unless it's
like<00:04:18.360> shaved<00:04:18.750> up<00:04:19.020> to<00:04:19.260> here<00:04:19.770> then<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.760> won't

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
like shaved up to here then it won't

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.840 
like shaved up to here then it won't
take<00:04:21.480> that<00:04:21.510> long<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.230> grow<00:04:22.680> out<00:04:22.860> like<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.580> think

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
take that long to grow out like I think

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.250 
take that long to grow out like I think
this<00:04:24.030> was<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.390> perfect<00:04:24.510> length<00:04:24.840> because

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
this was the perfect length because

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.080 
this was the perfect length because
it'll<00:04:25.590> still<00:04:25.890> be<00:04:26.070> able<00:04:26.190> to<00:04:26.310> grow<00:04:26.520> out<00:04:26.670> but<00:04:26.940> it's

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
it'll still be able to grow out but it's

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.960 
it'll still be able to grow out but it's
still<00:04:27.300> not<00:04:27.450> too<00:04:27.510> short<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.350> just<00:04:28.980> trust<00:04:29.670> people

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
still not too short I just trust people

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.610 
still not too short I just trust people
sometimes<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.420> know<00:04:30.540> it's<00:04:30.720> good<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.470> have
