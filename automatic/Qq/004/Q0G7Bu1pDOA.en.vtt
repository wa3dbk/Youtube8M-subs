 the government denies this information 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.689
 stating that money doesn't even pass 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.210
 through ethiopian leadership but 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.590
 human rights watch organization 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.880

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 it was found that supporters 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 the opposition received no products 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.829
 sheep seed or fertilizer remedies were 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.059
 designed specifically for these purposes 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.280

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.980
 school education in india worth 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 300 88 million pounds British 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.670
 the government boasted incredible 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.920
 successful projects as a result of which 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.379
 more children began to go to school however 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.050
 Indian authorities say about 17 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 million was lost or stolen that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.020
 much of the amount has been allocated 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.579
 to non-existent schools besides on 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.359
 this money is indian officials 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.920
 purchased a car 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.070
 the British government refutes and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.049
 These statements are a third example of this project 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.290
 worth 100 million pounds for 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.549
 improve education in nigeria 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.740
 An independent investigation revealed that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.810
 no change in education 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.670
 happened and the Nigerian project was

 awarded second best score in 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.350
 rating but the government denies these 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.720
 data stating that journalists visited 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.640
 too few local schools and so this 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.310
 very serious charge of 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.290
 inefficient spending of funds like 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.659
 distributing huge amounts of aid money 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.369
 helps the reputation of British politics 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.020
 shoulder towels al in a bone concert from 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.040
 It is believed that the conservative party 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.500
 Great Britain 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.149
 dole and ready to help only the rich and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.570
 many more will have to work to 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.009
 get rid of that image 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.219
 Sparta represents his politicians 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.780
 generous and generous 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.939
 this information suggests 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.799
 that the government doesn't care where they go 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.570
 money as they are distributed and 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.170
 how effective is the program itself 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.600
 help 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.149
 this report is really serious 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.860
 criticizes the government suggests whether 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.770
 he that uk should stop 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.590
 help friend 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.790
 they have no countries, but it is assumed that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.330
 money should be allocated 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.800
 and distribute much more efficient 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.990
 Of course it all happens on the background of measures 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.090
 austerity in the country and many people 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.400
 say enough to feed abroad 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.020
 let's spend the money here because there is 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.870
 what even the poorest are capable of 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.540
 taxes are reduced very high even on 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.670
 pensions many attempt that 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.560
 money can not be spent abroad better 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.500
 at home with budget aid 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.760
 constantly growing and already is 0.7 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.950
 percent of gross national income 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.680
 it is 500 pounds a year from each family and 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.910
 many British say we know better 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.910
 what do we do with this money
