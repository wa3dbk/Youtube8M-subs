00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
under native shrubs and so what we've

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.510 
under native shrubs and so what we've
been<00:01:20.510> doing<00:01:20.720> here<00:01:21.230> is<00:01:21.410> trying<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.980> recreate

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
that shrub habitat where they where they

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.120 
that shrub habitat where they where they
can<00:01:25.520> nest

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.270 

this<00:01:31.880> small<00:01:32.450> shade<00:01:32.780> houses<00:01:33.320> are<00:01:33.469> on<00:01:33.710> island

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
this small shade houses are on island

this small shade houses are on island
nursery<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:35.299> grow<00:01:35.539> all<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.079> plants<00:01:36.560> that

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
nursery we grow all of the plants that

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.819 
nursery we grow all of the plants that
we<00:01:36.920> use<00:01:37.159> for<00:01:37.969> habitat<00:01:38.420> restoration<00:01:38.450> on<00:01:39.259> Island

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
we use for habitat restoration on Island

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.310 
we use for habitat restoration on Island
so<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.189> collect<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.640> seed<00:01:40.880> here<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.509> grow<00:01:42.140> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
so we collect the seed here and grow the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.999 
so we collect the seed here and grow the
plants<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.579> little<00:01:43.880> facility<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:45.860> a

year's planting and I think we could
really<00:04:08.650> see<00:04:08.980> some<00:04:09.189> results<00:04:09.760> in<00:04:09.879> the<00:04:09.970> next<00:04:10.269> you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
really see some results in the next you

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
coming in to these these these sites and

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.580 
coming in to these these these sites and
and<00:04:14.889> using<00:04:15.430> them<00:04:15.549> as<00:04:15.780> nesting<00:04:16.780> nesting

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
and using them as nesting nesting

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.439 
and using them as nesting nesting
grounds<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.900> so<00:04:20.079> this<00:04:20.229> restoration<00:04:20.620> work<00:04:20.919> is
