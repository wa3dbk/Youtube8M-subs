 Hello, my name is Luis Estrada and I am a software developer. In this video I will show you how to change the size of a photo with the Paint program. The Paint program is included in your Windows Vista or Windows XP operating system. Windows is a registered trademark of Microsoft and I do not have any affiliation with Microsoft. It is common, when we create web pages, that you need to include an image that does not have the appropriate size. Go to the folder where you store the image, right click on it and select Edit. Now that you have the Paint program and the image ready to be modified, select Image, Expand or collapse or Ctrl W. Then select the vertical and horizontal percentage. Let's say we want a final image that is half the size, then write 50% in each of the fields, then press "Ok". Now that you want to save your list image, go to the File tab and there you will find two options; you can simply click on Save and the original image will be replaced with the image that we just created, or you can select Save as and then you have the possibility to save the image as a new file. I recommend you use the second option because in this way you leave your original image intact. So click on Save as and choose a new name, for example, "autos2". Imagine that after changing the size of a photo by 50%, we want to return it to the original size. This is what would happen: right click on the new image and select Edit, now press Ctrl W and enter 200% in the horizontal and vertical fields; press "Ok" and save the image as "autos3". Now, go back to the folder where you have your pictures and we will preview the original image of the cars against the new one that we just created. You will see that although the 2 images are the same size, there is a big difference in terms of quality. This is because the original image lost half of its information when it was reduced in size, and when it was expanded again, the Paint program had to reinvent that information. However, the work he did is not very good. This happens in most image editors and that is why it is important to leave the original file intact for future use. This was Luis Estrada and I just showed you how to create web pages using HTML.
