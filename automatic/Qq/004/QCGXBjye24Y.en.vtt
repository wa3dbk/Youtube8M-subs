00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
had to go into this thing to begin with

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.290 
had to go into this thing to begin with
we<00:00:56.160> started<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> car<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.180> was

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
we started out with the car that was

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
we started out with the car that was
pretty<00:00:57.870> much<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> really<00:00:58.320> good<00:00:58.470> proven<00:00:58.769> car<00:00:58.980> but

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
pretty much a really good proven car but

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.970 
pretty much a really good proven car but
it<00:01:00.150> would<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.420> competitive<00:01:01.019> for<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.830> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it would be competitive for the way the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.040 
it would be competitive for the way the
car<00:01:02.160> sits<00:01:02.400> right<00:01:02.489> now<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.540> we<00:01:03.660> decided<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
car sits right now so what we decided to

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.620 
car sits right now so what we decided to
do<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.640> turbocharged<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.850> put<00:01:06.180> better<00:01:06.360> tires

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
do is a turbocharged it put better tires

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.710 
do is a turbocharged it put better tires
on<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:06.960> filled<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> engine<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.690> overall<00:01:09.690> just

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
on it filled the engine and overall just

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330 
on it filled the engine and overall just
change<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.620> we<00:01:10.710> could<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.010> make<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.220> thing

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
