that we're left or whatever and this
area<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:12.090> could<00:02:12.360> recede<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.379> with

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
area I could recede this with

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.820 
area I could recede this with
grass<00:02:14.160> seed<00:02:14.460> which<00:02:14.670> would<00:02:14.850> be<00:02:14.970> fine<00:02:15.210> or<00:02:16.110> just

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
grass seed which would be fine or just

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.970 
grass seed which would be fine or just
kind<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.330> loosen<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.930> dirt<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.290> bit<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.709> make<00:02:19.830> it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
kind of loosen the dirt a bit to make it

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.610 
kind of loosen the dirt a bit to make it
easier<00:02:20.280> for<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.610> roots<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.180> take<00:02:21.390> hold<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
easier for the roots to take hold and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.830 
easier for the roots to take hold and
then<00:02:22.860> I'm<00:02:22.980> going<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.310> take<00:02:23.520> these<00:02:23.760> clumps<00:02:24.660> of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
then I'm going to take these clumps of

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.050 
then I'm going to take these clumps of
grass<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.530> I've<00:02:26.010> removed<00:02:26.370> from<00:02:26.580> my<00:02:26.760> clover

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
grass that I've removed from my clover

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.010

patch and what I'm going to do is you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.070 
patch and what I'm going to do is you
know<00:02:31.110> pop<00:02:31.650> them<00:02:31.950> into<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.700> area<00:02:33.150> where<00:02:34.050> I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
know pop them into that area where I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.750 
know pop them into that area where I
actually<00:02:34.380> need<00:02:34.800> some<00:02:35.100> some<00:02:36.030> grass<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.760> to

actually need some some grass to be to

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.390 
actually need some some grass to be to
be<00:02:38.910> spread<00:02:39.270> out<00:02:39.300> or<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.780> grow<00:02:40.020> back<00:02:40.400> and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
be spread out or to grow back and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.660 
be spread out or to grow back and
basically<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.420> basically<00:02:43.260> then<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:44.489> will

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
basically and basically then that will

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.530 
basically and basically then that will
give<00:02:44.819> me<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.440> head<00:02:46.440> start<00:02:46.770> on<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.070> area<00:02:47.610> so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
give me a head start on that area so

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.210 
give me a head start on that area so
again<00:02:48.630> than<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.230> point<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.040> video

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
again than just the point of this video

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.340 
again than just the point of this video
being<00:02:50.640> anytime<00:02:51.239> you're<00:02:51.390> pulling<00:02:51.750> grass<00:02:51.989> out

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
being anytime you're pulling grass out

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.960 
being anytime you're pulling grass out
and<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.769> have<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.920> clump<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.370> grass<00:02:53.519> from

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and you have a clump of grass from

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.030 
and you have a clump of grass from
someplace<00:02:54.360> where<00:02:55.019> either<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.350> don't<00:02:55.650> want<00:02:55.860> it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
someplace where either you don't want it

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.470 
someplace where either you don't want it
or<00:02:56.190> you're<00:02:56.340> doing<00:02:56.430> construction<00:02:57.000> or<00:02:57.269> some

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
or you're doing construction or some

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.830 
or you're doing construction or some
other<00:02:57.600> kind<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.900> work<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:59.330> best<00:03:00.330> thing<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.600> do

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
other kind of work the best thing to do

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.860 
other kind of work the best thing to do
from<00:03:01.019> my<00:03:01.230> perspective<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:02.220> find<00:03:03.209> another<00:03:03.480> area

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
from my perspective is find another area

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.360 
from my perspective is find another area
where<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.170> need<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.380> bit<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.830> grass<00:03:05.010> and

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
where you need that bit of grass and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.240 
where you need that bit of grass and
plug<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.120> for<00:03:06.269> yourself<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.040> that's<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
plug it in for yourself so that's the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.530 
plug it in for yourself so that's the
scoop<00:03:08.459> on<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.850> alright<00:03:09.810> happy<00:03:10.080> gardening
