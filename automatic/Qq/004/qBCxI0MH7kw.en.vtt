00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.109 
the odor of the garlic from your hands
when<00:02:02.979> we<00:02:03.100> look<00:02:03.280> at<00:02:03.340> all<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.610> our<00:02:03.790> product

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
when we look at all of our product

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.460 
when we look at all of our product
design<00:02:04.390> we<00:02:04.659> always<00:02:05.049> think<00:02:05.200> about<00:02:05.350> the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
design we always think about the

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.440 
design we always think about the
function<00:02:06.040> first<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:06.580> very<00:02:06.820> very<00:02:07.060> important

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
function first it's very very important

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.050 
function first it's very very important
for<00:02:07.540> us<00:02:07.659> we're<00:02:08.439> trying<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.860> provide<00:02:09.159> solutions

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
for us we're trying to provide solutions

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.170 
for us we're trying to provide solutions
to<00:02:10.599> problems<00:02:10.869> so<00:02:11.530> we<00:02:11.650> have<00:02:11.860> one<00:02:12.430> product<00:02:12.879> that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
to problems so we have one product that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.839 
to problems so we have one product that
has<00:02:13.359> eight<00:02:13.629> Bowles<00:02:14.109> that<00:02:14.560> nest<00:02:14.950> into<00:02:15.249> a<00:02:15.430> single

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
has eight Bowles that nest into a single

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.699 
has eight Bowles that nest into a single
product<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.749> it<00:02:16.810> saves<00:02:17.049> a<00:02:17.230> lot<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.379> space

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
product so it saves a lot of space

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.450 
product so it saves a lot of space
within<00:02:17.919> the<00:02:18.129> kitchen

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
within the kitchen

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.580 
within the kitchen
so<00:02:18.610> that's<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.910> storage<00:02:19.300> solution<00:02:19.590> right

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
so that's a storage solution right

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.400 
so that's a storage solution right
through<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.160> cooking<00:02:22.000> solutions<00:02:22.320> where<00:02:23.320> we

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
through to cooking solutions where we

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.590 
through to cooking solutions where we
have<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.860> range<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.280> elevated<00:02:24.910> tools<00:02:25.210> with<00:02:25.480> an

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
have a range of elevated tools with an

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.240 
have a range of elevated tools with an
elevated<00:02:25.870> head<00:02:26.350> which<00:02:26.710> means<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.040> they're

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
elevated head which means that they're

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.580 
elevated head which means that they're
hygienic<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:28.600> always<00:02:28.780> problem-solving

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
hygienic so it's always problem-solving

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.530 
hygienic so it's always problem-solving
first<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.250> then<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.700> course<00:02:30.940> we<00:02:31.090> try<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.420> make

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
first and then of course we try and make

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.170 
first and then of course we try and make
the<00:02:31.660> products<00:02:31.990> look<00:02:32.140> attractive<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.980> nice<00:02:33.850> so

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the products look attractive and nice so

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.550 
the products look attractive and nice so
people<00:02:34.480> want<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.080> have<00:02:35.200> them<00:02:35.320> in<00:02:35.440> their

masher<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:57.010> their<00:02:57.190> design<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:58.000> based<00:02:58.300> around

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
masher but their design is based around

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.590 
masher but their design is based around
the<00:02:58.930> idea<00:02:59.020> that<00:02:59.350> you<00:02:59.860> can<00:03:00.040> mash<00:03:00.340> as<00:03:00.730> well<00:03:01.450> as

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
potato and like I say it's very easy to

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.530 
potato and like I say it's very easy to
knock<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.710> potato<00:03:17.980> off<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.940> mashing<00:03:19.330> head

knock the potato off the mashing head

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.140 
knock the potato off the mashing head
also<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.710> very<00:03:20.770> easy<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.160> hold<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:21.760> apply

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
also it's very easy to hold and apply

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.610 
also it's very easy to hold and apply
pressure<00:03:22.420> down<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:22.960> your<00:03:23.080> as<00:03:23.290> you're<00:03:23.470> mashing

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
pressure down as your as you're mashing

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.980 
pressure down as your as you're mashing
the<00:03:24.580> reason<00:03:24.850> it's<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:25.480> great<00:03:25.720> at<00:03:25.900> the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
the reason it's so it's great at the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.260 
the reason it's so it's great at the
moment<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.350> because<00:03:26.590> cooking<00:03:26.830> is<00:03:27.040> very<00:03:27.370> much<00:03:27.580> a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
moment is because cooking is very much a

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.050 
moment is because cooking is very much a
growing<00:03:28.900> trend<00:03:29.400> we're<00:03:30.400> seeing<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.700> lot<00:03:30.850> more

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
growing trend we're seeing a lot more

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
that that's been helped by the celebrity

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.650 
that that's been helped by the celebrity
chefs<00:03:36.310> as<00:03:36.520> a<00:03:36.730> lot<00:03:37.150> more<00:03:37.270> cooking<00:03:37.540> on

trend<00:03:40.090> at<00:03:40.390> home<00:03:40.600> we<00:03:41.410> still<00:03:41.680> think<00:03:41.800> there<00:03:41.950> are

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
trend at home we still think there are

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.380 
trend at home we still think there are
many<00:03:42.160> products<00:03:42.580> within<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.880> kitchen<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.300> we

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
many products within the kitchen that we

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.920 
many products within the kitchen that we
can<00:03:43.620> design<00:03:44.620> improve<00:03:45.660> produce<00:03:46.660> better

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
can design improve produce better

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.600 
can design improve produce better
products<00:03:47.410> so<00:03:47.530> we're<00:03:47.710> very<00:03:47.920> still<00:03:48.460> very

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
products so we're very still very

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.820 
products so we're very still very
focused<00:03:48.910> on<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.030> kitchen<00:03:49.330> for<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.350> future

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
focused on the kitchen for the future

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.250 
focused on the kitchen for the future
and<00:03:51.010> when<00:03:51.220> we<00:03:51.310> think<00:03:51.550> in<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.270> next<00:03:52.300> five<00:03:52.960> years

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
and when we think in the next five years

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.380 
and when we think in the next five years
we<00:03:53.620> definitely<00:03:54.190> will<00:03:54.400> move<00:03:54.700> be<00:03:54.910> moving<00:03:55.240> our

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
we definitely will move be moving our

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.530 
we definitely will move be moving our
product<00:03:55.990> range<00:03:56.850> or<00:03:57.850> creating<00:03:58.240> a<00:03:58.300> wider

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
product range or creating a wider
