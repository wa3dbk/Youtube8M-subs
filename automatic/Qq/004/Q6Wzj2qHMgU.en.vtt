 hello to all and all how are you good 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.340
 spending since another day more and good and 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.340
 I come to bring you a new tweet tweet 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.099
 and it comes out show that it is a tweet 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.920
 that what it does is improve a lot 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.750
 which is multitasking and I recommend and 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.890
 install this tweet to the whole world 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.270
 because it's really very practical 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.640
 then well let's install it and 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.890
 then we see how the first thing that works 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.660
 let's do is go to cydia 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.660
 and we wait for it to load 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.850
 once it's loaded we're going to go to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.850
 drive 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.180
 and let's go to sources 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.630
 we are going to install the repository and font m 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.030
 dotcom to install this tweet this 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.890
 tweet then let's give it to edit it 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.800
 let's add and we'll write 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.960
 the web address and we are going to give it 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.340
 add source to be the repository 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.280
 the repository what we have to 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.380
 typing is http.fifa.com and nothing 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.520
 we installed once installed let's go 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.979
 to search and let's write aux or what is 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 the name of the tweet then good 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.090
 We wait for you to look for it 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.149
 and we are going to install it 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.280
 we go to the repository difonÃ­a mind us 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.569
 we have to fix in the icons 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.160
 and once inside we're going to give 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.880
 install my table to modify because 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.110
 I already have it installed then good 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.610
 it gives this to install install is 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.610
 once installed 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.049
 let's go to settings 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:43.530
 and we are going to look 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.530
 the tuiga that is auto we enter 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:51.760
 and well here we can configure 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:56.019
 because multitasking adds that we can 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.629
 have access to different options for 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.450
 activate or deactivate more 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:04.319
 quick as it can be the wifi activate or 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.219
 disable wifi bluetooth 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.980
 in connection 3g the sound good the 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.760
 airplane mode good everything you see here 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.760
 so good here you can 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.000
 you can place the order that you want is worth 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.200
 so then let's see the multitasking 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.750
 ok to open good open the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.560
 multitasking and as you see changes a 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:32.030
 outrageous you see what the icons are 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.070
 they look whole and you see a one 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.980
 preview screen of what we were 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.200
 doing as you see directly now 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.750
 we have removed adjustments and you see that we are 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.790
 within aux alone then good at 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.250
 pointed out that good a screen of what 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.910
 we were doing and then good 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.550
 we follow the music tab this has 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.190
 reformed a bit and now good is more 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.430
 it's different I see it better because the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.670
 buttons are bigger to give 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.580
 to play or move forward or backward then 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.330
 let's go to what it is to what are the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.160
 shortcuts and in addition the 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.890
 flash button 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.820
 that as you can see we can control the flash 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:20.000
 of stuckey you see the flash forgive the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.730
 lighting the brightness then here we have 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.940

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.800

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.180
 we have here the different options 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:36.320
 to disable activate the bluetooth the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.620

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.620
