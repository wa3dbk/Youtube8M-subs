00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.990
 and 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.730
 welcome to a new techno the 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.460
 You can subscribe to our channel 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.430
 youtube we thank all those who 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.770
 they look at the things that we are going up there and 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.309
 today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.280
 phone a Motorola phone is the 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.020
 new model that is about to go out to 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.890
 the sale in all the companies of the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.980
 Argentina that is the motorcycle and that we are going to 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.830
 find another engine in the engine 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.469
 bets of the brand and I think it's 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.540
 a successful bet to follow the 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.880
 path also from other brands that 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.450
 phones are doing it like 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.960
 They know they have low range midrange and range 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.750
 high the ranges are differentiated 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.460
 according to the materials in which 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.190
 are each doing for example a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.229
 high-end phone has a metal 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.210
 how can it be an aluminum that you can 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.960
 find on an iphone or you can 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.360
 find in a zeta 1 and crystal 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.990
 front and back materials that are 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.510
 more expensive and before those who were in the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.820
 low end not only had materials 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.990
 which were cheaper but also 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.990
 their technical qualities were average 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.290
 doubtful or were there could not be 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.409
 enjoy we could say the phone to 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.890
 full from the appearance of the 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.659
 motogp as the one that marked the way and that 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.670
 it's a phone that is very successful 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.880
 sales 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.460
 motorola bet a little more to have a 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.200
 good technical disposition maybe with 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.979
 some benefits less as can 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.550
 be a flash less and launch the engine 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.170
 it comes in this box 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.440
 at least here in the market 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.750
 Argentine obviously tracing the land of 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.160
 fire 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.880
 and we're going to open the box so we can 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.670
 see this phone when you do it at 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.940
 touch is a phone that has seems to me 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.030
 an exact weight that is very easy to 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.260
 handle that has a 4.5 screen 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.640
 inches right now I am 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.500
 doing is trying to change the brightness 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.459
 so you can see clearly this 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.690
 is the screen 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.900
 4.5 inches in a size that as you can see 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.730
 It is very pleasant to the hand and I remember in a 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.010
 thing when they began to leave the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.980
 first phones how can it be a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.710
 samsung galaxy s2 four screen 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.670
 and a half were bigger phones than 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.120
 this 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.720
 the brands have gone trying to 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.660
 that the edges of the screen every time 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.120
 are finer then such a screen 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.640
 time the same size as phones 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.910
 previous editions are smaller 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:22.780
 luckily for the users 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:25.120
 has 4 gb of memory and you can add 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.230
 a memory card also for 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.630
 expand it up to 32 gb obviously the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.390
 operating system is android are 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.210
 starting with a kit kat and the brand 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.390
 is promising an update for 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.570
 all that is, you're going to have a phone 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.540
 of those considered from the low end with 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.640
 a great technological provision and that 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.030
 In addition, the operating system is 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.430
 guaranteed that it will be updated in 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.290
 the top you have the entrance to 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.970
 the headphones and has a detail 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.520
 I also particularly like the 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.020
 phones is that they have FM radio so 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.820
 that directly connecting the 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.069
 headphones that you know that make you from 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.620
 antenna you can have 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.469
 your radio fm working I like it 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.129
 really that the phones have radio 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:17.620
 fm on the back a cover of 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.590
 plastic that can be removed although the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.400
 Battery is not removable with a camera 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.120
 of 5 megapixels that in conditions of 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.910
 Normal light takes more than decent photos 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.039
 have achieved a good result in that 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.099
 felt in one of the lateral parts 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:39.820
 you are going to find the power button and 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.919
 of suspension or blocking and the key of 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.720
 volume that you already know in the part 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.039
 higher plus volume in the part 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.870
 lower 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:51.680
 the volume is going to lower us 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.160
 at the bottom of the phone you can 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.890
 find the mini usb entry for 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.560
 perform the charge when I tell you the 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.530
 charge that another advantage has a battery 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.410
 that will last you practically everything 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.250
 all day giving I had with a very 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.280
 good duration notice that the system to 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:17.210
 be almost a pure android provided by 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.340
 google is flowing very naturally 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.380
 so you're not going to have the chs so 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.220
 less in the time that we have been 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:28.640
 testing the logs there are no podÃ©s 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.840
 run the games too with quite 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.630
 decency and it 's totally customizable 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.110
 how is android obviously has control 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.290
 of the basic applications so that 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.200
 you can enjoy this new phone 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.540
 motorola engine 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.610
 what else are you going to find apart from that 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.440
 aesthetically it's nice that you have a 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.729
 good screen with a very good 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.409
 definition your camera and other character 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:01.080
 inside the box that is also one of 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.879
 the philosophies that are taking 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.710
 brands but from a good phone 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:09.300
 performance with quality materials 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.039
 that technically will give you that 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.259
 has a very good battery in terms of 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.210
 its duration I'm assuring you that 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.629
 I have an operating system that is going to 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.080
 update but I do not give you headphones and 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:24.229
 in this case it is not usb cable 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.480
 it only comes with a redesigned 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:29.360
 charger 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.580
 that directly comes with the mini usb 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.710
 in the tip and that you will be able to load it to 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.230
 your cell phone but you do not have the usb cable 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.770
 what can you get in any Chinese 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:45.280
 any price that's not a problem and I 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:51.380
 it seems that the user is understanding 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:54.380
 that although it does not have headphones the 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.960
 headphones you can use others or buy 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.790
 of the same brand separately that does not 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.320
 there is no problem other things 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.660
 who will come here in Argentina and that 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.790
 going to sell separately are the caps 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.040
 Rear colored back covers 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:10.400
 following the motorbike line the engine 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.500
 will repeat the same if you do not want 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.770
 spend a lot of money here in the republic 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:18.970
 argentina more or less about one thousand 900 pesos 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:22.880
 by company I do not know when it will be 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.440
 released in the retails so I guess 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.750
 that will be a price a little bit more 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.520
 high but for the benefits if you're 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.740
 a user who does not want to spend much 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.689
 money have a phone that allows you 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.419
 connect to social networks 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:38.330
 updated and on top of not spending much 

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:40.879
 money the engine is the most 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.399
 convenient, thank you very much for having 

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:45.079
 been here listening while watching this techno
