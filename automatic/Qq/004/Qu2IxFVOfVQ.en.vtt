sure the patches is good enough okay so

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.339 
sure the patches is good enough okay so
some<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.310> test<00:02:13.610> methods<00:02:13.819> we<00:02:14.209> do<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.600> our

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
some of the test methods we do a our

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.460 
some of the test methods we do a our
vertical<00:02:16.099> ball<00:02:16.459> rebound<00:02:16.910> we<00:02:17.720> test<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.260> ball

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
vertical ball rebound we test the ball

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.890 
vertical ball rebound we test the ball
on<00:02:18.709> concrete<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.519> measure<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.540> rebound

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
on concrete and measure the rebound

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.199 
on concrete and measure the rebound
height<00:02:21.200> then<00:02:21.769> we<00:02:22.010> compare<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.579> to<00:02:23.120> the

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
height then we compare it to the

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.440 
height then we compare it to the
artificial<00:02:23.600> touch<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:25.160> SPO<00:02:25.549> deboned<00:02:25.910> we

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
artificial touch that SPO deboned we

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.920 
artificial touch that SPO deboned we
also<00:02:26.630> do<00:02:26.900> ball<00:02:27.200> roll<00:02:27.470> we<00:02:28.250> roll<00:02:28.609> the<00:02:29.299> ball<00:02:29.510> from

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
also do ball roll we roll the ball from

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.229 
also do ball roll we roll the ball from
a<00:02:30.079> given<00:02:30.410> height<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.250> we<00:02:31.519> measure<00:02:31.730> how<00:02:31.940> far

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
a given height and we measure how far

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.229 
a given height and we measure how far
the<00:02:32.299> ball<00:02:32.480> rolls<00:02:33.430> we<00:02:34.430> also<00:02:34.609> do<00:02:34.880> vertical

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the ball rolls we also do vertical

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.319 
the ball rolls we also do vertical
deformation<00:02:36.310> vertical<00:02:37.310> deformation<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:38.090> when

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
deformation vertical deformation is when

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.300 
deformation vertical deformation is when
you<00:02:38.540> put<00:02:38.810> your<00:02:38.840> foot<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.410> surface<00:02:39.590> how

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
you put your foot on the surface how

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.819 
you put your foot on the surface how
much<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.820> surface<00:02:41.239> compacts<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:42.739> you

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
much the surface compacts so if you

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.339 
much the surface compacts so if you
watch<00:02:42.980> my<00:02:43.190> foot

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.920 

we<00:02:50.010> also<00:02:50.220> test<00:02:50.700> their<00:02:50.909> hard<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.360> surfaces

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
we also test their hard the surfaces

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.899 
we also test their hard the surfaces
compared<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:52.470> concrete<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.430> test<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
compared to concrete so we test the

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.500 
compared to concrete so we test the
concrete<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.569> then<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.680> test<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.099> surface<00:02:56.510> we

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
concrete and then we test the surface we

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.920 
concrete and then we test the surface we
also<00:02:57.959> test<00:02:58.439> the<00:02:59.310> attraction<00:02:59.909> so<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.659> test

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
also test the attraction so we test

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.520 
also test the attraction so we test
again<00:03:01.200> my<00:03:01.980> foot<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:02.970> much<00:03:03.530> rotational

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
again my foot how much rotational

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.970 
again my foot how much rotational
resistance<00:03:05.129> how<00:03:05.459> much<00:03:05.640> traction<00:03:06.799> we<00:03:07.799> use<00:03:07.950> a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
resistance how much traction we use a

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.690 
resistance how much traction we use a
torque<00:03:08.370> meter<00:03:08.549> for<00:03:08.909> that<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:10.799> then<00:03:11.340> some<00:03:11.579> of

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
torque meter for that and then some of

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.899 
torque meter for that and then some of
the<00:03:11.790> other<00:03:11.819> tests<00:03:12.299> we<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:12.860> we<00:03:13.860> we<00:03:14.370> also<00:03:14.519> check

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
the other tests we do we we also check

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.030 
the other tests we do we we also check
the<00:03:15.030> dimensions<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:15.840> we<00:03:16.319> check<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.799> length

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
the dimensions so we check the length

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.610 
the dimensions so we check the length
and<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:18.090> width<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.629> meter

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
and the width and meter

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.759 
and the width and meter
okay<00:03:20.430> let's<00:03:21.420> piece<00:03:21.659> of<00:03:21.840> equipment<00:03:22.349> is<00:03:22.440> for

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
okay let's piece of equipment is for

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.759 
okay let's piece of equipment is for
measuring<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.640> surface<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:25.109> see<00:03:25.319> how<00:03:25.500> hard

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
measuring the surface to see how hard

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.180 
measuring the surface to see how hard
the<00:03:26.190> surfaces<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:27.060> also<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.319> check<00:03:28.590> how<00:03:29.159> much

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
the surfaces and also to check how much

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.300 
the surfaces and also to check how much
the<00:03:29.549> surface<00:03:29.940> moves<00:03:30.750> when<00:03:31.200> your<00:03:31.349> foot<00:03:31.590> stands

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
the surface moves when your foot stands

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.309 
the surface moves when your foot stands
on<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.519> surface<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.629> as<00:03:33.659> to<00:03:33.930> measure<00:03:34.079> the

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
on the surface so as to measure the

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.199 
on the surface so as to measure the
shock<00:03:34.560> absorption<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.849> vertical

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
shock absorption and the vertical

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.020 
shock absorption and the vertical
deformation<00:03:36.799> this<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> FIFA<00:03:38.280> test<00:03:38.639> method

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
deformation this is a FIFA test method

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.629 
deformation this is a FIFA test method
that<00:03:39.599> is<00:03:39.720> used<00:03:39.750> for<00:03:40.139> all<00:03:40.470> artificial<00:03:41.129> pictures

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
that is used for all artificial pictures

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:49.339 
that is used for all artificial pictures
I<00:03:41.900> will<00:03:42.900> press<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.290> button<00:03:47.569> it<00:03:48.569> drops<00:03:49.230> the

I will press the button it drops the
weight<00:03:49.609> and<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:51.239> gives<00:03:51.450> us<00:03:51.540> some<00:03:51.599> results<00:03:52.170> and

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
weight and it gives us some results and

00:03:54.169 --> 00:04:05.990 
weight and it gives us some results and
then<00:03:55.169> we<00:03:55.620> measure<00:03:55.889> it<00:03:56.040> again<00:04:01.790> we<00:04:02.790> left<00:04:04.760> we<00:04:05.760> wait

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
then we measure it again we left we wait

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.990 
then we measure it again we left we wait
for<00:04:06.329> 30<00:04:06.540> seconds<00:04:07.319> and<00:04:07.470> then<00:04:08.340> we<00:04:08.400> retest<00:04:14.000> good
