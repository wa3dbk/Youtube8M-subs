00:00:01.254 --> 00:00:04.254
 Welcome to the Capello series of series of fact-finding missions we will be doing over the coming weeks and months 

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:08.172
 To give coach Fabio a look at England's opponents to the World Cup. 

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:09.960
 We have 3 Algerians here 

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.241
 Overall Algeria will participate in the World Cup 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.720
 We will speak to this country on the players of his team 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.230
 As well as to keep Algeria in front of England 

00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:29.044
 Football in Algeria is a second religion after Islam Everyone loves this sport 

00:00:37.198 --> 00:00:39.398
 The Algerian people are crazy about the ball 

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:42.628
 The only thing in my mind that makes him happy 

00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:46.618
 Because there are problems that live like work ... a lot of problems 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.640
 What makes them happy is football 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.610
 Is the key to the joy and pride of all the Algerians 

00:00:54.073 --> 00:00:56.113
 Do you think you can achieve a result against England? 

00:00:56.163 --> 00:01:00.443
 Of course we can play against big teams like England 

00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:11.013
 In the view of playing in front of England or major teams is better than the smaller teams that may lose control and lack of pressure 

00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:18.703
 The elements of our team are young and have gaps in age compared to previous elements 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.679
 Your coach was a great player and famous in Algeria right? 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.570
 In my opinion Saadane is not a full coach 

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:36.042
 I'm not saying that Saadane is not good but he needs to draw good tactical lines 

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:40.019
 When you see Algeria, England faces what you will feel 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.780
 I can not imagine that 

00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:47.798
 Will you see it here in London? 

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:51.925
 Of course, of course 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.330
 By us we qualify for the expense of Egypt this is the achievement either the World Cup is for fun and watching 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.089
 The players will offer all their possessions without pressure and joy in participation and why not go away 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.060
 To the final or final half of what not ... everything is now possible
