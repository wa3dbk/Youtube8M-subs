00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.869 

the<00:00:04.440> way<00:00:04.589> we<00:00:04.710> got<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.980> waterfall<00:00:05.400> effect<00:00:05.549> is

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
the way we got the waterfall effect is

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.650 
the way we got the waterfall effect is
very<00:00:06.029> simple<00:00:06.569> Gina<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.500> just<00:00:07.740> took<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.950> big

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
very simple Gina and I just took a big

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.570 
very simple Gina and I just took a big
like<00:00:09.660> blue<00:00:09.870> velvet<00:00:10.260> curtain<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:11.040> we<00:00:11.219> painted

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
like blue velvet curtain and we painted

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.780 
like blue velvet curtain and we painted
it<00:00:12.410> with<00:00:13.410> with<00:00:13.769> areas<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.340> light<00:00:14.549> blue

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
it with with areas of like light blue

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.500 
it with with areas of like light blue
and<00:00:15.000> whites<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.690> get<00:00:15.839> like<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> water<00:00:16.379> effect<00:00:17.510> we

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and whites to get like a water effect we

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.540 
and whites to get like a water effect we
stitched<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.900> into<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> big<00:00:19.350> loop<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.189> was<00:00:20.369> just

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
stitched it into a big loop and was just

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.090 
stitched it into a big loop and was just
on<00:00:20.760> rollers<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.869> each<00:00:22.410> time<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.949> did<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
on rollers so each time we did a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830 
on rollers so each time we did a
waterfall<00:00:23.670> shot<00:00:23.970> way<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> adjust<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
waterfall shot way to adjust the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.269 
waterfall shot way to adjust the
lighting<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.529> could<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> four

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
lighting so that we could do a four

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.550 
lighting so that we could do a four
second<00:00:26.789> exposure<00:00:27.090> at<00:00:27.359> least<00:00:27.570> which<00:00:28.320> gave<00:00:28.529> us

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
second exposure at least which gave us

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.209 
second exposure at least which gave us
enough<00:00:28.920> time<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.550> move<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.599> fabric<00:00:30.980> in<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
enough time to move the fabric in the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.889 
enough time to move the fabric in the
direction<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.730> wanted<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> had<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> kind<00:00:33.750> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
direction we wanted so it had a kind of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.260 
direction we wanted so it had a kind of
motion<00:00:34.320> blur<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.680> felt<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:34.980> water<00:00:37.070> was

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
motion blur that felt like water was

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.700 
motion blur that felt like water was
turning<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> entire<00:00:39.719> set<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.590> had

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
turning the entire set which we had

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
turning the entire set which we had
built<00:00:40.980> vertically<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.180> making<00:00:42.540> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
built vertically and making it

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.779 
built vertically and making it
horizontal<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.890> was<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.219> thing<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.670> was

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
horizontal so that was one thing it was

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.240 
horizontal so that was one thing it was
a<00:00:44.820> very<00:00:45.120> intricate<00:00:46.050> set<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:46.980> tied

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
a very intricate set that was all tied

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.740 
a very intricate set that was all tied
together<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.700> chicken<00:00:48.120> wire<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.480> think<00:00:48.660> it

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
together with chicken wire I think it

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.020 
together with chicken wire I think it
might<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:49.020> worth<00:00:49.170> pointing<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.620> too<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.100> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
might be worth pointing out too that you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.310 
might be worth pointing out too that you
know<00:00:51.120> tradition<00:00:51.570> stop-motion<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
know tradition stop-motion is one of the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.920 
know tradition stop-motion is one of the
oldest<00:00:53.030> oils<00:00:54.030> tricks<00:00:54.300> without<00:00:54.480> that's<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
oldest oils tricks without that's one of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.270 
oldest oils tricks without that's one of
those<00:00:55.020> tricks<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> book<00:00:55.649> how<00:00:55.949> much<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
those tricks in the book how much the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.599 
those tricks in the book how much the
filmmaker<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.510> all<00:00:57.660> practical<00:00:58.170> so

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
filmmaker and it's all practical so

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.010 
filmmaker and it's all practical so
painted<00:00:59.609> backgrounds<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.359> little<00:01:00.600> toys<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
painted backgrounds and little toys that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.439 
painted backgrounds and little toys that
you<00:01:01.079> play<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.469> more<00:01:02.370> recently<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.000> computers

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you play with more recently as computers

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
you play with more recently as computers
have<00:01:03.600> sort<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> infiltrated<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.860> filmmaking

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
have sort of infiltrated the filmmaking

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
have sort of infiltrated the filmmaking
world<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.909> become<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:07.200> main

world and have become the main
powerhouse<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.920> animation<00:01:08.400> there's<00:01:08.610> still<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
powerhouse for animation there's still a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.090 
powerhouse for animation there's still a
lot<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.450> computer<00:01:10.200> integration<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.860> visual

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
lot of computer integration for visual

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.000 
lot of computer integration for visual
effects<00:01:11.400> even<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.330> stop-motion<00:01:12.540> film<00:01:13.140> whereas

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
effects even in stop-motion film whereas

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.190 
effects even in stop-motion film whereas
we<00:01:14.210> intentionally<00:01:15.210> decided<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.780> keep<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> kind

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
we intentionally decided to keep it kind

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.050 
we intentionally decided to keep it kind
of<00:01:16.350> low-tech<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> lot<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.700> practical

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
of low-tech and do a lot of practical

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.700 
of low-tech and do a lot of practical
visual<00:01:18.420> effects<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.140> being<00:01:19.350> said<00:01:19.409> we

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
visual effects but that being said we

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.030 
visual effects but that being said we
still<00:01:19.920> had<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:21.110> they<00:01:22.110> weren't<00:01:22.290> 3d<00:01:22.650> rendering

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
still had to they weren't 3d rendering

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.820 
still had to they weren't 3d rendering
yet<00:01:23.159> they're<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:23.780> things<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:25.020> shot<00:01:25.320> pieces

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
yet they're all things we shot pieces

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.280 
yet they're all things we shot pieces
pieces<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.610> shot<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> together<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.080> layers

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
pieces we shot and together the layers

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.440 
pieces we shot and together the layers
it<00:01:28.890> was<00:01:29.009> essentially<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.579> five<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it was essentially like five I think it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.800 
it was essentially like five I think it
was<00:01:30.570> five<00:01:30.780> different<00:01:31.020> layers<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:32.810> created

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
was five different layers that created

00:01:33.810 --> 00:02:11.120 
was five different layers that created
that<00:01:33.840> shot

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.190
