00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.080
 two 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.030
 hello welcome to tribal today 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.200
 we will teach you to make two delicious 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.200
 desserts for this reality 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.619
 let's start for the first idea 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.660
 we are going to need falls with cream 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.500
 decorations for cakes sticks 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 skewer an egg medium loose sugar 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.210
 lemon 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.910
 The first thing we will do is break the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.910
 egg and put the clear in the container 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.860
 we will beat until the snow point that 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.960
 it means that it has a consistency 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.420
 fluffy last to know when is 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.070
 list what if we pour the container 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.650
 in the mixture should not fall 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.770
 now with a colander we will put the sugar 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.200
 flower to remove all the groups and 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.540
 let's beat until the whole mixture is 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.990
 and create a bright consistency and without 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.990
 lumps 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.299
 we will add the lemon and we will go back to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.299
 shake 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.830
 while we are going to prepare the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.630
 cookies we will take the skewer sticks 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.630
 and we will put them in the cream part 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.930
 once ready this we are going to put the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.930
 real glasa in the cookie in this way 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.840
 and put it in refrigerator for 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.340
 approximately 10 minutes 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.050
 ah 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.879
 now we will almost cure as you want 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.390
 here we made different types 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.390
 of snow monkeys 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.130
 or not 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.800
 one 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.800
 all right 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.080
 Y 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.960
 If you want to give a gift, you can put the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.960
 tape and ready 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.490
 do not 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.000
 for an idea number 2 what 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.000
 we need is a chocolate cake 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 decorations 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.060
 and dyes strawberries molds and the same 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.610
 real class that we did amazing 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.000
 The first thing we will do is cut the 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.000
 what what 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.610
 now with a cookie mold 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.820
 we will cut circular shapes in which 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.820
 my 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.040
 in the strawberries what we will do 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.049
 cut the part of the leaves and 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.180
 it has to be as skinny as possible 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.349
 so that it does not fall at the moment of 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.349
 put it on the cake 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.440
 to real class we will give green 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.890
 with the dyes 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.290
 we are going to add yellow droplets and 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.680
 blue until we achieve the green that 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.680
 we want 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.100
 or 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.980
 to make a sleeve we will take a bag 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.400
 plastic and the scissors and we will cut one 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.400
 tip 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.050
 then we will put the mouthpiece shaped like 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.060
 star 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.409

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.319
 sleeve 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.120

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.360
 and now we will begin to fill in a link 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.740
 around the strawberry creating the 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.740
 feeling of a Christmas pine 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.030
 once all ready we will begin to
