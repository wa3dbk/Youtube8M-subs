passcode<00:02:08.080> one<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.110> bought<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.619> internet

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
passcode one I bought the internet

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.620 
passcode one I bought the internet
doesn't<00:02:10.280> really<00:02:10.460> match<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:11.000> because<00:02:11.390> it's

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
doesn't really match it because it's

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:25.420 
doesn't really match it because it's
like<00:02:12.790> might<00:02:13.790> won't<00:02:13.970> match<00:02:14.150> it

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.729 

now<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.239> online<00:02:26.450> passcode<00:02:27.079> gave<00:02:27.349> me<00:02:27.500> off<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
now the online passcode gave me off the

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.970 
now the online passcode gave me off the
Internet<00:02:28.099> is<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:29.329> five<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:33.290> five<00:02:33.349> by<00:02:33.739> five

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
Internet is a five it's five by five

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.250 
Internet is a five it's five by five
meaning<00:02:34.430> five<00:02:34.730> letters<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.599> then<00:02:35.720> space<00:02:35.989> and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
meaning five letters and then space and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.110 
meaning five letters and then space and
then<00:02:36.349> five<00:02:36.769> layers<00:02:37.040> continue

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
then five layers continue

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.479 
then five layers continue
so<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:38.540> redeemed<00:02:38.870> code<00:02:39.170> they<00:02:40.010> come<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.370> to

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
so it's redeemed code they come on to

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.210 
so it's redeemed code they come on to
this<00:02:40.610> bit<00:02:40.849> here<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:42.530> wait<00:02:42.739> for<00:02:42.769> it<00:02:43.010> but<00:02:43.040> it
