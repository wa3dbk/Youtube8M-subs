made from a nylon chassis and then the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.130 
made from a nylon chassis and then the
entire<00:00:35.670> thing<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.090> coated<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.450> 100<00:00:36.809> percent

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140

waterproof polyurethane so it's really
good<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.050> keeping<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.379> water<00:00:40.530> out<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.070> very

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
good at keeping the water out it's very

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.950 
good at keeping the water out it's very
lightweight<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.480> roll<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.809> up

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
lightweight you can actually roll it up

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
lightweight you can actually roll it up
and<00:00:43.050> stuff<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.500> into<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.800> pocket<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.370> make<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and stuff it into a pocket and make it a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.100 
and stuff it into a pocket and make it a
self-contained<00:00:45.360> unit<00:00:45.570> when<00:00:45.870> you're<00:00:45.989> not

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
self-contained unit when you're not

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600 
self-contained unit when you're not
using<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.710> easy<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> carry<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
using it so it's easy to carry on the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.100 
using it so it's easy to carry on the
bike<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> saddle<00:00:48.539> bag<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:48.809> something

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
bike like in a saddle bag or something

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.189 
bike like in a saddle bag or something
also<00:00:50.149> it's<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.449> nice<00:00:51.539> reflective<00:00:51.989> gear

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
also it's got some nice reflective gear

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.959 
also it's got some nice reflective gear
on<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> logo<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.920> reflective<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.789> got

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
on it the logo is reflective it's got

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.010 
on it the logo is reflective it's got
some<00:00:54.149> piping<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
some piping on it

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.330 
some piping on it
so<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.469> other<00:00:55.680> motors<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.100> gonna<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.280> able

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
so that other motors are gonna be able

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.650 
so that other motors are gonna be able
to<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.789> pretty<00:00:57.000> well<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> lot<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> times
