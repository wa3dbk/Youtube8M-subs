00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.290 
is going to be steep fall burrow let's
go<00:00:16.350> ahead<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.619> activate<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> location<00:00:17.609> there

go ahead and activate the location there

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.210 
go ahead and activate the location there
we<00:00:18.449> go<00:00:18.600> steep<00:00:18.960> fall<00:00:19.170> burrow<00:00:19.439> discovered<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
we go steep fall burrow discovered and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.910 
we go steep fall burrow discovered and
you'll<00:00:20.340> also<00:00:20.550> notice<00:00:20.939> there's<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.300> very<00:00:21.920> closed

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
you'll also notice there's a very closed

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.599 
you'll also notice there's a very closed
location<00:00:23.519> down<00:00:23.730> there<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.240> that's<00:00:24.689> actually

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
location down there and that's actually

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.529 
location down there and that's actually
related<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.119> believe<00:00:27.300> it's

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
related to this one I believe it's

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.390 
related to this one I believe it's
called<00:00:27.660> like<00:00:27.869> lower<00:00:28.230> steep<00:00:28.710> fall<00:00:28.920> burrow<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
called like lower steep fall burrow so

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.730 
called like lower steep fall burrow so
we<00:00:29.550> should<00:00:29.849> exit<00:00:30.390> there<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.260> use<00:00:31.470> my

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
we should exit there if I can use my

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.490 
we should exit there if I can use my
skyrim<00:00:32.279> intuition<00:00:32.940> right<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> place<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
skyrim intuition right so this place is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.170 
skyrim intuition right so this place is
located<00:00:34.739> actually<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.489> don't<00:00:35.550> even<00:00:35.730> know<00:00:35.940> where

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
located actually I don't even know where

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.590 
located actually I don't even know where
it's<00:00:36.360> located<00:00:36.510> oh<00:00:37.969> okay<00:00:38.969> there's<00:00:39.210> Steve<00:00:39.420> all

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it's located oh okay there's Steve all

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.580 
it's located oh okay there's Steve all
burrow<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.230> relation<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.899> over<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.260> would<00:00:43.440> be

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
burrow in relation to over here would be

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.639 
burrow in relation to over here would be
Solitude<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.610> down<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:47.390> Markarth

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
Solitude and down here would be Markarth

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.560 
Solitude and down here would be Markarth
so<00:00:49.649> let's<00:00:49.980> scroll<00:00:50.280> back<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.120> way<00:00:51.149> back<00:00:51.210> up

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so let's scroll back all the way back up

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.970 
so let's scroll back all the way back up
here<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.320> where<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.530> want<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.890> if

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
here and this is where you want to go if

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.410 
here and this is where you want to go if
you<00:00:53.070> want<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> find<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.610> location

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you want to find this location

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
you want to find this location
it's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.199> cave<00:00:55.500> let's<00:00:56.489> head<00:00:56.730> inside<00:00:58.370> alrighty

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
it's a cave let's head inside alrighty

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.400 
it's a cave let's head inside alrighty
so<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.699> looks<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> snowed<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.870> cave

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
so it looks to be like a snowed in cave

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.729 
so it looks to be like a snowed in cave
and<00:01:01.739> apparently<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.899> location<00:01:03.899> has<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> quest

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and apparently this location has a quest

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
and apparently this location has a quest
I<00:01:04.920> believe<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.700> miscellaneous<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.450> fact

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
I believe it's a miscellaneous in fact

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.130 
I believe it's a miscellaneous in fact
I'm<00:01:06.780> 99.9%<00:01:07.380> sure<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.400> I've<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:09.750> my<00:01:09.900> best

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
I'm 99.9% sure because I've to my best

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
I'm 99.9% sure because I've to my best
ability<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.950> I've<00:01:11.220> done<00:01:11.400> pretty<00:01:11.640> much

ability I know I've done pretty much

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520 
ability I know I've done pretty much
every<00:01:12.299> single<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.930> quests<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.350> this

I<00:03:17.470> was<00:03:17.620> talking<00:03:17.889> about<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.160> beginning<00:03:18.459> of

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
I was talking about the beginning of

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.340 
I was talking about the beginning of
this<00:03:18.670> episode<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:19.690> could<00:03:19.840> probably<00:03:19.989> try<00:03:20.230> and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
this episode so I could probably try and

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.229 
this episode so I could probably try and
do<00:03:20.500> some<00:03:20.709> parkour<00:03:20.920> with<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.519> whirlwind

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
do some parkour with the whirlwind

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.629 
do some parkour with the whirlwind
sprint<00:03:22.329> shot<00:03:22.690> but<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.900> think<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> better

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
sprint shot but I think it's a better

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.220 
sprint shot but I think it's a better
thing<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.269> better<00:03:25.540> thing<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.750> do<00:03:25.930> would<00:03:26.019> be<00:03:26.079> to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
thing a better thing to do would be to

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.319 
thing a better thing to do would be to
exit<00:03:26.859> here<00:03:27.069> and<00:03:27.130> let's<00:03:27.430> go<00:03:27.609> ahead<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.940> explore

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
exit here and let's go ahead and explore

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.800 
exit here and let's go ahead and explore
the<00:03:28.540> other<00:03:28.720> location<00:03:30.150> alrighty<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.450> lower

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the other location alrighty so lower

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.960 
the other location alrighty so lower
steep<00:03:32.470> fall<00:03:32.709> burrow<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.250> going<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.579> be<00:03:33.700> right

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
steep fall burrow is going to be right

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.580 
steep fall burrow is going to be right
over<00:03:34.030> here<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:34.989> gonna<00:03:35.079> be<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> bit<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.530> a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
over here and it's gonna be a bit of a

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.229 
over here and it's gonna be a bit of a
drop<00:03:35.829> obviously<00:03:36.370> because<00:03:36.639> it's<00:03:36.790> connected<00:03:37.030> to

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
drop obviously because it's connected to

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.479 
drop obviously because it's connected to
that<00:03:37.450> giant<00:03:37.870> chasm<00:03:38.109> we<00:03:38.500> just<00:03:38.739> saw<00:03:38.920> there's

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
that giant chasm we just saw there's

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.759 
that giant chasm we just saw there's
also<00:03:39.700> another<00:03:40.209> unmarked<00:03:41.170> location<00:03:41.680> or

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
also another unmarked location or

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.520 
also another unmarked location or
unmarked<00:03:42.579> as<00:03:42.670> far<00:03:42.849> as<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.180> haven't<00:03:44.049> found<00:03:44.319> it

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
unmarked as far as I haven't found it

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.440 
unmarked as far as I haven't found it
over<00:03:44.920> there<00:03:45.190> which<00:03:45.430> looks<00:03:45.639> like<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.819> ship<00:03:46.209> not

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
over there which looks like a ship not

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.490 
over there which looks like a ship not
sure<00:03:46.660> how<00:03:46.810> big<00:03:46.989> that's<00:03:47.200> going<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.590> be

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
sure how big that's going to be

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.960 
sure how big that's going to be
I<00:03:48.560> think<00:03:49.130> that's<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.430> only<00:03:49.460> thing<00:03:49.640> around

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
I think that's the only thing around

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.880 
I think that's the only thing around
here<00:03:50.270> yes<00:03:50.540> so<00:03:50.750> lower<00:03:51.020> steep<00:03:51.410> fall<00:03:51.620> burrow

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
here yes so lower steep fall burrow

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.380 
here yes so lower steep fall burrow
let's<00:03:52.580> head<00:03:52.730> inside<00:03:52.880> this<00:03:53.180> one<00:03:54.370> okay<00:03:55.370> so<00:03:56.180> this

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
is going to be lower steep fall burrow

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.770 
is going to be lower steep fall burrow

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
we have a path to the left actually it

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.690 
we have a path to the left actually it
might<00:04:25.790> not<00:04:25.970> be<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.180> path<00:04:26.570> huh<00:04:27.500> looks<00:04:28.310> like<00:04:28.490> a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
might not be a path huh looks like a

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.130 
might not be a path huh looks like a
water<00:04:29.000> path<00:04:29.270> alright<00:04:29.570> we'll<00:04:29.750> save<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:29.960> for

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
water path alright we'll save that for

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.530 
water path alright we'll save that for
later<00:04:30.500> let's<00:04:30.680> head<00:04:30.919> up<00:04:31.040> here<00:04:31.400> because<00:04:32.270> this<00:04:32.419> is

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
later let's head up here because this is

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.940 
later let's head up here because this is
probably<00:04:32.780> going<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:32.960> be<00:04:33.020> enclosed<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:33.770> if<00:04:33.830> we

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
probably going to be enclosed so if we

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.590 
probably going to be enclosed so if we
look<00:04:34.160> up<00:04:34.370> okay<00:04:34.730> so<00:04:34.790> we're<00:04:35.000> not<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.360> part

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
look up okay so we're not to the part

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.810 
look up okay so we're not to the part
where<00:04:35.750> we<00:04:35.900> were<00:04:36.080> before<00:04:36.320> yet<00:04:36.740> is<00:04:37.550> there

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
where we were before yet is there

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.900 
where we were before yet is there
anything<00:04:38.210> up<00:04:38.720> here<00:04:39.020> there<00:04:39.200> should<00:04:39.440> be<00:04:39.910> let's

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
anything up here there should be let's

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.420 
anything up here there should be let's
see<00:04:41.350> we<00:04:42.350> have<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:43.130> corundum<00:04:43.790> or<00:04:44.150> vein<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.430> a

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
see we have a corundum or vein and a

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.350 
see we have a corundum or vein and a
hunter<00:04:47.150> which<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:48.320> going<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.830> have<00:04:49.300> just<00:04:50.300> some

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
hunter which is going to have just some

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.680 
hunter which is going to have just some
arrows<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:51.050> some<00:04:51.320> gold<00:04:51.650> alright<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:53.570> I<00:04:53.600> think

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
arrows and some gold alright so I think

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.390 
arrows and some gold alright so I think
if<00:04:54.020> we<00:04:54.169> take<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.410> dip<00:04:54.710> through<00:04:54.979> here<00:04:55.220> we're

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
if we take a dip through here we're

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.670 
if we take a dip through here we're
going<00:04:55.669> to<00:04:55.760> end<00:04:55.910> up<00:04:56.060> into<00:04:56.390> that<00:04:56.630> giant<00:04:57.020> chasm

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
going to end up into that giant chasm

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.580 
going to end up into that giant chasm
that<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.860> was<00:04:58.040> talking<00:04:58.220> about<00:04:58.430> before<00:04:59.470> let's<00:05:00.470> go
