of like where I'm and break them in

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.439

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.559 
complaints honestly I think that for the
price<00:05:43.129> of<00:05:43.159> the<00:05:43.490> jeans<00:05:43.699> even<00:05:43.939> without<00:05:44.389> the

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
price of the jeans even without the

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.299 
price of the jeans even without the
discount<00:05:44.990> for<00:05:45.289> the<00:05:45.499> three<00:05:45.800> for<00:05:46.099> each

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:46.309 
discount for the three for each

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:47.829 
discount for the three for each
individual<00:05:46.939> price<00:05:47.209> I<00:05:47.419> thought<00:05:47.599> they<00:05:47.779> were

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:47.839 
individual price I thought they were

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:50.079 
individual price I thought they were
great<00:05:48.199> because<00:05:48.740> high-waisted<00:05:49.490> jeans<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.879> mean

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.089 
great because high-waisted jeans I mean

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:51.999 
great because high-waisted jeans I mean
like<00:05:50.449> they<00:05:50.659> tend<00:05:50.959> to<00:05:51.080> run<00:05:51.319> really<00:05:51.680> expensive

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
like they tend to run really expensive

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:53.920 
like they tend to run really expensive
and<00:05:52.430> that's<00:05:52.819> what<00:05:53.300> stopped<00:05:53.659> me<00:05:53.809> from

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
and that's what stopped me from

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.139 
and that's what stopped me from
purchasing<00:05:54.469> from<00:05:54.589> a<00:05:54.740> lot<00:05:54.889> of<00:05:54.919> online<00:05:55.249> sites<00:05:55.819> on

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:56.149 
purchasing from a lot of online sites on

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:58.209 
purchasing from a lot of online sites on

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
because they were like really expensive

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.699 
because they were like really expensive
and<00:05:58.669> I'm<00:05:59.059> like<00:05:59.269> I'm<00:05:59.509> not<00:05:59.809> even<00:06:00.080> really<00:06:00.229> tried

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:00.709 
and I'm like I'm not even really tried

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:03.670 
and I'm like I'm not even really tried
them<00:06:01.039> on<00:06:01.659> to<00:06:02.659> try<00:06:02.839> to<00:06:02.870> pay<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.289> amount<00:06:03.319> of
