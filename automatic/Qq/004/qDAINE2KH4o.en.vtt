00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.160
Hi.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.780
This is Carrie from Carrie and Toys.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.480
Today, we will be playing with Kongsuni’s Songi Dressing Table.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.480
Let’s start.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.520
Carrie.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.620
Carrie: Wait. Aren’t you Lucy whopunish the bad guys? What’s the matter, Lucy?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.220
Lucy: Carrie, I’m in trouble.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.540
Carrie: What happened? Did the villains attack?

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.240
Lucy: No, that’s not it. I need to ask you a favor.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.480
Carrie: To Carrie? What is it?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.540
Lucy: Turn me into a human being.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.180
Carrie: To a human being? Why human? What’s up?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.820
Lucy: Actually, I saw this guy while walking and he was really hot.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.320
Carrie: You want to change yourself to a humanbeing just because of a guy?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.120
Carrie: You can datean animal. Lucy, date an animal.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.640
Lucy: No, I really want to date the guy. Turn me into a human.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.840
Carrie: Well, Carrie thinks it might be hard.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.160
Lucy: No, I already heard the rumor.You have a magic dressing table thatcan make me a human being.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.120
Carrie: How did you know?

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.520
What will you do for me in return?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480
Will you find a guy for me to date too? You?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.280
Wait a minute. Carrie will bring it.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.620
Lucy: Wow. Is this the famous transformation gadget we were talking about?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.820
Carrie: Yep. Wait a minute.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.040
It also needs to transform itself first.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.300
Incredible, right? Amazing, right? This is really cool.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.920
There are so many things inside.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.500
Transform, transform.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.740
Transform, my dressing table.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.220
Ta-da.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.980
This is amazing, right?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.300
Lucy: Carrie, can I touch it?

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.500
Carrie: No. From now on, I will turn you into a human.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.460
Hmm, you have big eyes for a human.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.140
What do we do with the eyes?

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.540
Can you make your eyes a bit smaller?

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.400
Firstly, I will put some lipstick on.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.540
You are so red though.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.620
You are all red.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.960
It’s not going to work.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.360
I will also put a shadow on.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.940
On your eyes.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:07.700
Let’s wear shoes like a human and put on a headband.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.980
You might have too big of a head.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.440
You look a bit like a human now.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:31.400
Let’s brush your hair.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.800
You look like you’re shedding.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.580
Should we also put on a hairpin?

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.180
Let’s do it. Make it pretty with a hairpin.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.800
Lastly,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.960
guess what this is.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.260
Lucy: Wow, Carrie. What is it?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.800
Carrie: This is the magic perfume that will make you a human.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.380
Lucy: I want it. Spray it. Spray it.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.080
Carrie: For free?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.340
Don’t forget the promise you made with Carrie, ok?

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.820
Pinky promise.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.100
Now, let’s transform.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.180
One,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.180
two,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.900
three.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.480
Carrie: Lucy. You’re so beautiful.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.840
Lucy: Carrie, did I really transform? Did I really turn into a human?

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.400
Carrie:Yeah, take a look in the mirror.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.020
Lucy: Wow, I’m so pretty.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.920
Carrie: Well, you usually don’t say you’re pretty yourself, others do.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.940
Anyways, you are prettier than Carrie. I am jealous.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.760
Did I make you too pretty?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.560
Lucy: Carrie, you are the best. Thank you.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.020
Carrie: Now, what are you going to say to the guy?

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.920
You can’t say you’re Lucy.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.320
Let me give you a name.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.600
Since this is the magic Songi dressing table, you can name yourself Songi. What do you think?

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.960
Lucy: Sounds good.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.880
Now, can I go meet the guy?

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.960
Carrie: Everything’s done on my side. Oh, she’s leaving just like that. Don’t forget our promise.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.480
Good luck meeting with the guy.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.560
Lucy: Ok, Carrie. I’ll tell you all about it when I come back.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.760
Carrie: Wait. Can Carrie follow you and see what happens?

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.960
I actually also have a guy in mind. I want to get some ideas.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.260
Lucy: Of course. Then follow me.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.480
Carrie: Lucy, Lucy.Where is the guy? Right.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.400
You are not Lucy anymore. Songi, where is the guy?

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400
Lucy: Where is he?

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.460
Carrie: Where, where?

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.520
Lucy: Over there.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.200
Carrie: That guy?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.300
Lucy: yes! He is so hot. So cool.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.680
Carrie: No.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.400
Lucy: Why not?

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.340
Carrie: Do you want to fight with me?

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.700
He is the kind of guy Carrie likes.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.300
Lucy: What are you talking about, Carrie? I had my eye on that guy first.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.500
Carrie: You had your eye on him? There’s no such thing. Whoever gets him first is all that matters.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.740
You are an animal, Lucy.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.600
Lucy: What are you talking about? I’m Songi.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.220
Carrie: Since when were you Songi?

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:40.320
Oh, I forgot to tell you that you are going to change back in 12 hours.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.720
Lucy: What are you talking about, Carrie? Isn’t that too cruel?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.420
Carrie: Love is cruel.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:53.180
Now, I’m going to hit on him first. Songi, bye.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.760
The Guy: Hello, there.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.860
Carrie: Oh, he talked to me.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.260
Hi, there. I am so embarrassed.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.880
The Guy: If you are not too busy, can we go get some tea?

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:16.700
Carrie: Sure. I will definitely go. Where should we go? It’s on me. I have lots of money.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.000
The Guy: Should we go?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.860
Carrie. Yes. Let’s hold hands and go.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.460
Today, we played with Kongsuni’s Songi Dressing Table.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.020
How was it? Did you have fun?

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.780
Carrie will be back with more fun toys next week.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.780
Bye-bye.
