00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
just going to start detailing it from

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.039 
just going to start detailing it from
the<00:01:44.579> bottom<00:01:44.939> building<00:01:45.299> all<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> way<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.810> so

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the bottom building all the way up so

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.690 
the bottom building all the way up so
that<00:01:46.079> way<00:01:46.290> you're<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.890> know<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.549> doing

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that way you're not you know just doing

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.660 
that way you're not you know just doing
this<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.570> breaking<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.500> down<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.460> hair

much 89 percent we are ready to go to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.990 
much 89 percent we are ready to go to
the<00:02:42.590> last<00:02:42.800> step<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.370> most<00:02:43.430> important

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
the last step and the most important

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.660 
the last step and the most important

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
the cold setting and I would definitely

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.740 
the cold setting and I would definitely
recommend<00:02:48.500> having<00:02:49.160> or<00:02:49.430> getting<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.030> blow<00:02:50.510> dryer

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
recommend having or getting a blow dryer

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.690 
recommend having or getting a blow dryer
with<00:02:50.990> negative<00:02:51.350> ions<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.070> what<00:02:52.220> that's<00:02:52.490> going

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
with negative ions and what that's going

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.880 
with negative ions and what that's going
to<00:02:52.760> do<00:02:52.910> is<00:02:53.030> going<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.270> lock<00:02:53.540> in<00:02:53.840> all<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.590> great

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
to do is going to lock in all that great

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.949 
to do is going to lock in all that great
moisture<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.970> shine<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.300> we<00:02:56.630> had<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
moisture and shine that we had in the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:57.850 
moisture and shine that we had in the
hair<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.470> make<00:02:57.560> your<00:02:57.650> hair

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860

hair and is going to make your hair
extra<00:02:58.250> shiny<00:02:58.520> so<00:02:58.940> that's<00:02:59.660> not<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.930> tip<00:03:00.200> for<00:03:00.380> you

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
extra shiny so that's not a tip for you

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.050 
extra shiny so that's not a tip for you
so<00:03:00.860> basically<00:03:01.160> everything<00:03:01.610> I'm<00:03:01.730> going<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:01.910> do

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
so basically everything I'm going to do

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.000 
so basically everything I'm going to do
is<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:02.570> run<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.260> blow-dry<00:03:03.650> through<00:03:03.920> the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
is just run the blow-dry through the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.580 
is just run the blow-dry through the
hair<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.459> guide<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.209> with<00:03:05.510> my<00:03:05.840> brush<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.470> make

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
hair and guide it with my brush to make

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.949 
hair and guide it with my brush to make
sure<00:03:06.830> it's<00:03:07.010> like<00:03:07.100> nice<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.670> sleek<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.270> blows

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
sure it's like nice and sleek and blows

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.900 
sure it's like nice and sleek and blows
dry<00:03:09.230> it's<00:03:09.380> pretty<00:03:09.650> straight<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.190> this<00:03:10.760> whole

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
dry it's pretty straight and this whole

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.820 
dry it's pretty straight and this whole
process<00:03:11.090> usually<00:03:11.450> takes<00:03:11.660> me<00:03:12.050> about<00:03:12.260> 10

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
process usually takes me about 10

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.850 
process usually takes me about 10
minutes<00:03:13.070> of<00:03:13.400> cold<00:03:13.970> air<00:03:14.180> on<00:03:14.450> my<00:03:14.660> hair<00:03:14.930> no<00:03:15.590> heat
