 You may also be a sponsor 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:39.490
 Of you may know a player 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:42.280
 In any case, you can definitely 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.420
 that then the possibility times that 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.830
 she's one of those beautiful gaming 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.630
 notebooks in the cl the ethical 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.430
 that means really nice 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.950

 So it's free to participate 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.400
 and try makes clever it means yes 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.800
 nice it is definitely worth trying 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.150
 it is a 1000 euro laptop so the 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.250
 running hinterhergeschmissen 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.800
 olympic pretty crass now circle 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.970
 say that intake is so 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.890
 to be able to follow all you are going to 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.240
 Just press the channel of easy press 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.800
 so that you go the videos with the creeping thing 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.150
 Like the facebook page 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.030

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.459

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.630
 Make counting can it talk 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.950
 after all, not a bottomless vice ten 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.240
 but only a few words I should 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.830
 believe you can do that today 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.030
 I think everyone who counts over ten 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.850
 can probably participate somehow 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.350
 can and yes that was actually it 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.310
 I wish you much fun 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.450
 participate 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.700
 I'll probably himself again 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:47.560
 try because starts janina one has yes 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:50.190
 never enough three laptops 3 and only one 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.190
 old murderer 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.290
 you're breaking down an anecdote 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.720
 so this video somehow something 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.100
 except advertising humid I remember 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.170
 I have my brother at the time as I mean 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.290
 current laptop citizen bought at 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.880
 old given 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.680
 not for nothing but I have so 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.150
 who then new 600 tasted my 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.790
 older laptop I 've got him for 100 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.959
 I said here you can have that yes 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.489
 Ding looks like one now 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.410
 Swiss cheese at least keyboard and 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.030
 has paid accordingly 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.169
 he paid for it that's why I like it too 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.730
 not around but that's why he gets now 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.710
 mean now the older laptop then 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.460
 not because I know exactly that this also 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.840
 so will end or what deserves better 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.710
 So if you need a new laptop 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.060
 eg 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.380
 I will probably also attentive 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.940
 maybe he's lucky I know it 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.650
 Not 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.220
 to join in does no harm and I say 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.220
 like you
