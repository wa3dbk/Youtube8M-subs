while the GTR is far pleasure than
before<00:01:01.670> there<00:01:02.510> are<00:01:02.690> similarities<00:01:03.520> especially

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
before there are similarities especially

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.210 
before there are similarities especially
the<00:01:04.640> central<00:01:05.059> screen<00:01:05.320> but<00:01:06.320> there<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.500> one<00:01:06.650> big

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
the central screen but there is one big

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.740 
the central screen but there is one big
difference<00:01:07.430> that's<00:01:07.850> obvious<00:01:08.180> from<00:01:08.360> inside

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
difference that's obvious from inside

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.160 
difference that's obvious from inside
the<00:01:09.050> twin<00:01:09.740> clutch<00:01:10.040> 6-speed<00:01:10.910> auto<00:01:11.180> gearbox<00:01:11.690> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
the twin clutch 6-speed auto gearbox and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.450 
the twin clutch 6-speed auto gearbox and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
there's no manual gearbox no but will

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.940 
there's no manual gearbox no but will
the<00:01:16.640> v-spec<00:01:16.910> make<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.630> comeback<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.470> lighter

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
the v-spec make a comeback and lighter

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.750 
the v-spec make a comeback and lighter
faster<00:01:19.729> even<00:01:20.540> more<00:01:20.930> hardcore<00:01:21.440> GTR<00:01:22.040> I've<00:01:22.490> heard

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
faster even more hardcore GTR I've heard

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.280 
faster even more hardcore GTR I've heard
they'll<00:01:22.970> definitely<00:01:23.180> be<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.510> beast<00:01:23.780> back<00:01:24.080> down

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
they'll definitely be a beast back down

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:33.840 
they'll definitely be a beast back down
later<00:01:24.500> I<00:01:24.979> don't<00:01:25.940> know<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:27.040> secret<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.400> see

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.880 

this<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.150> sufficient<00:01:35.890> transmission

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
this is a sufficient transmission

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.760 
this is a sufficient transmission
control<00:01:37.280> yeah<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.750> shock<00:01:39.140> absorber

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
control yeah and this shock absorber

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.940 
control yeah and this shock absorber
control<00:01:40.250> here<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:40.960> take<00:01:41.960> stability<00:01:42.710> control

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
control here and take stability control

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.070 
control here and take stability control
program<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:44.119> with<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:44.390> stability<00:01:44.869> control

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
program so with the stability control

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.550 
program so with the stability control
you<00:01:45.440> can<00:01:45.590> be<00:01:45.710> off<00:01:45.950> off<00:01:47.560> normal<00:01:49.780> normal<00:01:50.780> yeah

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
you can be off off normal normal yeah

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.060 
you can be off off normal normal yeah
all<00:01:52.460> is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
all is

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.110 
all is
and<00:01:54.870> long-lived<00:01:55.870> right<00:01:56.700> each<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.970> these<00:01:58.060> three

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
and long-lived right each of these three

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.080 
and long-lived right each of these three
switches<00:01:58.780> has<00:01:59.170> three<00:01:59.500> different<00:01:59.830> settings<00:02:00.580> so

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
switches has three different settings so

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.000 
switches has three different settings so
the<00:02:01.210> GTR<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:01.900> more<00:02:02.110> adjustable<00:02:02.740> than<00:02:02.890> its

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
the GTR is more adjustable than its

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.700 
the GTR is more adjustable than its
predecessors<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.850> it's<00:02:04.350> 473<00:02:05.350> brake

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710
