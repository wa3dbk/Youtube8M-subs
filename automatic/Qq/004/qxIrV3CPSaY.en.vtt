00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.290
 yes hello together in let's play tools 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.730
 from the summer of 2014 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.379
 and in this video I take care of myself 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.960
 the first challenges are 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.430
 the something simple and there at the 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.860
 resume me the game again annoyed 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.990
 in which it has from 16 9 to 4 3 um 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.439
 the hall may be curious 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.300
 do 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.800
 but they were so incredibly easy 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.119
 is easily determined from a 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.700
 to make video by calling you now 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.309
 we show all five challenges 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.000
 begin with bidders of the dead and yes 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:40.359
 my train of thought like me 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.609
 I want to challenge myself on the slope 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.679
 of course you then suggest yes here 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.629
 just until that did a monstrous army 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.739
 gathered in the opposite direction 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.410
 smash 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.550
 I would have that unbelievably silly because 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.730
 The monstrous army consists of two 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.530
 zombies we have 322 vanilla bloggers 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.210
 the enemy we have two zombies and 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.390
 A rave times our cards look like 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.629
 follows out with dark brut and shoots 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.600
 not black creature of our choice then 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.830
 an unnatural robbing cancer out 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.990
 a temple of technology as great as +49 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.490
 lightning stripe damage in the face and the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:22.390
 Production shoots damage at height 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:26.650
 number of our are so four cheers 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.660
 so naturally, here is the crucial 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.280
 if you just attack the block 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.720
 Oppose our creatures one to one 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.230
 no harm is natural 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.850
 clear 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.320
 we are now still generating the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.930
 But tories do not care because we are supposed to 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.420
 In this train simply win at the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.410
 Of course, the block comes one 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.090
 Rave times, of course we go 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.010
 the influence of the course is a trample of damage 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.290
 our strongest creature tramples so 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.090
 five damage and he against that 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.980
 Immediately dead because he had only five lives 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.330
 you see in the place even we would have 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.860
 even playing the lightning bolt 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.600
 can hurt as even nine 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.730
 So you can do one right now 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.380
 really simple challenges 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.830
 let's get to the next one for the war 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.830
 prepare 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.729
 So here are the choices really 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.319
 easy at the beginning of the opponent 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.700
 to use a powerful defense 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.650
 your equipment in this train too 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.900
 win 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.910
 yes, we're back here like the classic that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.500
 go four against four 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.910
 and we now have a creature like that 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.110
 get as strong as possible and only 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.000
 with our equipments 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.250
 Here is the key card again 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.140
 oki data because there are plus 3 +0 is the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.060
 with the biggest damage bonus here 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.310
 I think so if I think so too 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.849
 Only three men in total and Trample 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.739
 damage 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.150
 we can eke out only a creature 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.380
 the strength has 3 or more and there 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.610
 Just use the example now 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.160
 reliable machete 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.349
 which is also a super low price 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.340
 performance ratio what you say yes 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.470
 you can think about that 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.840
 henkersmahlzeit because that has gives 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.819
 intimidate 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.500
 So do a fair tour block b that 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.299
 unfortunately not enough to enough 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.000
 to push through damage because you have to 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.549
 wait a little bit around so one man 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.140
 just upgraded from all times 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.000
 The NATO is giving a bonus now 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.170
 seven threesome creature and the only one 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.879
 Committee on the current survives the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.280
 we can create before that are the well 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.700
 in the skin gloves given a total of + 3 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.680
 + 0 for our creature and then has 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.420
 hold strength of 10 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.430
 in that the temple has damaged 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.349
 It does not matter how much 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.959
 opponent blocks by exactly 8 damage 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.769
 get 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.209
 he makes her of a place, a 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.599
 double block so six damage 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.430
 by 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.049
 however, a creature can not do that 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.700
 blocking are the two damages that are missing 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.650
 and so come overall at this 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.840
 challenge the eight needed 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.340
 damage points 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.340
 now come the war tactics 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.370
 in the first passage no longer 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.630
 I need the challenges 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.599
 think they are very transparent though 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.910
 good for beginners then quite okay here 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.280
 one has it already suggested 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.500
 always this situation 3 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.000
 returned the 3 4 against 4 something like that 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.650
 obviously a creature here 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.100
 So when the opponent it can not 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.830
 block 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.220
 yes if you do the oak cemetery ii 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.019
 plus 7 + 7 destroyed land a creature 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.670
 and here we can at an opponent four 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.709
 starving next to or losing a lot of lives 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.140
 let's live a lot yes at the 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.489
 you have to do a bit of a combative trick 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.959
 also i can find for beginners 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.030
 actually a very nice mission 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.919
 You do not have to reach for it first 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.260
 the pump plays then one waits too 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.790
 that the bloggers are declared so on 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.090
 the spot we see exactly this bear 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.400
 is not blocked against it with plus 7 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.960
 This gives him a strength of 9 and 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.620
 Skin our opponents exactly for nine 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.720
 I find it quite simple to harm me 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.430
 know the game mechanics already quite 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.990
 okay I would say he has ever 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:44.040
 played there I find it then completely 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.040
 just so we come to blood is life 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.039
 So also see the interaction of 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.640
 few cards is actually quite 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.600
 simple 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.530
 Here's an extremely simple one too 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.479
 thing as I think 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.340
 adversary with two creatures one man 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.960
 must here the block times the round the 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.550
 attack survival and in return to 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.450
 hew 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.530
 you can already see the enemy has one 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.930
 Fourth creature 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.970
 we have 21 flying creatures he two 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.740
 live or you say that went today 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.750
 opponents around I must be able to both 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.539
 every case for the 3 1 to the radio 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.620
 21 life link with thick 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:19.270
 Trampler 44 vanilla or both 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.310
 Resistance only have a reflection 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.810
 it does not matter which of us block it 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.490
 Here we prevent almost four losses 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.900
 Two live through the block 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.669
 life link and here we can 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.930
 three lives but five we hurt about it 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.669
 trampled that just does not have him 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.320
 calculated that the only one 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.850
 possibility what you can do here 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.190
 actually survives with two lives 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.930
 so many it off just a swamp 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.770
 after and as said the opponents can also 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.110
 just do not block 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.419
 say we cut down for 2 in the air and 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.560
 Blood test life is also great 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.000
 just done 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.790
 I am glad that I am now in 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.350
 show a video because it is so cruel 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.840
 to look at that alone that he is 30 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.120
 Seconds Video Good Last Kills That 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.669
 Great 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.380
 tending to be a good challenge 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:06.460
 but unfortunately it reveals the solution fits 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:07.750
 times on the enemy almost defeated only 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.980
 the truncheon cross is a triumph in the 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.330
 Away in this train 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.190
 win but now comes when 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.230
 Horse clock regenerates escapes death 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.590
 but is tapped piano the rule text 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.060
 the rowlings knows about regeneration 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.700
 Creatures that will regenerate 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.340
 tapped and in the field is easy 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.780
 we have three creatures threefold strength 3 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.639
 life thus speak the only one 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.220
 , wizard of Swabia had creature 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.020
 he says he has to regenerate it 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.820
 what he does, of course, will be her 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.460
 zapped so solved was a simple 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.800
 by the way, this does not mean anything here 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.750
 special yes you can need it 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.940
 the place does not even look and 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.010
 leaves you so for three on the head 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.139
 troll and there is already the 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.780
 first challenge or the last one 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.280
 said league active in advance of 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.200
 really really easy i hope that 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.550
 five advanced challenge 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.930
 then ask me a little bit more 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.610
 tends to market it out very much 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.200
 but would like to think a bit 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.270
 I really like that already 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.500
 Video here a place anyway 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.700
 I want the whole content of the 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.039
 play shows so also hear something 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.090
 just like that but as always wish you 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.450
 of course a nice day until the 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.450
 next
