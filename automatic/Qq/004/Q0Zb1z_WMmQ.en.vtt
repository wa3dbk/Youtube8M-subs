another good idea is to share your food
by<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:52.140> some<00:01:52.320> more<00:01:52.500> share<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.189> your

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
by do some more share it with your

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.190 
by do some more share it with your
neighbor<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.060> relatives<00:01:54.750> or

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
neighbor or with your relatives or

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.050 
neighbor or with your relatives or
something<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.280> you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
something like that and then you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.569 
something like that and then you
actually<00:01:57.450> get<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.990> another<00:01:58.799> day<00:01:59.009> they<00:01:59.399> cook

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
actually get it another day they cook

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.459 
actually get it another day they cook
for<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.570> good<00:02:00.719> idea<00:02:00.840> used<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> do

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
for you that's a good idea used to do

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.359 
for you that's a good idea used to do
this<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> student<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.820> works<00:02:03.140> um<00:02:04.369> so

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
this when I was a student it works um so

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.419 
this when I was a student it works um so
this<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.360> about<00:02:06.719> saving<00:02:07.590> leftovers<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
this is all about saving leftovers and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.960 
this is all about saving leftovers and
it's<00:02:08.580> very<00:02:08.879> good<00:02:09.060> idea<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.450> no

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it's very good idea is no

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.120 
it's very good idea is no
it<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.600> very<00:02:10.780> important<00:02:11.170> not<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.380> throw<00:02:12.040> away

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
it it's very important not to throw away

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.610 
it it's very important not to throw away
food<00:02:12.460> it's<00:02:12.880> very<00:02:13.300> unfortunate<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:14.080> lots<00:02:14.440> of

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
food or white is getting you know it's

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.900 
food or white is getting you know it's
about<00:02:17.350> one-third<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.190> food<00:02:18.370> produce<00:02:18.550> is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910

about one-third of the food produce is
thrown<00:02:19.210> away<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.350> about<00:02:20.590> 1<00:02:21.430> billion

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
thrown away and we have about 1 billion

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.540 
thrown away and we have about 1 billion
of<00:02:21.940> people<00:02:22.270> I'm<00:02:22.740> under<00:02:23.820> under<00:02:24.820> nourished<00:02:25.600> and
