00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.770
 so hello to all of you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.200
 found before you today for my 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.150
 new celebrity hairstyle series 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.000
 so we're going to do a hairstyle inspired by 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.469
 sarah michelle gellar 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.770
 so here we will start by separating 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:22.199
 the hair with a tail comb or 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 your finger then you're going to comb and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.060
 so the hair at the back the creped 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.460
 a little bit so if need be at the level so the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.610
 from this part pulled higher than the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 head 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.190
 so I do not need to create 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.190
 a lot but if you have hair 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.950
 do not hesitate to crepe during 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.559
 this step so then you go 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.100
 separate in fact the hair in three 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.800
 sections 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.809
 so you're going to leave the hair of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.260
 that on the sides actually to be able to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.379
 then the mats and and you continue 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.570
 of penny so this part at the back has 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.550
 stained to partition 6 " side if that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.629
 you disturb 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 then then you're going to make a kind 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.439
 of buns so the goal is that it 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.820
 is something pretty vague so if 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.130
 you have shorter hair or 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.439
 longer it will pose no problem task 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.390
 just here to take well in a set 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.040
 away you want and then you set with 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.040
 round pliers and clamps bed 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.450
 so until rendering is the one 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.450
 that you want 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.990
 so here we go then attacked the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.930
 first net reversed so it's great 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.350
 pretty on the actress because she so 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.670
 wicks the blonde image so it is 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.920
 true that some hairstyles make 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.140
 really very good when you have 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.640
 reflections I would say in the hair so 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.990
 the goal is really to do this 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.539
 net to pay so to take three 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.159
 strands and nate is actually on the 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.110
 underneath so I have already often done 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.000
 this technique so in others 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.159
 videos including my last video on 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.470
 madonna video on four movie listings 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.350
 hunger games so you can review my 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.690
 technique on the top right and my video 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.910
 so then you keep going back to 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.250
 each time we make departures years on 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.110
 the ends and you insert them towards 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.060
 the bottom you keep inserting 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.380
 you take hair you insert them 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.640
 from below you are all taking 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.959
 the hair they stay and then 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.459
 you continue mats and whose 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.920
 always backwards so that the 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.840
 made in fact be here already take 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.079
 the movement you are going to give 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.790
 then to the mat so you continue 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.200
 the net you can the mouth commands 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.750
 yayladag each small elastic 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.920
 admit it loosen slightly and you 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.780
 come set in fact around the bun 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.660
 with a small plett or two well 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.220
 sure that 7th well and you proceed 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.389
 exactly the same way 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.980
 on the right side so you make a 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.239
 reached paid 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.940
 the goal is that they stay no 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.350
 hair here on the front these 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.480
 kinds of hairstyle that is super 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.069
 same practice that I will go when we want 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.230
 to do sports or what, of course, that 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.410
 done very well but the sale is 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.300
 in that the hair does not bother me 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.740
 I do not like it at all so it's really 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.450
 kind of hairstyle that you can wear 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.250
 for many occasions me I wear it 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.920
 for work for an evening for a 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.330
 little any occasion 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.550
 so the mat to pour it just needs 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.960
 take the hand and then you 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.360
 will see it's super convenient and 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.860
 honestly it's true that in the end it's 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.480
 this note that I'm doing even more than 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.880
 the simple African nat because 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.110
 I really appreciate the relief side 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.000
 makes of this note 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.190
 especially you can play with and more 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.470
 you loose it and often it will be 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.780
 nice so the only difference is that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.730
 on sarah michelle gellar there you do not have 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.410
 not in fact to loosen too much what is 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.580
 pretty on her it's precisely that she 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.110
 brings tight enough so you set the 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.710
 same way that you did it with the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.480
 first net you can loosen a 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.430
 little bit like I do on the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.930
 top and the bun in itself 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.120
 small hair exceed if you 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.560
 prefer ditto on the 2 years of your 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.110
 face if you feel like leaving some 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.990
 hair and so here is the result of 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.670
 this celebrity hairstyle i hope in 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.830
 any case that the result pleases you 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.239
 see it's not very complicated 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.770
 not reproduce and send me 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.280
 photos on facebook it makes me super 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.870
 pleasure 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.520
 so here I am making you standards 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.050
 kisses and thank you to all 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.050
 to be so many very quickly
