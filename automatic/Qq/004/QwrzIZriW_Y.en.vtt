00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
as a spare was only showing it was

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
getting to 230 degrees and so I turned

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.660 
getting to 230 degrees and so I turned
the<00:00:56.730> temperature<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.019> smoker<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.670> 275

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the temperature up on the smoker to 275

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.369 
the temperature up on the smoker to 275
which<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> maximum<00:01:00.780> temperature<00:01:01.019> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
which is the maximum temperature the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.250 
which is the maximum temperature the
smoker<00:01:01.679> will<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> still<00:01:03.809> wouldn't

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
smoker will go to and it still wouldn't

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.690 
smoker will go to and it still wouldn't
break<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.739> 235<00:01:05.670> degree<00:01:05.880> mark<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.340> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
break that 235 degree mark and so I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.610 
break that 235 degree mark and so I
thought<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.110> these<00:01:10.230> chickens

chickens back up to two hundred

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.889 
chickens back up to two hundred
thirty-five<00:01:23.280> degrees<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:24.240> was<00:01:24.420> ridiculous

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
thirty-five degrees which was ridiculous

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.370 
thirty-five degrees which was ridiculous
there<00:01:25.350> had<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.649> something<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:27.079> so<00:01:28.079> my

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
there had to be something going on so my

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.810 
there had to be something going on so my
first<00:01:28.590> thought<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:29.009> well<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> elements

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
first thought was well the elements

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.679 
first thought was well the elements
starting<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.119> go<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:33.390> course<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
starting to go out and so of course I

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.120 
starting to go out and so of course I
opened<00:01:33.960> door<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.710> element<00:01:35.040> down

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
opened door you can see the element down

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.709 
opened door you can see the element down
in<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.670> wasn't<00:01:35.880> blowing<00:01:36.270> real

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
in there and it wasn't blowing real

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.440 
in there and it wasn't blowing real
bright<00:01:37.380> red<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.250> does<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.240> trying

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
bright red like it does when it's trying

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.770 
bright red like it does when it's trying
to<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:39.990> temperature<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> thought

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
to get up to temperature so I thought

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.350 
to get up to temperature so I thought
well<00:01:42.960> shoot<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.950> let<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> chicken

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
well shoot so I just let the chicken

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.630 
well shoot so I just let the chicken
smoke<00:01:45.689> at<00:01:45.990> 235<00:01:46.829> degrees<00:01:47.159> which<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
smoke at 235 degrees which is the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.510 
smoke at 235 degrees which is the
maximum<00:01:47.969> it<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.539> up<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.799> for<00:01:49.799> three<00:01:50.399> or

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
maximum it would get up to for three or

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
maximum it would get up to for three or
four<00:01:50.670> hours<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.630> give<00:01:51.780> him<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.020> smoky

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
four hours just to give him a smoky

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.580

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
looked like it was a ground wire and the

part they said they're going to send

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.240 
part they said they're going to send
some<00:04:43.130> instructions<00:04:43.729> on<00:04:43.880> how<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.060> do<00:04:44.330> this<00:04:45.250> and

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
some instructions on how to do this and

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.590 
some instructions on how to do this and
like<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:46.490> don't<00:04:46.729> even<00:04:46.940> know<00:04:47.030> exactly<00:04:47.270> I'm

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
like I don't even know exactly I'm

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.529 
like I don't even know exactly I'm
assuming<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:48.789> underneath<00:04:49.789> that<00:04:52.240> this<00:04:53.240> plate

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
assuming it's underneath that this plate

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.420 
assuming it's underneath that this plate
here<00:04:54.009> that's<00:04:55.009> all<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.160> can<00:04:55.340> figure<00:04:57.100> but<00:04:58.100> once<00:04:58.310> I

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
here that's all I can figure but once I

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.430 
here that's all I can figure but once I
get<00:04:58.639> it<00:04:58.759> I'll<00:04:58.940> make<00:04:59.180> another<00:04:59.419> video<00:04:59.630> on<00:05:00.110> how<00:05:00.380> to

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
get it I'll make another video on how to

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.170 
get it I'll make another video on how to
repair<00:05:00.860> this<00:05:01.100> thing<00:05:01.160> hopefully<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.910> can<00:05:02.000> get

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
repair this thing hopefully I can get

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.800 
repair this thing hopefully I can get
figured<00:05:02.570> out<00:05:02.690> easy<00:05:02.900> enough<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:04.810> something

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
figured out easy enough and something

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.150 
figured out easy enough and something
else<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:06.020> was<00:05:06.139> going<00:05:06.289> to<00:05:06.380> share<00:05:06.530> with<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.919> guys

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.060 

back<00:05:10.160> in<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.400> smoker<00:05:11.380> writing<00:05:12.380> right<00:05:12.620> in<00:05:12.770> here

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
back in the smoker writing right in here

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.379 
back in the smoker writing right in here
is<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:14.240> what<00:05:15.050> I<00:05:15.139> believe<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.410> be<00:05:15.740> the

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
is the what I believe to be the

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.490 
is the what I believe to be the
thermostat<00:05:17.389> for<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.810> internal<00:05:18.169> part<00:05:18.410> of

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
thermostat for the internal part of

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.240 
thermostat for the internal part of
smoker<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:20.120> it's<00:05:20.630> good<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:21.260> you<00:05:21.949> know<00:05:22.039> every

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
smoker and it's good to you know every

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.210 
smoker and it's good to you know every
couple<00:05:22.430> times<00:05:22.789> you<00:05:22.970> smoke<00:05:23.680> takes<00:05:24.680> up<00:05:24.889> and<00:05:25.039> wipe

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
couple times you smoke takes up and wipe

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.700 
couple times you smoke takes up and wipe
that<00:05:25.250> thermostat<00:05:25.880> off<00:05:26.330> to<00:05:27.259> get<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.470> cleaned

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
that thermostat off to get it cleaned

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.420 
that thermostat off to get it cleaned
off<00:05:27.860> so<00:05:28.130> it<00:05:28.280> reads<00:05:28.699> well<00:05:29.560> now<00:05:30.560> on<00:05:30.860> mine<00:05:31.130> the

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
off so it reads well now on mine the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.750 
off so it reads well now on mine the
temperature<00:05:32.000> probe<00:05:32.770> that's<00:05:33.770> built<00:05:34.130> in<00:05:34.430> I've

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
temperature probe that's built in I've

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.050 
temperature probe that's built in I've
done<00:05:35.000> already<00:05:35.240> ruined<00:05:35.720> mine<00:05:35.900> I<00:05:36.789> was<00:05:37.789> doing<00:05:38.030> a

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
done already ruined mine I was doing a

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.290 
done already ruined mine I was doing a
turkey<00:05:38.510> I<00:05:39.160> went<00:05:40.160> to<00:05:40.220> pull<00:05:40.400> and<00:05:40.639> pull<00:05:40.880> out<00:05:41.060> bird

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
turkey I went to pull and pull out bird

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.430 
turkey I went to pull and pull out bird
my<00:05:41.479> hands<00:05:41.660> are<00:05:41.810> greasy<00:05:42.099> and<00:05:43.099> pulled<00:05:43.400> the

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
my hands are greasy and pulled the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.950 
my hands are greasy and pulled the
sheeting<00:05:45.440> right<00:05:45.620> off<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.510> thermostat<00:05:47.510> probe

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
sheeting right off the thermostat probe

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.250 
sheeting right off the thermostat probe
so<00:05:48.770> now<00:05:48.949> it<00:05:49.070> won't<00:05:49.159> read<00:05:49.550> right

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
so now it won't read right

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.899 
so now it won't read right
and<00:05:51.260> why<00:05:51.440> I<00:05:51.470> had<00:05:51.740> masterbuilt<00:05:52.430> on<00:05:52.580> the<00:05:52.699> phone<00:05:52.880> I

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
and why I had masterbuilt on the phone I

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.640 
and why I had masterbuilt on the phone I
asked<00:05:53.389> them<00:05:53.510> about<00:05:53.630> that<00:05:54.050> they<00:05:54.260> said<00:05:54.409> I'd<00:05:54.530> have

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
asked them about that they said I'd have

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.500 
asked them about that they said I'd have
to<00:05:54.770> be<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:54.889> whole<00:05:55.070> new<00:05:55.310> housing<00:05:55.820> to<00:05:55.909> replace<00:05:56.240> it

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
to be a whole new housing to replace it

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.480 
to be a whole new housing to replace it
so<00:05:56.780> that's<00:05:56.990> one<00:05:57.229> downside<00:05:57.770> I'm<00:05:57.949> finding<00:05:58.340> out

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
so that's one downside I'm finding out

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.149 
so that's one downside I'm finding out
with<00:05:58.639> this<00:05:58.760> smoker<00:05:59.120> is<00:05:59.990> this<00:06:00.260> is<00:06:00.440> not<00:06:00.620> easily

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
with this smoker is this is not easily

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.120 
with this smoker is this is not easily
replaceable<00:06:02.320> master<00:06:03.320> build<00:06:03.500> another<00:06:03.680> hint<00:06:03.979> to

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
replaceable master build another hint to

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.070 
replaceable master build another hint to
you<00:06:04.250> make<00:06:04.430> this<00:06:04.610> so<00:06:04.820> just<00:06:05.000> plugs<00:06:05.360> it<00:06:05.570> in<00:06:05.690> so<00:06:05.960> it

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
you make this so just plugs it in so it
