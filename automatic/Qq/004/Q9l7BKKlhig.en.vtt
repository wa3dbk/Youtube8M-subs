program well bricks for kids is a
program<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.770> uses<00:00:35.670> Legos<00:00:36.300> motors<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> gears

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
program that uses Legos motors and gears

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.380

and<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.829> teach<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> children<00:00:38.309> how<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> build

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and we teach the children how to build

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.950 
and we teach the children how to build
motorized<00:00:40.290> models<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> use<00:00:41.399> LEGO<00:00:42.000> pieces<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
motorized models and use LEGO pieces and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
motorized models and use LEGO pieces and
they<00:00:43.320> learn<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.620> gear<00:00:43.860> ratio<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.610> they

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
they learn about gear ratio as they

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.299 
they learn about gear ratio as they
learn<00:00:44.850> about<00:00:45.149> how<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> work<00:00:46.469> together<00:00:46.649> more

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
learn about how to work together more

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.310 
learn about how to work together more
it's<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.610> social<00:00:48.180> right<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.750> its<00:00:48.870> hands<00:00:49.230> on

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it's like social right but its hands on

so<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.710> incorporates<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> math<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.550> science

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
so it incorporates the math and science

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.630 
so it incorporates the math and science
architecture<00:00:51.840> skills<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.640> engineering

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
architecture skills and engineering

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.479

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
Legos wait those are mini figs and they

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.340 
Legos wait those are mini figs and they
come<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:18.060> together<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:18.780> work<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.140> teams
