00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.720
 and that after friends of direction 50 and this 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.939
 once with the fourth floor of decorations 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.320
 stable wants to teach to be a room and 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.119
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.189
 is to have a structure like that are going to be 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.460
 just as I am a structure of 13 x 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.199
 13 and she that have the frame as well 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.870
 when they understand me as well as they look and 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.190
 the lowest on a level after and good 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.690
 I'm going to make the black chairs because 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.980
 Well, I like black people but 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.710
 They know that you can do them like 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.870
 you want to and I shit but there's nothing 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.240
 what more arrange then is what 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.430
 has to do is can do that is 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.780
 put the is put slabs of what 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.840
 they want good I put him of those because 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.700
 He perceives that he looks mop, I put him 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.040
 four furniture but then you can 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.660
 vary put three if they want that table 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.200
 from the center you put the material that 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.350
 you want but it is slab 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.960
 stone slabs of course is the one 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.720
 I like it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
 then we have to put it this way in 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.960
 which they were both beside the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.140
 chairs where they are seeing in the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.670
 video slabs of wooden slabs if that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.740
 its wooden floors but whatever 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.960
 its soil so that the effect as well as 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.220
 staircase and place an effect because cold no 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.890
 well I like it, not if you 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.220
 assuming that's another piece of the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.840
 x house I remember because it says that but 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.060
 well you suppose it's another piece 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.950
 of the house 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.470
 and good the corners in the corners 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.780
 put you already know with grids and earth 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.579
 put pots found that you can 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.590
 put what is left so that they will see you 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.390
 because grids are placed where 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.520
 mind then that they will never happen 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.920
 for the pot if it has place 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.390
 they're going to come out like that they're not going to come out that way 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.429
 so it looks good in the corner the flowerpot 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.740
 Anyway , you know by now that 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.549
 I'm going to go to those slabs they can 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.899
 put if they want some if not then not this 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.560
 as a backup type but then if 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.310
 they want 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.080
 flowers already know that you can 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.210
 vary the plant that you put up to 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.810
 cactus there they put sand and a cactus if 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:16.270
 they want is not my case but then you 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.790
 they put it the while I go to the big house to 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.310
 finish so they see more or less how 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.170
 that was the room and taking advantage of that 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.640
 I had time because the video 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.920
 is something short I'm going to teach you 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.030
 put 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.030
 and that intention 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.739
 and you can make him a pool table 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.989
 see well the room grab green wool the 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.519
 green is the green is more 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.340
 strong no more than I was wrong but already 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.610
 I did not realize until he finished 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.239
 but you do so 82 wide 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.280
 4 long the error of signs and then 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.069
 in the two plants right now they are going to see 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.739
 they put something to upload I put that 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.810
 you can whatever you want and they put you 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.790
 gray wool a gray the one you want 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.010
 but that is gray or black or a want 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.500
 to simulate the marker like that or 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.260
 minus something so no more so that it 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.040
 see well and also ice fill it 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.989
 from e3 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.790
 they can put you like a piece of furniture 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.859
 with stairs right now forgiveness is 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.600
 to simulate where the clubs go and already 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.540
 does not tell you there I forgot 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.160
 realize that on your roof and well something 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.460
 so it will look good have as if 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.020
 out so well bookmark the only one 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.490
 they change the green he puts on the other 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.820
 green that is the one that looks good 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.580
 and from there they will see what I tell them 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.750
 the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.900
 of those of the woods those airs that do not 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.420
 I arrived I'm walking 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.430
 and see how to push the pots like this 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.720
 corners so they do not get in the way 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.060
 If you want to make furniture like that 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.220
 they also make a piece of furniture like that ignore my 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.950
 leaks there I have two that three 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.510
 leaks but it is for a 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.370
 update that made the water 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.680
 I fell for mother or several 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.340
 constructions but it does not matter anymore 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.069
 see this is how I tell you that the pots 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.019
 and that is the TV is TV table 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.370
 pool is how you can put that 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.040
 Furniture cited that I tell them they do 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.910
 with stairs or slabs I do not remember well 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.109
 I think it 's with gauze and it does not disguise 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.820
 where the clubs go 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.620
 there are people I hear something hoarse I do not know 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.520
 why but I'm not listening 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.580
 something raspy I think 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.400
 but hey that was all they give him like 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.400
