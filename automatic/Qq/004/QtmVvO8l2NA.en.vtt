00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.800
 good and with respect to people who 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.420
 they want to gain weight but in a way 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.509
 muscle of course in the verification 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.040
 muscle and diet and generally 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.650
 measurement guidelines that were indicated are 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.830
 since the beginning of the day they are proteins 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 and minerals directly from the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.440
 start energy be half of the day yes 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.970
 for directly to be able to carry 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.830
 out daily tasks if what is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.260
 work for study whatever and over 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.080
 after the gym and finally they are 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.149
 the night more proteins for just 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.770
 to form the muscle are diets 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.780
 totally different are patterns of 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.720
 ventilla is totally different according to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.720
 the somatic type that is if you are hector 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.050
 morpho in 2 morpho or month or forno if that 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.100
 It is different according to each body type 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.210
 that's why routines and diets are not 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.220
 compatible with any body type 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.590
 Well maybe you think I 'm doing this 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.670
 routine served me very well to me had it 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.290
 recommend my friend who also 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.260
 You need to gain weight and actually you 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.090
 friend what you want is to lose weight or 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.440
 A friend who wants to gain weight can 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.320
 be very thin and maybe 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.750
 you need to have more muscle mass 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.510
 legs follow the shoulders the arms 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.780
 because at dinner tazio does not play football or 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.280
 whatever it is not to fight the diets with 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.530
 any type of body you have to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.660
 detect what is the somatic type the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.040
 inconvenience you have or why not 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.410
 has no problem and needs 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.820
 change your body you want it so either 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.830
 because I have some physical task 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.170
 alcÃ sser or directly wants to change 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.050
 his body merely by aesthetics is 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.580
 totally different every body yes 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.290
 good as you will have noticed that I center 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.820
 a lot in diets too for 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.370
 people who want to lose weight in 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.810
 many proteins and instead of doing 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.600
 several large meals are small 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.950
 meals if this is very important and it is 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 constant that they keep eating all the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.100
 time throughout the day small 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 half-eaten meals large meals 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.420
 this may sound a bit weird for 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.580
 some people but it was totally 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.830
 proven that the person who wants to download 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.930
 of weight have to be eating few 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.479
 meals many times throughout the day 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.310
 instead of eating two or three very meals 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.250
 large three very large plates and 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.599
 well let's keep watching the videos soon 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.310
 more new videos and soon I'm 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.560
 climbing on self-defense videos 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.330
 yes so I hope that if you like my 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.099

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.150
