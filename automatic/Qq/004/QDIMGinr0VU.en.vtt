impossible<00:04:22.970> I<00:04:23.970> guess<00:04:24.510> super<00:04:24.990> flat<00:04:27.530> system

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
impossible I guess super flat system

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:57.689 
impossible I guess super flat system
pushing

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
it's been a lot of resistance of a tree

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.170 
it's been a lot of resistance of a tree
put<00:05:09.949> into<00:05:10.279> this<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:11.360> um<00:05:12.289> I<00:05:13.039> guess<00:05:13.699> it's<00:05:14.029> more
