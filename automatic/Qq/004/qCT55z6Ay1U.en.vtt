00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
these pieces of the universe that were

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
these pieces of the universe that were
all<00:00:29.609> made<00:00:29.849> out<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.259> we're<00:00:31.470> trying<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
all made out of you know we're trying to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.610 
all made out of you know we're trying to
make<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.040> movie<00:00:32.430> using<00:00:32.610> atoms<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.620> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
make a movie using atoms and so that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.260 
make a movie using atoms and so that
sounds<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> simple<00:00:35.550> concept<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.030> in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
sounds like a simple concept but in

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.720 
sounds like a simple concept but in
reality<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.900> course<00:00:37.080> these<00:00:37.260> atoms<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.490> does

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
reality of course these atoms it does

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.340 
reality of course these atoms it does
take<00:00:38.940> some<00:00:38.970> concentration<00:00:39.630> because<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> want

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
take some concentration because you want

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.300 
take some concentration because you want
to<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.590> them<00:00:40.740> in<00:00:40.860> exactly<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:41.580> right<00:00:41.670> spot<00:00:46.310> we

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
to get them in exactly the right spot we

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.130 
to get them in exactly the right spot we
have<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.490> tool<00:00:47.790> that<00:00:47.820> allows<00:00:48.210> us<00:00:48.240> to<00:00:48.450> move<00:00:48.750> atoms

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
have a tool that allows us to move atoms

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.780 
have a tool that allows us to move atoms
on<00:00:49.290> surfaces<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.800> build<00:00:50.160> structures<00:00:50.610> one

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
atom at a time and we want to explore

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.310 
atom at a time and we want to explore
how<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.760> use<00:00:53.910> atoms<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.480> surfaces<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:55.140> do

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
how can we use atoms on surfaces to do

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:12.050 
how can we use atoms on surfaces to do
computation<00:00:55.950> and<00:00:56.130> data<00:00:56.190> storage<00:01:11.060> we've

computation and data storage we've

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.989 
computation and data storage we've
started<00:01:12.450> making<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> frames<00:01:14.159> it's

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
started making some of the frames it's

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.359 
started making some of the frames it's
kind<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.539> cool<00:01:15.749> and<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.380> addictive<00:01:16.889> all

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
kind of cool and it's addictive all

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
of one of these surfaces so to make this

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.919 
of one of these surfaces so to make this
animation<00:01:25.829> we<00:01:26.490> move<00:01:26.759> molecules<00:01:27.359> around<00:01:27.600> one

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
animation we move molecules around one

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.169 
animation we move molecules around one
at<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.170> time<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:29.100> draw<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> little<00:01:29.549> picture<00:01:29.639> and

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
at a time to draw a little picture and

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.109 
at a time to draw a little picture and
we<00:01:31.109> save<00:01:31.319> that<00:01:31.350> picture<00:01:31.679> and<00:01:32.280> move<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
we save that picture and move on to the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.410 
we save that picture and move on to the
next<00:01:33.240> frame<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.229> start<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.369> tell<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> story<00:01:35.880> this

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
next frame to start to tell a story this

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.969 
next frame to start to tell a story this
is<00:01:36.569> a<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:36.840> challenging<00:01:37.109> task<00:01:37.409> because

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
is a very challenging task because

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.469 
is a very challenging task because
nobody<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.429> far<00:01:38.639> as<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:39.030> including

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
nobody as far as we know including

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.209 
nobody as far as we know including
ourselves<00:01:39.689> has<00:01:40.139> ever<00:01:40.319> moved<00:01:40.560> five<00:01:40.799> thousand

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
ourselves has ever moved five thousand

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.550 
ourselves has ever moved five thousand
atoms<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> man<00:01:42.929> that's<00:01:43.229> built

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
atoms now we see the man that's built

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.279 
atoms now we see the man that's built
with<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.219> carbon<00:01:44.819> monoxide<00:01:45.420> molecules

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
with all this carbon monoxide molecules

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.169 
with all this carbon monoxide molecules
and<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.249> them<00:01:47.459> we<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.819> have<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
and then some of them we would have to

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.969 
and then some of them we would have to
shovel<00:01:48.420> away<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:49.049> make<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> really<00:01:49.709> be<00:01:49.859> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
shovel away to make it really be the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.919 
shovel away to make it really be the
movie<00:01:50.279> frame<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.819> we<00:01:50.939> would<00:01:51.029> have<00:01:51.209> to<00:01:51.389> clean<00:01:51.749> up

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
movie frame so we would have to clean up

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.160 
movie frame so we would have to clean up
a<00:01:52.049> little<00:01:52.170> bit<00:01:52.289> when<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.630> see<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.779> image<00:01:55.020> in

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
a little bit when we see the image in

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.959 
a little bit when we see the image in
the<00:01:55.259> microscope<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.279> magnified<00:01:56.819> about

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the microscope we see it magnified about

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.870 
the microscope we see it magnified about
100<00:01:57.630> million<00:01:57.869> times<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.950> an<00:01:59.159> atom<00:01:59.429> is<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.639> size

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
100 million times if an atom is the size

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.889 
100 million times if an atom is the size
of<00:02:00.119> an<00:02:00.509> orange<00:02:01.069> then<00:02:02.069> the<00:02:02.789> orange<00:02:03.359> would<00:02:03.719> be

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
of an orange then the orange would be

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:13.130 
of an orange then the orange would be
the<00:02:04.020> size<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> whole<00:02:04.709> planet<00:02:05.039> Earth<00:02:12.140> what

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the size of the whole planet Earth what

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.690 
the size of the whole planet Earth what
we<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.440> been<00:02:13.650> doing<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.130> last<00:02:14.220> forty

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
we have been doing for the last forty

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.250 
we have been doing for the last forty
years<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:15.060> we've<00:02:15.240> taken<00:02:15.510> essentially<00:02:16.140> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
years is we've taken essentially the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.710 
years is we've taken essentially the
same<00:02:16.500> silicon<00:02:16.980> transistor<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.090> scaled<00:02:18.540> it

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
same silicon transistor and we scaled it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.450 
same silicon transistor and we scaled it
down<00:02:18.960> putting<00:02:19.560> correspondingly<00:02:20.370> more

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
down putting correspondingly more

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.580 
down putting correspondingly more
transistors<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> same<00:02:21.720> chip<00:02:21.930> very

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
transistors on the same chip very

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.320 
transistors on the same chip very
recently<00:02:23.010> what<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.460> done<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.970> we've<00:02:24.180> been

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
recently what we have done is we've been

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.240 
recently what we have done is we've been
interested<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.230> magnetic<00:02:25.620> properties<00:02:26.070> of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
interested in the magnetic properties of

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.280 
interested in the magnetic properties of
atoms<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.820> surfaces<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.630> really<00:02:28.080> what<00:02:28.200> we

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
atoms on surfaces and really what we

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.600 
atoms on surfaces and really what we
wanted<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.620> answer<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> very<00:02:29.280> simple

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
wanted to answer is a very simple

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.850 
wanted to answer is a very simple
question<00:02:29.790> how<00:02:30.420> small<00:02:30.840> can<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.230> make<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> magnet

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
question how small can you make a magnet

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.860 
question how small can you make a magnet
and<00:02:32.040> still<00:02:32.310> use<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:32.790> data<00:02:32.940> storage<00:02:33.090> we

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
and still use it for data storage we

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.740 
and still use it for data storage we
know<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.350> can<00:02:34.500> make<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.950> stable<00:02:35.550> II<00:02:35.850> out

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
know that we can make it stable II out

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.450 
know that we can make it stable II out
of<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.020> million<00:02:37.380> atoms<00:02:37.710> because<00:02:38.070> that's<00:02:38.280> what's

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
of a million atoms because that's what's

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.670 
of a million atoms because that's what's
done<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.850> current<00:02:39.210> technologies<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.530> we

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
done in current technologies and we

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.380 
done in current technologies and we
found<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.160> for<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.640> materials<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.240> we

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
found that for the materials that we

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.210 
found that for the materials that we
chose<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.260> we're<00:02:43.410> able<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.830> work<00:02:43.980> with

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
chose and that we're able to work with

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.510 
chose and that we're able to work with
only<00:02:44.490> twelve<00:02:45.240> atoms<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:46.230> sufficient<00:02:46.950> you

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
only twelve atoms is sufficient you

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520 
only twelve atoms is sufficient you
could<00:02:47.670> carry<00:02:47.910> around<00:02:48.060> not<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.050> know<00:02:49.110> two

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
could carry around not just you know two

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.380 
could carry around not just you know two
movies<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.040> your<00:02:50.130> iPhone<00:02:50.490> or<00:02:50.640> something<00:02:50.970> you

movies on your iPhone or something you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.880 
movies on your iPhone or something you
would<00:02:51.510> carry<00:02:51.750> around<00:02:51.900> any<00:02:52.200> movie<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.620> was

would carry around any movie that was
ever<00:02:53.040> ever<00:02:53.400> produce<00:02:56.960> we're<00:02:57.960> using<00:02:58.140> two

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
ever ever produce we're using two

scanning tunneling microscopes to make

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.170 
scanning tunneling microscopes to make
this<00:03:00.810> movie<00:03:01.200> first<00:03:02.010> we<00:03:02.490> need<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.730> look<00:03:02.880> at<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
this movie first we need to look at the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.610 
this movie first we need to look at the
surface<00:03:03.360> um<00:03:03.690> we<00:03:03.780> need<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.930> figure<00:03:04.200> out<00:03:04.380> where

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
surface um we need to figure out where

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.200 
surface um we need to figure out where
the<00:03:04.770> atoms<00:03:05.100> are<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.490> here<00:03:05.670> we<00:03:05.790> have<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.060> other

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
the atoms are so here we have the other

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.670 
the atoms are so here we have the other
that<00:03:06.450> we<00:03:06.540> want<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.810> move<00:03:06.930> here<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:07.350> have<00:03:07.500> our

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
that we want to move here we have our

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.250 
that we want to move here we have our
needle<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.310> we<00:03:08.970> switch<00:03:09.270> between<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.840> imaging

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
needle and we switch between the imaging

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.980 
needle and we switch between the imaging
mode<00:03:10.470> whereas<00:03:10.860> stay<00:03:11.100> relatively<00:03:11.520> far<00:03:11.910> away<00:03:12.060> to

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
mode whereas stay relatively far away to

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.870 
mode whereas stay relatively far away to
the<00:03:13.110> moving<00:03:13.350> mode<00:03:13.650> where<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.920> get<00:03:14.100> close<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.670> and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
the moving mode where I get close in and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.000 
the moving mode where I get close in and
now<00:03:15.270> these<00:03:15.480> two<00:03:15.540> atoms<00:03:16.050> are<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.410> close<00:03:16.710> that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
now these two atoms are so close that

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.560 
now these two atoms are so close that
they've<00:03:17.340> chemically<00:03:17.850> react<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.330> each<00:03:18.360> other

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
they've chemically react with each other

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.540 
they've chemically react with each other
and<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.020> then<00:03:19.170> we<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.530> drag<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:19.980> atom<00:03:20.280> along

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
and so then we can drag this atom along

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.550 
and so then we can drag this atom along
the<00:03:20.670> surface<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.270> position<00:03:21.960> it<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.380> new

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
the surface and position it to a new

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.620 
the surface and position it to a new
location<00:03:22.740> here<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.730> are<00:03:23.910> actually<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.480> the

location here you are actually in the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.050 
location here you are actually in the
microscope<00:03:25.080> room<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.520> room<00:03:26.790> where

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
where the action is taking place we're

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.720 
where the action is taking place we're
working<00:03:31.230> at<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> temperature<00:03:31.710> of<00:03:31.860> minus<00:03:32.070> two

was<00:03:58.670> three<00:03:58.910> locations<00:03:59.180> now<00:04:00.050> of<00:04:00.230> course<00:04:00.410> we

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
was three locations now of course we

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.900 
was three locations now of course we
usually<00:04:00.980> build<00:04:01.160> things<00:04:01.460> that<00:04:01.640> can<00:04:01.790> do

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
usually build things that can do

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.850 
usually build things that can do
computation<00:04:02.480> data<00:04:02.660> storage<00:04:03.080> in<00:04:03.440> this<00:04:03.620> case

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
computation data storage in this case

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.470 
computation data storage in this case
we're<00:04:04.100> just<00:04:04.130> telling<00:04:04.460> a<00:04:04.640> very<00:04:04.850> simple<00:04:05.210> story

an atom dancing together playing

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.520 
an atom dancing together playing
together<00:04:10.490> I<00:04:10.910> think<00:04:11.360> it's<00:04:11.480> very<00:04:11.690> exciting<00:04:12.110> to

can<00:04:20.840> do<00:04:20.959> this<00:04:21.140> by<00:04:21.260> making<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.680> movie<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.130> I

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
can do this by making the movie and I

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.310 
can do this by making the movie and I
can<00:04:22.340> get<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:22.700> thousand<00:04:23.210> kids<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.570> join<00:04:23.780> science

future technologies will be but we can

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.040 
future technologies will be but we can
lay<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.340> scientific<00:04:44.090> groundwork<00:04:44.570> for<00:04:44.780> them

lay the scientific groundwork for them

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.810 
lay the scientific groundwork for them
and<00:04:45.290> we<00:04:45.950> can<00:04:46.090> spur<00:04:47.090> our<00:04:47.360> own<00:04:47.510> imaginations<00:04:48.380> and

and we can spur our own imaginations and
get<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.850> head<00:04:50.090> start<00:04:50.450> in<00:04:50.750> exploring<00:04:51.350> these<00:04:51.530> new
