00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:08.440
 humans are born without fear the 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.719
 fear is acquired our superior is 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.000
 who is responsible for this part since 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.090
 there are the values ​​limits 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.130
 ethics and also the fears most of 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.010
 we are afraid of what 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.820
 unknown but I would say that rather 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.100
 we are all afraid of the unknown 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.220
 we are all afraid of the new thing because 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.250
 it's something we do not know about anymore we've seen 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.640
 we have no control over it is not 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.040
 our territory the human being tends 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.470
 to manipulate everything and if you find something that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.930
 can not manipulate fear that this 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.230
 manipulate and he is like an instinct 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.350
 survival let's admit him who does not 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.630
 he fears something unknown although speaking 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.930
 of fearing the unknown we embrace 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.450
 many ghosts human taboos that 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.750
 some are for me supervisions 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.940
 ominous here I will describe some of the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.479
 major fears that humans 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 we have 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.250
 fear of the dark 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.770
 I think that our tendency to fear 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 to the darkness has origins 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.260
 ancient throughout history 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.840
 the fear of night and darkness is 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.659
 has increased since it has been constituted 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.670
 as a favorite theme of legends myths and 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.970
 horror stories like ghosts 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.340
 monsters demons and others and even today we 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.470
 accompanies as a slight apprehension that 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.020
 we feel when we come across a site 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.060
 dark 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.280
 It is also said that fear of 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.799
 darkness is not the fear of absence 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.409
 of light but to the possible dangers or 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.780
 imaginary that the dark conceals 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.549
 some researchers consider the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.289
 fear of the dark as a 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.960
 manifestation of anxiety 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.780
 separation the fetus that is in the tummy 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.340
 of the mother is in a dark and 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.850
 at birth comes to light 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.190
 there the dark is the safe but after 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.590
 of a certain age the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.260
 anguish of separation from the mother and 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.380
 the dark becomes unknown and source 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.079
 of uncertain dangers fear is not the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.239
 lack of light itself but the possibility 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.959
 that something from outside 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.510
 threaten physical integrity this fear 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.760
 it is nothing other than a mechanism of 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.150
 internal projection of one's fears 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.150
 and insecurities 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.780
 fear the devil 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.640
 some say that demon devil and 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.250
 satan are the same representation the 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.050
 same character then why 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.350
 use different names for a 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.530
 same character satan the prince of 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.210
 absolute evil of evil as purpose I 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.850
 I imagine him as the master well 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.890
 sitting in the center has to his right 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.220
 to the devil and to his left to the devil 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.950
 his disciples there are many who believe that 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.800
 there is the devil who has a huge 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.400
 power for evil some say it is 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.840
 a fallen angel and who is trying 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.600
 constantly destroy the work of 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.430
 God among men and women say 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.709
 that it is the devil that whispers 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.550
 secretly in our ear and we 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.230
 tempting towards evil can be hidden or 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.290
 speak in different languages 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.390
 even pretending to be supportive is 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.060
 known to people who have seen the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.459
 very demon and tell that this is 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.920
 a being half animal and half human 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.040
 some describe it with body 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.470
 horse tail and hooves with a trident and 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.320
 head of man with 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.280
 and sometimes they describe it 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.280
 even with lullabies 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.120
 fear of ghosts 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.349
 have you ever felt that you are not alone 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.349
 in the room 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.639
 maybe he has also felt a chill 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.859
 in your body without knowing why or 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.919
 you have simply heard your name 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.150
 whispered in your ear and of course there not 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:28.699
 had nobody ever happened to you 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.979
 according to beliefs a ghost is a 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.020
 non material appearance or essence of a 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.080
 organism usually of a being 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.330
 human being is most often attributed 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.630
 the term ghost to the appearance of a 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.240
 deceased whose apparent solidity oscillates 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.639
 between the mere misty mass and the perfect 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.310
 replica of the person although also 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.160
 can refer to a person's still 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.800
 alive in many cultures has been believed 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.560
 from long ago that the soul leaves the body 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.470
 in moments of unconsciousness for example 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.229
 during the dream or that the spirit 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.229
 lurks next to the body of the deceased 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.810
 fear of death 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.110
 everything unknown causes us something 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.510
 fear but death is something natural that 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.540
 we all have to get there first 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.330
 and others later but it is imminent that 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.970
 death will have been called the 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.170
 enemy of man and with reason there is a 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.330
 our around 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.180
 abundant evidence attesting that 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.920
 is about a real enemy one of the 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.470
 greatest fears sheltering the 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.480
 people is to cease to exist without 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.060
 matter what your convictions 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.169
 religious the idea that death is 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.630
 the absolute end shudders many not 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.160
 it is strange therefore that there are people 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.680
 that although of the lips for outside 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.530
 they claim to believe with fervor in the afterlife 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.930
 inside they fear dying and being reduced 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.610
 to nothing to date 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.250
 Researchers have not yet submitted 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.169
 no scientific proof that there is a 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.050
 soul that separates from the body in the 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.390
 moment of death they say that the mother 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.910
 of all fears is death because 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.060
 no matter what we do, it's the only thing 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.550
 that we can never control 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.680
 fear of death because we do not know what 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.680
 and after her heaven or hell 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.980
 fear addresses us all to those who 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.770
 they have everything clear in life and waste 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.200
 security to those who doubt those who 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:40.140
 dare everything to those who pass everything 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.740
 to those who think more of the account to the 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.420
 that do not think so much etcetera 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.970
 absolutely everyone to the most 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.120
 brave at some point they feel fear 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.240
 therefore, become aware that the 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.640
 fear of the unknown is something natural and 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.180
 one of the most defense mechanisms 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:03.710
 valuable we have but do not let him 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.710
 that limits your possibilities
