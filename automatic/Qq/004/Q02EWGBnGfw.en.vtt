I think his feet which is has been

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.100 
I think his feet which is has been
giving<00:01:07.610> him<00:01:07.700> some<00:01:07.850> challenges<00:01:08.360> I'm<00:01:08.780> not<00:01:08.960> as

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
giving him some challenges I'm not as

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.080 
giving him some challenges I'm not as
concerned<00:01:09.290> about<00:01:09.560> injuries<00:01:10.159> as<00:01:10.400> much<00:01:10.580> because

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
concerned about injuries as much because

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.120 
concerned about injuries as much because
he<00:01:11.780> knows<00:01:11.960> his<00:01:12.170> body<00:01:12.290> really<00:01:12.619> well<00:01:12.799> he's<00:01:12.979> been

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
he knows his body really well he's been

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.679 
he knows his body really well he's been
playing<00:01:13.369> basketball<00:01:13.549> for<00:01:13.970> many<00:01:14.119> many<00:01:14.330> years

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
playing basketball for many many years

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.740 
playing basketball for many many years
so<00:01:15.470> I<00:01:15.500> think<00:01:15.890> he<00:01:16.100> knows<00:01:16.310> his<00:01:16.490> body<00:01:16.700> best<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.390> he
