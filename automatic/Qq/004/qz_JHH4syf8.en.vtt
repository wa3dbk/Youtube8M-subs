hello<00:00:01.140> YouTube<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.399> our<00:00:02.610> nm<00:00:02.820> productions

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hello YouTube this is our nm productions

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.260 
hello YouTube this is our nm productions
here<00:00:03.540> with<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.780> comparison<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.529> cps<00:00:05.270> 1200

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
here with the comparison of the cps 1200

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.740 
here with the comparison of the cps 1200
and<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:07.200> cps<00:00:07.620> 1000<00:00:08.309> keep<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.420> mind<00:00:09.599> that's

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
and the cps 1000 keep in mind that's

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.810 
and the cps 1000 keep in mind that's
actually<00:00:10.139> purple<00:00:10.530> not<00:00:10.740> blue<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.580> same

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
actually purple not blue it's the same

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.360 
actually purple not blue it's the same
color<00:00:12.059> as<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.710> just<00:00:13.830> showing

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
color as that and that is just showing

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.400 
color as that and that is just showing
up<00:00:14.490> funny<00:00:14.700> with<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> lighting<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.260> this

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
up funny with the lighting so on this

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.980 
up funny with the lighting so on this
we're<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.770> start<00:00:17.010> by<00:00:17.220> comparing<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
we're going to start by comparing the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.630 
we're going to start by comparing the
parts<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.470> both<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.650> them<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.550> how

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
parts that both of them have and how

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.460 
parts that both of them have and how
they're<00:00:20.880> different<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.869> advantages<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
they're different and the advantages and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.130 
they're different and the advantages and
disadvantages<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.340> each<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.539> cap<00:00:24.900> wise

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
disadvantages of each one so cap wise

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.420 
disadvantages of each one so cap wise
they're<00:00:25.439> exactly<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> same<00:00:26.039> they're<00:00:26.400> both

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
they're exactly the same they're both

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.859 
they're exactly the same they're both
tethered<00:00:27.420> tethered<00:00:28.019> screw<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.949> caps<00:00:29.869> there

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
tethered tethered screw on caps there

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.030 
tethered tethered screw on caps there
are<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:31.320> colors<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.859> really

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
are different colors but it really

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.470 
are different colors but it really
doesn't<00:00:32.279> matter<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> outside<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
doesn't matter from the outside that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.970 
doesn't matter from the outside that
one's<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.780> little<00:00:33.989> darker<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> inside

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
one's a little darker and on the inside

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.500 
one's a little darker and on the inside
the<00:00:35.130> colors<00:00:35.489> differ<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.030> doesn't<00:00:36.329> matter

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the colors differ but it doesn't matter

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.200 
the colors differ but it doesn't matter
so<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.829> reservoirs<00:00:38.430> next<00:00:39.300> thing<00:00:40.129> QPS

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
so now to the reservoirs next thing QPS

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.060 
so now to the reservoirs next thing QPS
1200<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.390> reservoir<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.170> wouldn't<00:00:43.710> say<00:00:43.829> much

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
1200 the reservoir I wouldn't say much

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.110 
1200 the reservoir I wouldn't say much
larger<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.590> lot<00:00:46.590> larger<00:00:46.800> than

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
larger but it is a lot larger than

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.660 
larger but it is a lot larger than
significantly<00:00:48.120> larger<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.530> 1000<00:00:50.129> has<00:00:50.309> I

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
significantly larger the 1000 has I

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.689 
significantly larger the 1000 has I
would<00:00:51.239> say<00:00:51.390> very<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.559> small<00:00:53.010> reservoir<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
would say very a small reservoir for a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.880 
would say very a small reservoir for a
CPS<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.360> run<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.629> you'll<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.930> you'll<00:00:55.829> be

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
CPS to run it you'll be you'll be

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
CPS to run it you'll be you'll be
filling<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.460> lot<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.820> dialog<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.270> say

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
filling up a lot in the dialog just say

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.930 
filling up a lot in the dialog just say
yeah<00:00:57.809> most<00:00:58.379> CPS<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> tend<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> use<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.789> their

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
yeah most CPS is tend to use up their

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.700 
yeah most CPS is tend to use up their
water<00:01:00.149> pretty<00:01:00.570> quickly<00:01:00.840> though<00:01:01.109> cuz<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
water pretty quickly though cuz of the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.560 
water pretty quickly though cuz of the
nozzle<00:01:02.070> size<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> power<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.300> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
nozzle size and the power and you and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
nozzle size and the power and you and
takes<00:01:03.780> water<00:01:04.049> away<00:01:04.350> quickly<00:01:04.710> though<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.489> on

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
takes water away quickly though but on

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.480 
takes water away quickly though but on
the<00:01:05.909> CPS<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.600> less<00:01:06.930> watery<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:08.010> lighters

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the CPS with less watery it's lighters

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700 
the CPS with less watery it's lighters
yeah<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.030> doesn't<00:01:09.600> yeah<00:01:09.689> there's<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> pros<00:01:10.290> so

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
yeah it doesn't yeah there's the pros so

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.289 
yeah it doesn't yeah there's the pros so
this<00:01:10.860> one's<00:01:11.070> heavier<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.909> holds<00:01:12.030> more

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
this one's heavier but it holds more

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.570 
this one's heavier but it holds more
water<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.840> one's<00:01:13.049> lighter<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.430> can

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
water that one's lighter so it you can

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
water that one's lighter so it you can
run<00:01:14.729> faster<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.450> holds<00:01:15.540> less<00:01:15.840> water<00:01:16.110> yeah

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
run faster but it holds less water yeah

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.190 
run faster but it holds less water yeah
so<00:01:16.799> they're<00:01:17.130> still<00:01:17.310> pretty<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:17.759> equal<00:01:18.200> let's

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
so they're still pretty much equal let's

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.980 
so they're still pretty much equal let's
go<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> straps<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:20.420> there<00:01:21.420> wasn't<00:01:21.630> much

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
go to the straps here there wasn't much

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
go to the straps here there wasn't much
there<00:01:22.290> both<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.920> both<00:01:23.040> adjustable<00:01:23.420> so

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
there both are both adjustable so

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.140 
there both are both adjustable so
they're<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.799> evenly<00:01:26.130> weighted<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.670> there's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
they're all evenly weighted so there's

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.770 
they're all evenly weighted so there's
not<00:01:27.270> much<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.659> say<00:01:27.840> their<00:01:28.020> handles<00:01:29.360> same<00:01:30.360> exact

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
not much to say their handles same exact

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.719 
not much to say their handles same exact
I<00:01:30.990> don't<00:01:31.140> yeah<00:01:31.439> except<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> some<00:01:32.159> years<00:01:32.460> is

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I don't yeah except you some years is

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.340 
I don't yeah except you some years is
farther<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.570> seems<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.990> little<00:01:34.110> bit

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
farther up and it seems a little bit

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140 
farther up and it seems a little bit
sturdier<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.130> looks<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.850> flimsy

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
sturdier like that looks a little flimsy

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
sturdier like that looks a little flimsy
it's<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> back<00:01:37.380> more<00:01:37.680> yeah<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
it's kind of on the back more yeah so

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940 
it's kind of on the back more yeah so
yeah<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.970> think<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.470> little<00:01:40.710> more

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
yeah that I think that's a little more

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.109 
yeah that I think that's a little more
to<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> CPS<00:01:41.549> 1000<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.640> round<00:01:44.790> so

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
to the CPS 1000 so this one is round so

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060 
to the CPS 1000 so this one is round so
they're<00:01:45.479> pretty<00:01:45.659> much<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.840> same<00:01:46.020> yeah<00:01:46.439> so

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
they're pretty much the same yeah so

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.420 
they're pretty much the same yeah so

it's<00:03:26.070> shorter<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.940> little<00:03:27.000> bit<00:03:27.450> darker<00:03:28.019> there's

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it's shorter a little bit darker there's

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.670 
it's shorter a little bit darker there's
more<00:03:28.800> grooves<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:30.000> would<00:03:30.510> say<00:03:30.750> equal<00:03:31.290> with

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
more grooves but I would say equal with

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.190 
more grooves but I would say equal with
crip<00:03:31.980> wise<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:32.880> then<00:03:33.030> now<00:03:33.690> let's<00:03:33.870> go<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
crip wise so then now let's go to the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.350 
crip wise so then now let's go to the
rest<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.680> pumps<00:03:35.010> yeah<00:03:35.370> when<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:35.910> extends

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
rest of the pumps yeah when you extends

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.699 
rest of the pumps yeah when you extends
them<00:03:36.480> they're<00:03:36.690> both<00:03:36.840> stick<00:03:37.200> pumps<00:03:37.560> and

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
them they're both stick pumps and

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.160 
them they're both stick pumps and
conveniently<00:03:38.280> but<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.910> think<00:03:39.390> some<00:03:39.630> tests<00:03:40.019> have

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
conveniently but I think some tests have

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.759 
conveniently but I think some tests have
shown<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.820> 1200s<00:03:41.820> is<00:03:42.170> actually<00:03:43.170> thinner

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
shown that the 1200s is actually thinner

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.009 
shown that the 1200s is actually thinner
it's<00:03:44.400> not<00:03:44.610> like<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:45.209> can't<00:03:45.420> see<00:03:45.660> then<00:03:45.870> it's

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
it's not like you can't see then it's

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.110 
it's not like you can't see then it's
thinner<00:03:46.230> but<00:03:46.470> it's<00:03:46.590> more<00:03:46.860> hollow<00:03:47.160> so<00:03:47.910> it's<00:03:48.060> a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
thinner but it's more hollow so it's a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.270 
thinner but it's more hollow so it's a
little<00:03:48.330> bit<00:03:48.570> flimsier<00:03:49.050> I<00:03:49.140> think<00:03:49.470> what<00:03:50.070> one

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
little bit flimsier I think what one

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.220 
little bit flimsier I think what one
person<00:03:50.519> claimed<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.330> ice<00:03:51.450> ogre<00:03:51.690> calm

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
person claimed to that on ice ogre calm

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.949 
person claimed to that on ice ogre calm
I<00:03:52.560> think<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.160> was<00:03:53.310> but<00:03:54.300> so<00:03:54.690> they're<00:03:54.840> both

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
I think it was but so they're both

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.240 
I think it was but so they're both
sticks<00:03:55.290> pump<00:03:55.560> which<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> little

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
sticks pump which is a little

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.009 
sticks pump which is a little
inconvenient<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.090> thing<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.390> his<00:03:57.630> is

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
inconvenient but the thing is his is

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.540 
inconvenient but the thing is his is
really<00:03:58.470> smooth<00:03:59.060> to<00:04:00.060> pum<00:04:00.830> they're<00:04:01.830> both<00:04:01.980> 35

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
really smooth to pum they're both 35

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.900 
really smooth to pum they're both 35
milliliter<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.239> think<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:04.489> but<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:05.670> one

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
milliliter I think and but this one

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.030 
milliliter I think and but this one
sometimes<00:04:06.390> when<00:04:06.570> you're<00:04:06.690> pumping<00:04:07.230> around

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
sometimes when you're pumping around

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.740 
sometimes when you're pumping around
when<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:08.489> get<00:04:08.580> around<00:04:08.820> here<00:04:09.120> sometimes<00:04:09.360> it'll

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
when you get around here sometimes it'll

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.120 
when you get around here sometimes it'll
catch<00:04:09.989> a<00:04:10.140> little<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.830> kind<00:04:11.010> of

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
catch a little so you have to kind of

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.070 
catch a little so you have to kind of
force<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:11.970> one<00:04:12.090> side<00:04:12.120> then<00:04:12.480> slide<00:04:12.660> it<00:04:12.930> in

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
force it to one side then slide it in

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.229 
force it to one side then slide it in
and<00:04:13.290> get<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.590> around<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:14.070> little<00:04:14.310> niche<00:04:15.090> or

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
and get it around a little niche or

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.150 
and get it around a little niche or
whatever<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:16.200> that's<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.650> one's<00:04:16.830> in<00:04:16.979> better

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
whatever so that's that one's in better

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.820 
whatever so that's that one's in better
condition<00:04:17.700> than<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:17.970> one<00:04:18.209> like<00:04:18.830> physical

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
condition than this one like physical

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.800 
condition than this one like physical
condition<00:04:20.340> alright<00:04:20.820> now<00:04:21.000> we'll<00:04:21.150> go<00:04:21.180> on<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.660> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
condition alright now we'll go on to the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
condition alright now we'll go on to the
nozzle

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
nozzle

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.070 
nozzle
both<00:04:23.310> nozzle<00:04:23.790> sizes<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.420> can<00:04:24.750> show<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.020> guys

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
both nozzle sizes I can show you guys

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.790 
both nozzle sizes I can show you guys
are<00:04:25.980> exactly<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.120> same<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.360> might<00:04:27.750> not<00:04:27.960> um

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
are exactly the same you might not um

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.670 
are exactly the same you might not um
yeah<00:04:29.310> they're<00:04:29.520> exactly<00:04:30.480> they<00:04:30.930> both<00:04:31.110> 5<00:04:31.410> X

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
yeah they're exactly they both 5 X

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.430 
yeah they're exactly they both 5 X
nozzles<00:04:32.190> rated<00:04:32.670> by<00:04:32.820> super<00:04:32.850> soaker<00:04:33.720> yes<00:04:33.990> there

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
nozzles rated by super soaker yes there

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.800 
nozzles rated by super soaker yes there
was<00:04:34.590> some<00:04:34.860> people<00:04:35.250> claimed<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:36.060> actually<00:04:36.600> I

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
was some people claimed that actually I

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.680 
was some people claimed that actually I
don't<00:04:37.350> know<00:04:37.770> about<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.100> 1000<00:04:38.670> but<00:04:38.760> I've<00:04:38.880> since

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
don't know about the 1000 but I've since

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.190 
don't know about the 1000 but I've since
I've<00:04:39.840> read<00:04:39.960> up<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.200> lot<00:04:40.380> on<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.830> 1200<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:42.180> know<00:04:42.870> it

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
I've read up a lot on the 1200 I know it

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.080 
I've read up a lot on the 1200 I know it
some<00:04:43.800> people<00:04:43.920> claim<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.310> when<00:04:44.640> you<00:04:44.760> start

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
some people claim that when you start

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.480 
some people claim that when you start
shooting<00:04:45.360> with<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.620> rating<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.130> actually

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
shooting with it the rating is actually

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.120 
shooting with it the rating is actually
a<00:04:47.520> 10x<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.360> then<00:04:48.630> throughout<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.380> 3<00:04:49.770> seconds

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
a 10x and then throughout the 3 seconds

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.610 
a 10x and then throughout the 3 seconds
of<00:04:50.190> shot<00:04:50.400> time<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.730> drops<00:04:50.880> down<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.270> 5x<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:52.170> don't

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
of shot time it drops down to 5x I don't

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.080 
of shot time it drops down to 5x I don't
know<00:04:52.710> if<00:04:52.830> that's<00:04:53.010> true<00:04:53.280> but<00:04:53.490> if<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.700> is<00:04:53.820> true

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
know if that's true but if it is true

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.990 
know if that's true but if it is true
it's<00:04:54.210> probably<00:04:54.270> true<00:04:54.930> for<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.170> 1000<00:04:55.710> also

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
it's probably true for the 1000 also

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.400 
it's probably true for the 1000 also
this<00:04:57.000> one<00:04:57.210> has<00:04:57.360> a<00:04:57.390> little<00:04:57.780> bit<00:04:57.900> more<00:04:57.960> range

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
this one has a little bit more range

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.470 
this one has a little bit more range
only<00:04:58.800> about<00:04:59.130> 3<00:04:59.430> feet<00:04:59.610> though<00:04:59.790> not<00:05:00.180> gonna<00:05:00.330> make

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
only about 3 feet though not gonna make

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.330 
only about 3 feet though not gonna make

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
it term end as difference but it is a

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.090 
it term end as difference but it is a

little bit more range the outputs the

we<00:05:12.060> seem<00:05:12.420> to<00:05:12.450> agree<00:05:12.840> that<00:05:12.930> that<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.980> cps<00:05:14.670> 1000

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
we seem to agree that that the cps 1000

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.000 
we seem to agree that that the cps 1000
is<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.390> better<00:05:15.660> color<00:05:15.960> scheme<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.710> in

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
is a better color scheme and it in

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.900 
is a better color scheme and it in
general<00:05:17.400> looks<00:05:17.640> better<00:05:18.200> I<00:05:19.550> think<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.760> nozzle

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
general looks better I think the nozzle

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.310 
general looks better I think the nozzle
looks<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.390> little<00:05:21.510> bit<00:05:21.720> better<00:05:21.810> on<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.170> one

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
looks a little bit better on that one

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.930 
looks a little bit better on that one
getting<00:05:22.590> that<00:05:22.680> one<00:05:22.890> yes<00:05:23.190> but<00:05:23.460> I'm<00:05:23.640> not<00:05:23.790> really

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
getting that one yes but I'm not really

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.660 
getting that one yes but I'm not really
sure<00:05:24.240> but<00:05:24.650> overall<00:05:25.650> both<00:05:25.950> guns<00:05:26.280> are<00:05:26.490> great

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
sure but overall both guns are great

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.250 
sure but overall both guns are great
this<00:05:26.970> gun<00:05:27.210> I<00:05:27.360> would<00:05:27.480> say<00:05:27.510> more<00:05:27.930> could<00:05:28.110> be<00:05:28.230> a

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
this gun I would say more could be a

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.530 
this gun I would say more could be a
submachine<00:05:28.890> gun<00:05:29.100> SMB<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.790> means<00:05:30.060> it's<00:05:30.270> light

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
submachine gun SMB it means it's light

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.900 
submachine gun SMB it means it's light
it's<00:05:30.840> close<00:05:31.050> combat<00:05:31.410> you<00:05:31.950> can<00:05:32.130> get<00:05:32.460> in<00:05:32.640> you<00:05:32.850> can

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
it's close combat you can get in you can

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.810 
it's close combat you can get in you can
run<00:05:33.210> in<00:05:33.390> and<00:05:33.660> this<00:05:33.900> one<00:05:34.830> is<00:05:35.070> like<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.370> heavier

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
run in and this one is like the heavier

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.420 
run in and this one is like the heavier
one<00:05:36.060> yeah<00:05:36.330> it<00:05:36.660> stays<00:05:36.960> behind<00:05:37.290> that<00:05:37.890> one<00:05:38.100> and

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
one yeah it stays behind that one and

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.460 
one yeah it stays behind that one and
covers<00:05:39.030> them<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.390> stuff<00:05:39.600> and<00:05:39.810> make<00:05:39.930> sure<00:05:40.170> that

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
covers them and stuff and make sure that

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.580 
covers them and stuff and make sure that
it<00:05:40.770> has<00:05:40.920> a<00:05:40.950> longer<00:05:41.310> range<00:05:41.520> like<00:05:41.910> yeah<00:05:42.180> yeah<00:05:42.590> so

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
it has a longer range like yeah yeah so

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.400 
it has a longer range like yeah yeah so
all<00:05:44.040> around
