00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.810
 hello welcome to my yorick channel 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.160
 have requested that you share the 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.740
 makeup and the hairstyle that was 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.750
 using in the latest videos and good 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.730
 here is to start because I have to 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.969
 take a bath so I can have my 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.850
 manageable hair and I'll start with 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.920
 the eyes applying this pre base in my 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.710
 eyes so that I can last a little longer 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.960
 shadow and makeup now with my 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.420
 eyebrows I love that my eyebrows have 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.509
 a natural way that is me the ones of the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.910
 union following its natural form and in the 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.010
 start of the eyebrow I use one more shadow 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.100
 clear and already for the risk used a 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.780
 shadow darker and it blurs me 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.280
 I'm going to apply yellow concealer 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.280
 lass and I define it a little more 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.190
 and the black shadow is back in 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.379
 wilde and it 's intense suffocating but 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.410
 I'm just going to use it as a base 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.620
 then I'm going to apply this shadow of the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:04.769
 home brown color over and so on 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.079
 I create a tuxedo there is a more armed eye 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.869
 I'm going to apply this area that has 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:12.810
 glitter and the basics here is blur 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.329
 and blur until you reach the part of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.090
 up and so you can not see the lines very 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.789
 useful made and I will use this 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.940
 illuminator to separate the shadows and 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.890
 my eyebrows 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.290
 I'm going to apply a little bit of this 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.460
 shadow by the eyes I'm just going to 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:35.180
 delineate or nothing more than just the area 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.040
 and I'm going to use this other illuminator here 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.299
 on the inside to open a 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.250
 little bit more the eye since I'm 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.229
 using for black shadows and like me 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.369
 I am my eye is a chemist because that is the trend 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.369
 to be smaller 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.850
 now the eyeliner this is a part 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.260
 difficult for most but what 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.840
 I do is that I do it like this with 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.870
 taps I'm doing little to 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.800
 little and slow so I do not commit 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.740
 no mistake and so now I make the tail 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.080
 from outside to do as a catalog of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.080
 cats but not very exaggerating 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.420
 and so now I turn my eyelashes and 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.790
 he used this mascara that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.460
 I really love the brand excites not 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.600
 they helped guatemala and really 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.120
 very good is the only one that I do not like 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.420
 the tabs so down we want you 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.420
 Kings 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.959
 I'm going to use this tremendous Chinese meter 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.750
 so that I last longer the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.000
 makeup can now mix these 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.740
 two bases because one darker the other 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.410
 it's very clear and then I like it too 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.250
 the finish that is on these two boards and 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.940
 I will also use apply for this 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.940
 sigma brush 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.680
 and this powder from our china that I 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.180
 I love it because it 's translucent and it's dust 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.830
 of rice can now use this 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.569
 bronzer to be able to frame the 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.300
 factions of my face and we need 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.510
 re-emphasize those factions that 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.580
 our face has I'm going to apply this 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.180
 blush that I love that is the same 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.459
 wells equal and a little bit of corrector for 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.709
 the dark circles and to define a little 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.380
 illuminate the part of the nose and good 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.080
 where you need it 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.650
 Now I'm going to apply this crayon 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.870
 lips in a color like pretty peach 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.480
 natural because the eyes are already 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.750
 recharged so I need to put my 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.070
 lips a little more natural now let's go 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.770
 with my hair like I said I need 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.280
 that is wet to be able to do it with 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.530
 the nicest dryer so this was used 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.080
 pretty thick brush and just 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.990
 leave it for the front and at the same time 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.800
 putting the dryer in there and that does 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.050
 that my hair of his indomitable and if I 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.780
 it takes a little more time does not want 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.090
 a lot of work but time to dry my 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.220
 hair more that is quite volume but 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.990
 If I really like the result, it's my 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.950
 favorite result because always 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.950
 you have been rather 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.450
 and that same procedure I repeat only 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.400
 by the top part of my hair there 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.740
 I dry it all up down because if not 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.050
 I'm going to dilate hours what I do this 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.850
 event all my hair for the part of 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.400
 opposite and then make-up dry like this 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.400
 with the dryer and so it remains 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.040
 now I'm going to use this pincer that is 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.980
 pretty thick I do not know how much 2 inches 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.180
 be but it is a Chinese c a bit 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.280
 loose because I do not like trills 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.170
 so tight but if you guys 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.540
 they want the Chinese a little more defined 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.000
 and tighter then use a 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.890
 more skinny and I start by the part of 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.080
 up then it came down a little bit lower 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.590
 and then I give it back and roll it up 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.600
 all the hair and then well I 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.710
 it swished from the root to the tip and 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.760
 it is a little more natural that enchinado or 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.760
 it's curly 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.440
 now with my hand I pass my fingers and 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.440
 well that's how it is 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.120
 now this step is optional to me 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.930
 like to use these dip extensions 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.810
 and passion and style man that has the 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.790
 degraded at the root is exactly the 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.590
 color of my hair and at the tips is 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.810
 this red color the information I'm going 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.180
 to leave in the description box ok me 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.580
 I like them because they are clip and I take them off 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.730
 and I put them on when I want and it's 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.620
 super easy to place and if you ask me 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.090
 if I recommend them, of course, 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.860
 I recommend them, I hope you have them 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.330
