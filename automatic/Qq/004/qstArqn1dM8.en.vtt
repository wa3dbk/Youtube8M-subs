00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.020
Hii, today I'm here with Jure (AdviseMyStyle).

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.160
He does make-up in London
and he is going to

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.230
 help me with a big dillema I have.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.190
And that is, in the evening 
your friends call you,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.190
 you have 20 min to get ready.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.510
How do you make smokey eyes?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.890
 Smokey eyes is very easy to make.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.600
All you need is a brush.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.260
So now im going to tell you how to 
do it with excellent results.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.230
Let's do it!

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.110
Tjaša here, has a bit moist
eyelids.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.390
You can see that because the
eyelids shine a little.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.730
So the first thing I'll do 
is put on some loose powder.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.690
 We put the powder to here.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.070
We didn't put it on the face yet 
because the make up will fall down.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.860
So we will have to clean it first.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.090
And then add the powder. 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 For smoky eyes take a
 black pencil.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
 Apply it all around the eye.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.720
Don't bother yourself with the line

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.330
It doesn't matter if the line
 isn't perfect.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.590
It just needs to get into the eye
as much as possible.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.500
 Then you look down and apply it
at the eyelashes.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.730
It looks very weird if there is 
a white line here,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.750
and everything around is black.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.480
 Then apply it under the eye,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.840
and in here.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.690
Now the trick is that you have
to change the pencil.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.120
 Because for the waterline the black
pencil has to be waterproof.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.140
So it won't melt into the eye.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.940
It has to be waterproof!

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.440
 Now when you look down
you have to do the same thing,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.410
with the area under the eyelashes.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.960
Do you see it?
It looks a bit creepy too.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.690
She looks really weird.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.050
 In other words you put this under here.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.770
You have to go trough this line, 
just left and right and repeat.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.030
Just go over it.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.690
So you smudge all 
those lines.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.490
 The more this part goes up 
- that's why smokey eyes can fit anybody -

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.130
the more it goes up it will
 look more like cats eye.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.790
Do you see how it changes
 the form.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.630
And at the bottom do you
see what happened,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.460
 it's all black.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.050
Now this you have to smudge it
with a brush.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.090
 It has to be a bit thinner.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.000
Now you take the 
violet colour,

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.470
 if you have brown eyes violet
is awesome.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.310
 If you have blue eyes, brown
is a great choice.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.390
 If you have green eyes you
can put violet too.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.070
 In other words EXPERIMENT!
Put on what you like.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.780
 The most important thing with smokey eyes
is really what kind of brush you have.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.670
The better the brush the better
it will look and it will be easier.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.330
Now if you wanna look real sexy,
this is what they do with Victoria's Secret angels,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.280
you have to put a bright colour here,
I will put gold.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.160
Again it doesn't need to be perfect,
just put it on there.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.470
If you want to get this part even 
more up,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.510
then you have to put some bright colour here.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.940
 Right now I'm going to put
white on there.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.930
Now smudge it here.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.770
And then I go a bit lower, so that I
smudge this colour here too.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.050
Just go right over it,
smudge it.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.370
 Put the mascara on the eyelashes
like this and press it on the eye a bit,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.750
 and then drag it left and right.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.390
Try not to concentrate the mascara
on the ends of the eyelashes.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.960
 Put it on the beginning of 
the eyelashes.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.010
The eyelashes will look bigger.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.060
 At the beginning we applied
 the powder on the eye till here,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.780
 where the colour is, because we 
are going to clean under the eye now.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.110
Do you see how it all fell down.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.380
Take a cotton ball or make-up
cleaning wipes.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.640
 And you just swipe under the eye.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.780
Now take loose powder or
liquid powder,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.970
And apply it to the face.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.860
Now for the contouring,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.370
you can take a dark powder.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.180
Or nutella! If there is nothing else.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.630
Loose powder or anything
else you want.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.860
And now you smudge it with a brush
into the hairline.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.440
 It will look more natural,
3D because,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.530
when you apply powder,
 your face looks 2D.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.650
You get this ''flat face''.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.250
OK, now for the cheeks.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.820
 You can do this with a blusher
or a dust bronzer

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.720
what ever you want.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.530
If you apply it between the nose and ears
you will always hit it spot on.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.890
 Now we fill in the eyebrows so
it will look more trendy.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.970
The eyebrows have to
look big.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.100
I suggest that you do not pluck 
your eyebrows too much, because

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.230
they will stop growing back.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.130
 Now we put on Tjaša just 
a bit of gloss.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.620
 Pink gloss because if you put on
lipstick it's hard to kiss.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.650
Lipstick can smudge, but 
gloss just goes off.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.950
Great success!

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.310
 If you wanna know how to make 
this Kiera Knightley inspired look,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
then head over to his channel.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.710
Yeah here!

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.770
Right, right here.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.920
We are gonna make it work.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.580
 (Unimportant gibberish xD)

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.200
(Both trying to do something funny, but not succeeding)
