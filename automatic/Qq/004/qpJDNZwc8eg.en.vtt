00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
genre so I'm going to try and explain in

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.740 
genre so I'm going to try and explain in
my<00:00:16.680> own<00:00:16.859> words<00:00:17.130> why<00:00:17.730> ArenaNet<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.420> made<00:00:18.600> this

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
my own words why ArenaNet have made this

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.810 
my own words why ArenaNet have made this
decision<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.470> why<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.310> will<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.640> make<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
decision and why it will just make the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.349 
decision and why it will just make the
game<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.230> much<00:00:22.410> better<00:00:22.680> for<00:00:22.980> it

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
game so so much better for it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
watching a party window is in my opinion

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.929 
watching a party window is in my opinion
and<00:01:58.680> probably<00:01:58.950> quite<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.130> lot<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.399> people's<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and probably quite a lot of people's a

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.359 
and probably quite a lot of people's a
bit<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> slap<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> face

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
bit of a slap in the face

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.980 
bit of a slap in the face

far less mindless and more fun you're
not<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.460> healer<00:03:41.850> there's<00:03:42.150> no<00:03:42.270> such<00:03:42.450> thing<00:03:42.660> as<00:03:42.690> a

character<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.300> lot<00:03:51.510> more<00:03:51.660> fun<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.140> know<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.290> lot

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
character a lot more fun you know a lot

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.740 
character a lot more fun you know a lot
less<00:03:52.860> like<00:03:53.100> whack-a-mole<00:03:53.430> but<00:03:54.390> what<00:03:54.540> about

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
less like whack-a-mole but what about

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.540 
less like whack-a-mole but what about
the<00:03:54.900> other<00:03:55.110> problem<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.620> dedicated<00:03:56.160> healers

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
the other problem of dedicated healers

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.610 
the other problem of dedicated healers
now<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.390> problem<00:03:57.720> isn't<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.140> much<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.470> do

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
now this problem isn't so much to do

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.680 
now this problem isn't so much to do
with<00:03:58.770> the<00:03:58.890> way<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.100> personally<00:03:59.910> play<00:04:00.150> but

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
with the way you personally play but

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.080 
with the way you personally play but
rather<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.140> way<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.290> dedicated<00:04:01.980> class<00:04:02.459> effects

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
rather the way a dedicated class effects

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.510 
rather the way a dedicated class effects
everyone<00:04:03.690> else<00:04:03.959> simply<00:04:04.920> if<00:04:05.100> you<00:04:05.220> have<00:04:05.430> an

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
everyone else simply if you have an

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.510 
everyone else simply if you have an
entire<00:04:05.910> class<00:04:06.330> dedicated<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:07.350> one<00:04:07.590> role<00:04:07.920> then

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
entire class dedicated to one role then

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.550 
entire class dedicated to one role then
everyone<00:04:09.000> else<00:04:09.030> becomes<00:04:09.660> dependent<00:04:10.050> on<00:04:10.380> it

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
everyone else becomes dependent on it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.760 
everyone else becomes dependent on it
let<00:04:11.190> me<00:04:11.220> explain<00:04:11.550> why<00:04:12.200> imagine<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.290> game<00:04:13.440> where

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
let me explain why imagine a game where

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.830 
let me explain why imagine a game where
everyone<00:04:14.070> can<00:04:14.370> keep<00:04:14.550> themselves<00:04:14.760> alive<00:04:15.150> by

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
everyone can keep themselves alive by

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.840 
everyone can keep themselves alive by
using<00:04:16.080> their<00:04:16.350> own<00:04:16.500> defensive<00:04:17.250> or<00:04:17.489> healing

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
using their own defensive or healing

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.900 
using their own defensive or healing
abilities<00:04:18.330> and<00:04:18.660> nothing<00:04:19.530> else<00:04:19.760> everything<00:04:20.760> is

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
abilities and nothing else everything is

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.940 
abilities and nothing else everything is
balanced<00:04:21.390> around<00:04:21.660> this<00:04:21.840> idea<00:04:22.350> so<00:04:22.650> some

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
balanced around this idea so some

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.230 
balanced around this idea so some
enemies<00:04:23.310> will<00:04:23.580> still<00:04:23.820> be<00:04:23.910> much<00:04:24.060> more

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
enemies will still be much more

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.090 
enemies will still be much more
difficult<00:04:24.720> than<00:04:24.810> others<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.410> you'll<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:25.979> to

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
difficult than others and you'll have to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.870 
difficult than others and you'll have to
depend<00:04:26.340> on<00:04:26.490> your

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
depend on your

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.820 
depend on your
and<00:04:27.240> good<00:04:27.390> teamwork<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.930> beat<00:04:28.140> them<00:04:28.320> but

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
and good teamwork to beat them but

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.020 
and good teamwork to beat them but
essentially<00:04:29.340> everyone<00:04:29.760> is<00:04:29.910> keeping

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
essentially everyone is keeping

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.630 
essentially everyone is keeping
themselves<00:04:30.360> alive<00:04:30.930> now<00:04:31.800> imagine<00:04:32.340> that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
themselves alive now imagine that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.490 
themselves alive now imagine that
developers<00:04:33.150> have<00:04:33.180> added<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.900> dedicated

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
developers have added a dedicated

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.010 
developers have added a dedicated
support<00:04:35.130> class<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.730> game<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.240> all<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.900> can

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
support class to the game and all it can

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.780 
support class to the game and all it can
do<00:04:37.140> is<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.500> we<00:04:37.620> can't<00:04:37.830> do<00:04:37.950> anything<00:04:38.250> else<00:04:38.580> it

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
do is here we can't do anything else it

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.330 
do is here we can't do anything else it
just<00:04:39.090> provides<00:04:39.480> support<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:40.980> why<00:04:41.160> would

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
just provides support so why would

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.920 
just provides support so why would
anyone<00:04:41.550> want<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.850> use<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.360> they<00:04:42.480> can<00:04:42.630> get<00:04:42.780> by

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
anyone want to use it they can get by

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.670 
anyone want to use it they can get by
fine<00:04:43.230> on<00:04:43.380> their<00:04:43.530> own<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:44.010> still<00:04:44.610> do<00:04:44.940> damage<00:04:45.680> so

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
fine on their own and still do damage so

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.140 
fine on their own and still do damage so
then<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.160> developers<00:04:47.670> have<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:48.000> up<00:04:48.120> the

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
then the developers have to up the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.450 
then the developers have to up the
damage<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.780> monsters<00:04:49.260> people<00:04:50.010> then<00:04:50.160> find

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
damage of the monsters people then find

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.560 
damage of the monsters people then find
that<00:04:50.610> they<00:04:50.700> can't<00:04:50.940> survive<00:04:51.210> on<00:04:51.270> their<00:04:51.510> own

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
that they can't survive on their own

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.720 
that they can't survive on their own
anymore<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.320> they<00:04:52.710> need<00:04:52.980> this<00:04:53.280> dedicated

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
anymore and they need this dedicated

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.180 
anymore and they need this dedicated
healer<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.360> become<00:04:54.870> dependent<00:04:55.380> on<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:55.890> a

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
healer and become dependent on it a

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.430 
healer and become dependent on it a
dedicated<00:04:56.880> class<00:04:57.300> as<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.780> can<00:04:57.900> see<00:04:58.110> will

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
dedicated class as you can see will

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.280 
dedicated class as you can see will
either<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.890> entirely<00:04:59.370> useless<00:05:00.090> or<00:05:00.360> entirely

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
either be entirely useless or entirely

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.250 
either be entirely useless or entirely
necessary<00:05:01.910> so<00:05:02.910> what's<00:05:03.480> so<00:05:03.630> wrong<00:05:03.810> with<00:05:03.870> having

MMOs have tried tackling this problem
with<00:05:43.680> things<00:05:43.860> like<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.130> dungeon<00:05:44.520> finder<00:05:44.910> but

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
with things like the dungeon finder but

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.520 
with things like the dungeon finder but
really<00:05:45.720> these<00:05:45.930> are<00:05:45.990> just<00:05:46.290> temporary

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
really these are just temporary

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
issue and there's another problem what

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.150 
issue and there's another problem what
if<00:05:51.900> you<00:05:52.050> and<00:05:52.230> your<00:05:52.290> friends<00:05:52.620> all<00:05:52.740> want<00:05:52.920> to<00:05:52.980> play

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
if you and your friends all want to play

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.620 
if you and your friends all want to play
together<00:05:53.340> but<00:05:53.700> none<00:05:53.880> of<00:05:53.910> you<00:05:54.120> want<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.420> play<00:05:54.600> a

together but none of you want to play a
specific<00:05:54.870> role<00:05:55.410> one<00:05:56.190> of<00:05:56.340> you<00:05:56.460> is<00:05:56.670> going<00:05:56.850> to<00:05:56.940> be

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
specific role one of you is going to be

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000 
specific role one of you is going to be
forced<00:05:57.330> to<00:05:57.390> switch<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:57.810> if<00:05:57.930> you<00:05:58.020> don't<00:05:58.410> then

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
forced to switch and if you don't then

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.370 
forced to switch and if you don't then
you're<00:05:59.190> kicked<00:05:59.580> and<00:05:59.910> that<00:06:00.450> is<00:06:00.600> not<00:06:00.750> fun<00:06:00.960> either

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
you're kicked and that is not fun either

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.910 
you're kicked and that is not fun either
so<00:06:01.830> how<00:06:02.130> are<00:06:02.430> they<00:06:02.580> fixing<00:06:02.850> it<00:06:03.150> in<00:06:03.300> one<00:06:04.290> major

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
so how are they fixing it in one major

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.620 
so how are they fixing it in one major
way<00:06:05.490> all<00:06:06.210> classes<00:06:06.900> can<00:06:07.560> play<00:06:07.830> all<00:06:08.240> roles<00:06:09.240> and

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
way all classes can play all roles and

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.720 
way all classes can play all roles and
that's<00:06:09.930> a<00:06:10.170> that's<00:06:10.530> pretty<00:06:10.830> revolutionary<00:06:11.130> as

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
that's a that's pretty revolutionary as

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.510 
that's a that's pretty revolutionary as
far<00:06:12.000> as<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.180> mmo's<00:06:12.840> go<00:06:13.080> each<00:06:13.440> class<00:06:13.770> still<00:06:14.340> has

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
far as a mmo's go each class still has

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.880 
far as a mmo's go each class still has
its<00:06:14.670> own<00:06:14.790> unique<00:06:15.240> distinct<00:06:15.780> style<00:06:16.080> you<00:06:16.680> still
