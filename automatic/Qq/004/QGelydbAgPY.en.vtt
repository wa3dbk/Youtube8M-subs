00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
flashes of quality as you say but

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110 
flashes of quality as you say but
nothing<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.590> frightens<00:00:44.280> anybody<00:00:44.670> no

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120

nothing really that frightens anybody no
definitely<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.660> i<00:00:45.719> thought<00:00:45.930> over<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.320> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
definitely not i thought over there it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.200 
definitely not i thought over there it
would<00:00:46.559> probably<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> toughest<00:00:47.610> game<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
would probably be a toughest game but it

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.970 
would probably be a toughest game but it
didn't<00:00:48.989> pan<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.620> thought<00:00:49.860> we

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
didn't pan out like that I thought we

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.950 
didn't pan out like that I thought we
cooked<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.640> know<00:00:50.760> quite<00:00:51.270> easily<00:00:51.539> quite

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
cooked you know quite easily quite

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
cooked you know quite easily quite
confident<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:52.649> thought<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.910> get

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
confident with my thought in all to get

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.520 
confident with my thought in all to get
a<00:00:54.059> clean<00:00:54.300> sheet<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.750> obviously<00:00:55.079> very<00:00:55.140> very

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
a clean sheet or was obviously very very

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.490 
a clean sheet or was obviously very very
important<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.940> no<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.270> i<00:00:57.420> think<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.840> habit

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
important but no not i think the habit

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.170 
important but no not i think the habit
flashing<00:00:58.920> took<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.370> central<00:00:59.730> defenders

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
flashing took to central defenders

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.450 
flashing took to central defenders
defended<00:01:00.660> well<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.770> won't<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.039> adverse<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
defended well so we won't be adverse to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
defended well so we won't be adverse to
break<00:01:02.760> them<00:01:02.910> down<00:01:02.989> hopefully<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
break them down hopefully we can do that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500
