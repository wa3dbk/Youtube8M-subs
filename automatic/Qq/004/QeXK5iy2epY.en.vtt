00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
feeding schedule is stuff like that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.410 
feeding schedule is stuff like that
then<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> want<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.190> if<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> how<00:01:27.270> many

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
then you want to know if it's a how many

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
then you want to know if it's a how many
times<00:01:27.630> its<00:01:27.810> shed<00:01:28.110> since<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.740> attached

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
times its shed since they attached

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.160 
times its shed since they attached
because<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.149> hasn't<00:01:30.329> shed<00:01:30.689> yet<00:01:30.899> then<00:01:31.049> it's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
because it hasn't shed yet then it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.600 
because it hasn't shed yet then it's
probably<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.770> ready<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> go<00:01:32.219> home<00:01:32.430> because

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
probably not ready to go home because

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
probably not ready to go home because
usually<00:01:32.909> Raven<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.869> they<00:01:34.110> hatch<00:01:34.259> they

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
usually Raven that they hatch they

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.109 
usually Raven that they hatch they
should<00:01:34.680> shed<00:01:34.979> within<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> few<00:01:35.520> days<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
should shed within a few days then you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.340 
should shed within a few days then you
start<00:01:36.329> feeding<00:01:36.539> them<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.140> sell

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
start feeding them then you can sell

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
since she's an alternate blood-red she

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.380 
since she's an alternate blood-red she
has<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.160> couple<00:04:02.520> more<00:04:02.580> genes<00:04:02.880> than<00:04:02.970> just<00:04:03.270> the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
has a couple more genes than just the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.120 
has a couple more genes than just the
normal<00:04:03.690> blood<00:04:03.900> red<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.350> she's<00:04:04.740> really<00:04:05.010> pretty

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
normal blood red and she's really pretty

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.650 
normal blood red and she's really pretty
especially<00:04:05.490> when<00:04:05.790> she's<00:04:05.940> baby<00:04:06.240> she<00:04:06.480> looks

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
especially when she's baby she looks

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.000 
especially when she's baby she looks
less<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.140> normal<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.590> more<00:04:07.710> like<00:04:07.860> an

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
less like a normal and more like an

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.160 
less like a normal and more like an
albino<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.670> then<00:04:09.090> she's<00:04:09.360> gonna<00:04:09.480> be<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.810> nice

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
albino and then she's gonna be the nice

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.490 
albino and then she's gonna be the nice
dark<00:04:10.980> solid<00:04:11.400> red<00:04:11.760> when<00:04:12.300> she's<00:04:12.510> older<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.470> I

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
dark solid red when she's older so I

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.810 
dark solid red when she's older so I
thought<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:14.070> was<00:04:14.160> something<00:04:14.310> really<00:04:14.580> cool

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
thought that was something really cool

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.640 
thought that was something really cool
because<00:04:15.270> I<00:04:15.300> took<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.930> was<00:04:16.080> looking<00:04:16.320> at<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.440> lot<00:04:16.590> of

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
because I took I was looking at a lot of

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.320 
because I took I was looking at a lot of
things<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:17.190> my<00:04:17.310> first<00:04:17.549> choice<00:04:17.790> was<00:04:17.970> gonna<00:04:18.150> be

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
things and my first choice was gonna be

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.700 
things and my first choice was gonna be
it<00:04:18.420> to<00:04:18.600> Sarah<00:04:18.870> if<00:04:18.960> you<00:04:19.049> haven't<00:04:19.290> seen<00:04:19.470> any<00:04:19.650> of

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.170 
it to Sarah if you haven't seen any of
those<00:04:19.920> you<00:04:20.400> gotta<00:04:20.549> check<00:04:20.760> them<00:04:20.880> out<00:04:20.940> they're

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
those you gotta check them out they're

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.450 
those you gotta check them out they're
beautiful<00:04:21.870> but<00:04:22.290> unfortunately<00:04:22.980> I<00:04:23.220> couldn't

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
beautiful but unfortunately I couldn't

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.820 
beautiful but unfortunately I couldn't
find<00:04:23.550> them<00:04:23.880> anywhere<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:25.170> just<00:04:25.350> decided<00:04:25.710> to

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
find them anywhere so I just decided to

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.950 
find them anywhere so I just decided to
go<00:04:25.980> with<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.280> ultramel<00:04:26.850> blood-red<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.450> I

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
go with the ultramel blood-red and I

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.300 
go with the ultramel blood-red and I
really<00:04:28.170> liked<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.470> idea<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.920> blood<00:04:29.100> red

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
really liked the idea of the blood red

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.010 
really liked the idea of the blood red
too<00:04:29.520> because<00:04:29.910> since<00:04:30.240> their<00:04:30.450> pattern<00:04:30.780> is

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
too because since their pattern is

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.690 
too because since their pattern is
normal<00:04:31.380> at<00:04:31.440> first<00:04:31.650> but<00:04:31.800> then<00:04:31.920> I<00:04:32.010> go<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.280> solid

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
normal at first but then I go to a solid

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.250 
normal at first but then I go to a solid
color<00:04:32.970> when<00:04:33.150> they're<00:04:33.270> older<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.780> thought<00:04:34.200> it'd

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
color when they're older I thought it'd

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.630 
color when they're older I thought it'd
be<00:04:34.290> really<00:04:34.500> neat<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.830> see<00:04:34.860> sort<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.400> change

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
be really neat to see sort of the change

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.030 
be really neat to see sort of the change
in<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.390> pattern<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.990> color<00:04:37.230> and<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.980> was

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
in the pattern and the color and it was

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.399 
in the pattern and the color and it was
just

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
just

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.109 
just
neat<00:04:38.679> idea<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.219> it's<00:04:39.309> like<00:04:39.399> a<00:04:39.489> red<00:04:39.669> snake<00:04:39.969> so

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:40.119 
neat idea and it's like a red snake so

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:42.570 
neat idea and it's like a red snake so
it's<00:04:40.269> pretty<00:04:40.479> cool<00:04:41.129> so<00:04:42.129> on

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
it's pretty cool so on

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.100 
it's pretty cool so on
now<00:04:42.939> some<00:04:43.149> of<00:04:43.179> the<00:04:43.300> physical<00:04:43.599> things<00:04:43.659> too<00:04:43.989> you

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110

the people that you're getting them from

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:39.359 
the people that you're getting them from
kind<00:05:38.439> of<00:05:38.529> build<00:05:38.709> a<00:05:38.769> little<00:05:38.889> bit<00:05:39.009> of<00:05:39.159> trust

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:39.369 
kind of build a little bit of trust

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:41.699 
kind of build a little bit of trust
there<00:05:39.610> and<00:05:39.849> I<00:05:40.629> think<00:05:40.839> that<00:05:41.079> is<00:05:41.259> actually<00:05:41.589> about

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:41.709 
there and I think that is actually about

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:43.649 
there and I think that is actually about
