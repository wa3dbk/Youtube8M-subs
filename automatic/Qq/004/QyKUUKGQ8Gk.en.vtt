00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
that all the time and I kind of went

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.320 
that all the time and I kind of went
over<00:03:03.080> this<00:03:03.200> on<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.410> few<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.770> my<00:03:03.890> videos<00:03:04.300> when<00:03:05.300> I

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
over this on a few of my videos when I

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.210 
over this on a few of my videos when I
sketch<00:03:05.690> really<00:03:06.080> light<00:03:06.290> it's<00:03:06.560> hard<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.890> see<00:03:07.070> my

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
sketch really light it's hard to see my

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.280 
sketch really light it's hard to see my
sketching<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.030> when<00:03:08.210> I<00:03:08.240> go<00:03:08.540> over<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.110> can

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
sketching so when I go over it you can

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.680 
sketching so when I go over it you can
see<00:03:09.530> just<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.920> tiny<00:03:10.100> bit<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.580> sketch<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.540> it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
see just a tiny bit of the sketch so it

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.240 
see just a tiny bit of the sketch so it
almost<00:03:11.900> looks<00:03:12.260> like<00:03:12.350> I'm<00:03:12.560> tracing<00:03:12.860> but<00:03:13.160> I'm

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
almost looks like I'm tracing but I'm

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.860 
almost looks like I'm tracing but I'm
just<00:03:13.490> going<00:03:14.450> over<00:03:14.630> my<00:03:14.780> own<00:03:15.020> picture<00:03:15.470> with<00:03:15.650> ink
