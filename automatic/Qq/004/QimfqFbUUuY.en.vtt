another one and as you see over here I
made<00:04:51.889> a<00:04:51.919> handle<00:04:52.370> it's<00:04:52.880> very<00:04:53.180> simple<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:53.900> easy

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
made a handle it's very simple and easy

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.760 
made a handle it's very simple and easy
to<00:04:54.349> do<00:04:54.500> all<00:04:55.340> what<00:04:55.610> I<00:04:55.639> did<00:04:55.909> is<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.960> I've<00:04:57.500> used

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
to do all what I did is that I've used

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.760 
to do all what I did is that I've used
safety<00:04:58.669> pin<00:04:58.820> like<00:04:59.000> that<00:04:59.210> and<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:01.400> made<00:05:01.639> my<00:05:01.880> holes

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
safety pin like that and I made my holes

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.670 
safety pin like that and I made my holes
and<00:05:03.940> what<00:05:04.940> I've<00:05:05.090> done<00:05:05.300> here<00:05:05.659> is<00:05:05.780> I<00:05:05.900> made<00:05:06.530> my

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
and what I've done here is I made my

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.740 
and what I've done here is I made my
hole<00:05:06.830> exactly<00:05:07.280> under<00:05:07.789> the<00:05:07.820> crack<00:05:08.270> over<00:05:08.449> here

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
hole exactly under the crack over here

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.589 
hole exactly under the crack over here
so<00:05:09.349> I<00:05:09.380> was<00:05:09.650> able<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:10.190> push<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.060> with<00:05:11.570> a

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
so I was able to push it with a

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.390 
so I was able to push it with a
screwdriver<00:05:12.199> to<00:05:12.560> make<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.949> hook<00:05:13.099> like<00:05:13.340> that

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
screwdriver to make the hook like that

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
and as you see I made two models like

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.770 
and as you see I made two models like
that<00:05:18.169> I<00:05:18.349> have<00:05:18.590> a<00:05:18.830> one<00:05:19.039> inch<00:05:19.280> line<00:05:19.780> large

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
that I have a one inch line large

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
here I made a half inch between each

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.680 
here I made a half inch between each
line<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:27.139> I<00:05:28.099> really<00:05:28.370> like<00:05:28.580> this<00:05:28.759> one<00:05:28.970> as<00:05:29.630> a

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
line and I really like this one as a

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.230 
line and I really like this one as a
model<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.289> what<00:05:30.680> I<00:05:30.710> did<00:05:30.979> is<00:05:31.220> with<00:05:31.610> my<00:05:31.789> tape<00:05:32.030> I

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.890 
model and what I did is with my tape I
went<00:05:32.449> down<00:05:32.690> almost<00:05:35.440> 3/4<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.470> an<00:05:36.650> inch<00:05:37.900> okay

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
went down almost 3/4 of an inch okay

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.730 
went down almost 3/4 of an inch okay
from<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.560> bottom<00:05:39.919> on

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740

do a hook a handle for each one of them

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.309 
do a hook a handle for each one of them
