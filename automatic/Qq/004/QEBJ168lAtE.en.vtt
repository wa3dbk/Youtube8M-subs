in<00:00:01.310> this<00:00:01.910> demonstration<00:00:02.270> I'm<00:00:02.929> going<00:00:03.020> to<00:00:03.440> show

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:03.679 
in this demonstration I'm going to show

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:13.409 
in this demonstration I'm going to show
you<00:00:03.710> how<00:00:03.980> to<00:00:05.169> change<00:00:07.630> the<00:00:08.630> bearings<00:00:09.110> in<00:00:09.349> a

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:13.419 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:20.890 

brushless<00:00:17.800> RC<00:00:18.800> motor<00:00:19.039> now<00:00:19.910> this<00:00:20.150> is<00:00:20.300> a<00:00:20.330> RC

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
brushless RC motor now this is a RC

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.109 
brushless RC motor now this is a RC
timer<00:00:21.170> motor<00:00:21.859> it<00:00:22.340> doesn't<00:00:22.760> really<00:00:22.849> matter

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
timer motor it doesn't really matter

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.839 
timer motor it doesn't really matter
they<00:00:23.420> all<00:00:23.449> basically<00:00:24.490> constructed<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.609> same

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
they all basically constructed the same

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.730 
they all basically constructed the same
and<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:28.310> have<00:00:29.300> purchased<00:00:29.750> some<00:00:29.960> new<00:00:30.529> bearings

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
and I have purchased some new bearings

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.660 
and I have purchased some new bearings
from<00:00:31.220> Boca<00:00:31.580> bearings<00:00:33.160> their<00:00:34.160> precision<00:00:36.670> you

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
from Boca bearings their precision you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.209 
from Boca bearings their precision you
can<00:00:37.820> get<00:00:37.969> them<00:00:38.059> at<00:00:38.270> Boca<00:00:38.780> comm<00:00:39.289> Boca<00:00:40.070> bearings

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
can get them at Boca comm Boca bearings

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.200 
can get them at Boca comm Boca bearings
calm<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:44.050> in<00:00:45.050> there<00:00:45.920> they<00:00:46.129> come<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:46.940> can<00:00:47.059> buy

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
calm and in there they come you can buy

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.360 
calm and in there they come you can buy
them<00:00:47.390> in<00:00:47.420> different<00:00:47.660> forms<00:00:48.199> but<00:00:48.289> for<00:00:49.190> this

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
them in different forms but for this

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.889 
them in different forms but for this
motor<00:00:50.360> I<00:00:50.480> had<00:00:50.719> pre-ordered<00:00:51.020> these<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:53.809> I'm

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
motor I had pre-ordered these and I'm

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.709 
motor I had pre-ordered these and I'm
going<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.079> take<00:00:54.260> out<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:55.300> what<00:00:56.300> I<00:00:56.329> like<00:00:56.570> about

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
going to take out to what I like about

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.540 
going to take out to what I like about
these<00:00:56.989> bearings<00:00:57.590> is<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:57.890> they<00:00:58.100> they<00:00:58.340> come

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
these bearings is that they they come

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.330 
these bearings is that they they come
sealed<00:00:59.329> the<00:01:00.079> grease<00:01:00.379> seal<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:00.949> never<00:01:01.160> have

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
sealed the grease seal so you never have

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.180 
sealed the grease seal so you never have
to<00:01:01.460> worry<00:01:01.640> about<00:01:02.019> packing<00:01:03.019> them<00:01:03.410> with<00:01:06.190> grease

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
to worry about packing them with grease

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.520 
to worry about packing them with grease
or<00:01:07.520> oil<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.420> them<00:01:08.630> in<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:08.990> future<00:01:09.200> just

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
or oil in them in a future just

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.730 
or oil in them in a future just
basically<00:01:10.310> replace<00:01:10.820> them<00:01:11.260> you<00:01:12.260> need<00:01:12.410> a<00:01:12.470> few

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
basically replace them you need a few

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.180 
basically replace them you need a few
tools<00:01:12.950> for<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:14.150> job<00:01:14.920> apparent<00:01:15.920> needlenose

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
tools for this job apparent needlenose

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.780 
tools for this job apparent needlenose
pliers

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
pliers

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.360 
pliers
I<00:01:17.110> use<00:01:18.370> this<00:01:19.370> small<00:01:20.500> screwdriver<00:01:22.720> flat<00:01:23.720> head

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
I use this small screwdriver flat head

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.450 
I use this small screwdriver flat head
to<00:01:25.370> remove<00:01:25.730> the<00:01:26.030> clip<00:01:26.680> on<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.890> back<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.280> the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
to remove the clip on the back of the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.820 
to remove the clip on the back of the
motor<00:01:29.360> now<00:01:29.900> there<00:01:30.110> are<00:01:30.170> special<00:01:30.320> tools<00:01:30.710> for

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
motor now there are special tools for

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.070 
motor now there are special tools for
removing<00:01:31.370> Clips<00:01:31.610> but<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:31.880> don't<00:01:32.120> have<00:01:32.300> one<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:32.600> I

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
removing Clips but I don't have one so I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.450 
removing Clips but I don't have one so I
have<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.740> improvise<00:01:34.840> I<00:01:35.840> use<00:01:36.470> this<00:01:36.770> pin<00:01:37.160> to

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
have to improvise I use this pin to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.590 
have to improvise I use this pin to
force<00:01:38.390> out<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.960> old<00:01:39.200> bearing<00:01:39.680> on<00:01:40.270> if<00:01:41.270> it's

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
force out the old bearing on if it's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.450 
force out the old bearing on if it's
really<00:01:41.960> pressed<00:01:42.260> tight<00:01:42.620> it's<00:01:43.250> not

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
really pressed tight it's not

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.080 
really pressed tight it's not
recommended<00:01:44.180> it's<00:01:44.510> better<00:01:44.840> if<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.170> use<00:01:45.230> a

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
recommended it's better if you use a

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.180 
recommended it's better if you use a
brass<00:01:47.090> pin<00:01:47.480> or<00:01:47.660> something<00:01:48.020> soft<00:01:48.320> but<00:01:48.590> again<00:01:48.980> I

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
brass pin or something soft but again I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.110 
brass pin or something soft but again I
don't<00:01:49.250> have<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.000> I'm<00:01:50.120> using<00:01:50.360> what<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.630> have

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
don't have it so I'm using what I have

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.540 
don't have it so I'm using what I have
this<00:01:53.120> is<00:01:53.300> not<00:01:53.530> necessarily<00:01:54.530> required<00:01:55.010> but<00:01:55.370> I

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
this is not necessarily required but I

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.590 
this is not necessarily required but I
have<00:01:55.760> a<00:01:55.790> just<00:01:56.180> in<00:01:56.330> case<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:57.160> need<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:59.360> do

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
have a just in case I need to to do

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.850 
have a just in case I need to to do
something<00:01:59.930> what<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:00.140> also<00:02:00.470> great<00:02:00.830> for

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
something what is also great for

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.220 
something what is also great for
removing<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.730> young<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:03.290> clip<00:02:03.560> too<00:02:05.230> just

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
removing the young the clip too just

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.000 
removing the young the clip too just
depends<00:02:06.710> on<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:07.130> mood

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
depends on a mood

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.600 
depends on a mood
now<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.960> also<00:02:09.960> have<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.380> vise<00:02:11.280> which<00:02:12.030> also<00:02:12.270> later

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
now I also have a vise which also later

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.790 
now I also have a vise which also later
that<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> use<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:16.620> protect<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.550> stator<00:02:18.770> when<00:02:19.770> I

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
that I use to protect the stator when I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.640 
that I use to protect the stator when I
take<00:02:20.070> out<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.340> Barons<00:02:21.200> first<00:02:22.200> thing<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.440> want

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
take out the Barons first thing we want

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.900 
take out the Barons first thing we want
to<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:22.800> we<00:02:22.920> want<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.190> remove<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.090> clip<00:02:24.750> now

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
to do we want to remove the clip now

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.170 
to do we want to remove the clip now
also<00:02:27.530> when<00:02:28.530> removing<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.100> clips<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.670> strongly

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
also when removing the clips I strongly

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.150 
also when removing the clips I strongly
recommend<00:02:30.450> using<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.200> pair<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.500> glasses

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
recommend using a pair of glasses

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.330 
recommend using a pair of glasses
because<00:02:32.520> um<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.480> clip<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:34.260> spring<00:02:34.800> material

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
because um that clip is spring material

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.720 
because um that clip is spring material
and<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:36.560> jump<00:02:38.930> unexpectedly<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:41.280> it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
and it can jump unexpectedly and if it

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.700 
and it can jump unexpectedly and if it
gets<00:02:41.910> lost<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.630> you'll<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.230> order<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.590> new

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
gets lost and you'll have to order a new

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.340 
gets lost and you'll have to order a new
clip<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.450> thing<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.900> do<00:02:45.960> the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
clip so the thing that I do the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.560 
clip so the thing that I do the
technique<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.010> do<00:02:47.160> with<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.060> take

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
technique that I do with it is I take

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.620 
technique that I do with it is I take
and<00:02:48.780> point<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.200> down<00:02:49.530> words<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.730> then<00:02:51.240> I<00:02:51.360> use

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and point it down words and then I use

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.730 
and point it down words and then I use
the<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:53.100> flat<00:02:54.000> end<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.900> screwdriver<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
the the flat end of the screwdriver and

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.890 
the the flat end of the screwdriver and
put<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.340> into<00:02:56.550> one<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.730> these<00:02:56.910> slots<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.480> then

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
put it into one of these slots and then

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.250 
put it into one of these slots and then
I<00:02:58.050> kind<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.410> pry<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:58.920> off<00:02:59.870> okay

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.090 

pry<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.410> off<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:08.070> such<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.840> way<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.890> doesn't

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
pry it off as such that way it doesn't

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.890 
pry it off as such that way it doesn't
go<00:03:11.340> anywhere<00:03:11.550> I'm<00:03:11.940> having<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.570> little<00:03:12.690> problem

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
go anywhere I'm having a little problem

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.710 
go anywhere I'm having a little problem
here<00:03:13.350> okay

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.290 

their<00:03:20.530> account<00:03:22.500> there<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.650> is<00:03:23.770> and<00:03:24.180> let<00:03:25.180> it

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
their account there it is and let it

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.270 
their account there it is and let it
drop<00:03:25.510> there<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:26.080> way<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.230> don't<00:03:26.530> lose<00:03:26.860> it

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
drop there so that way I don't lose it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.440 
drop there so that way I don't lose it
there's<00:03:28.000> my<00:03:28.270> clamp<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.730> next<00:03:31.000> thing<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.270> do<00:03:31.420> is

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
there's my clamp the next thing I do is

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.400 
there's my clamp the next thing I do is
uh<00:03:32.550> I<00:03:33.550> pull<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.810> Bell<00:03:35.520> from<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.610> housing

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
uh I pull the Bell from the housing

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.790 
uh I pull the Bell from the housing
carefully<00:03:39.690> okay<00:03:40.690> it's<00:03:40.960> the<00:03:41.080> magnetic<00:03:41.410> that

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
carefully okay it's the magnetic that

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.940 
carefully okay it's the magnetic that
keeps<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.310> place

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
keeps it in place

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.180 
keeps it in place
and<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.670> set<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.330> bill<00:03:46.480> aside<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:50.500> now<00:03:50.710> comes

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
and I set the bill aside and now comes

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.140 
and I set the bill aside and now comes
the<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:53.709> usage<00:03:54.100> of<00:03:54.250> device<00:03:56.850> if<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.910> don't

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
the the usage of device if you don't

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.330 
the the usage of device if you don't
have<00:03:58.270> a<00:03:58.330> vise<00:03:58.600> then<00:03:58.930> anything<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.740> will<00:03:59.980> hold

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
have a vise then anything that will hold

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.850 
have a vise then anything that will hold
the<00:04:01.300> motor<00:04:01.480> in<00:04:01.990> place<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.980> do<00:04:03.100> this<00:04:03.459> way<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:05.620> that

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
the motor in place I do this way so that

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.600 
the motor in place I do this way so that
it<00:04:06.400> will<00:04:06.640> rest<00:04:06.970> on<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.650> housing<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:12.250> but<00:04:12.459> then

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
it will rest on the housing and but then

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.060 
it will rest on the housing and but then
just<00:04:13.150> snug<00:04:13.450> with<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:15.959> just<00:04:16.959> snug<00:04:17.260> enough<00:04:17.590> to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
just snug with the just snug enough to

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.740 
just snug with the just snug enough to
keep<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.459> from<00:04:18.640> moving<00:04:19.859> against<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:20.980> stator

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
keep it from moving against the stator

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.230 
keep it from moving against the stator
so<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.900> way<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> square<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:23.830> it's<00:04:24.610> not<00:04:25.000> going

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
so that way a square and it's not going

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.450 
so that way a square and it's not going
to<00:04:25.390> take<00:04:25.690> any<00:04:25.870> chance<00:04:26.110> of<00:04:26.320> Smashing<00:04:27.070> in<00:04:27.220> any

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
to take any chance of Smashing in any

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.909 
to take any chance of Smashing in any
wires<00:04:27.760> or<00:04:28.000> anything<00:04:28.210> like<00:04:28.480> that<00:04:28.590> now<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.620> take

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
wires or anything like that now I take

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.770 
wires or anything like that now I take
this<00:04:30.190> this<00:04:30.850> doll<00:04:31.150> pin<00:04:31.480> and<00:04:32.320> I<00:04:32.440> insert<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:33.780> it's

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
this this doll pin and I insert it it's

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.440 
this this doll pin and I insert it it's
like<00:04:35.020> such<00:04:35.350> then<00:04:36.310> if<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.580> can<00:04:36.729> push<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:37.030> off<00:04:37.150> with

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
like such then if I can push it off with

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.690 
like such then if I can push it off with
my<00:04:37.660> hand<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:38.140> will<00:04:38.410> now<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.860> back<00:04:39.160> one<00:04:39.340> came<00:04:39.550> out

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
my hand I will now the back one came out

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:47.070 
my hand I will now the back one came out
pretty<00:04:39.910> easy<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.990> front<00:04:44.260> one<00:04:45.150> is<00:04:46.150> not<00:04:46.870> so

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
pretty easy and the front one is not so

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.380 
pretty easy and the front one is not so
easy

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
easy

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.460 
easy
now<00:04:49.390> again<00:04:49.810> I'm<00:04:50.020> just<00:04:50.200> using<00:04:50.320> my<00:04:51.900> garage<00:04:52.900> tools

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
now again I'm just using my garage tools

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.990 
now again I'm just using my garage tools
and<00:04:53.890> you<00:04:53.979> have<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.220> be<00:04:54.340> extremely<00:04:54.550> careful

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
and you have to be extremely careful

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.210 
and you have to be extremely careful
with<00:04:55.330> this<00:04:55.540> because<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.590> can<00:04:56.740> apply<00:04:56.950> too<00:04:57.010> much

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
with this because you can apply too much

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.200 
with this because you can apply too much
pressure<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:57.970> I<00:04:58.720> hold<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.200> I<00:04:59.350> now<00:04:59.830> I<00:04:59.940> take<00:05:00.940> the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
pressure and I hold it I now I take the

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.030 
pressure and I hold it I now I take the
edge<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.870> put<00:05:02.169> it<00:05:02.320> against<00:05:02.740> wall<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:04.330> tap

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
edge and I put it against wall and I tap

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.750 
edge and I put it against wall and I tap
lightly<00:05:06.040> on<00:05:06.760> each<00:05:07.240> side<00:05:08.310> forcing<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.400> bearing

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
lightly on each side forcing the bearing

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.760 
lightly on each side forcing the bearing
up<00:05:11.400> there<00:05:12.400> we<00:05:12.520> go

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.840 

and<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:17.220> remove<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:18.980> device<00:05:19.980> and<00:05:20.310> there's<00:05:20.610> my

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
and I remove the device and there's my

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.500 
and I remove the device and there's my
baron<00:05:22.430> now<00:05:23.430> while<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:23.730> have<00:05:24.060> it<00:05:24.120> in<00:05:24.360> this

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
baron now while I have it in this

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.830 
baron now while I have it in this
position<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:26.390> can<00:05:27.390> take

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
position I can take

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.650 
position I can take
well<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.710> on<00:05:28.980> this<00:05:29.670> particular<00:05:30.030> motor<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.600> the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
well the on this particular motor of the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.490 
well the on this particular motor of the
housing<00:05:31.380> is<00:05:31.560> this<00:05:32.780> it's<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:34.050> little<00:05:34.350> bit

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
housing is this it's a little bit

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.710 
housing is this it's a little bit
oversized<00:05:35.040> so<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.370> Baron<00:05:35.670> fits<00:05:35.910> in<00:05:36.090> fairly

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
oversized so the Baron fits in fairly

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.120 
oversized so the Baron fits in fairly
fairly<00:05:37.140> easily<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:38.360> remove<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.540> from<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.920> vise

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
fairly easily I remove it from the vise

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.270 
fairly easily I remove it from the vise
flip<00:05:41.850> it<00:05:42.000> over<00:05:42.120> and<00:05:45.290> just<00:05:46.290> kind<00:05:46.530> of<00:05:46.620> worth<00:05:47.100> it

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
flip it over and just kind of worth it

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.850 
flip it over and just kind of worth it
it<00:05:47.490> will<00:05:47.940> sit<00:05:48.210> there<00:05:48.420> and<00:05:48.690> I<00:05:49.320> take<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.740> new

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
it will sit there and I take the new

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
the soft hand on a soft head so that I

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.500 
the soft hand on a soft head so that I
don't<00:06:07.840> apply<00:06:08.350> too<00:06:08.470> much<00:06:08.710> pressure<00:06:09.100> I<00:06:09.460> try<00:06:10.450> to

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
don't apply too much pressure I try to

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.970 
don't apply too much pressure I try to
hold<00:06:10.750> it<00:06:10.960> square<00:06:11.320> and<00:06:12.060> I<00:06:13.060> tap<00:06:13.360> it<00:06:13.600> lightly<00:06:14.050> to

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.510 
hold it square and I tap it lightly to
get<00:06:15.130> the<00:06:15.250> very<00:06:15.490> end<00:06:16.890> now<00:06:17.890> the<00:06:17.920> thing<00:06:18.250> is<00:06:18.370> we

use<00:06:20.380> this<00:06:20.740> is<00:06:20.890> so<00:06:21.070> that<00:06:21.250> it<00:06:21.400> doesn't<00:06:21.790> smash

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
use this is so that it doesn't smash

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.440 
use this is so that it doesn't smash
into<00:06:22.450> any<00:06:22.750> of<00:06:22.930> the<00:06:24.930> book<00:06:25.980> windings<00:06:27.150> the<00:06:28.150> stator
