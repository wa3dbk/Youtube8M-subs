00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
see these three different platforms

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.250 
see these three different platforms
around<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.529> octagon<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.520> basically<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
around this octagon and basically if you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.040 
around this octagon and basically if you
kill<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.800> zombie<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.700> blood<00:00:36.000> will<00:00:36.300> sink

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
kill a zombie on it the blood will sink

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.610 
kill a zombie on it the blood will sink
down<00:00:37.290> underneath<00:00:38.030> into<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.270> water<00:00:39.570> below<00:00:39.840> now

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
down underneath into the water below now

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080 
down underneath into the water below now
in<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> water<00:00:41.129> below<00:00:41.370> there's<00:00:41.730> actually<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
in the water below there's actually a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.350 
in the water below there's actually a
shark<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.559> lure<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.219> shark<00:00:44.640> by<00:00:44.969> killing

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
shark so you lure the shark by killing

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.450 
shark so you lure the shark by killing
zombies<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.140> that's<00:00:46.530> basically<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> do

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
