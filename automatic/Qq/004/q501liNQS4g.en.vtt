you know and I think it allows them to
also<00:01:15.960> feel<00:01:16.740> comfortable<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.610> themselves<00:01:18.090> and

also feel comfortable in themselves and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
also feel comfortable in themselves and
you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.439> we're<00:01:19.590> not<00:01:19.710> perfect<00:01:19.920> but

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
you know that we're not perfect but

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.090 
you know that we're not perfect but
that's<00:01:20.790> perfect<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that's perfect you know I think when I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.240 
that's perfect you know I think when I
took<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> long<00:01:23.820> break<00:01:24.210> um<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.920> just
