mall TV the altitude hole doesn't seem
to<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.630> wherever<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.500> befall<00:00:22.769> settings

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
to do wherever you can befall settings

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.609 
to do wherever you can befall settings
it<00:00:25.410> seems<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.949> up<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.369> down<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.820> I

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
it seems to be going up and down and I

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.040 
it seems to be going up and down and I
could<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.220> hold<00:00:29.640> steady<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
could not get it to hold steady at a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.910 
could not get it to hold steady at a
fixed<00:00:31.260> attitude<00:00:33.320> finally<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> realize<00:00:34.710> what's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
fixed attitude finally I realize what's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.299 
fixed attitude finally I realize what's
the<00:00:35.070> problem<00:00:36.680> first<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.280> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the problem first of all you have to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.150 
the problem first of all you have to
know<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.750> hover<00:00:40.290> position<00:00:41.870> in<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.649> case<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
know the hover position in this case you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.569 
know the hover position in this case you
can<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.570> feel<00:00:45.780> safe<00:00:46.250> Trotter<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
can see that the feel safe Trotter is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.869 
can see that the feel safe Trotter is
158<00:00:48.920> this<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.780> stick<00:00:51.780> position<00:00:52.879> whereby

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
158 this is the stick position whereby

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.860 
158 this is the stick position whereby
my<00:00:54.300> quadcopter<00:00:54.629> will<00:00:55.199> descend<00:00:55.710> gracefully<00:00:56.870> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
my quadcopter will descend gracefully so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.299 
my quadcopter will descend gracefully so
if<00:00:58.199> i<00:00:58.890> wanted<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> whole<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.960> altitude<00:01:01.309> the

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
can never get the barometer to look

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.410 
can never get the barometer to look
properly<00:02:03.939> and<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.950> Super<00:02:06.429> X<00:02:06.549> quadcopter

will be jumping up and down with the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.050 
will be jumping up and down with the
correct<00:02:11.440> setting<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:12.069> is<00:02:12.640> going<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:12.970> work

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
correct setting it is going to work

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.309 
correct setting it is going to work
wherever<00:02:13.269> which<00:02:13.690> i'm<00:02:13.870> going<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.170> show<00:02:14.290> you

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
wherever which i'm going to show you

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.160 
wherever which i'm going to show you
later<00:02:15.000> okay<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.299> other<00:02:16.480> statement<00:02:16.959> here

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
later okay for the other statement here

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.460 
later okay for the other statement here
the<00:02:17.380> other<00:02:17.799> parameter<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.579> set<00:02:18.849> it<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.200> 20<00:02:20.200> used

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
the other parameter I set it to 20 used

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.410 
the other parameter I set it to 20 used
to<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.739> 50<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:22.269> said<00:02:22.480> 220<00:02:23.049> because<00:02:23.910> with<00:02:24.910> 50

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
to be 50 and I said 220 because with 50

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.870 
to be 50 and I said 220 because with 50
I'm<00:02:25.660> getting<00:02:26.620> major<00:02:26.860> correction<00:02:27.190> movement

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
I'm getting major correction movement

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.020 
I'm getting major correction movement
and<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:29.170> don't<00:02:29.380> want<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.310> with<00:02:30.519> Lindy

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
and I don't want that so with Lindy

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.839 
and I don't want that so with Lindy
steps<00:02:31.299> it<00:02:31.569> seems<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.049> be<00:02:32.230> correcting<00:02:33.099> more

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
steps it seems to be correcting more

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.280 
steps it seems to be correcting more
gradually<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.510> these<00:02:37.660> are<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.870> two<00:02:37.959> sub

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
gradually so these are the two sub

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.280 
gradually so these are the two sub
things<00:02:38.500> we<00:02:38.709> have<00:02:39.010> changed<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.599> this<00:02:40.599> made<00:02:41.049> all

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
things we have changed and this made all

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.770 
things we have changed and this made all
the<00:02:41.709> difference<00:02:42.150> ok<00:02:43.150> now<00:02:43.299> I'm<00:02:43.359> going<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.630> show

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
the difference ok now I'm going to show

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.140 
the difference ok now I'm going to show
you<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.670> flight<00:02:46.290> with<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.500> new<00:02:47.680> settings<00:02:48.150> in

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
you the flight with this new settings in

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:59.790 
you the flight with this new settings in

parameter as you can see i'm going to

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.170 
parameter as you can see i'm going to
take<00:05:47.440> control<00:05:47.620> and<00:05:47.949> then<00:05:50.879> you<00:05:51.879> know<00:05:52.030> i'm

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
take control and then you know i'm

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.749 
take control and then you know i'm
taking<00:05:52.509> control<00:05:52.690> as<00:05:53.560> you<00:05:53.740> can<00:05:53.919> as<00:05:54.310> you<00:05:54.460> can<00:05:54.610> see

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
taking control as you can as you can see

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.020 
taking control as you can as you can see
i<00:05:54.789> am<00:05:54.909> still<00:05:55.210> able<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.509> control<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.259> altitude

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
i am still able to control the altitude

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.870 
i am still able to control the altitude
using<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.120> chopper<00:05:58.330> stick<00:05:59.370> it's<00:06:00.370> just<00:06:00.610> less

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
using the chopper stick it's just less

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:10.370 
using the chopper stick it's just less
responsive<00:06:01.539> like<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.050> NASA

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.160 

turn<00:06:10.980> off<00:06:11.100> the<00:06:11.130> barometer<00:06:13.370> okay<00:06:14.810> no<00:06:15.810> I'm<00:06:15.960> going

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
turn off the barometer okay no I'm going

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.350 
turn off the barometer okay no I'm going
to<00:06:16.230> laugh
