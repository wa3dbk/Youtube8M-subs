00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
your eggs have set for about ten minutes

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.640 
your eggs have set for about ten minutes
pour<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.000> hot<00:01:06.180> water<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.810> immediately

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
pour off the hot water and immediately

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.890

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
cover it with tons and tons of ice

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
cover it with tons and tons of ice
that's<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> way<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.670> shocks

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that's the way that I do it it shocks

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.990 
that's the way that I do it it shocks
the<00:01:12.210> outside<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.530> egg<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.400> hopefully

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the outside of the egg so that hopefully

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.899 
the outside of the egg so that hopefully
it's<00:01:15.420> pulling<00:01:16.020> away<00:01:16.290> when<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> peel<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.640> so

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it's pulling away when you peel it so

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.820 
it's pulling away when you peel it so
we're<00:01:18.060> gonna<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> test<00:01:18.600> run<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.409> see
