00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
plane because it's probably the best

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.920 
plane because it's probably the best
thing<00:01:37.110> because<00:01:38.070> since<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> dragon<00:01:39.510> can<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
thing because since as a dragon can it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.160 
thing because since as a dragon can it
takes<00:01:40.229> less<00:01:40.620> damage<00:01:41.100> from<00:01:41.460> flying<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.660> has

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
takes less damage from flying and it has

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.719 
takes less damage from flying and it has
magic<00:01:43.590> ability<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.160> deal<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.670> damage

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
magic ability is that deal more damage

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.990 
magic ability is that deal more damage
