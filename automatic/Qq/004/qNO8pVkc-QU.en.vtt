00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.440
 We take the net height from both sides. 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.000
 We measure the width. 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 Up in the middle and down 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.900
 and we note the smallest dimension. 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.920
 We measure the thickness of the wall perimeter, and we mark the largest dimension 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.720
 Then we go to order it. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.380
 Put the case on the floor. 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.020
 Screw the three pieces. 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.420
 Take her up and put her in her place 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.500
 Put two wedges on the top so the box does not move. 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.600
 We are parsing and altering. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.020
 Since everything is OK and well wedged then we place the door on the hinges. 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.200
 We look to open the door properly 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.660
 We take care that the bottom of the door is tiled, 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.120
 and when it opens it does not find it down. 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.080
 Screw the handle onto the door. 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.160
 We do our last testing 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.740
 to properly open and close the door correctly to the hose. 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.180
 We use non-swollen foam to avoid having to smother. 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.300
 Place the foam in a vacuum around the frame. 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.820
 And we wait for it to dry out. 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.320
 Once the foam has dried, we look at our door to be in the right position 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.920
 and we begin by placing the sills. 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.020
 Our ledges come cut. 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.240
 We put silicone on the side of the sill on the wall. 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.700
 Put the headboard first and then the two sides. 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.980
 We hit them gently until we click in. 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.960
 And we do the same on the other side. 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.020
 If we have some small voids from the ledge on the wall, 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.760
 we can carefully fill it with painted silicone acrylate.
