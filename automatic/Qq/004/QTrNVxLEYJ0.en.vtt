which clubs should you be taking divots

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.439 
which clubs should you be taking divots
with<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.339> which<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.610> should<00:00:56.790> you<00:00:56.850> shouldn't

be taking divots with basically you want
to<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.760> your<00:00:59.909> divots<00:01:00.269> in<00:01:00.420> relationship

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to think of your divots in relationship

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
to think of your divots in relationship
to<00:01:00.989> your<00:01:01.229> ball<00:01:01.469> position<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> ball

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to your ball position it's the ball

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
to your ball position it's the ball
position<00:01:02.729> changing<00:01:03.659> so<00:01:03.839> moving<00:01:04.110> forwards<00:01:04.440> or

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
position changing so moving forwards or

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.499 
position changing so moving forwards or
backwards<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> change<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
backwards it is going to change the

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.090 
backwards it is going to change the
angle<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.930> attack<00:01:07.020> into<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> ball<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.009> that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
angle of attack into the ball and that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.859 
angle of attack into the ball and that
will<00:01:08.190> change<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.729> deepness<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.539> kind<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
will change the deepness and the kind of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
will change the deepness and the kind of
divot<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.200> take<00:01:10.410> so<00:01:11.160> for<00:01:11.399> instance<00:01:11.789> if<00:01:11.880> I've

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
divot you take so for instance if I've

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
divots in front of the ball if I move

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.150 
divots in front of the ball if I move
all<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.690> way<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:43.080> then<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:44.149> my<00:01:45.149> four<00:01:45.360> iron<00:01:45.599> here

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
all the way up then to my four iron here

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.389 
all the way up then to my four iron here
what<00:01:47.160> happens<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.590> ball<00:01:49.739> position<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.280> me

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
what happens is the ball position for me

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.339 
what happens is the ball position for me
is<00:01:50.520> moved<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.910> inside<00:01:51.300> my<00:01:51.330> left<00:01:51.690> here<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:51.959> in

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
is moved just inside my left here so in

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:53.749 
is moved just inside my left here so in
turn<00:01:52.560> inch<00:01:52.709> and<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> half<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.220> front<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.520> my<00:01:53.580> left

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
turn inch and a half in front of my left

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.270 
turn inch and a half in front of my left
heel<00:01:54.000> now<00:01:54.750> what<00:01:55.050> happens<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.709> I'm<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:56.069> really

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
heel now what happens is I'm not really

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.740 
heel now what happens is I'm not really
going<00:01:56.489> to<00:01:56.610> taking<00:01:56.759> much<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.179> a<00:01:57.239> divot<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.599> this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
going to taking much of a divot on this

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.880 
going to taking much of a divot on this
club<00:01:58.020> because<00:01:58.349> I've<00:01:58.500> moved<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> ball

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
club because I've moved the ball

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.960 
club because I've moved the ball
forwards<00:01:59.310> I'm<00:01:59.429> going<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.700> getting<00:01:59.910> the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
forwards I'm going to be getting the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.359 
forwards I'm going to be getting the
ball<00:02:00.119> slightly<00:02:00.869> more<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.410> upswing<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
ball slightly more on the upswing to the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.070 
ball slightly more on the upswing to the
level<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:03.060> upswing<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.539> this<00:02:03.780> kind<00:02:04.020> of

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
level to the upswing with this kind of

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.440 
level to the upswing with this kind of
ball<00:02:04.259> position<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.849> means<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.270> hit

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
ball position and what that means I hit

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.420 
ball position and what that means I hit
this<00:02:06.629> one<00:02:08.959> if<00:02:09.959> I'm<00:02:10.259> hitting<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.800> way<00:02:11.069> I'm

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
this one if I'm hitting that way I'm

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.850 
this one if I'm hitting that way I'm
still<00:02:11.730> taking<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.239> bit<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> scrape<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.709> it's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
still taking a bit of a scrape but it's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.190 
still taking a bit of a scrape but it's
barely<00:02:14.310> impacted<00:02:15.030> into<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.390> turf<00:02:15.629> it's<00:02:15.989> more

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
barely impacted into the turf it's more

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.680 
barely impacted into the turf it's more
off<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.410> top<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.830> grass<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.970> that's<00:02:18.330> ball

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
off the top of the grass and that's ball

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.530 
off the top of the grass and that's ball
position<00:02:19.290> based<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.879> I<00:02:21.000> move<00:02:21.180> all<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> way

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
position based so if I move all the way

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.400 
position based so if I move all the way
up<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.989> my<00:02:22.160> three-word<00:02:23.989> where<00:02:24.989> I'm<00:02:25.140> going<00:02:25.349> to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
up to my three-word where I'm going to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.199 
up to my three-word where I'm going to
go<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.709> dump<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.220> ball<00:02:26.340> right<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.670> my<00:02:27.030> left

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
go and dump the ball right on my left

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.140 
go and dump the ball right on my left
heel<00:02:27.800> this<00:02:28.800> one<00:02:29.069> now<00:02:31.489> really<00:02:32.489> picking<00:02:32.849> out<00:02:33.000> off

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
heel this one now really picking out off

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.449 
heel this one now really picking out off
the<00:02:33.180> top<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:33.870> no<00:02:34.140> real<00:02:34.500> scrapes<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> ground

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
the top so no real scrapes of the ground

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.800 
the top so no real scrapes of the ground
there<00:02:35.730> at<00:02:35.819> all<00:02:36.000> because<00:02:36.120> I've<00:02:36.330> got<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.629> ball

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
there at all because I've got that ball

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.360 
there at all because I've got that ball
further<00:02:37.080> forward<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.860> I'm<00:02:37.920> hitting<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.220> more

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
further forward so I'm hitting it more

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.550 
further forward so I'm hitting it more
on<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.550> out<00:02:38.760> swing<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.720> divots<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.260> want<00:02:40.440> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
on the out swing so divots you want to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.339 
on the out swing so divots you want to
think<00:02:40.709> about<00:02:40.920> your<00:02:41.040> divot<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:42.390> relationship

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
think about your divot in relationship

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.790 
think about your divot in relationship
to<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.310> ball<00:02:44.489> position<00:02:45.200> if<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.379> play<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> wedge

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
to the ball position if I play a wedge

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
to the ball position if I play a wedge
let's<00:02:48.610> see<00:02:48.760> let's<00:02:48.940> say<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.120> play<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.360> 7-iron<00:02:50.140> here

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
let's see let's say I play a 7-iron here

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.080 
let's see let's say I play a 7-iron here
from<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.000> back<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.330> my<00:02:52.450> stance<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.730> let's<00:02:54.910> say

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
from the back of my stance so let's say

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.120 
from the back of my stance so let's say
I'm<00:02:55.240> going<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.510> hit<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> low<00:02:55.930> shot<00:02:56.410> British<00:02:56.800> open

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
I'm going to hit a low shot British open

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.980 
I'm going to hit a low shot British open
style<00:02:57.430> under<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.880> wing<00:02:58.030> kind<00:02:58.210> of<00:02:58.360> punch<00:02:58.630> shot

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
style under the wing kind of punch shot

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.020 
style under the wing kind of punch shot
stinger<00:02:59.530> shot<00:02:59.830> what<00:03:00.400> will<00:03:00.520> happen<00:03:00.850> now

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
stinger shot what will happen now

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.430 
stinger shot what will happen now
because<00:03:01.390> they've<00:03:01.540> always<00:03:01.750> further<00:03:02.050> back<00:03:02.290> in

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
because they've always further back in

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.840 
because they've always further back in
the<00:03:02.470> stance<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.980> angle<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.340> attack<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.730> going

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
the stance the angle of attack is going

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.450 
the stance the angle of attack is going
to<00:03:03.910> get<00:03:04.060> greater<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.380> my<00:03:05.530> divot<00:03:05.890> is<00:03:06.070> going<00:03:06.370> to

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
to get greater so my divot is going to

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.160 
to get greater so my divot is going to
be<00:03:06.550> deeper<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.850> ball<00:03:10.060> sent<00:03:10.360> out<00:03:10.570> low<00:03:10.750> more

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
be deeper so the ball sent out low more

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.990 
be deeper so the ball sent out low more
turf<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.740> moving<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.250> divot<00:03:12.580> has<00:03:12.670> become

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
turf is moving that divot has become

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.450 
turf is moving that divot has become
much<00:03:13.210> deeper<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.710> did<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.070> -<00:03:15.160> gotta<00:03:15.340> be

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
much deeper so you did it - gotta be

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.250 
much deeper so you did it - gotta be
related<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.820> your<00:03:16.000> ball<00:03:16.180> position<00:03:16.210> you<00:03:17.080> want

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
related to your ball position you want

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.290 
related to your ball position you want
them<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.500> front<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.220> ball<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:18.670> ball<00:03:18.970> first

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
them in front of the ball so ball first

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.960 
them in front of the ball so ball first
divot<00:03:19.660> second<00:03:20.020> and<00:03:20.320> also<00:03:21.190> your<00:03:21.490> divots<00:03:21.820> if

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
divot second and also your divots if

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.160 
divot second and also your divots if
you're<00:03:22.090> hitting<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.390> ball<00:03:22.570> well<00:03:22.810> should<00:03:23.050> be

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
you're hitting the ball well should be

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.380 
you're hitting the ball well should be
relatively<00:03:23.650> shallow<00:03:24.010> even<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.940> shallow<00:03:25.240> you

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
relatively shallow even and shallow you

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.350 
relatively shallow even and shallow you
don't<00:03:25.720> want<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.170> bigger<00:03:26.560> thick<00:03:27.490> chunks<00:03:28.150> now

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
don't want to bigger thick chunks now

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.570 
don't want to bigger thick chunks now
also<00:03:29.080> you're<00:03:29.500> asking<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:29.980> question<00:03:30.340> if<00:03:30.430> it's

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
also you're asking the question if it's

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.580 
also you're asking the question if it's
dry<00:03:30.880> or<00:03:31.030> wet<00:03:31.060> when<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.600> swish<00:03:31.930> dry<00:03:32.290> what

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
dry or wet when it swish dry what

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.930 
dry or wet when it swish dry what
happens<00:03:32.890> is<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> ground<00:03:33.400> tends<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.790> get

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
happens is the ground tends to get

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.600 
happens is the ground tends to get
bearer<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.870> then<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.740> divot<00:03:36.040> maybe<00:03:36.250> won't<00:03:36.460> be

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
bearer and then a divot maybe won't be

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.520 
bearer and then a divot maybe won't be
so<00:03:36.970> deep<00:03:37.300> when<00:03:37.480> it's<00:03:37.630> wet<00:03:37.870> it's<00:03:38.080> much<00:03:38.200> easier

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
so deep when it's wet it's much easier

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.380 
so deep when it's wet it's much easier
to<00:03:38.590> get<00:03:38.710> a<00:03:38.770> bit<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:39.040> dig<00:03:39.190> after<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.640> club<00:03:39.820> but

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
to get a bit of dig after the club but

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.600 
to get a bit of dig after the club but
it<00:03:40.480> shouldn't<00:03:40.840> be<00:03:40.930> massively<00:03:41.500> noticeable<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
it shouldn't be massively noticeable the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.040 
it shouldn't be massively noticeable the
only<00:03:42.880> place<00:03:43.090> you'll<00:03:43.240> really<00:03:43.270> notice<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:43.810> is<00:03:43.930> if

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
only place you'll really notice it is if

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.180 
only place you'll really notice it is if
you've<00:03:44.230> got<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.470> ball<00:03:44.590> back<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:45.010> start

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
you've got the ball back and you start

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.160 
you've got the ball back and you start
see<00:03:45.400> hitting<00:03:45.610> down<00:03:45.790> there<00:03:46.090> grounds<00:03:46.840> wet<00:03:47.020> you

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
see hitting down there grounds wet you

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.170 
see hitting down there grounds wet you
can<00:03:47.320> take<00:03:47.470> some<00:03:47.650> big<00:03:47.860> old<00:03:48.070> chunks<00:03:48.580> where<00:03:49.120> if

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
can take some big old chunks where if

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.030 
can take some big old chunks where if
it's<00:03:49.330> dry<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.660> club<00:03:49.930> will<00:03:50.080> bounce<00:03:50.350> out<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.740> turf

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
it's dry the club will bounce out a turf

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.010 
it's dry the club will bounce out a turf
a<00:03:51.160> little<00:03:51.370> bit<00:03:51.460> more<00:03:51.640> but<00:03:51.790> divots<00:03:52.150> first<00:03:52.810> thing

a little bit more but divots first thing

in front of the ball ball first divot
second<00:03:55.810> second<00:03:56.410> thing<00:03:56.530> your<00:03:56.650> divot<00:03:56.890> should<00:03:57.040> be

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
second second thing your divot should be

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.110 
second second thing your divot should be
related<00:03:57.310> more<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.670> your<00:03:57.880> ball<00:03:58.090> position

divots to be relatively evening so
shallow<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.920> even<00:04:06.280> or<00:04:06.430> throughout<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.000> for
