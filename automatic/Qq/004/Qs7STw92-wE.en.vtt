00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:14.360
 hello cherry the today's tutorial is 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.199
 This art is very beautiful with a print 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.330
 galaxy is there are several techniques own 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.410
 doing this art of stamping 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.080
 galaxy 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.499
 I saw today teaches you the technique. 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.179
 that I use the way I do that I 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.609
 I think it's cuter 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.660
 So whoever wants to learn is just 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.660
 keep watching the video 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.910
 so I start by putting on my nails 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.359
 with a black enamel 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.370
 I used intense night of the beautiful brand and 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.489
 now with a sponge of these 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.589
 even if you cook the main item 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.430
 for us is making our nor 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.129
 Haiti 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.899
 I'm going through the nail polish. 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:09.330
 Grape-tone on my sponge I've already used 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.979
 risque faith i sponge soft donated 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.069
 on my nails 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.729
 then I come in with a blue nail polish and 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:21.479
 they of the planet one of risquÃ© and in the other 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.630
 sponge tip of the same soft side 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.250
 I spend blue enamel I chose colors 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 because I think it leaves the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.530
 effect more beautiful and I will sponge on the nail 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.159
 randomly 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.729
 now I'm going to use the impala pet work 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.799
 It's a little bit brighter and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.530
 He'll pass on the thickest side. 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.679
 sponge and I'll sponge on my fingernail 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.810
 to give a texture effect a little 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.879
 different 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.119
 now with acrilex white paint back 

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:56.700
 doing the last step with the sponge or 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.610
 sponge year with soft side 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.800
 now with a fine brush and a brush for 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.530
 law the pain I'm doing the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.550
 stars to compensate the scorer 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.970
 I make balls very small dots 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.720
 as if they were stars so far away 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.230
 of the universe and make up the thin 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.959
 make stars as if they were stars 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.140
 with the brightest stars and 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.769
 The way we finish our print 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.769
 galaxy 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.510
 and that's how it is not our art is 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.540
 You wish you could be stopping by. 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.370
 here only finish with this brightness 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.040
 stage is very important that the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.079
 durability of our nor the art 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.750
 and for better finalization for a 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.670
 Most beautiful finish looks just how it looks 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.500
 with onion skin above gives a finish 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.329
 much more beautiful 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.989
 If you want, you can stop here. 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:00.440
 but I wanted to use glaze with glitter 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.989
 I used the physical enamel of the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.579
 hello kitty collection 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.030
 You may be using a glitter that 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.700
 Do you have any home? I thought you gave a 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.629
 touch more like this in our active environment 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.599
 sheik became even more expensive in the galaxy and 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.220
 This is the end result, my loves. 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.680
