00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
stands you get to one-and-a-half M power

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.730 
stands you get to one-and-a-half M power
batteries<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.660> get<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.959> battery<00:02:09.319> charger

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
batteries you get the battery charger

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.770 
batteries you get the battery charger
that<00:02:09.770> does<00:02:10.100> not<00:02:10.280> only<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.700> 20<00:02:11.060> volt<00:02:11.209> batteries

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
that does not only the 20 volt batteries

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.730 
that does not only the 20 volt batteries
but<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.080> will<00:02:12.260> do<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.560> 12<00:02:12.860> volt<00:02:13.069> systems

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
but it will do the 12 volt systems

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.730 
but it will do the 12 volt systems
and<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> nice<00:02:14.280> carrying<00:02:14.670> case<00:02:15.740> let's

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and you get a nice carrying case let's

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.460 
and you get a nice carrying case let's
get<00:02:16.950> right<00:02:17.100> into<00:02:17.310> some<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.700> main<00:02:17.910> features

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
get right into some of the main features

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.260 
get right into some of the main features
first<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.560> all<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> brushless<00:02:20.250> motor<00:02:20.700> so

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
first of all it is a brushless motor so

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.180 
first of all it is a brushless motor so
if<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.020> don't<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.380> much<00:02:22.590> about<00:02:22.620> brushless

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
if you don't know much about brushless

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.190 
if you don't know much about brushless
motors<00:02:23.730> there's<00:02:24.060> some<00:02:24.180> great<00:02:24.510> stuff<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:25.020> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
motors there's some great stuff on the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.840 
motors there's some great stuff on the
waltz<00:02:25.530> website<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.160> will<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:26.460> talk<00:02:26.670> you

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
waltz website that will really talk you

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.090 
waltz website that will really talk you
through<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.120> basically<00:02:27.930> no<00:02:28.620> more<00:02:28.800> brush

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
through it basically no more brush

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.140 
through it basically no more brush
everything<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.850> electronic<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:32.640> cuts<00:02:32.970> down

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
everything is electronic that cuts down

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.420 
everything is electronic that cuts down
on<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:34.170> no<00:02:34.260> waste<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.710> energy<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.370> that

really ends up helping out with the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.710 
really ends up helping out with the
runtime<00:02:37.710> it's<00:02:38.640> much<00:02:38.940> more<00:02:39.150> technical<00:02:39.690> than

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
runtime it's much more technical than

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.900

that<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.860> know<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:41.100> we<00:02:41.190> do<00:02:41.340> our<00:02:41.370> review

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
that and you know when we do our review

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.180 
that and you know when we do our review
we'll<00:02:42.120> give<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.750> some<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.800> back<00:02:44.010> it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
we'll give you some of that to back it

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.890 
we'll give you some of that to back it
up

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
up

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.080 
up
finally<00:02:46.830> Dewalt<00:02:47.160> has<00:02:47.340> done<00:02:47.550> something<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.060> a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
finally Dewalt has done something that a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.520 
finally Dewalt has done something that a
lot<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.330> us<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.630> been<00:02:48.690> asking<00:02:49.080> for<00:02:49.140> quite

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
lot of us have been asking for quite

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.070 
lot of us have been asking for quite
some<00:02:49.740> time<00:02:49.980> they<00:02:50.190> put<00:02:50.460> fuel<00:02:50.760> gauges<00:02:51.000> on<00:02:51.300> these

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
some time they put fuel gauges on these

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.630 
some time they put fuel gauges on these
new<00:02:52.260> batteries<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.190> when<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.430> buy<00:02:53.610> a

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
new batteries so when you buy a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.360 
new batteries so when you buy a
brushless<00:02:54.290> impact<00:02:55.290> driver<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.950> batteries

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
brushless impact driver the batteries

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.700 
brushless impact driver the batteries
will<00:02:56.610> come<00:02:56.850> with<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:58.050> technology<00:02:58.650> is

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
will come with this this technology is

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.140 
will come with this this technology is
going<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.890> start<00:02:59.130> rolling<00:02:59.310> out<00:02:59.580> on<00:02:59.790> more<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
going to start rolling out on more and

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.910 
going to start rolling out on more and
more<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.390> their<00:03:00.510> batteries<00:03:00.960> so<00:03:01.170> stay<00:03:01.710> tuned

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
more of their batteries so stay tuned

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.350 
more of their batteries so stay tuned
for<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.930> quarter<00:03:04.380> inch<00:03:04.410> drive

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
for that it is a quarter inch drive

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
for that it is a quarter inch drive
you'll<00:03:06.360> notice<00:03:06.720> something<00:03:06.930> there's<00:03:07.230> no

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
you'll notice something there's no

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.430 
you'll notice something there's no
there's<00:03:07.830> no<00:03:07.920> Chuck<00:03:08.310> here<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:09.720> know<00:03:09.840> people

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
there's no Chuck here you know people

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.100 
there's no Chuck here you know people
saying<00:03:10.620> what<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.980> heck<00:03:11.160> well<00:03:11.460> basically<00:03:12.240> you

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
saying what the heck well basically you

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.440 
saying what the heck well basically you
push<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.710> it's<00:03:14.220> locked<00:03:14.610> in<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.240> can

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
push it in it's locked in so you can

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.270 
push it in it's locked in so you can
actually<00:03:15.630> put<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:16.170> bit<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.590> with<00:03:16.770> one<00:03:16.950> hand

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
actually put this bit in with one hand

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.910 
actually put this bit in with one hand
and<00:03:17.760> then<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.120> release<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.690> on<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.320> front<00:03:19.620> here

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
and then to release it on the front here

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.010 
and then to release it on the front here
is<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.070> little<00:03:20.280> button<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.970> push<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.930> you

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
is a little button you push that and you

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.560 
is a little button you push that and you
just<00:03:22.170> pull<00:03:22.470> pull<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.040> Chuck<00:03:23.280> out<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:23.880> pull<00:03:24.540> a

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
just pull pull the Chuck out so pull a

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.720 
just pull pull the Chuck out so pull a
bit<00:03:24.780> out<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:24.960> should<00:03:25.080> say<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.440> that's<00:03:26.310> kind<00:03:26.700> of

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
bit out I should say so that's kind of

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.640 
bit out I should say so that's kind of
cool<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:26.940> like<00:03:27.240> that<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.720> what<00:03:28.170> does<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.320> mean

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
cool I like that and what does that mean

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.740 
cool I like that and what does that mean
for<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:29.010> well<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:29.820> particular<00:03:30.030> design

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
for you well this particular design

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.750 
for you well this particular design
they've<00:03:31.050> got<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:31.410> front<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:32.010> back<00:03:32.310> distance

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
they've got this front to back distance

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.700 
they've got this front to back distance
cut<00:03:33.240> down<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.600> five<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.110> quarter<00:03:34.410> inches

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
cut down to five and a quarter inches

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.070 
cut down to five and a quarter inches
doesn't<00:03:35.610> seem<00:03:35.940> like<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> lot<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:36.660> it's<00:03:36.810> about<00:03:37.020> a

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
doesn't seem like a lot but it's about a

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.050 
doesn't seem like a lot but it's about a
quarter<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.680> half<00:03:37.710> inch<00:03:38.130> shorter<00:03:38.640> than<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.880> lot

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
quarter to half inch shorter than a lot

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.750 
quarter to half inch shorter than a lot
of<00:03:39.150> competitors<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.250> ultimately<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.490> means

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
of competitors and ultimately that means

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.340 
of competitors and ultimately that means
you<00:03:42.030> could<00:03:42.180> put<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.390> really<00:03:42.720> short<00:03:42.930> bit<00:03:43.230> in

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
you could put a really short bit in

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.110 
you could put a really short bit in
there<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.740> get<00:03:43.860> into<00:03:44.070> much<00:03:44.430> tighter<00:03:44.730> spaces

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
there and get into much tighter spaces

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360 
there and get into much tighter spaces
and<00:03:45.660> sometimes<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.470> space<00:03:46.860> could<00:03:47.130> really

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
and sometimes that space could really

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.800 
and sometimes that space could really
make<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.670> difference<00:03:48.030> between<00:03:48.120> using<00:03:48.480> this

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
make the difference between using this

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.750 
make the difference between using this
and<00:03:49.020> some<00:03:49.740> kind<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:49.980> knuckle<00:03:50.190> Buster<00:03:50.670> and

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
and some kind of knuckle Buster and

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.600 
and some kind of knuckle Buster and
doing<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.090> by<00:03:51.210> hand<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.750> great<00:03:52.200> feature<00:03:52.440> there

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
doing it by hand so great feature there

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.890 
doing it by hand so great feature there
another<00:03:53.610> thing<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.180> am<00:03:54.540> absolutely

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
another thing that I am absolutely

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.700 
another thing that I am absolutely
excited<00:03:55.680> about<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.990> three-speed<00:03:57.990> technology

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
excited about is three-speed technology

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.200 
excited about is three-speed technology
so<00:03:58.860> if<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.040> look<00:03:59.250> down<00:03:59.400> here<00:03:59.460> on<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.880> front

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
so if you look down here on the front

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.840 
so if you look down here on the front
just<00:04:00.420> above<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.320> battery<00:04:01.560> there<00:04:02.370> are<00:04:02.580> three

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
just above the battery there are three

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.610 
just above the battery there are three
is<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> three<00:04:03.450> speed<00:04:03.690> selector<00:04:04.050> here<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:04.560> you

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
is a three speed selector here so you

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.290 
is a three speed selector here so you
could<00:04:04.830> start<00:04:05.130> out<00:04:06.020> low-speed<00:04:08.120> Ratchet<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.180> up

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
could start out low-speed Ratchet it up

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.370 
could start out low-speed Ratchet it up
medium<00:04:10.290> speed<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.860> then<00:04:11.430> go<00:04:11.610> high<00:04:12.480> speed<00:04:12.780> why

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
medium speed and then go high speed why

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.500 
medium speed and then go high speed why
is<00:04:13.440> this<00:04:13.620> important<00:04:14.100> well<00:04:14.220> what<00:04:14.760> this<00:04:14.940> does<00:04:15.210> in

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
is this important well what this does in

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.360 
is this important well what this does in
my<00:04:15.690> opinion<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.290> opens<00:04:16.590> up<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.859> lot<00:04:17.130> more

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
my opinion is it opens up a lot more

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.450 
my opinion is it opens up a lot more
uses<00:04:17.820> for<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.840> impact<00:04:19.320> driver<00:04:19.710> and<00:04:20.010> I've<00:04:20.310> been

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
uses for the impact driver and I've been

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.800 
uses for the impact driver and I've been
saying<00:04:20.730> this<00:04:20.850> for<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.120> long<00:04:21.270> time

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
saying this for a long time

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.230 
saying this for a long time
impact<00:04:22.470> drivers<00:04:22.950> are<00:04:23.070> taken<00:04:23.430> over<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.730> market

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
impact drivers are taken over the market

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.320 
impact drivers are taken over the market
I<00:04:24.270> meet<00:04:24.690> warm

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
I meet warm

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.360 
I meet warm
more<00:04:25.419> trades<00:04:25.780> guys<00:04:26.020> everyday<00:04:26.560> than<00:04:26.979> a<00:04:27.009> thrown

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
more trades guys everyday than a thrown

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.379 
more trades guys everyday than a thrown
away<00:04:27.490> there<00:04:27.759> drill/driver

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
away there drill/driver

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.210 
away there drill/driver
and<00:04:28.539> trying<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.080> do<00:04:29.229> everything<00:04:29.860> they<00:04:30.009> can

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
and trying to do everything they can

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.830 
and trying to do everything they can
with<00:04:30.280> an<00:04:30.520> impact<00:04:30.909> driver<00:04:31.120> because<00:04:31.479> it's<00:04:31.629> more

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
with an impact driver because it's more

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.260 
with an impact driver because it's more
efficient<00:04:32.349> it<00:04:33.099> just<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.580> just<00:04:33.610> works<00:04:34.030> better

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
efficient it just it just works better

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.230 
efficient it just it just works better
so<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:35.650> know<00:04:35.740> first<00:04:36.310> right<00:04:36.550> off<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.819> bat<00:04:37.030> you

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
so you know first right off the bat you

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.369 
so you know first right off the bat you
could<00:04:37.419> actually<00:04:37.569> put<00:04:37.810> this<00:04:37.960> in<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.199> low-speed

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:38.379 
could actually put this in a low-speed

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.100 
could actually put this in a low-speed
and<00:04:39.060> probably<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.300> know<00:04:40.419> at<00:04:40.509> least<00:04:40.659> I<00:04:40.870> would

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
and probably you know at least I would

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.839 
and probably you know at least I would
I'd<00:04:41.289> start<00:04:41.560> putting<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:41.919> cabinet<00:04:42.370> hinge

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
I'd start putting in cabinet hinge

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.839 
I'd start putting in cabinet hinge
screws<00:04:43.229> um<00:04:44.229> things<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.860> wouldn't<00:04:45.189> dare<00:04:45.610> do

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
screws um things that I wouldn't dare do

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.339 
screws um things that I wouldn't dare do
in<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.090> past<00:04:46.330> because<00:04:46.659> I<00:04:46.719> just<00:04:47.020> ripped<00:04:47.259> the

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
in the past because I just ripped the

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.200 
in the past because I just ripped the
heads<00:04:47.590> off<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:48.009> them<00:04:48.129> so<00:04:48.159> this<00:04:48.849> gives<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:49.180> a

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
heads off of them so this gives you a

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.510 
heads off of them so this gives you a
lot<00:04:49.419> control<00:04:50.110> I'm<00:04:50.349> really<00:04:50.800> excited<00:04:51.039> about<00:04:51.219> it

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
lot control I'm really excited about it

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.740 
lot control I'm really excited about it
and<00:04:51.639> to<00:04:51.789> me<00:04:51.939> it's<00:04:52.090> one<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.360> best<00:04:52.539> features

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
and to me it's one of the best features

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.080 
and to me it's one of the best features
that<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:54.039> wall<00:04:54.189> has<00:04:54.219> come<00:04:54.490> up<00:04:54.639> with<00:04:54.819> on<00:04:54.939> this

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
that the wall has come up with on this

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.659 
that the wall has come up with on this
line<00:04:55.680> you've<00:04:56.680> got<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.919> push<00:04:57.069> button<00:04:57.430> chuck<00:04:57.639> I

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
so there you have it and this thing is

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.980 
so there you have it and this thing is
so<00:05:29.919> different<00:05:30.190> than<00:05:30.520> than<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.360> brushed<00:05:31.629> motor

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
so different than than the brushed motor

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.589 
so different than than the brushed motor
so<00:05:32.229> what<00:05:32.349> I<00:05:32.379> did<00:05:32.590> was<00:05:32.740> I<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:33.250> gap<00:05:33.699> dEWALT's

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
so what I did was I a gap dEWALT's

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.619 
so what I did was I a gap dEWALT's
latest<00:05:35.219> 20<00:05:36.219> volt<00:05:36.430> max<00:05:36.490> impact<00:05:37.150> driver<00:05:37.389> here

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
latest 20 volt max impact driver here

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.290 
latest 20 volt max impact driver here
that<00:05:37.810> we<00:05:37.900> got<00:05:38.080> last<00:05:38.289> year<00:05:39.029> put<00:05:40.029> the<00:05:40.120> same

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
that we got last year put the same

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.999 
that we got last year put the same
battery<00:05:40.659> pack<00:05:40.870> on<00:05:41.139> I<00:05:41.229> want<00:05:41.440> you<00:05:41.529> to<00:05:41.620> hear<00:05:41.889> the

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
battery pack on I want you to hear the

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.010 
battery pack on I want you to hear the
difference<00:05:42.039> in<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.639> motor<00:05:42.879> so<00:05:43.210> here's<00:05:43.839> the

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
difference in the motor so here's the

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.700 
difference in the motor so here's the
new<00:05:44.169> brushless<00:05:47.490> here's<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.759> brushed<00:05:49.710> totally

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
new brushless here's the brushed totally

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.980 
new brushless here's the brushed totally
different<00:05:51.069> sound<00:05:51.370> you<00:05:52.150> can<00:05:52.360> tell<00:05:52.599> right<00:05:52.629> off

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
different sound you can tell right off

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.170 
different sound you can tell right off
the<00:05:53.169> bat<00:05:53.379> that<00:05:53.409> they're<00:05:53.800> different<00:05:54.069> um<00:05:54.460> you

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
the bat that they're different um you

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.990 
the bat that they're different um you
know<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.690> designs<00:05:56.139> are<00:05:56.379> really<00:05:56.500> similar<00:05:57.279> but

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
know the designs are really similar but

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.309 
know the designs are really similar but
you<00:05:58.240> know<00:05:58.360> there's<00:05:58.539> an<00:05:58.690> inherent<00:05:58.779> difference

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 
you know there's an inherent difference

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.800 
you know there's an inherent difference
as<00:05:59.469> you<00:05:59.589> can<00:05:59.740> see<00:05:59.979> the<00:06:00.550> old<00:06:00.699> one<00:06:00.940> had<00:06:01.180> this<00:06:01.389> the

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
as you can see the old one had this the

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.079 
as you can see the old one had this the
Chuck<00:06:02.080> way<00:06:02.289> out<00:06:02.440> here<00:06:02.800> now<00:06:03.099> that's<00:06:03.550> gone<00:06:03.789> away

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:04.089 
Chuck way out here now that's gone away

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:06.839 
Chuck way out here now that's gone away
it's<00:06:04.930> a<00:06:05.080> little<00:06:05.349> bit<00:06:05.469> longer<00:06:05.830> in<00:06:06.669> the<00:06:06.699> front

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
it's a little bit longer in the front

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.700 
it's a little bit longer in the front
here<00:06:07.479> because<00:06:07.870> of<00:06:07.990> that<00:06:08.080> what<00:06:08.319> they<00:06:08.440> needed<00:06:08.620> to

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
here because of that what they needed to

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.800 
here because of that what they needed to
do<00:06:08.919> for<00:06:09.159> this<00:06:09.279> but<00:06:09.610> overall<00:06:10.180> it's<00:06:10.569> it's

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
do for this but overall it's it's

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.800 
do for this but overall it's it's
slightly<00:06:11.169> shorter<00:06:11.740> than<00:06:11.770> than<00:06:12.759> than<00:06:12.969> the<00:06:13.629> one

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
slightly shorter than than than the one

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.749 
slightly shorter than than than the one
from<00:06:14.020> before<00:06:14.440> so<00:06:14.469> there's<00:06:15.009> a<00:06:15.099> quick<00:06:15.279> advantage

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
from before so there's a quick advantage

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.600 
from before so there's a quick advantage
there<00:06:15.969> on<00:06:16.360> the<00:06:17.110> grip<00:06:17.440> really<00:06:17.860> feels<00:06:18.129> the<00:06:18.310> same

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
there on the grip really feels the same

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.790 
there on the grip really feels the same
most<00:06:19.210> of<00:06:19.419> the<00:06:19.539> head<00:06:19.900> of<00:06:20.050> it<00:06:20.199> looks<00:06:20.409> the<00:06:20.589> same

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
most of the head of it looks the same

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.290 
most of the head of it looks the same
and<00:06:21.009> then<00:06:21.129> of<00:06:21.190> course<00:06:21.219> the<00:06:21.550> base<00:06:21.729> of<00:06:21.909> it<00:06:22.029> looks

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
and then of course the base of it looks

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.779 
and then of course the base of it looks
the<00:06:22.449> same<00:06:22.659> with<00:06:22.839> the<00:06:22.900> exception<00:06:23.319> of<00:06:23.409> the

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
the same with the exception of the

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.709 
the same with the exception of the
multiscreen<00:06:24.789> so<00:06:26.879> we'll<00:06:27.879> keep<00:06:28.060> testing<00:06:28.330> this

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
multiscreen so we'll keep testing this

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.149 
multiscreen so we'll keep testing this
but<00:06:28.900> I<00:06:28.960> can<00:06:29.080> tell<00:06:29.259> you<00:06:29.349> right<00:06:29.469> now<00:06:29.529> from<00:06:29.889> using

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 
but I can tell you right now from using

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.159 
but I can tell you right now from using
it<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:30.490> loop<00:06:30.639> and<00:06:30.879> I<00:06:30.969> have<00:06:31.210> wonderful

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169

wonderful improvements overall you get
the<00:06:34.930> benefit<00:06:35.380> of<00:06:35.409> brushless<00:06:35.770> but

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
the benefit of brushless but

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.120 
the benefit of brushless but
some<00:06:36.690> other<00:06:36.900> features<00:06:37.140> that<00:06:37.350> haven't<00:06:37.860> existed

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
some other features that haven't existed

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.820 
some other features that haven't existed
