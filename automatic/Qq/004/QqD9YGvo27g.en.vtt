00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
anyway so I've tested this system for

anyway so I've tested this system for
this<00:02:58.980> review<00:02:59.250> with<00:02:59.489> my<00:02:59.669> Canon<00:03:00.150> 5d<00:03:00.359> mark<00:03:00.720> ii<00:03:00.750> and

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
this review with my Canon 5d mark ii and

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.250 
this review with my Canon 5d mark ii and
i<00:03:01.409> got<00:03:01.980> some<00:03:02.189> really<00:03:02.549> nice<00:03:02.700> results<00:03:02.930> both<00:03:03.930> on

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
i got some really nice results both on

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.699 
i got some really nice results both on
outside<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.159> car<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.639> inside<00:03:06.419> there<00:03:07.409> are<00:03:07.439> so

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
outside the car and inside there are so

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.349 
outside the car and inside there are so
many<00:03:07.859> different<00:03:08.370> setups<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.879> you<00:03:08.970> can<00:03:09.150> do

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
many different setups that you can do

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.509 
many different setups that you can do
with<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.139> particular<00:03:10.409> system<00:03:10.919> when<00:03:11.459> you

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
with this particular system when you

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.550 
with this particular system when you
first<00:03:11.730> start<00:03:11.939> user<00:03:12.209> system<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.229> bit<00:03:13.379> like

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
first start user system it's a bit like

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.710 
first start user system it's a bit like
Lego<00:03:13.919> you<00:03:13.979> connecting<00:03:14.579> little<00:03:15.419> bits<00:03:15.599> and

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
Lego you connecting little bits and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.199 
Lego you connecting little bits and
pieces<00:03:15.810> trying<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.799> get<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.459> best<00:03:17.699> balance

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
pieces trying to get the best balance

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.979 
pieces trying to get the best balance
and<00:03:19.220> while<00:03:20.220> at<00:03:20.549> first<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.449> can<00:03:21.659> be<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.870> bit

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
and while at first it can be a bit

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.080 
and while at first it can be a bit
frustrating<00:03:22.199> and<00:03:22.919> you<00:03:23.069> want<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.310> get<00:03:23.400> as<00:03:23.639> good

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
frustrating and you want to get as good

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.770 
frustrating and you want to get as good
as<00:03:24.479> possible<00:03:24.629> with<00:03:25.199> time<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.069> practice<00:03:27.030> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
as possible with time and practice it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.289 
as possible with time and practice it
becomes<00:03:28.109> second<00:03:28.470> nature<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.069> that's<00:03:30.030> really

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
becomes second nature so that's really

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.069 
becomes second nature so that's really
cool<00:03:30.540> stuff

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
cool stuff

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.509 
cool stuff
the<00:03:31.290> recommend<00:03:31.590> speed<00:03:31.889> of<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.159> car<00:03:32.340> when

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
the recommend speed of the car when

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.869 
the recommend speed of the car when
using<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.030> suction<00:03:33.239> cups<00:03:33.629> is<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.500> think

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
using this suction cups is I think

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.869 
using this suction cups is I think
around<00:03:35.879> 30<00:03:36.269> kilometres<00:03:36.780> per<00:03:37.079> hour<00:03:37.409> which<00:03:37.620> is

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
around 30 kilometres per hour which is

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.069 
around 30 kilometres per hour which is
about<00:03:38.879> 20<00:03:39.180> miles<00:03:39.389> per<00:03:39.540> hour

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
about 20 miles per hour

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.460 
about 20 miles per hour
well<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:41.099> is<00:03:41.310> not<00:03:41.519> fast<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.449> you<00:03:43.109> would

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
well this is not fast and you would

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.710 
well this is not fast and you would
usually<00:03:43.799> not<00:03:43.919> try<00:03:44.159> for<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.519> speed<00:03:44.849> remember

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
usually not try for this speed remember

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.490 
usually not try for this speed remember
the<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.049> actually<00:03:46.560> filming<00:03:47.099> something<00:03:47.370> and

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
the you actually filming something and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.780 
the you actually filming something and
keeping<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.590> speed<00:03:49.859> down<00:03:50.010> will<00:03:50.370> actually

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
keeping the speed down will actually

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.390 
keeping the speed down will actually
help<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.329> with<00:03:51.629> the<00:03:52.439> stability<00:03:52.949> of<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.129> shot

there will be less shake from both the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.580 
there will be less shake from both the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
you will see from my test shots that

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.640 
I was able to get nice and dramatic
shots<00:04:17.100> because<00:04:17.820> when<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.750> mount<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.079> camera

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
shots because when you mount that camera

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.420 
shots because when you mount that camera
on<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.489> side<00:04:20.730> by<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.510> wheel<00:04:21.750> or<00:04:22.079> on<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.250> top

of the car

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.629 
of the car
everything<00:04:25.260> looks<00:04:25.440> much<00:04:25.740> more<00:04:25.919> dramatic<00:04:26.460> and

everything looks much more dramatic and

everything looks much more dramatic and
everything<00:04:27.450> works<00:04:27.660> really<00:04:27.930> nicely<00:04:28.200> even<00:04:28.530> at

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
everything works really nicely even at

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.310 
everything works really nicely even at
low<00:04:28.950> speed<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:30.000> particular<00:04:30.480> kid<00:04:30.690> comes<00:04:30.990> at<00:04:31.290> a

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
very good price and while there are some

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.470 
very good price and while there are some

cheaper Hamilton kids even from temp
tree<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.960> think<00:04:37.350> that<00:04:37.710> this<00:04:37.830> particular<00:04:38.040> one

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.450 
tree I think that this particular one
offers<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.510> lot<00:04:39.750> for<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:39.990> money<00:04:40.020> there's<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.830> lot

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
offers a lot for the money there's a lot

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.970 
offers a lot for the money there's a lot
of<00:04:41.610> flexibility<00:04:42.360> with<00:04:42.720> all<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.290> parts<00:04:43.650> that<00:04:43.710> I

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
of flexibility with all the parts that I
