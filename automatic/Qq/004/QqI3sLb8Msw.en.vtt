00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.749
 if mythix once again so we put live jei paris 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.150
 we are this time with the man loves the cordova scene 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.960
 Colonel Mass that is part of the banks 3 which is a little in the hen of 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.110
 death for this age and paris bah well this is already novel what you could 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.239
 introduce yourself for people leave konÃ© death then for me 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.310
 in life on earth 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.660
 before the age of 6 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.660
 no luck this year 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.990
 the cio explained 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.729
 facing the daily press 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:42.170
 the outgoing government 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.160
 she was a member of the staff and especially the reds motivated to count on paul 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.280
 here 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.030
 ok so down as in the devils you were a little in the hen of the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.840
 dead if there were banks 3 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 the fans of the star 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.550
 and at the time foods 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.810
 so the high school girl is pretty well out all you have to gain 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.700
 controlled two teams 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.540
 eventually it will take a little while the pressure compared to those of 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.739
 market how is it going 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.759
 honestly a lot of people saw me rather finish second 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.060
 third 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.040
 unpretentious half-moon think we had the means to finish first 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.820
 in 106 advanced on his last three players were missing really well 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.090
 to make up for the weight per month later 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.390
 so the first match because pretty well and we'll start 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.070
 already at the time my sister 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.700
 opti-time spent the rest a tough match 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.000
 So we have consistency in this event that we have gained 7% of attacks 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.100
 from the ira 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.100
 according to evening at this tax it is really much harder 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.660
 but we delayed the first round seems to me 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.420
 - even the first heat in the cold we lost the second the second it's 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.310
 the carnage that made Sunday and not more than the prince because in practice 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.530
 quite recently 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.490
 his name was sarah 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.490
 a flemish but we won we won there 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.780
 - this attempt to lynch France 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.780
 after we played against sales the band book latina season 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 gold first map so if I remember correctly it was 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.140
 this help to go here seems to me yes this case to very tight soaster 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.559
 horn with a director to dominate the map 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:09.709
 for the year 3 0 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.319
 and they are caught up to us three hook-up they made win only three 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.369
 with suspended sentence end of the end so a career of novelist 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.809
 and after the second one tenth time we're actually going cold it's been won 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.809
 5 armand we were wrong to support normand guilbeault 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.249
 the searches were interrupted still bears on the ranks 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:28.609
 do you know the map 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.569
 after start 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.839
 demonstration 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.089
 as for the defense 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:36.169
 local defense 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.359
 gold quite easily 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.359
 Orenburg after the attacked cons we compose 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.369
 quite easily will put it in hn we did not manage to ask after 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.969
 unfortunately one of the bows so many people for five rounds 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.099
 will have deposited their name I think we could win a match everything is 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.649
 possible 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.499
 the other markets that started in Algeria fanfare own and we did not 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:56.699
 never managed to ask 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.129
 so I'll show you very well defended during this term one 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.689
 danced to the approach of the north I asked myself nothing 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.469
 having so we arrived on 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.229
 the arzon snsm so the leverage of the crowd of events 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.429
 way did break euros 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.519
 without any worry what the preparation had a lot of trouble against 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.549
 very dangerous 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.269
 from his bag to three and in the end we won 5 3 so a game a little to 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.219
 the snatch remains a match and it's a very good match 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.129
 for the last match was against which thierry tilly so you'll 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.510
 see the easiest match in a state if the opus good at the end of his 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:27.800
 free concert of big teams of our hen 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.019
 wanimo side results okay 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.230
 why do you think of the organization of justice there would have 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.060
 fewer problems 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.319
 so we remain the organization cited three contracts at the beginning I had 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.269
 the impression we made of the podium finally number 2 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.450
 but who is a little edgy has received the precious for the elders 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:49.149
 here is an impression after m honestly my sense arrange 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.749
 beautiful again the vices that are a little help the staff 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.079
 and the winner the sybarval handle ink we will catch up for 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.639
 can be beaten 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.619
 okay so here the matches unfold this post a glass without 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.129
 retina chains the germany nazi who just arrived he's also in 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.640
 hen match gets to know the board 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.109
 but we already know that in the table part 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.499
 dozens of people 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.039
 valence has the capacity of 120 members 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:17.840
 on the other side the braided wool even week if they do not get done 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.989
 beaten to tampa in florida 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.740
 - apparently not free 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.970
 for its part training of mauro refosco meetings the most economical 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:29.419
 be more accomplice than the team the tenth team 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.499
 the problem that this tournament in hamburg 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:35.129
 the cold but that only pass a song in vulgar language also one 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.509
 manages well we should go for profit 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.680
 from abc m face mythical what we expect with a head titration 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.210
 against head after a flash-ball shot of a policeman at the afp 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:48.840
 we knew it but in France we understand each other 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.560
 those who were a little word of late for a little word of late for my 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.520
 signings
