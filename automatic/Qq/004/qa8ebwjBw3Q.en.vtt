00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.070
 hello my name is head or 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.779
 today i will teach you very simple they 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.419
 very quick recipe 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.910
 which perfectly replaces chocolate but 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.770
 no less sugar free for fat 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.610
 absolutely does not hurt your figure to 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.989
 the same is now summer and its hot weather 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.820
 nice let it try because you 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.840
 will own 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.149
 we will need a portion of chocolate 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.170
 protein as a teaspoon to 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.690
 right such 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:47.340
 for the sake of earning a little water and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:52.950
 small spoon 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.950
 natural cocoa powder even 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.170
 they started a lie and 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.310
 diluted gently diluted 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.140
 a little water 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:12.510
 mixing it up to a thick consistency 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.510
 such a gel empty thick cream 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.530
 water should be added gradually so as not to 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.530
 pour and need too 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.160
 I suffered 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.030
 now when we mixed our mass we 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.810
 take the molds and lay out a small 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.630
 part 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.730
 to the bottom to completely shut but 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.240
 because the mass is thick you need enough 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.240
 cabbage 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.020
 here are two closed now peanut butter 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.450
 literally a little bit can be complete 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.450
 teaspoon the middle 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.970
 can this little bit connect with you 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.710
 there was more stuffing 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.740
 but a large number of class are not needed and 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:52.010
 pour over the top chocolate mass again 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:54.400
 and already a small amount here it is 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.400
 spread out 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.630
 here 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.120
 it seems 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.260
 eight 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.750
 now we need to remove our finished ones 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.860
 freezer tins but before freezing 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.860
