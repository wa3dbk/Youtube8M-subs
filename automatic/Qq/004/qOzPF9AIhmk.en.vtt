00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.610
 hello I'm nicolÃ¡s from info game and this 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.839
 video tutorial these practical hours of 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.839
 fifa manager 2012 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 as you can see barcelona 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.350
 and way of the way 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.619
 what is the current barcelona this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.590
 it depends on the taste of each one 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.240
 players who go on the team 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.080
 once they build that we're going to see only 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.660
 the practices 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.169
 let's go tactics those will be let's see 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.169
 all manually 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.980
 we put complex 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.630
 and here we are going to start applying a 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.120
 bit 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.820
 Goal kick much involve everyone 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.310
 put as you want only as a miracle or 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.260
 court ordering that it be removed long 13 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.239
 of cort 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.239
 defensive let's continue 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.039
 if we go outside we will raise a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.489
 Match of the opposing team's life 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.430
 and leave defenseless counterattack and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.890
 put back or far back and select the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.659
 attack point 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.659
 or if we want to play a game in the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.520
 opposite field pressing the equipment 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.090
 the line ahead and out of the game 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.070
 then we have fast defenders 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.950
 when part of the ball can move 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.680
 speed to the juons against jon side 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.540
 and if we are going to play in the opposite field 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.870
 we can also put pressure on all the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.740
 field if we are going to play counterattack 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.220
 we put the pressure in the third 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.220
 defensive 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.510
 the line creator of the 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.930
 the steering wheel that is just so that 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.930
 the game 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.460
 a place where you want him to play 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.350
 by the bands 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.770
 and that key usually 9 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.970
 daily 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.970
 in the best sense 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.620
 percent for your next party 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.180
 that is, as the most important party 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.030
 most important party is sometimes 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.550
 that can be put once 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.160
 championship by season 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.020
 or as a more important part now and 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.220
 afterwards they can in the end I will not be able to 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.550
 share more important 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.190
 in this bar the level is selected 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.850
 of delivery if it is a friendly match or 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.720
 of minor importance with a low level if 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.940
 it is a normal pattern a medium level 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.040
 if only I recommend that if 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.320
 it's only a final match 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.900
 important you can deliver the maximum 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.260
 or are the young will tire quickly and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.670
 good render 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.670
 let's go now individual 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.600
 and all quite is selected 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.700
 explain each one 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.580
 flexibility position 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.640
 if it gets inflexible better 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.440
 instead and we are not much 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.840
 main is normal or is a model a 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.230
 little more and the player gets creative 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.390
 will leave that original place to move 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.710
 considerably longer hours the 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.560
 tickets 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.490
 go to remove the adhesive ball goes to 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.550
 scrape a lot a lot the normal floor 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.550
 and softly go to remove it casually 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.950
 the network is up so they go up a lot 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.630
 player to attack warn or never the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.990
 frequency of hundred the frequency of 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.990
 center 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.950
 well the line of movement is put 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.950
 to the poor 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.660
 Forward 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.660
 if you have good uncheck and if it is fast 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.140
 as a villa 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.180
 and well this action 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.490
 then but by the day movement to 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.970
 that is always the line of defense 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.709
 opposite and when part of the ball is 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.360
 forward then it remains hands of 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.700
 goalkeeper 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.590
 conserve is put to the poor 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.959
 the rest but final 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.389
 but it's a very frontal game it 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.150
 can keep for comfort a little 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.610
 of equipment break 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.610
 dribbling is a very skill game of 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.180
 dodge 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.180
 as a villa 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.260
 later so that instead of opting for a 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.530
 pass 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.090
 in each player and try past if not 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.680
 has good dribbling for the much the 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.000
 ball 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.490
 you put the ones that already the forwards 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.540
 you 're not going to defend then you do not know 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.700
 tire 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.350
 forward to the set piece is put to 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.900
 the players who have good auction of 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.500
 head for the balls stopped as the 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.200
 elbows the three free go up to nod 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.800
 for example spicy and 86 in addition to 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.199
 head that is a lot 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.330
 and I from far away from the midfielders 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:20.710
 original in 5 that have a punch 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.710
 when he has a shot of the area 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.160
 en route is selected to the cord why 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.620
 route that is that your best 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.360
 and by what route do you want me to get off and get off 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.360
 for half the side 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.430
 in comparison equipment can be put 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.280
 wings 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.520
 personal brands and now after a game 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.180
 of this type with one opposite the base 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.180
 personal brand 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.260
 we select the target of marking 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.550
 to 60 brands that player we put him 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:03.909
 but I think you liked not only 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:03.909
 comes to comment
