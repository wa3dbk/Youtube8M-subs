00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hi guys, let's make our pants 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.060
 shredded jeans you will need this 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.170
 material and an old or 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.000
 I do not know. 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.070
 My good old lady loved this 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.530
 pants and now I'll continue to love her 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.370
 Why will you be super super fashion cat? 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.039
 come on 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.170
 start with the ruler and a pencil making a 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.449
 trait actually did not make a test 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.460
 where would I make the cuts then I doing 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.740
 As I really like you can use 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
 your creativity and make a dash with the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.369
 pencil or with entered kohl with the pen 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.740
 that you have does not matter because 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.290
 We'll divert the first one. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.820
 trait is already done in fact the traits 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.280
 it's not that there are two to be able people 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.870
 a strip with the smaller pointed scissors 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.239
 I make the first cut to be able to 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.360
 the other scissors to enter the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 fabric and finish the cut on the thread 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 in the full extent 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.969
 in fact just right scissors she already 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.199
 will do this cut will not need to 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.699
 two scissors 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.559
 but as my small scissors high in 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.180
 a curve at the tip could not do 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.640
 a straight cut so I am 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.680
 using two but then that's it 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.539
 now I'll just finish the cut by following 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.539
 the trait I made upstairs down 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.750
 Dad was already excited about the song. 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.990
 I forgot to talk to you guys, go there and 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.110
 now you 're doing the same thing underneath 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.930
 making a cut and show you how 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.640
 that first strip was then with the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.100
 tip of the scissors I'll pull some 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.930
 to gain access to the other 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.119
 that I'll show you and you guys 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.310
 they will understand then start pulling like this 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.320
 for power we managed to shove 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.570
 pines that we will pull now with 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.490
 an eyebrow track that 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.920
 probably his mother only had his voice 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.350
 Your girlfriend I do not know has and if not 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.539
 have buy one cockroach breaks 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.789
 people pulling these strands are 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.869
 middle is not white wires and cisc had 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.550
 taken with scissors 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.850
 I'll show you now closer to 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 you see they are the children of 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.280
 vertical and horizontal of the horizontal 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.270
 are those clear from the vertical those more 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.220
 dark ne 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.470
 but same jeans color is what you 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.660
 have to do to give a charm to 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.940
 able to achieve that shredded effect 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.150
 well, professional is watching very slowly 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.100
 now 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.290
 sometimes we end up picking up the others 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.959
 clearer wires of osb stepladders but 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.489
 ends up giving a more potent effect 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.980
 destroyed that is what we really want 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.650
 but the intention is to get out pulls this is 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.079
 seeing very slowly for you see and take 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.060
 this matter now because the 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.880
 pants it 's all like that then the cuts 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.820
 will choose how you are going to do it and only 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.410
 diverting let's see now I'm here to 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.150
 show you what I ended up using 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.620
 marker because the pencil was not 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.739
 risking well then to stay more 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.630
 I made the cut with who I changed 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.340
 but the same logic is the same as the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.680
 Step, I'm just going to show you some more. 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.970
 For you guys, you really understand. 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.680
 How did I do it? 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.680
 Now I'll spend peace, enjoy the music. 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.830
 to with the tweezers and two bibles each leave 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.010
 edge of the shredder in this part of the 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.989
 pulling pants still rolling up the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.209
 mouth of the cause of this impression of pants 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.950
 old woman of well-instructed the same mouth 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.569
 because that's what I want and it's over 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.610
 pulling the strings and there gave a stretched 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.290
 in the fabric and you are seeing one more 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.700
 and pulling the wires 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.709
 We'll find out how it goes. 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.750
 It is easier to see there holding 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.300
 thumb and index finger the fabric and pulling 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.760
 With the other hand you see it like that. 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.709
 the bridges are easier for me 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.350
 I was pulling now I'm going to make one more 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.150
 cut close to the pocket or use the 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.580
 creativity you know I'm not one 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.680
 basic person so I did enough 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.019
 cuts in the pants and I thought that there 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.920
 higher up gets even more fashion 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:04:05.910
 So you follow your taste as you 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:08.640
 decided to make the cuts, it's the same now 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.820
 I will show you how okay I did five 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.440
 cuts on each side on each leg is 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.450
 showing you the end result 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.030
 I spent the whole day teaching procession 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.370
 doing that there in the video is super 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.270
 quick for you but I stayed for two 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.640
 in the afternoon at seven in the evening 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.979
 serious and did not end a little surprise me 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.410
 had such rates in the drawer. 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.150
 spike type but these are thumbtacks and I 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.610
 I decided that I would finish in 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.590
 all the cuts I've done but you do not 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.600
 You have to do it this game you have 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.550
 You can keep your trousers 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.950
 you want with the option I gave 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.930
 first but I wanted to add a 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.640
 a little more finishing and solved 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.310
 then place them with nozzle pliers 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.310
 boring places the rates and holding there in the 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.990
 background attention train well the china does not 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.030
 leave a little piss of her even a little to 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.690
 out because then it will hurt your leg 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.970
 OK 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.580
 as it has no lining underneath so it's good 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.000
 you give the pliers a little squeeze 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.860
 to fold the folds well so that 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.639
 there is no risk of hurting you when 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.610
 Are you wearing pants? I'll do it. 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.770
 in all the cuts like I said on ski 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.110
 random sides or 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.960
 this first as 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.770
 Thus, it did not follow any order if 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.770
 putting it to look good and natural 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.770
 stripped 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.040
 now I'll do everything quickly showing 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.040
 for you 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.300
 people i loved the result that pants 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.380
 Just use your creativity. 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.960
 reuse a jeans that you have home 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.630
 and gives a new face besides earning more 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.550
 style to have daring to wear is also 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.740
 Very cool, I really liked the result. 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.050
 maybe it was one of the customizations 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.880
 I did what I liked the most because 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.490
 really the result was positive, I 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.770
 I had never done it then if I could 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:07.430
 You can do it now, too. 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:11.740
 try on pants and tapurah 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.740

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.170
 and they liked there likes 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.300
