 separate them xd xd after a lot of waiting 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.310
 At last the day came when I would receive my 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.530
 first pokemon this filled me with 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.050
 emotion since always since I have 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.760
 memory had dreamed of living thousands of 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.670
 adventures next to some companions 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.560
 pokemon that I had a lot of love or 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.649
 at least that's what I wanted 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.509
 as soon as I woke up I prepared to go to 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.880
 see my friends and to choose a 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.640
 little bit I already had in mind the pokemon that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.310
 I wanted that pokemon had to be strong 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.410
 big and of course very powerful almost 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.570
 as much as arthur while dreaming 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.630
 awake I went into the lab and I 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.130
 I decided to choose a poke ballmer 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.320
 when I saw that all those pokemon were 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.900
 weak my illusions came down 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.730
 I could not believe this as expected 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.170
 will begin my adventure with a ship with 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.180
 so weak 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.310
 something ridiculous but I still came out 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.080
 running away without realizing that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.330
 one of the bats mouths that were in the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.890
 I arrived at a kind of forest in 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.739
 where I sat crying while 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.750
 sobbing can you hear a voice you want 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.600
 a pokémon stronger than any other 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.790
 He told me the mysterious thing when everything 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.920
 I had in my pocket and decided 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.470
 go home and just when I got up 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.239
 a poke bay rolled up to me I assumed that a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.670
 coach wanted to get rid of his 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.069
 pokemon so I did not give importance 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.260
 some and I left throughout the night 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.660
 I could not help but wonder what the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.910
 Pokémon that had given me this 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.799
 question intrigued me but after a 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.690
 I finally fell asleep in the morning 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.700
 Next, prepare a backpack for 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.860
 order to start my trip around me 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.420
 region and once I got out of 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.580
 house I opened the little fence that had 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.620
 found from the little by and came out a 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.690
 pokémon that was not at all common and was 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.970
 stupid that someone would like to get rid of 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.069
 from him he was nothing less than a dark cry me 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.440
 I was so excited I could not believe that a 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.750
 Pokémon so powerful I belonged without 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.030
 But my surprise was even greater when 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.080
 that pokemon spoke to me he told me that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.760
 now he had 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.640
 in a more powerful than those in the region 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.500
 or even the world unfortunately I 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.350
 greed was so much that I could not see the 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.760
 true intentions to give back 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.070
 our adventure had started 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.020
 we left my hometown and we fought 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.060
 with all the coaches that we were 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.940
 put in front so you can 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.950
 training the battles were very easy 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.990
 since he was a very powerful pokemon 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.270
 so after a while we decided 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.190
 beat all the gym leaders 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.530
 when we decided to rest from 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.930
 training give cra and I talked 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.180
 for hours then we had already done 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.890
 great friends he told me about how bad 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.810
 that humans had treated him and 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.330
 some pokemon and I talked to him about my 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.180
 past life everything went from the best until 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.070
 that one day I decided to trap a polygon 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.380
 but when I launch a loop that goes to the crai 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.959
 he disobeyed me and killed something that mon 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.490
 I was stunned I did not understand anything came out 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.650
 tears from my cheeks 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.780
 I asked him why he had killed him if 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.700
 I had not done anything dark knight me 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.410
 he replied that this was a very pokemon 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.360
 weak and that he did not deserve to be in 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.460
 our team yell at you that weak or not 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.060
 he had no right to kill him 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.770
 deser 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.139
 I that the team could not have 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.330
 Pokemons so weak after telling me 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.460
 this came in he knew that dancing and the worst 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.620
 The fact is that the same thing always happened 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.230
 every time I tried to catch a 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.330
 new pokémon he murdered him when 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.190
 I got four medals I decided it would be 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.620
 better to release it because besides 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.870
 he killed he released the pokemon but also 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.000
 to their coaches for this reason not 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.760
 I wanted to get more medals or catch 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.860
 more why however when I tried 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.960
 talking to him attacked me and told me that he 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.790
 it would be the only pokemon that I had and 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.010
 if I did not think the same he was going to 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.650
 kill me a cold sweat ran by me 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.900
 back was scared but still what 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.550
 I faced the flu that he could not be my 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.800
 only pokemon and leave me alone 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.050
 because at that moment I would release it 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.660
 in turn he told me that before that 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.639
 would happen would kill me but just before 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.830
 receive your attack a light came out of me 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.510
 pocket apparently was the little fence 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.610
 I had saved the day I met 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.270
 dark knight the pokemon that came out of this 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.460
 was 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.290
 I thought that now I was not just going to die 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.360
 but also that poor one because a 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.310
 innocent who only wanted to protect him 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.380
 I said that he will leave but he did not listen to me 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.330
 I expected certain death but that 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.880
 small and simple pokemon managed to defeat 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.680
 to give bugle was very impressed 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.180
 I decided to stay with him and when we 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.370
 we realized the ark had already 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.440
 gone now I have found and 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.240
 captured new pokémon with help from me 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.010
 friend your tweet I'm about to 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.990
 face the high command but in the 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.910
 background of my soul a stranger to hard 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.680
 drive because I know that what he did was for 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.260
 how badly we humans treated it 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.240
 I just wanted a friend but good too 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.980
 I know that sooner or later he will return to 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.840
 finish what it started and I will be 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.180
 waiting to have it face to face and 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.340
 face it with my new friends but 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.440
 even after so long I do not know how 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.660
 it was possible that a pokemon basically 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.610
 newborn will beat a legendary 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.670
 but in the end that will be a mystery that 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.310
 I will never solve good that's all for 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.350
 today I hope there are going to be girls that the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.810
 space passed us a little hand 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.420
 in our fight but do not worry anymore 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.320
 we feel better in the end now 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.930
 I will present the crepe 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.690
