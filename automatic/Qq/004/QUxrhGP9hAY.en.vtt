I think it's three times now so this
time<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:52.610> looks<00:00:52.790> like<00:00:52.910> I'm<00:00:53.000> gonna<00:00:53.150> koala

years in a row and so I guess the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.190 
years in a row and so I guess the
biggest<00:03:27.030> accomplishment<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.720> really<00:03:27.960> had<00:03:28.110> to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
biggest accomplishment I really had to

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.600 
biggest accomplishment I really had to
put<00:03:28.350> everything<00:03:28.530> aside<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.040> really<00:03:29.400> drive

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
put everything aside and really drive

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.160 
put everything aside and really drive
for<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.030> when<00:03:30.150> when<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:30.660> do<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.110> just

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
for it and when when you do that it just

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.480 
for it and when when you do that it just
means<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.590> much<00:03:31.740> more<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.160> when<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.370> do

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
means that much more to you when you do

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.280 
means that much more to you when you do
win<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:32.940> finally<00:03:33.450> got<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.870> three<00:03:34.110> years

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
win it and finally got it three years

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.380

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
finally got that win so it feels really

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.630
