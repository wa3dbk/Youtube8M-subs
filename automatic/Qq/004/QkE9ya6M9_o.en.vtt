what part you want so let's say I just
want<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> start<00:01:10.999> I'm<00:01:11.999> just<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.569> to<00:01:12.659> hit<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
want the start I'm just going to hit I

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.160 
want the start I'm just going to hit I
and<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:14.009> will<00:01:14.130> crop<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.609> part<00:01:14.909> off<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.929> I<00:01:15.990> can

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and it will crop this part off so I can

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.629 
and it will crop this part off so I can
start<00:01:16.499> this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.859> where<00:01:17.009> I'll<00:01:17.100> start<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> clip

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:17.639 
start this is where I'll start the clip

and then when I drag it let's say I want

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.899 
and then when I drag it let's say I want
to<00:01:20.639> stop<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.179> about<00:01:22.130> just<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.340> times<00:01:23.670> sake

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
there then you're going to hit 0 on a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
there then you're going to hit 0 on a
computer<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:27.869> crop<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.560> that's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
computer and it will crop it and that's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.289 
computer and it will crop it and that's
the<00:01:28.770> route<00:01:29.039> point<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.549> there's<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.789> endpoint

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and the out point this will crop it down

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
and the out point this will crop it down
to<00:01:32.789> how<00:01:33.240> much<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.719> want<00:01:33.929> to<00:01:33.990> use<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.530> your

allows<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.530> UM<00:03:05.120> for<00:03:06.120> me<00:03:06.300> um<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:08.010> seems<00:03:08.910> like

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
allows it to UM for me um it seems like

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.780 
allows it to UM for me um it seems like
it<00:03:09.180> allows<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.810> go<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.320> upload<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.340> YouTube

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
it allows it to go in upload to YouTube

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.510 
it allows it to go in upload to YouTube
faster<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.480> still<00:03:14.540> keep<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> quality<00:03:15.990> um<00:03:16.520> you

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
faster and still keep the quality um you

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.520 
faster and still keep the quality um you
want<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.760> click<00:03:17.970> export<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:19.709> an<00:03:20.120> h.264<00:03:21.120> file<00:03:21.690> so

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
want to click export to an h.264 file so

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.220 
want to click export to an h.264 file so
we'll<00:03:22.620> convert<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.130> an<00:03:23.280> h.264<00:03:24.150> file<00:03:24.570> and

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
we'll convert it to an h.264 file and

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.460 
we'll convert it to an h.264 file and
this<00:03:25.380> will<00:03:25.560> allow<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.040> go<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:27.350> upload<00:03:28.350> to

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
this will allow it to go to upload to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.990 
this will allow it to go to upload to
YouTube<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.920> little<00:03:29.160> bit<00:03:29.250> faster<00:03:29.610> than<00:03:29.640> normal

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
YouTube a little bit faster than normal

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.170 
YouTube a little bit faster than normal
to<00:03:30.330> see<00:03:30.890> when<00:03:31.890> I've<00:03:32.010> tried<00:03:32.280> other<00:03:32.550> things<00:03:32.640> it

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
to see when I've tried other things it

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.810 
to see when I've tried other things it
didn't<00:03:33.780> want<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.260> file<00:03:35.130> types<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.489> didn't<00:03:35.670> want

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
didn't want to file types it didn't want

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.449 
didn't want to file types it didn't want
any<00:03:35.910> well<00:03:36.410> upload<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.620> faster<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.250> one

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
any well upload is faster but this one

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.030 
any well upload is faster but this one
seems<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.820> be<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.090> fastest<00:03:39.510> for<00:03:39.840> me<00:03:40.170> now<00:03:40.470> some

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
seems to be the fastest for me now some

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.920 
seems to be the fastest for me now some
people<00:03:41.310> use<00:03:41.340> compressor<00:03:42.120> they'll<00:03:42.630> send<00:03:42.840> this

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
people use compressor they'll send this

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.130 
people use compressor they'll send this
clip<00:03:43.170> off<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.500> compressor<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.100> they<00:03:44.760> will

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
clip off to compressor and they will

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.900 
clip off to compressor and they will
change<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.260> Kodak<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:46.680> there<00:03:46.830> but<00:03:47.040> for<00:03:47.790> right

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
change the Kodak in there but for right

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.080 
change the Kodak in there but for right
now<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.360> just<00:03:48.690> use<00:03:49.110> an<00:03:49.230> h.264<00:03:50.010> file<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:51.000> then

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
now I just use an h.264 file and then

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.850 
now I just use an h.264 file and then
you'll<00:03:51.209> click<00:03:51.330> Next<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.989> will<00:03:52.170> export<00:03:52.620> and
