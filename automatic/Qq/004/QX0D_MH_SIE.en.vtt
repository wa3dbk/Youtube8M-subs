-<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:08.160> s15<00:00:09.120> here<00:00:09.660> recently<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:11.150> I<00:00:12.440> really<00:00:13.440> have

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
- a s15 here recently and I really have

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.390 
- a s15 here recently and I really have
had<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> lot<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.340> fun<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:16.160> it's<00:00:17.160> great

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
had a lot of fun with it it's it's great

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.029 
had a lot of fun with it it's it's great
in<00:00:17.640> low<00:00:17.820> light<00:00:18.060> conditions<00:00:19.100> it<00:00:20.100> got<00:00:22.039> fantastic

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
in low light conditions it got fantastic

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.779 
in low light conditions it got fantastic
colors<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:25.050> anti<00:00:25.320> shake<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:26.340> just

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
colors and the anti shake is just

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.080 
colors and the anti shake is just
brilliant<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.630> many<00:00:30.779> ways<00:00:32.090> Sony

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
brilliant so I think in many ways Sony

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.799 
brilliant so I think in many ways Sony
managed<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.260> nail<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:35.000> but<00:00:36.000> they<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.600> did

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
managed to nail it but they really did

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.389 
managed to nail it but they really did
some<00:00:37.110> very<00:00:37.469> strange<00:00:38.000> mistakes<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.180> my<00:00:39.690> opinion

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
some very strange mistakes in my opinion

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.619 
some very strange mistakes in my opinion
first<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:42.290> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> mistake<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.629> try

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
first of all this is a mistake you try

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.869 
first of all this is a mistake you try
to<00:00:45.690> place<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.260> somewhere<00:00:49.370> yeah<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.670> doesn't

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
to place it somewhere yeah it doesn't

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.360 
to place it somewhere yeah it doesn't
work<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.980> it's<00:00:52.980> round<00:00:54.710> that<00:00:55.710> doesn't

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
work because it's round that doesn't

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.810 
work because it's round that doesn't
really<00:00:56.550> makes<00:00:56.820> much<00:00:57.030> sense

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
really makes much sense

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.950 
really makes much sense
secondly<00:01:00.230> there<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.320> no<00:01:02.660> threat<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
secondly there is no threat for the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640 
secondly there is no threat for the
tripod<00:01:04.530> stand<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.479> camera<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.900> actually

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
tripod stand as the camera is actually

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.120 
tripod stand as the camera is actually
you<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.130> lid<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.150> leads<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
you have this lid that leads you to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.810 
you have this lid that leads you to
different<00:01:11.130> kind<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.430> ports<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.380> USB<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
different kind of ports like the USB and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
different kind of ports like the USB and
HDMI<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.920> microphone<00:01:18.049> which<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
HDMI you have a microphone which is of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.609 
HDMI you have a microphone which is of
course<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.860> great<00:01:20.009> feature<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.210> most<00:01:21.390> cases

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
course a great feature but in most cases

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.670 
course a great feature but in most cases
you<00:01:22.619> simply<00:01:23.040> can't<00:01:23.310> use<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.320> if<00:01:25.320> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you simply can't use it because if you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.350 
you simply can't use it because if you
put<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> stand<00:01:27.439> with<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.909> they<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.150> so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
put it on a stand with what they have so

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
put it on a stand with what they have so
find<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.930> range<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.920> buy

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
find the range and what you buy

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
find the range and what you buy
including<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> camera<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.659> waterproof

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
including the camera is this waterproof

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.670 
including the camera is this waterproof
box<00:01:34.640> which<00:01:35.640> got<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> prime<00:01:36.299> tripod<00:01:37.079> stand<00:01:37.229> but

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
box which got the prime tripod stand but

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
box which got the prime tripod stand but
as<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:40.430> how<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> supposed<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
as you see how are you supposed to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.780 
as you see how are you supposed to
connect<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.110> microphone<00:01:43.259> if<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.130> inside<00:01:44.520> here

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
connect a microphone if it's inside here

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.429 
connect a microphone if it's inside here
that's<00:01:45.149> simply<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.200> possible<00:01:48.439> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that's simply just not possible so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.710 
that's simply just not possible so
that's<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.759> an<00:01:50.880> option<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> want

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
that's really not an option if you want

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.940 
that's really not an option if you want
to<00:01:51.810> put<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.170> tripod<00:01:54.619> anyway<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> was

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
to put it on a tripod anyway I was

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.350 
to put it on a tripod anyway I was
walking<00:01:56.280> around<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> other<00:01:56.969> day<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
walking around here the other day and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.030 
walking around here the other day and
came<00:01:57.600> past<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:59.479> which<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> chinese-made

and I looked at it I thought to myself
that<00:02:11.270> could<00:02:11.569> actually<00:02:11.720> work<00:02:12.129> so<00:02:13.129> I<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.459> bought

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910

it and brought it home and did a few hex
to<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.209> make<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.390> work<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:18.310> added<00:02:19.310> these<00:02:19.489> two

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
to it to make it work I added these two

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.100 
to it to make it work I added these two
pieces<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.390> rubber<00:02:20.690> they<00:02:21.319> make<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:23.720> camera

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.490 
property in the bank so now what I can
do<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.549> can<00:02:50.739> squeeze<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.920> camera<00:02:52.250> inside

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
do is I can squeeze the camera inside

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.050 
do is I can squeeze the camera inside
and<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.530> made<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.040> maybe<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.459> little<00:02:55.640> bit<00:02:55.819> too

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
and I made it maybe a little bit too

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.059 
and I made it maybe a little bit too
tight<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.420> squeeze<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.200> anyway<00:02:57.560> that's

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
tight a squeeze but anyway that's

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.009 
tight a squeeze but anyway that's
something<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.640> can<00:02:58.790> adjust<00:02:59.120> with<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.420> with<00:02:59.989> a

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
something I can adjust with a with a

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.870 
something I can adjust with a with a
knife<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.040> holds<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.459> camera<00:03:07.670> in

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
knife so so that holds the camera in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.590 
knife so so that holds the camera in
place<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:09.410> now<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.620> have<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> tripod<00:03:11.170> mount<00:03:12.170> I

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
place and now I have a tripod mount I

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.199 
place and now I have a tripod mount I
still<00:03:14.600> don't<00:03:14.810> have<00:03:14.930> access<00:03:15.139> to<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.579> mic

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
still don't have access to to the mic

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.650 
still don't have access to to the mic
out<00:03:17.389> but<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.690> could<00:03:17.959> really<00:03:18.260> easily<00:03:18.709> just<00:03:19.660> drill

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
out but I could really easily just drill

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.900 
out but I could really easily just drill
a<00:03:20.690> hole<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:22.130> would<00:03:22.280> solve<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.880> problem

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
a hole and that would solve the problem

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.750 
a hole and that would solve the problem
but<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:23.870> far<00:03:24.079> I<00:03:24.139> don't<00:03:24.319> even<00:03:24.799> have<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.250> mic<00:03:25.430> so

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
but so far I don't even have the mic so

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.940 
but so far I don't even have the mic so
there's<00:03:26.030> no<00:03:26.150> reason<00:03:26.480> for<00:03:26.510> doing<00:03:26.720> anything<00:03:27.079> but

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
there's no reason for doing anything but

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.530 
there's no reason for doing anything but
at<00:03:28.069> least<00:03:28.190> now<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.430> could<00:03:28.730> put<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.180> tripod

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
at least now I could put it on a tripod

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.960 
at least now I could put it on a tripod
stand<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:30.799> have<00:03:31.010> access<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.579> all<00:03:31.760> functions

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
stand and I have access to all functions

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.949 
stand and I have access to all functions
and<00:03:33.459> nothing<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.819> obscure<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.450> microphone

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
and nothing to obscure the microphone

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.509 
and nothing to obscure the microphone
it's<00:03:36.290> because<00:03:36.829> they<00:03:37.069> are<00:03:37.130> sitting<00:03:37.940> here<00:03:39.519> so

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
it's because they are sitting here so

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.920 
it's because they are sitting here so
that's<00:03:41.420> my<00:03:41.569> little<00:03:41.900> heck<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.470> this<00:03:42.590> problem<00:03:43.130> I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
that's my little heck to this problem I

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.120 
that's my little heck to this problem I
just<00:03:44.930> still<00:03:45.380> don't<00:03:45.410> get<00:03:45.769> why<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:48.440> technicians

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
just still don't get why the technicians

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.900 
just still don't get why the technicians
at<00:03:49.340> Sony

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
at Sony

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.870 
at Sony
missed<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.870> point<00:03:51.079> that<00:03:51.530> of<00:03:51.769> course<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.670> want

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
missed the point that of course you want

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.410 
missed the point that of course you want
to<00:03:52.970> put<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.299> camera<00:03:53.690> on<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:54.500> tripod<00:03:55.420> without

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
to put the camera on a tripod without

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.569 
to put the camera on a tripod without
the<00:03:56.750> waterproof<00:03:57.260> box<00:03:57.530> first<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.310> all<00:03:58.430> it

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
the waterproof box first of all it

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.220 
the waterproof box first of all it
doesn't<00:03:58.760> improve<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.359> sound<00:03:59.569> because<00:04:00.079> it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
doesn't improve the sound because it

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.280 
doesn't improve the sound because it
closed<00:04:00.500> off<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.950> microphones<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:02.900> can<00:04:03.079> still

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
closed off the microphones you can still

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.259 
closed off the microphones you can still
get<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.620> sound<00:04:03.920> but<00:04:04.310> it's<00:04:04.459> just<00:04:04.819> not<00:04:05.030> as<00:04:05.209> good

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
get the sound but it's just not as good

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.589 
get the sound but it's just not as good
as<00:04:05.660> without<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:07.069> secondly<00:04:07.970> if<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.180> put<00:04:08.389> it<00:04:08.480> in

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
as without and secondly if you put it in

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.349 
as without and secondly if you put it in
the<00:04:08.690> box<00:04:08.900> there's<00:04:09.500> no<00:04:09.919> way<00:04:10.220> you<00:04:10.819> can<00:04:11.030> actually

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
the box there's no way you can actually

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.129 
the box there's no way you can actually
access<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.819> full<00:04:14.030> function<00:04:14.480> of<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.780> camera

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
access the full function of the camera

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.770 
access the full function of the camera
unless<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.709> do<00:04:15.859> it<00:04:15.889> from<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.250> smart<00:04:16.549> phone<00:04:16.780> over

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
unless you do it from a smart phone over

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.110 
unless you do it from a smart phone over
the<00:04:17.900> Wi-Fi<00:04:18.079> which<00:04:18.890> of<00:04:19.099> course<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:19.579> an<00:04:19.729> option

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
the Wi-Fi which of course is an option

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.860 
the Wi-Fi which of course is an option
but<00:04:20.390> still

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
but still

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:32.480 
but still
still<00:04:22.260> obscures<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.889> sound<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:31.010> there<00:04:32.010> we<00:04:32.130> go

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
still obscures the sound so there we go

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.200 
still obscures the sound so there we go
I'll<00:04:32.820> just<00:04:33.150> need<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.480> raise<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.020> camera<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.410> bit

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:50.140 

now<00:04:39.210> it's<00:04:39.510> on<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.750> tripod<00:04:39.960> just<00:04:42.830> like<00:04:43.830> that

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.950 

hope<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.270> can<00:04:51.419> use<00:04:51.450> it

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
hope you can use it

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.530 
hope you can use it
