00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.129
 or not 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.240
 and you already passed by the 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.530
 renewed engine germania dealer 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.670
 if you here will find all the 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.410
 cars you were always looking for 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.570
 plus the service plus the plans 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.970
 financing and above all you will find 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.380
 the impressive clear amarok that 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.180
 we enjoy every time we have the 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.560
 opportunity to see and feel it 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.540
 because today we have a version too 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.610
 renewed carlos welcome and let's talk about 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.860
 what is this brand new something like 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.230
 it's so good right now we're 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.780
 watching the amarok andean is a truck 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.300
 which, as it says, has been renewed in 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.920
 as to what is an engine that follows 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.620
 being motor two thousand cubic centimeters 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.660
 diesel but that has a range of 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.330
 very good fuel and additional to that 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.520
 the price is very good and we are going to 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.020
 show what technical characteristics are 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.020
 they will find additional in this 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.019
 in amaros we have all the 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.580
 security systems then to one you 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.610
 was to sell a similar truck in 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.790
 its price but in security technology 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.140
 amarok is still at the top of this 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.770
 segment as such was finding him 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.479
 a 4x4 truck of 140 horses of a car 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.759
 has all the security systems 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.009
 like abs brakes like traction control 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.570
 so that the car does not skid in this 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.990
 truck with a very good lens and it's 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.569
 that I can use the 4x4 in 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.149
 maximum uncovered pavement up to 100 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.189
 kilometers of speed simply that 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.140
 I'm going to activate this button and 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.539
 then immediately already activates the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.640
 four-wheel drive system 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.890
 in this way the car prevents me 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.119
 do some strange in uncovered and for 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.369
 example when one comes down the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.500
 broom that is the wet pavement what 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.420
 active so that there is no queue with 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.909
 truck is important that the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.149
 people approach germany and motorcycles to 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.689
 know how the additional 4x4 is handled 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.020
 as we see in the images the 4x4 with 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.060
 the bass needs the car to be 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.860
 that be burning clos and can see 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.769
 how are you going to one of the truck 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.569
 obviously that should not be done 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.400
 get off the vehicle but just what 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.709
 we make for demonstration that the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.079
 car can only move forward without 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.819
 need to come out playing no pedal and 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.819
 that avoids being burning close to the case 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.310
 this month we can find marc in his 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.870
 version 4 by 2 from 75 million 900 the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.379
 4x4 version which is what we are 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.209
 knowing is from 81 900 and also 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.110
 this month we are going to have something very special 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:49.260
 and it is that amaro 4x4 automatic we are going to 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.260
 have a financing plan 50 5000 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.530
 I love that the mixture of two things the hand 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.420
 is the mixture of comfort and robustness 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.830
 they are going to have a car to be able to shoot in 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.600
 the ordinary city as if 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.790
 were a car the comfort that gives a 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.560
 automobile but when I entered a 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.900
 maluco terrain to an uncovered terrain 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.670
 they will have all the power and all the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.890
 German engineering within reach of 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.660
 people then one live in the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.760
 driving experience that one has with 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.440
 amargós why I invite you to german to 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.780
 motorcycles that approach to handle it already 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.340
 we have pendrive that is this we design 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.830
 a special edition in German since 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.410
 called the dakar the car it has has 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.780
 some different rims a different rim 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.570
 comes already tent and with hard line air and the 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.459
 The minimum cost is good. 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.769
 of this truck is that the 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.569
 Driving sensation is unique 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.100
 I'm finding a 2000 engine between 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.290
 the people who would have taken this car 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.760
 purged for being 2000 engine that's why the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.010
 I invite you to come and handle it because 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.810
 is that handle another bridge the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.810
 truck feels that immediately 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.950
 load the turbo thousand 800 revolutions 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.900
 immediately off the car already 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.400
 he feels impressive the strength by 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.299
 example on the hill as san julián let's go 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.240
 to have a car that will start 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.170
 perfect 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.120
 without purging compared to a 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.190
 truck that was a traditional engine 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.110
 so here we see the subject of 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.790
 German engineering compared to what 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.160
 they will find in the market with amaro 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.960
 I can put the payment plan that 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.160
 you wish already if you tell me in 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.770
 I really have a car in part payment 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.320
 we take it back in part of payment 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.150
 of the truck can you tell me I do not have 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.920
 money right now I get a 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.360
 silver in six months ready between come I 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.830
 I arranged a plan for them to pay me 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.250
 in six months or to get paid in a 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.720
 can you tell me I give you 10 percent 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.010
 isa that the rest financed we can 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.390
 do the ar with amaro we have 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.890
 absolutely all the plans of 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.840
 village financing I hope in germany 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.790
 you will be able to propose how they want 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.440
 take your additional van to the 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.600
 another very good thing and that is that I love 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.120
 It has three year warranty or a hundred 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.070
 thousand kilometers of travel and the 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.720
 service intervals are every 10,000 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.700
 miles then a goal that I know 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.990
 delivered them and in ten thousand kilometers we 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.000
 we go back to see where we are located 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.740
 Carlos in front of prize in places on 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.450
 all 30 next to auto mountain very 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.280
 country to arrive and I invite you to 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.800
 know the room how was that room that 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.820
 impressively nice then take advantage 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.250
 comes 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.840
 of all these cars and from now on 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.460
 we make the recommendation try the 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.600
 amarok that we want to go back down 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.600
 never from this truck
