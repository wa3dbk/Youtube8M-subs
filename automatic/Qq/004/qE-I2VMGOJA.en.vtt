well non-lethal weapons are really
pretty<00:00:32.550> critically<00:00:33.260> important<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.670> so<00:00:35.670> what

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
pretty critically important and so what

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.410 
pretty critically important and so what
I<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:37.140> me<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> Dazzler<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
I have with me is a Dazzler so the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.010 
I have with me is a Dazzler so the
Dazzler<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> seasickness<00:00:40.950> machine<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
Dazzler is a seasickness machine and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.319 
Dazzler is a seasickness machine and
what<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.110> does<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.559> uses<00:00:43.739> leds<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
what it does it uses leds and it's a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.310 
what it does it uses leds and it's a
random<00:00:45.839> generator<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:47.120> it<00:00:48.120> affects<00:00:48.570> your

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
random generator and it affects your

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.709 
random generator and it affects your

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
vomiting we thought we can probably do

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.720 
vomiting we thought we can probably do
that<00:02:14.080> for<00:02:14.230> under<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.470> million<00:02:14.620> dollars<00:02:14.740> so<00:02:15.460> we

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
that for under a million dollars so we

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.580 
that for under a million dollars so we
put<00:02:15.880> together<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.240> project<00:02:16.450> for<00:02:16.840> about<00:02:16.960> 250

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
put together this project for about 250

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.020 
put together this project for about 250
bucks<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.100> are<00:02:18.400> publishing<00:02:18.760> all<00:02:18.940> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
bucks and are publishing all the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.400 
bucks and are publishing all the
information<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:19.870> build<00:02:20.170> one<00:02:20.350> of

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410

enclosure<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.830> reused<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.730> flashlight<00:02:25.690> that

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
enclosure so I reused a flashlight that

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.890 
enclosure so I reused a flashlight that
I<00:02:26.200> got<00:02:26.380> from<00:02:26.500> Sears<00:02:27.209> so<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.660> head

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
I got from Sears so this is the head

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.140 
I got from Sears so this is the head
which<00:02:29.260> holds<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.709> LEDs<00:02:30.130> electronics<00:02:30.820> inside

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
which holds the LEDs electronics inside

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.380 
which holds the LEDs electronics inside
this<00:02:31.930> push<00:02:32.260> button<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.920> how<00:02:33.550> we<00:02:33.610> activate<00:02:34.060> it

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
this push button is how we activate it

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.810 
this push button is how we activate it
it's<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.750> not<00:02:34.989> turned<00:02:35.590> on<00:02:35.650> right<00:02:35.800> now

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
it's a not turned on right now

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.880 
it's a not turned on right now
and<00:02:37.000> here<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.870> lead-acid<00:02:38.170> battery<00:02:38.739> that

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
and here is a lead-acid battery that

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.240 
and here is a lead-acid battery that
provides<00:02:39.160> power<00:02:39.510> up<00:02:40.510> here<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:41.020> have<00:02:41.170> 36<00:02:41.739> LEDs

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
provides power up here we have 36 LEDs

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.150 
provides power up here we have 36 LEDs
each<00:02:42.580> one<00:02:42.880> has<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.750> lens<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.410> focuses<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
each one has a lens that focuses the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.120 
each one has a lens that focuses the
optics<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:46.570> I'm<00:02:47.200> going<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.410> remove<00:02:47.739> just<00:02:47.980> the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
optics so I'm going to remove just the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.620 
optics so I'm going to remove just the
lens<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.820> can<00:02:49.000> see<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.390> there's<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
lens and you can see that there's a

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.380 
lens and you can see that there's a
basic<00:02:50.080> heatsink<00:02:50.560> with<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> fan<00:02:51.220> on<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.489> back<00:02:51.760> to

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
help with a little heat sinking here we

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.280 
help with a little heat sinking here we
have<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:57.070> circuit<00:02:57.430> board<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:58.360> have<00:02:58.660> six

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
have the circuit board we have six

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.800
