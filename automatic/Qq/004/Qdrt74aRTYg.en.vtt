00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
this came in fairly quickly from Rosella

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.939 
this came in fairly quickly from Rosella
when<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.689> ordered<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.769> special

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
when I ordered it and it was on special

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.590 
when I ordered it and it was on special
and<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.430> was<00:00:32.550> another<00:00:32.790> reason<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.180> ordered<00:00:33.449> it

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and that was another reason I ordered it

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.280 
and that was another reason I ordered it
and<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.580> looking<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.420> some<00:00:36.690> new<00:00:36.839> rain<00:00:37.080> gear

had to order these separately but that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.050 
had to order these separately but that

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
where you can cinch up your pants on

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.950

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
your your boots it's pretty nice and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.040 
your your boots it's pretty nice and
it's<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.649> good<00:02:09.860> wide<00:02:10.100> opening<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:11.090> uh<00:02:11.120> your

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
it's a good wide opening that uh your

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.080 
it's a good wide opening that uh your
motorcycle<00:02:12.590> boots<00:02:12.770> can<00:02:13.010> fit<00:02:13.580> down<00:02:13.610> through

motorcycle boots can fit down through

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.550 
motorcycle boots can fit down through
there<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:15.010> think<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:16.610> I'm<00:02:16.730> used<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.240> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
there I think what I'm used to is a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.830 
there I think what I'm used to is a
zipper<00:02:18.560> with<00:02:18.800> Velcro<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.660> one

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
zipper with Velcro on it and this one

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.520 
zipper with Velcro on it and this one
doesn't<00:02:21.020> have<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.310> am<00:02:23.170> hoping<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.290> like

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
doesn't have that so I am hoping I like

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.940 
doesn't have that so I am hoping I like
this<00:02:24.820> one<00:02:25.820> thing<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.330> saw<00:02:26.990> about<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
this one thing that I saw about the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.500 
this one thing that I saw about the
information<00:02:28.490> was<00:02:29.000> because<00:02:29.660> they<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:31.510> it's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
information was because they have a it's

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.680 
information was because they have a it's
a<00:02:33.220> piece<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.250> cloth<00:02:34.580> here<00:02:34.820> but<00:02:35.120> what<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.480> does

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
a piece of cloth here but what it does

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.470 
a piece of cloth here but what it does
is<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.050> keeps<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.520> rain<00:02:37.520> gear<00:02:37.730> from<00:02:37.940> melting

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
is it keeps the rain gear from melting

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.290 
is it keeps the rain gear from melting
when<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:39.370> hit<00:02:40.370> up<00:02:40.459> against<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> pipe<00:02:41.090> when

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
when you hit up against the pipe when

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.290 
when you hit up against the pipe when
you're<00:02:41.420> sitting<00:02:41.720> on<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.930> bikes<00:02:42.170> that's

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
you're sitting on the bikes that's

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.770 
you're sitting on the bikes that's
really<00:02:44.300> important<00:02:46.209> because<00:02:47.209> I've<00:02:47.540> done<00:02:47.720> that

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
really important because I've done that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.590 
really important because I've done that
before<00:02:48.170> what's<00:02:48.650> another<00:02:48.890> material<00:02:49.670> and

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
before what's another material and

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.710 
before what's another material and
that's<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:50.959> both<00:02:51.110> sides<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:55.720> really

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
that's on both sides of that the really

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.660 
that's on both sides of that the really
nice<00:02:57.019> hangers

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.209 

this<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.819> these<00:03:04.450> are<00:03:04.659> all<00:03:04.689> which<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.799> failed<00:03:06.010> to

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:06.219 
this is these are all which I failed to

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.369 
this is these are all which I failed to
say<00:03:06.400> are<00:03:07.030> all<00:03:07.269> Olympia<00:03:08.549> gear<00:03:09.549> here<00:03:09.819> that<00:03:10.030> I

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
say are all Olympia gear here that I

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.209 
say are all Olympia gear here that I
ordered<00:03:11.379> from<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:13.920> there's<00:03:14.920> some<00:03:15.040> nice

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:15.219 
ordered from that and there's some nice

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.640 
ordered from that and there's some nice
little<00:03:15.459> cinch<00:03:15.790> downs<00:03:16.090> here<00:03:16.450> what<00:03:17.139> I<00:03:17.170> typically

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
little cinch downs here what I typically

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.949 
little cinch downs here what I typically
do<00:03:17.920> with<00:03:18.040> my<00:03:18.219> rain<00:03:18.489> gear<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.939> I<00:03:19.090> put<00:03:19.359> suspenders

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
do with my rain gear is I put suspenders

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.490 
do with my rain gear is I put suspenders
on<00:03:20.170> there<00:03:20.409> so<00:03:21.750> I'm<00:03:22.750> probably<00:03:22.930> gonna<00:03:23.260> have<00:03:23.439> to

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
on there so I'm probably gonna have to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.599 
on there so I'm probably gonna have to
order<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.950> pair<00:03:24.159> but<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.519> has<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> pretty<00:03:25.239> nasty

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
important for cinching down so the rain

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.140 
important for cinching down so the rain

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070 
it and then that way the rain does not

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.900
