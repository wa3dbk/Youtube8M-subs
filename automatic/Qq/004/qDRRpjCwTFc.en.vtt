00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.350
 the world is small for eco sport 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.810
 synonymous with innovative design proposal 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.000
 safety in technology and content. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 second generation of eco sport goes beyond 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 also when talking about transmission 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.769
 automatic ford launches in brazil the new 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.930
 automatic transmission powershift 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.520
 million for the new ecosport 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
 It is a transmission of six 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.239
 with double clutch 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.489
 combines the driving dynamics of a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.010
 manual transmission with the ease of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.239
 use of automatic exchange 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.590
 making the driver's job more 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.120
 easy and comfortable 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.090
 the automatic controlled box 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.559
 electronically the clutches 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.600
 are always positioned 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.850
 for the coupling without loss of torque what 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.390
 contributes significantly to the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.250
 fuel consumption and changes are 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.710
 preselected, ensuring that the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.630
 next gear is in the correct position 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.470
 when the other clutch prepares exchange 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.540
 Following 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.010
 this system causes the flow of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.380
 engine power is not interrupted 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.320
 during the many gear changes 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.630
 necessary in any way so the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.880
 powershift ford transmission offers 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.380
 performance and the convenience of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.049
 continuous work of a transmission 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.090
 provides conventional automatic 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.220
 also quick changes even in driving 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.619
 without giving up the most 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.970
 high levels of softness 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.120
 the operation is simple and intuitive 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.910
 the function of a balance between comfort 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.100
 and economy a moderate driving 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.050
 in this situation to a calibration of 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.380
 performance by maximizing 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.210
 power and torque in the indicated mode s 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.670
 for more sporting exchanges 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.890
 Powerchip remains the ecosport prepared 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.790
 for restarts to the control on the pedal of 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.980
 acceleration 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.970
 even when full force is not required 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.800
 of the set 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.410
 the transmission keeps the highest quote 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.150
 waiting for the driver's next decision 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.460
 The main advantage of 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.690
 is that it allows you to drive without 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.310
 leaks in the engine itself 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.380
 sequential manual mode can be 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.110
 used by the driver who prefers his 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.600
 own style of driving six gears 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.209
 are perfectly staggered to engage 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.080
 I need snapshots in delay of 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.150
 answer 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.250
 this mode can also be activated in the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.580
 positions by means of a button on the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.740
 side of the lever the duratec 2.0 engine 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.690
 works seamlessly with the 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.630
 powershift driving with 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.600
 optimum performance and 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.800
 this renowned economic propellant 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.239
 to the automatic transmission 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.940
 conventional 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.880
 the new powershift offers numerous 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.160
 Advantages is lighter you do not need 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.160
 no subsystem complex eyes and 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.650
 fluids the fuel consumption is 10% 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.350
 compared to an automatic cash dispenser. 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.709
 conventional six-speed 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.269
 a new strong eco sport more technology 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.269
 more innovation 1
