let's<00:00:25.329> say<00:00:25.599> a<00:00:25.630> few<00:00:26.020> decoys<00:00:26.579> you<00:00:27.579> can<00:00:27.700> see<00:00:27.910> this

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
let's say a few decoys you can see this

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.269 
let's say a few decoys you can see this
field<00:00:28.390> has<00:00:28.599> been<00:00:28.750> cut<00:00:28.989> but<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:29.500> straw<00:00:30.130> is

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
field has been cut but the straw is

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.910 
field has been cut but the straw is
still<00:00:30.520> left<00:00:30.759> and<00:00:31.059> rose<00:00:31.259> so<00:00:32.259> hopefully<00:00:32.710> I'll<00:00:32.829> be

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
still left and rose so hopefully I'll be

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.090 
still left and rose so hopefully I'll be
built<00:00:33.250> before<00:00:33.610> long<00:00:33.850> this<00:00:34.840> might<00:00:35.679> make<00:00:35.890> it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
built before long this might make it

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.000 
built before long this might make it
difficult<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.989> a<00:00:38.019> shot<00:00:38.289> of<00:00:38.469> birds<00:00:38.739> if

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
to go for a headshot that's the only

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.190 
to go for a headshot that's the only
opportunity<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.180> have<00:04:11.420> here<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:13.609> pallet<00:04:13.939> was

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
opportunity I have here the pallet was

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.719 
opportunity I have here the pallet was
clean<00:04:15.200> through<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.530> burden<00:04:16.009> actually<00:04:16.519> had
