shiny<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.789> see<00:01:03.199> some<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> reflectiveness

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
shiny can see some of the reflectiveness

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.410 
shiny can see some of the reflectiveness
in<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.600> anyways<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.770> opened<00:01:08.299> him<00:01:09.299> up

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
in this so anyways it's opened him up

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.289 
in this so anyways it's opened him up
and<00:01:10.320> he<00:01:10.950> stands<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.610> tall

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and he stands really tall

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.640 
and he stands really tall
um<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.290> eighty<00:01:13.650> millimeters<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:15.650> I

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
um it's eighty millimeters I think I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.210 
um it's eighty millimeters I think I
think<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> back<00:01:17.640> side<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:19.220> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
think that's what the back side so you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
think that's what the back side so you
can<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.119> gegen<00:01:21.720> Taurus<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> goes

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
can see that in gegen Taurus and it goes

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.460 
can see that in gegen Taurus and it goes
it<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.080> stands<00:01:25.380> out<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:26.299> Taurus

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
it kind of stands out because Taurus

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.219 
it kind of stands out because Taurus
Bowl<00:01:28.850> something<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> get<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.390> whole<00:01:30.780> like

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
Bowl something and get the whole like

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.740 
Bowl something and get the whole like
face<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.570> cool

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
face on there so it's a really cool

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.010 
face on there so it's a really cool
vodka<00:01:34.229> gun<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.369> feet<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:36.020> obviously

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
vodka gun and the feet are obviously

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.270 
vodka gun and the feet are obviously
manual<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.450> they<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.509> come<00:01:39.780> off<00:01:40.009> for<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
manual and they do come off for the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.590 
manual and they do come off for the
convert<00:01:41.850> system

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.440 

so<00:01:46.260> this<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> most<00:01:47.610> powerful<00:01:47.790> he<00:01:48.090> comes<00:01:48.300> in

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so this is the most powerful he comes in

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.560 
so this is the most powerful he comes in
at<00:01:48.600> 590<00:01:49.170> since<00:01:49.560> any<00:01:50.280> Japanese<00:01:50.850> Japanese

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
at 590 since any Japanese Japanese

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.750 
at 590 since any Japanese Japanese
Bakugan<00:01:52.320> are<00:01:52.590> tending<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.340> stay<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.240> then<00:01:54.960> 500

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
Bakugan are tending to stay and then 500

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.420 
Bakugan are tending to stay and then 500
range<00:01:56.760> at<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> highest<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.650> most<00:01:58.860> powerful

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
range at the highest the most powerful

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.810 
range at the highest the most powerful
Japanese<00:01:59.640> Bakugan<00:02:00.420> would<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.710> 800<00:02:02.550> G's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
Japanese Bakugan would be that 800 G's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
Japanese Bakugan would be that 800 G's
for<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:05.840> what's<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> what's<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.680> called<00:02:07.860> aa

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
for the what's it what's it called aa

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.710 
for the what's it what's it called aa
bio<00:02:09.840> Civic<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:11.250> that's<00:02:11.430> after<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:12.510> if

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
bio Civic and that's after the that's if

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.320 
bio Civic and that's after the that's if
the<00:02:13.020> die<00:02:13.590> thing<00:02:13.950> lands<00:02:14.190> right-side<00:02:14.940> up

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the die thing lands right-side up

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.760 
the die thing lands right-side up
so<00:02:16.970> um<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:19.080> actually<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.620> cool
