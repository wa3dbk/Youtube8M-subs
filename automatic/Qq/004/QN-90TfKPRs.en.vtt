game and this is just a beta but this is

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.020 
game and this is just a beta but this is
the<00:00:09.840> newest<00:00:10.170> beta<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:10.830> not<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.099> one<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.490> June

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the newest beta it's not the one in June

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.450 
the newest beta it's not the one in June
i<00:00:12.690> think<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.230> was<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:13.349> tune<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
i think it was in tune but this is the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.300 
i think it was in tune but this is the
one<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:15.170> october<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.830> started<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.160> October

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
one in october it started in October

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.060 
one in october it started in October
fourth<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.330> think<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.630> exclusively<00:00:19.380> for<00:00:19.619> pc

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
fourth I think it's exclusively for pc

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.240 
fourth I think it's exclusively for pc
and<00:00:20.810> dices<00:00:21.810> go<00:00:22.350> i<00:00:22.380> guess<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> test

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and dices go i guess is the test

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.730 
and dices go i guess is the test
bandwidth<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:24.390> something<00:00:24.960> i'm<00:00:25.230> not<00:00:25.439> exactly

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
bandwidth or something i'm not exactly

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.620 
bandwidth or something i'm not exactly

its<00:01:31.829> more<00:01:32.310> modern<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.880> guess<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.329> what's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
its more modern I guess but what's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.980 
its more modern I guess but what's
really<00:01:34.409> different<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.780> multi<00:01:36.780> player

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
really different is a multi player

really different is a multi player
multiplayer<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:38.540> much<00:01:39.540> different<00:01:40.110> because

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
multiplayer is much different because

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.490 
multiplayer is much different because
it's<00:01:41.310> more<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.640> battlefield<00:01:42.360> because<00:01:42.570> dice

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it's more like battlefield because dice

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.649

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
being a call of duty game it was really

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.530 
being a call of duty game it was really
hard<00:02:24.360> switching<00:02:25.110> over<00:02:25.260> from<00:02:25.790> college<00:02:26.790> ID<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
hard switching over from college ID to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.660 
hard switching over from college ID to
this<00:02:28.050> if<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.530> meant<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.890> medal<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.190> honor<00:02:29.340> now

even<00:02:30.180> though<00:02:30.360> they're<00:02:30.600> pretty<00:02:30.959> much<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> same

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
even though they're pretty much the same

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.220 
even though they're pretty much the same
game<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:32.730> they<00:02:32.940> feel<00:02:33.209> very<00:02:33.569> differently<00:02:33.840> which

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
game if they feel very differently which

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.210 
game if they feel very differently which
is<00:02:34.350> very<00:02:34.560> interesting<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.010> creek

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
is very interesting and just a creek

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.940 
is very interesting and just a creek
difference<00:02:38.870> battlefield<00:02:39.870> just<00:02:40.290> feels<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.680> bit

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
difference battlefield just feels a bit

I<00:02:41.250> don't<00:02:41.489> know<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:41.970> more<00:02:42.150> realistic

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
I don't know a little more realistic

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.949 
I don't know a little more realistic
however<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.850> really<00:02:44.850> don't<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.209> how<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.780> kind

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
however I really don't like how it kind

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.410 
however I really don't like how it kind
of<00:02:46.080> plays<00:02:46.260> out<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:47.220> kind<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:47.880> Call<00:02:48.390> of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
of plays out I kind of like Call of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.600 
of plays out I kind of like Call of
Duty's<00:02:48.780> arcade<00:02:49.230> style<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.220> seems<00:02:50.489> a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
Duty's arcade style and it seems a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.220 
Duty's arcade style and it seems a
little<00:02:50.730> more<00:02:50.940> smooth<00:02:51.269> but<00:02:51.959> that's<00:02:52.080> my

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
little more smooth but that's my

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.090 
little more smooth but that's my
personal<00:02:52.620> opinion<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.370> yeah<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:55.230> another

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
personal opinion so yeah and another

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.170 
personal opinion so yeah and another
thing<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.910> little<00:02:57.630> interesting<00:02:57.989> was

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
thing that was a little interesting was

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.160 
thing that was a little interesting was
like<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:01.730> picked<00:03:02.730> up<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.970> game<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.720> mean<00:03:03.989> I'm

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
like I picked up the game and I mean I'm

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.360 
like I picked up the game and I mean I'm
not<00:03:04.350> expecting<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.100> like<00:03:05.220> the

one's really played this game before so
I'm<00:03:12.660> kind<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.930> hoping<00:03:13.320> everyone<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:15.120> as

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
but I got 7 17 which you think about

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.729 
but I got 7 17 which you think about
who's<00:03:23.940> never<00:03:24.269> played<00:03:24.390> middle<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.320> before

who's never played middle of on before

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.509 
who's never played middle of on before
that's<00:03:26.549> that's<00:03:26.910> decent<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.989> maybe<00:03:28.980> I'll<00:03:29.280> get<00:03:29.459> a

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
that's that's decent so maybe I'll get a

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.420 
that's that's decent so maybe I'll get a
better<00:03:29.700> score<00:03:29.940> by<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.239> end<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.690> thursday

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.289 
maybe probably not but oh yeah but what
was<00:03:36.900> interesting<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.730> everyone<00:03:38.730> else<00:03:38.940> seemed

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
was interesting is everyone else seemed

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.110 
was interesting is everyone else seemed
to<00:03:39.329> be<00:03:39.890> exceptionally<00:03:40.890> great<00:03:41.250> which<00:03:41.489> was<00:03:41.670> kind

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
to be exceptionally great which was kind

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.000 
to be exceptionally great which was kind
of<00:03:42.180> disheartening<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.410> was<00:03:43.560> horrible

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
of disheartening and I was horrible

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.390 
of disheartening and I was horrible
because<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.510> seemed<00:03:45.870> like<00:03:46.019> everyone<00:03:46.650> knew

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
because it seemed like everyone knew

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.729 
because it seemed like everyone knew
what<00:03:47.579> was<00:03:48.299> going<00:03:48.600> on<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.989> i<00:03:49.170> was<00:03:49.470> just<00:03:49.620> kind

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
what was going on and I i was just kind

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.960 
what was going on and I i was just kind
of<00:03:49.829> sitting<00:03:50.070> there<00:03:50.250> clueless<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.720> maybe<00:03:52.850> if<00:03:53.850> I

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
of sitting there clueless so maybe if I

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.039 
of sitting there clueless so maybe if I
played<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.299> campaign<00:03:54.450> I'm<00:03:54.720> over<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:55.019> little

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
played the campaign I'm over it a little

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.590 
played the campaign I'm over it a little
I'll<00:03:55.440> get<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.799> little<00:03:55.859> bit<00:03:56.160> better<00:03:56.310> but<00:03:56.730> that's

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
I'll get a little bit better but that's

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.349 
I'll get a little bit better but that's
questionable<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:59.070> my<00:03:59.459> overall<00:03:59.640> of<00:04:00.030> view<00:04:00.209> from

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
questionable so my overall of view from

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.650 
questionable so my overall of view from
