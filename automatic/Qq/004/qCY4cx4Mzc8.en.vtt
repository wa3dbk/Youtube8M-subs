not<00:00:49.140> group<00:00:49.410> consistently<00:00:50.190> my<00:00:50.610> advice<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.059> just

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
not group consistently my advice is just

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.520 
not group consistently my advice is just
shoot<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> three<00:00:51.600> arrow<00:00:51.780> group<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> time

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
shoot a three arrow group at a time

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
shoot a three arrow group at a time
you've<00:00:53.250> our<00:00:53.489> three<00:00:53.789> arrows<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.270> you're

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you've our three arrows and you're

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.389 
you've our three arrows and you're
getting<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> good<00:00:54.690> consistent<00:00:55.230> group<00:00:55.399> continue

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
