00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.089
 first we prepare the cake pan 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.910
 then we line inside the 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.320
 cake pan with silver paper 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.470
 I recommend paying attention to 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.840
 cover yes and edges that the base is then 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.800
 we pass a veil of butter both on the base 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.720
 that on the edges 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.640
 after that we drop some 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.960
 flour spreading evenly 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.960
 the whole cake pan 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.070
 in a bowl now we put the flour 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.000
 with the sugar we mix it a little 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.340
 then add a pinch of salt 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.370
 we continue to mix 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.490
 and we move on to reach 3 shifts 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.750
 once joints we mix well in 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.980
 so that the dough is g20 enough 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.110
 homogeneous and dense 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.920
 obviously we will go to add 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.949
 also the butter and the half sachet of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.949
 yeast 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.590
 mix the dough until just a 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.369
 make it become very compact there 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.280
 we also help with hands then we can 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.710
 also pour on the table and we go to 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.939
 add water if we see that it is 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.939
 very dry 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.520
 we always continue to knead well 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.140
 until we realize it 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.810
 get a very compact dough 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.479
 at this point we make so many little ones 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.330
 pieces and let's go to form the base 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.970
 then of our tart 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:52.000
 we simply support it slowly 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.000
 on the cake tin with small pieces 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.530
 once we're done with 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.690
 we can cover all the base 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.690
 roll out our jam 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.590
 we cover the whole low and doing 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.050
 be careful to leave around a 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.270
 centimeter on the edge 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.640
 now with the advanced pasta we do 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.150
 of the strips we will need for 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.960
 decorate our tart 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.540
 first we make the diamonds and for 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.110
 last thing we finish all the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.930
 contour of the tart 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.930
 we bake the whole at 180 degrees for 35 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.510
 minutes 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.090
 this is how you see the result 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.360
 with the pasta and the advanced jam there 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.240
 has also done some 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.970
 I hope that the tutorial was useful 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.070
 maybe let me know if you have tried 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.140
 this recipe with a good morning here 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.740
 below and good appetite 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.740
