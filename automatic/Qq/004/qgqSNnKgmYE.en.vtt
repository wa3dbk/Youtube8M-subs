you could get parental control software
and<00:00:41.820> there's<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.510> built<00:00:42.899> into

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and there's actually some built into

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
and there's actually some built into
Macintosh<00:00:43.680> OS<00:00:43.829> 10<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> found<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.760> Apple's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
Macintosh OS 10 but I found that Apple's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.150 
Macintosh OS 10 but I found that Apple's
parental<00:00:45.960> control<00:00:46.260> software<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.770> really

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
parental control software is really

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.630 
parental control software is really
lousy

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
lousy

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 
lousy
I<00:00:47.760> googled<00:00:48.450> Abraham<00:00:48.960> Lincoln<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> other<00:00:49.590> day

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
I googled Abraham Lincoln the other day

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.350 
I googled Abraham Lincoln the other day
while<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.100> parental<00:00:50.430> control<00:00:50.789> software<00:00:50.969> was

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
while that parental control software was

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.139 
while that parental control software was
on<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.350> blocked<00:00:52.710> access<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.699> Abraham

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
on and it blocked access to Abraham

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.720 
on and it blocked access to Abraham
Lincoln<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.660> Google<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.559> mean<00:00:56.039> apples<00:00:56.610> has

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730

never been really that good there are
tons<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.469> options<00:00:58.710> out<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.340> are

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
tons of options out there that are

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
tons of options out there that are
really<00:00:59.670> awesome<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.180> parental<00:01:00.449> control<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
really awesome for parental control the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.260 
really awesome for parental control the
problem<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:02.280> parental<00:01:02.520> control<00:01:02.910> it's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
problem is with parental control it's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.149 
problem is with parental control it's
oftentimes<00:01:03.690> expensive<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> most

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
oftentimes expensive but the most

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.429 
oftentimes expensive but the most
frustrating<00:01:06.030> part<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.869> taxing

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
frustrating part is it's really taxing

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
frustrating part is it's really taxing
on<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> computer<00:01:08.189> you'll<00:01:08.610> notice<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.060> huge

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
on the computer you'll notice a huge

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
on the computer you'll notice a huge
decrease<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.960> performance<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.860> speed

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
decrease in performance and speed

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.330 
decrease in performance and speed
because<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.000> keeps<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.409> gigantic<00:01:13.409> cache<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
because it keeps a gigantic cache and it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
because it keeps a gigantic cache and it
stores<00:01:14.939> these<00:01:15.150> big<00:01:15.600> logs<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.320> always

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
stores these big logs and it's always

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.499 
stores these big logs and it's always
running<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.670> notice<00:01:17.909> usually<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
running and so you will notice usually a

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.780 
running and so you will notice usually a
pretty<00:01:18.780> significant<00:01:19.439> down<00:01:19.619> time<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.759> know

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
pretty significant down time or you know

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
pretty significant down time or you know
you'll<00:01:21.030> notice<00:01:21.330> longer<00:01:21.659> load<00:01:21.840> times<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.409> your

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you'll notice longer load times on your

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.800 
you'll notice longer load times on your
computer<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.759> very<00:01:24.090> annoying<00:01:24.540> when

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
computer and it is very annoying when

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600 
computer and it is very annoying when
really<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.860> want<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.189> protect<00:01:26.490> your

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
kids and you are at a detriment as well

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.649 
kids and you are at a detriment as well
because<00:01:29.700> your<00:01:29.850> computer<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> being<00:01:30.420> slowed

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
because your computer is being slowed

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.480 
because your computer is being slowed
down<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> doesn't<00:01:31.799> again<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
down so this doesn't again and I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.770 
down so this doesn't again and I
emphasize<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.030> enough<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> no

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
emphasize this enough this is no

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.060 
emphasize this enough this is no
replacement<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.380> parental<00:01:34.770> control

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
replacement for parental control

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.469 
replacement for parental control
software<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.610> doesn't<00:01:35.880> block<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> whole

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
software it doesn't block a whole

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.499 
software it doesn't block a whole
category<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:37.770> block<00:01:38.509> websites

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
category but it will block websites

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.390

serve<00:04:45.520> our<00:04:45.550> hosts<00:04:45.880> or<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.330> can<00:04:46.510> host<00:04:46.780> parental

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
serve our hosts or you can host parental

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.380 
serve our hosts or you can host parental
control<00:04:48.040> software<00:04:48.220> on<00:04:48.580> your<00:04:48.610> firewall<00:04:49.210> which

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
control software on your firewall which

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.850 
control software on your firewall which
again<00:04:49.630> is<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:50.080> little<00:04:50.290> bit<00:04:50.500> easier<00:04:50.800> than

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
again is a little bit easier than

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.610 
again is a little bit easier than
contacting<00:04:51.460> your<00:04:51.550> ISP<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.240> don't<00:04:52.420> need

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
contacting your ISP and you don't need

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.140 
contacting your ISP and you don't need
to<00:04:53.620> contact<00:04:54.040> them<00:04:54.310> every<00:04:54.580> time<00:04:54.730> you<00:04:54.790> want<00:04:55.060> a

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
to contact them every time you want a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.390 
to contact them every time you want a
site<00:04:55.360> removed<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.020> that's<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:57.010> little<00:04:57.160> bit<00:04:57.310> more

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
site removed so that's a little bit more

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.740 
site removed so that's a little bit more
easier<00:04:57.730> to<00:04:57.850> manage<00:04:58.000> but<00:04:58.240> that's<00:04:58.390> typically

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
easier to manage but that's typically

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.690 
easier to manage but that's typically
pretty<00:04:59.020> expensive<00:04:59.350> this<00:04:59.710> is<00:04:59.950> just<00:05:00.400> for<00:05:00.610> this
