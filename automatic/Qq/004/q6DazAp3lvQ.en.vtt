00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.580

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.969
 always like that now it's true 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.889
 that here are not selling Qatari 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.360
 russian chest they are not seeing 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.090
 review a title that's for sure 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.640
 now we will see what will be done 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.050
 margarita dreyfus 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.720
 but good marseille me it's a club that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.109
 I like very intimate and very close 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.470
 my son too with the brunette who is a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.910
 present to me who was fine 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.260
 now listen here must we 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.300
 beat we will beat if we have to 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.500
 beat we beat them on this draw 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.390
 it's even better for both 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.550
 I like 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.989
 will nassera the president he is very nice 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.210
 after their is good but jean louis 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.520
 gasset who is in the staff and he 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.160
 does a good job and laurent bon ben il 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.289
 took a shot on the head like 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.510
 that he will become again what he was at 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.940
 beginning of the season at paris saint germain 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.969
 it will be less unpretentious because 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.409
 that we must not exaggerate but finally and I 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.290
 think he was taking a little for 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.920
 mourinho bis a man that's all a 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.790
 asshole band who says these things there 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 I think it's ridiculous to regulate 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.390
 as I heard a big specialists 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.159
 of football because we have a lot of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.100
 this moment every monday to get there 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.229
 Bayern Munich Specialists 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.990
 they end up with no laughs how many 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.240
 advanced points are already champions 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.280
 not for that reason they are poorly qualified at 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.920
 review a little bit this bullshit league 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.340
 league 1 is like another 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.170
 championship 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.049
 homo someone who wants seemed who 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.360
 wants to leave it's in moriba leaves 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.549
 to leave for a sum of money 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.380
 and then cabella we promised him the year 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.759
 last so if he wants to leave and leave 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.310
 thoroughly now if they want not 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.680
 leave both while benjamin 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.409
 told my son who wanted to leave 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.110
 and remy said he had found a club 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.020
 where they thought to find a club there 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.240
 be it traveling at a bigger time 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.670
 worry saillies it's not this time 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.229
 matured and who had my biggest concern 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.099
 his protrusions and I hope he goes 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.080
 ability to play ball 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.260
 because when he is there the paillade 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.890
 it's something else so let's be nice 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.890
 so there
