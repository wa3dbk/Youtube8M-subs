00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
when I first God's Buzz driver I just

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.450 
when I first God's Buzz driver I just
said<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.909> myself<00:00:03.060> alright<00:00:03.870> one<00:00:04.230> awful<00:00:04.859> PC

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
said to myself alright one awful PC

games review coming up but once playing

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.940 
games review coming up but once playing
it<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.519> really<00:00:09.450> couldn't<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.230> good<00:00:10.290> conscience

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
it I really couldn't in good conscience

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.259 
it I really couldn't in good conscience
call<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.210> bad<00:00:12.690> PC<00:00:13.590> simulator<00:00:14.280> there<00:00:15.030> are

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
call it a bad PC simulator there are

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.220 
call it a bad PC simulator there are
some<00:00:15.690> bad<00:00:16.230> parts<00:00:16.560> about<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.400> simulator<00:00:18.230> one

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
some bad parts about this simulator one

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.340 
some bad parts about this simulator one
of<00:00:19.380> them<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.730> actual<00:00:21.390> turning<00:00:22.109> you're

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
of them is the actual turning you're

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.790 
of them is the actual turning you're
gonna<00:00:22.470> notice<00:00:22.859> right<00:00:22.920> away<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.880> bus<00:00:24.119> turns

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
gonna notice right away the bus turns

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.849 
gonna notice right away the bus turns
way<00:00:25.800> too<00:00:26.150> slowly<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.529> horrible<00:00:28.529> when<00:00:28.740> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
way too slowly it's horrible when you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.780 
way too slowly it's horrible when you
have<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.220> turn<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.449> feels<00:00:31.610> responsive<00:00:32.610> it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
have to turn but it feels responsive it

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.120 
have to turn but it feels responsive it
feels<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.420> that's<00:00:33.660> exactly<00:00:33.960> how<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> real

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
feels like that's exactly how a real

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.880 
feels like that's exactly how a real
gigantic<00:00:36.120> piece<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.750> machinery<00:00:37.110> would

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
gigantic piece of machinery would

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880 
gigantic piece of machinery would
actually<00:00:38.579> turn<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.719> turning<00:00:40.140> while<00:00:40.410> slow

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
actually turn and the turning while slow

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.490 
actually turn and the turning while slow
and<00:00:41.129> cumbersome<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.969> never<00:00:42.510> gets<00:00:42.899> really

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
and cumbersome it never gets really

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.610 
and cumbersome it never gets really
frustrating<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.640> mean<00:00:45.090> I've<00:00:45.360> seen<00:00:45.690> thousands

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
frustrating I mean I've seen thousands

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160 
frustrating I mean I've seen thousands
maybe<00:00:46.890> tens<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.550> thousands<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.210> buses<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.870> my

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
maybe tens of thousands of buses in my

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.310 
maybe tens of thousands of buses in my
life<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.640> way<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:51.270> turn<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.840> game<00:00:52.079> it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
life and the way they turn this game it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.889 
life and the way they turn this game it
looks<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.730> same<00:00:54.000> way<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.449> turn<00:00:54.719> in

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
looks like the same way they turn in

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.310 
looks like the same way they turn in
real<00:00:55.140> life<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.460> bit<00:00:56.699> slower<00:00:57.210> than<00:00:57.660> your

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
real life it's a bit slower than your

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
real life it's a bit slower than your
regular<00:00:58.559> passenger<00:00:59.399> car<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.539> it's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
regular passenger car but it's

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.349 
regular passenger car but it's
manageable<00:01:01.520> also<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.730> thing<00:01:02.879> about<00:01:03.120> this

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
manageable also one thing about this

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.719 
manageable also one thing about this
driving<00:01:04.019> simulator<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.489> actually

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
driving simulator is you can actually

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.920 
driving simulator is you can actually
stay<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> lanes<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.510> really<00:01:09.510> really

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
stay in the lanes it's not really really

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750 
stay in the lanes it's not really really
easy<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.409> mean<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.040> does<00:01:11.280> take<00:01:11.580> effort

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
easy I mean it does take effort

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
easy I mean it does take effort
especially<00:01:12.150> because<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:12.960> using<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
especially because I'm using the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.249 
especially because I'm using the
keyboard<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> wheel<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.900> no

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
keyboard and not a wheel but it's in no

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.560 
keyboard and not a wheel but it's in no
way<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.770> bad<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.310> some<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> other<00:01:17.970> really

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
way as bad if some of the other really

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.140 
way as bad if some of the other really
horrible<00:01:19.470> driving<00:01:19.950> simulators<00:01:20.340> we've<00:01:20.850> played

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
horrible driving simulators we've played

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.510 
horrible driving simulators we've played
where<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.200> turning<00:01:22.650> was<00:01:22.799> horrible<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.369> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
where the turning was horrible but you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.060 
where the turning was horrible but you
couldn't<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:23.939> stay<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> lanes<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
couldn't actually stay in the lanes so

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.850 
couldn't actually stay in the lanes so
you<00:01:26.159> kept<00:01:26.670> crashing<00:01:27.299> into<00:01:27.900> everything<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you kept crashing into everything the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.999 
you kept crashing into everything the
cars<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.610> sidewalks<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.780> people<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
cars the sidewalks the people if a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
cars the sidewalks the people if a
simulator<00:01:32.520> had<00:01:32.880> people<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.960> this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
simulator had people in them in this

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.530 
simulator had people in them in this
game<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> driving<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.549> manageable

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
game the driving is actually manageable

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.800 
game the driving is actually manageable
and<00:01:36.720> dare<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.079> say<00:01:37.320> often<00:01:38.130> fun<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.659> think

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
and dare I say often fun now we think

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.390 
and dare I say often fun now we think
another<00:01:40.079> reason<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.590> driving<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.189> game

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
another reason that driving in this game

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.270 
another reason that driving in this game
is<00:01:41.610> manageable<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.450> simply<00:01:43.409> because<00:01:43.560> you're

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
is manageable is simply because you're

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
is manageable is simply because you're
driving<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.880> bus<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.390> you're<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.930> pretty

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
driving a bus and you're going pretty

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.039 
driving a bus and you're going pretty
slowly<00:01:46.979> even<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:48.000> fastest<00:01:48.509> speed<00:01:48.810> you're

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
slowly even at your fastest speed you're

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.310 
slowly even at your fastest speed you're
still<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.979> pretty<00:01:50.009> slowly<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.960> easy

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
still going pretty slowly so it's easy

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.340 
still going pretty slowly so it's easy
to<00:01:52.619> see<00:01:53.009> things<00:01:53.399> coming<00:01:53.850> from<00:01:54.630> far<00:01:55.020> away

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
to see things coming from far away

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
to see things coming from far away
another<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.490> awful<00:01:56.820> thing<00:01:57.000> about<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
another really awful thing about the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.139 
another really awful thing about the
simulator<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.680> animation<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.610> people

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
simulator is the animation of the people

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.060 
simulator is the animation of the people
getting<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.990> out<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.469> bus<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
getting in and out of your bus it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.130 
getting in and out of your bus it
doesn't<00:02:02.490> exist<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.270> people<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.810> stand

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
doesn't exist the people just stand

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.620 
doesn't exist the people just stand
there<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:05.189> there's<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.969> number<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
there and then there's a number that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.270 
there and then there's a number that
tells<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:07.170> people<00:02:07.530> are<00:02:07.619> getting<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.220> out

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
tells you people are getting in and out

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.240 
tells you people are getting in and out
but<00:02:08.849> there's<00:02:09.090> no<00:02:09.300> actual<00:02:09.840> animation<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.530> don't

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
but there's no actual animation I don't

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.820 
but there's no actual animation I don't
get<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.910> mean<00:02:12.120> they

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
get that I mean they

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.800 
get that I mean they
had<00:02:12.920> enough<00:02:13.250> time<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:13.550> program<00:02:14.000> these<00:02:14.390> big

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
had enough time to program these big

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.680 
had enough time to program these big
sprawling<00:02:15.380> cities<00:02:16.130> with<00:02:16.640> different<00:02:17.000> seasons

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
sprawling cities with different seasons

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.870 
sprawling cities with different seasons
different<00:02:18.110> weathers<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.920> mean<00:02:19.310> even<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> bus

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
different weathers I mean even the bus

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.850 
different weathers I mean even the bus
windows<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> lot<00:02:20.960> of<00:02:20.990> effort<00:02:21.500> put<00:02:21.740> into

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
windows have a lot of effort put into

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.500 
windows have a lot of effort put into
them<00:02:22.100> in<00:02:22.250> terms<00:02:22.460> of<00:02:22.640> graphics<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.270> really

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
them in terms of graphics I I really

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.870 
them in terms of graphics I I really
don't<00:02:23.810> know<00:02:23.930> why<00:02:24.140> they<00:02:24.410> couldn't<00:02:24.470> put<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.550> some

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
don't know why they couldn't put in some

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.060 
don't know why they couldn't put in some
graphics<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.510> people<00:02:26.870> actually<00:02:27.020> walking<00:02:27.830> in

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
graphics of people actually walking in

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.530 
graphics of people actually walking in
and<00:02:28.280> out<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.400> mean<00:02:28.670> they<00:02:29.000> already<00:02:29.180> have<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
and out I mean they already have the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.820 
and out I mean they already have the
models<00:02:29.990> for<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.290> people<00:02:30.650> they're<00:02:30.800> just

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
models for the people they're just

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.800 
models for the people they're just
standing<00:02:31.370> there<00:02:31.430> like<00:02:31.730> mannequins<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.630> you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
standing there like mannequins and you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.270 
standing there like mannequins and you
know<00:02:32.900> what<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.140> be<00:02:33.230> honest<00:02:33.500> there<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.890> third

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
know what to be honest there is a third

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.610 
know what to be honest there is a third
thing<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.760> kind<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.750> bugs<00:02:35.960> me<00:02:36.170> about<00:02:36.440> this

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
thing that kind of bugs me about this

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.910 
thing that kind of bugs me about this
game<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.160> get<00:02:37.700> penalties<00:02:38.420> for<00:02:38.990> breaking<00:02:39.320> laws

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
game you get penalties for breaking laws

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.000 
game you get penalties for breaking laws
or<00:02:40.490> just<00:02:41.000> not<00:02:41.180> driving<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.810> bust<00:02:42.050> well<00:02:42.380> but<00:02:42.980> a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
or just not driving the bust well but a

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.520 
or just not driving the bust well but a
lot<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.370> times<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.300> get<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.720> same<00:02:44.960> penalty

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
lot of times you get the same penalty

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.040 
lot of times you get the same penalty
for<00:02:45.740> like<00:02:45.950> crashing<00:02:46.730> into<00:02:46.970> something<00:02:47.360> as<00:02:47.540> you

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
for like crashing into something as you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
for like crashing into something as you
do<00:02:48.290> for<00:02:48.560> making<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.220> kind<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.760> bad<00:02:50.150> turn<00:02:50.630> or

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
do for making a kind of bad turn or

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.100 
do for making a kind of bad turn or
stopping<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.190> little<00:02:52.490> too<00:02:52.850> abruptly<00:02:53.450> it's

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
stopping a little too abruptly it's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.830 
stopping a little too abruptly it's
almost<00:02:54.500> unfair<00:02:54.800> it's<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.209> crash<00:02:56.600> into

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
almost unfair it's like you crash into

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.750 
almost unfair it's like you crash into
something<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.950> caused<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.520> bus

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
something and you caused the bus

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.090 
something and you caused the bus
thousands<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.570> dollars<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.930> damage<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.680> then

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
thousands of dollars of damage and then

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.550 
thousands of dollars of damage and then
you<00:03:01.250> stop<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.910> bus<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> little<00:03:02.600> too<00:03:02.900> fast<00:03:03.230> maybe

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
you stop the bus a little too fast maybe

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.830 
you stop the bus a little too fast maybe
and<00:03:03.860> it's<00:03:04.280> minus<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.940> hundred<00:03:05.270> points<00:03:05.630> for

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
and it's minus the hundred points for

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.320 
and it's minus the hundred points for
both<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.410> those<00:03:06.560> infractions<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:07.970> yeah<00:03:08.120> those

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
both of those infractions so yeah those

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.510 
both of those infractions so yeah those
are<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.690> bad<00:03:08.900> parts<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:09.620> game<00:03:09.830> but<00:03:10.100> let

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
are the bad parts of this game but let

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.310 
are the bad parts of this game but let
me<00:03:10.580> talk<00:03:10.850> about<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.330> great<00:03:11.660> parts<00:03:12.050> of<00:03:12.170> this

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
me talk about the great parts of this

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.020 
me talk about the great parts of this
game<00:03:12.560> like<00:03:12.770> I<00:03:12.890> already<00:03:13.130> said<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.430> driving<00:03:13.880> is

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
game like I already said the driving is

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.330 
game like I already said the driving is
manageable<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.930> can<00:03:15.290> be<00:03:15.530> really<00:03:16.010> fun

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
manageable and can be really fun

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.100 
manageable and can be really fun
sometimes<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.150> one<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.690> reasons<00:03:18.050> for

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
sometimes and one of the reasons for

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.710 
sometimes and one of the reasons for
this<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.620> all<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:19.190> variety<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.690> levels

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
this is all the variety in the levels

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.860 
this is all the variety in the levels
there's<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.890> ton<00:03:22.550> of<00:03:22.580> different<00:03:23.120> levels

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
there's a ton of different levels

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.930 
there's a ton of different levels
there's<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.200> ton<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.620> different<00:03:25.190> places<00:03:25.550> to

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
there's a ton of different places to

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.729 
there's a ton of different places to
drive<00:03:26.269> in<00:03:26.480> these<00:03:26.630> cities<00:03:26.959> there's<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.410> ton<00:03:27.709> of

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
drive in these cities there's a ton of

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.830 
drive in these cities there's a ton of
different<00:03:27.980> weather<00:03:28.489> variables<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.330> there's

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
different weather variables and there's

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.380 
different weather variables and there's
a<00:03:29.900> ton<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.290> different<00:03:30.590> tiers<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.030> levels

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
a ton of different tiers so the levels

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.780 
a ton of different tiers so the levels
get<00:03:32.570> progressively<00:03:33.140> harder<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:34.250> levels<00:03:34.610> get

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
get progressively harder the levels get

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.120 
get progressively harder the levels get
different<00:03:35.150> there's<00:03:35.900> different<00:03:36.350> weathers<00:03:36.800> so

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
different there's different weathers so

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.190 
different there's different weathers so
you<00:03:37.190> got<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.550> account<00:03:37.760> for<00:03:37.910> sludge<00:03:38.450> or<00:03:38.840> rain<00:03:39.170> or

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
you got to account for sludge or rain or

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.280 
you got to account for sludge or rain or
just<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.250> clear<00:03:40.550> sunny<00:03:41.030> day<00:03:41.150> there's<00:03:41.780> just<00:03:41.870> a

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
just a clear sunny day there's just a

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.979 
just a clear sunny day there's just a
lot<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.709> different<00:03:43.459> variety<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.269> never<00:03:44.630> get

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
lot of different variety you never get

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.100 
lot of different variety you never get
bored<00:03:45.440> of<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:46.190> scenery<00:03:46.700> in<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.330> game<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.810> I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
bored of the scenery in the game and I

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.190 
bored of the scenery in the game and I
love<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.890> about<00:03:49.160> this<00:03:49.820> simulator<00:03:50.570> if<00:03:50.810> you

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
love that about this simulator if you

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.530 
love that about this simulator if you
were<00:03:51.320> just<00:03:51.560> driving<00:03:51.800> through<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.370> drabs<00:03:52.910> same

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
were just driving through a drabs same

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.320 
were just driving through a drabs same
old<00:03:53.810> city<00:03:54.110> on<00:03:54.290> every<00:03:54.800> level<00:03:55.070> I<00:03:55.340> could<00:03:55.760> easily

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330
