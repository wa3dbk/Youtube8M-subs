00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.970 
order so and these NH 112 very cool the
drift<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.430> very<00:04:42.820> very<00:04:43.180> cool<00:04:43.360> has<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.980> camouflage

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
drift is very very cool has a camouflage

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.290 
drift is very very cool has a camouflage
looking<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.669> tempo<00:04:46.270> design<00:04:47.730> and<00:04:48.730> it<00:04:48.940> says<00:04:49.090> rocky

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
looking a tempo design and it says rocky

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.230 
looking a tempo design and it says rocky
gorge<00:04:50.040> so<00:04:51.040> I<00:04:51.070> guess<00:04:51.160> that's<00:04:51.370> more<00:04:51.580> like<00:04:51.820> rocks

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
gorge so I guess that's more like rocks

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.720 
gorge so I guess that's more like rocks
but<00:04:53.200> it<00:04:53.320> looks<00:04:53.530> like<00:04:53.590> camouflage<00:04:54.100> which<00:04:54.520> is

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
but it looks like camouflage which is

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.860 
but it looks like camouflage which is
very<00:04:54.940> cool<00:04:55.620> alright<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.940> last<00:04:57.970> in<00:04:58.480> what<00:04:58.840> I

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
very cool alright and the last in what I

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.440 
very cool alright and the last in what I
got<00:04:59.940> is<00:05:00.940> road<00:05:01.720> trippin<00:05:02.080> highway<00:05:02.919> 212<00:05:03.450> there's

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
got is road trippin highway 212 there's

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.409 
got is road trippin highway 212 there's
a<00:05:04.660> geyser<00:05:05.140> so<00:05:05.710> I'm<00:05:05.890> guessing<00:05:06.160> it's<00:05:06.490> goes<00:05:07.270> by

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
a geyser so I'm guessing it's goes by

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.120 
a geyser so I'm guessing it's goes by
Yellowstone<00:05:07.990> maybe<00:05:08.320> clear<00:05:09.310> off<00:05:10.470> geyser<00:05:11.470> basin

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
Yellowstone maybe clear off geyser basin

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.670 
Yellowstone maybe clear off geyser basin
I<00:05:12.370> guess<00:05:12.550> that's<00:05:12.700> where<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.090> is<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:14.050> it<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.410> a

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
I guess that's where it is and it is a

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.370 
I guess that's where it is and it is a
tesla<00:05:15.370> roadster<00:05:16.680> which<00:05:17.680> is<00:05:17.919> a<00:05:18.750> very<00:05:19.750> very<00:05:20.050> cool
