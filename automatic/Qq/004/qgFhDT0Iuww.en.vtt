00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
then I'll reglue um so yeah that was

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.080 
then I'll reglue um so yeah that was
that<00:00:47.700> fun<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:49.370> actually<00:00:50.370> took<00:00:50.550> me<00:00:50.760> quite<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that fun that actually took me quite a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.279 
that fun that actually took me quite a
bit<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.480> time<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:52.850> cuz<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.420> midsole<00:00:54.840> was<00:00:55.079> so

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
bit of time just cuz the midsole was so

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
bit of time just cuz the midsole was so
firm<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:58.949> was<00:00:59.190> hard<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.579> peel

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
firm on that it really was hard to peel

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.470 
firm on that it really was hard to peel
you<00:01:00.059> know<00:01:00.180> usually<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.309> don't<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.520> I'm

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you know usually I don't like I'm

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.039 
you know usually I don't like I'm
stitching<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:05.129> then<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> fitment<00:01:06.049> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
stitching it because then the fitment is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
stitching it because then the fitment is
a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.380> weird<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.460> figured<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> know

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
a little weird but I figured you know

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.679 
a little weird but I figured you know
that's<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.560> best<00:01:10.740> way<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> um

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
that's that's the best way to do it um

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.350 
that's that's the best way to do it um
in<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.930> cases<00:01:13.280> because<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.030> don't<00:01:15.150> on

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
in all cases because if you don't on

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.960 
in all cases because if you don't on
stitch<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> could<00:01:16.049> only<00:01:16.340> get<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.549> far<00:01:17.580> with

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
stitch it you could only get so far with

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.320 
stitch it you could only get so far with
the<00:01:18.119> swap<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.689> at<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.229> front<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.330> you're

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the swap you know at the front so you're

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
the swap you know at the front so you're
gonna<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.689> some<00:01:21.720> midsole<00:01:22.350> build<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.799> there

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
gonna have some midsole build up there

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
gonna have some midsole build up there
and<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.220> could<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.580> ruin<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.090> swap<00:01:26.780> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and that could really ruin your swap so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.330 
and that could really ruin your swap so
yeah<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.020> guess<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.799> gonna<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> learning

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
yeah I guess it's gonna be a learning

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.870 
yeah I guess it's gonna be a learning
experience<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:30.000> me<00:01:30.090> I've<00:01:30.180> never<00:01:30.210> done<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:34.880> yeah

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
experience to me I've never done it yeah

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:58.130 
experience to me I've never done it yeah
