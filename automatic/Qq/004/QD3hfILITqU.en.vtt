machine table for this action I use two

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.450 
machine table for this action I use two
old<00:00:26.279> shaft<00:00:28.340> what<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.660> said<00:00:30.660> over<00:00:31.189> here<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
old shaft what I said over here like so

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
old shaft what I said over here like so
and<00:00:32.910> set<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.960> says<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.180> machining<00:00:36.180> work

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and set it says the machining work

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.569 
and set it says the machining work
workpiece<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.370> shaft<00:00:39.620> why<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.309> so

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
workpiece on this shaft why I do like so

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.540 
workpiece on this shaft why I do like so
because<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.140> way<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:44.030> make<00:00:45.140> easiest

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
because in this way I make easiest

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:55.069 
because in this way I make easiest
adjusting<00:00:50.840> by<00:00:51.980> rubber<00:00:52.980> hammer<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.390> first

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
adjusting by rubber hammer and first

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.799 
adjusting by rubber hammer and first
adjusting<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.399> first<00:00:56.850> adjusting<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
adjusting for first adjusting I use a

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
adjusting for first adjusting I use a
measuring<00:01:00.809> tape<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.680> roller<00:01:02.809> first<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.400> take<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
measuring tape or roller first I take a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.899 
measuring tape or roller first I take a
measure<00:01:06.270> from<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:08.280> here<00:01:09.920> both<00:01:10.920> side<00:01:11.490> side

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
measure from here to here both side side

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.060 
measure from here to here both side side
and<00:01:12.680> then<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.860> take<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> measure<00:01:14.689> from<00:01:15.689> over<00:01:16.530> here

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and then I take a measure from over here

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.179 
and then I take a measure from over here
to<00:01:17.280> over<00:01:17.900> here<00:01:18.900> over<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.070> edge<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:22.189> from

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
to over here over this edge and from

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:31.100 
to over here over this edge and from
that<00:01:24.049> board<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.150> will<00:01:30.210> know

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that board to to this then I will know

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.480 
that board to to this then I will know
that<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.850> piece<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.110> perfectly<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.509> 90

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
that to this piece is perfectly in 90

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:48.330 
that to this piece is perfectly in 90
degrees<00:01:38.490> angle<00:01:39.950> versus<00:01:41.899> machining<00:01:43.310> axle<00:01:44.990> and
