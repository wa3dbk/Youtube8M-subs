00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the secondary it looks really really

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.889 
the secondary it looks really really
nice<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.030> simple<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> make<00:01:42.659> I

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
nice and it's it's simple to make I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.080 
nice and it's it's simple to make I
really<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.920> how<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.250> looks<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
really like how it looks out in the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.359 
really like how it looks out in the
sunlight<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.689> out<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.079> daytime<00:01:46.470> it's

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
sunlight like out in the daytime it's

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.160 
sunlight like out in the daytime it's
not<00:01:47.640> too<00:01:47.970> dark<00:01:48.180> where<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.509> can't<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
not too dark where you can't see the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
not too dark where you can't see the
purple<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.799> also<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.610> light

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
purple but it's also not that light

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.850 
purple but it's also not that light
where<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.140> doesn't<00:01:52.200> look<00:01:52.590> good<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.799> think

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
where it just doesn't look good I think

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
where it just doesn't look good I think
it's<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.490> really<00:01:53.759> good<00:01:54.299> balance<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
it's a really really good balance of the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.980 
it's a really really good balance of the
you<00:01:55.649> know<00:01:55.680> dark<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.340> light<00:01:56.579> colors<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.210> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
you know dark and light colors and I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.359 
you know dark and light colors and I
think<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.770> might<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:58.950> one<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.280> my<00:01:59.340> new

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
think this might be one of my new

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.940 
think this might be one of my new
favorite<00:01:59.790> purple<00:02:00.180> colors<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.930> game

this<00:02:11.300> on<00:02:11.540> stream<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.860> figured<00:02:13.250> because

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
this on stream and I figured because

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.640 
this on stream and I figured because
it's<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.209> mean<00:02:14.510> obviously<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:15.080> made<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.349> for<00:02:15.530> the

Pro gentie 20 I thought it looked really
cool<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.050> figured<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.440> would<00:02:18.470> add<00:02:18.739> it<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.040> I

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220

you guys think but to make it you put a
gasoline<00:02:22.790> green<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.420> then<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.870> put<00:02:24.050> ice

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
gasoline green and then you put ice

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.600 
gasoline green and then you put ice
white<00:02:24.470> as<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> pearlescent<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.250> then<00:02:25.400> ice

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
screen here I think this color looks

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.610 
screen here I think this color looks
amazing<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:34.549> on<00:02:35.540> this<00:02:35.810> project<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.470> mean

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
amazing on on this project I mean

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.380 
amazing on on this project I mean
especially<00:02:36.799> with<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.730> ice<00:02:37.910> white<00:02:38.209> as<00:02:38.360> a

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
especially with the ice white as a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.140 
especially with the ice white as a
secondary<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.890> white<00:02:40.100> on<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.430> rims<00:02:40.670> like

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
secondary and the white on the rims like

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.729 
secondary and the white on the rims like
I<00:02:41.239> think<00:02:41.299> this<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.540> an<00:02:41.660> overall<00:02:41.989> really<00:02:42.590> good

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.580 
this one is called the Sun burner and
fairly<00:03:01.760> simple<00:03:02.060> color<00:03:02.269> as<00:03:02.480> well<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:03.410> make<00:03:03.560> it

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
fairly simple color as well to make it

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.920 
fairly simple color as well to make it
put<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:03.860> Cabernet<00:03:04.340> red<00:03:04.880> with<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.269> pearlescent

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
put a Cabernet red with a pearlescent

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.220 
put a Cabernet red with a pearlescent
orange<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.859> then<00:03:07.370> again<00:03:07.850> if<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.420> car<00:03:08.810> needs<00:03:09.109> a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
orange and then again if the car needs a

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.319 
orange and then again if the car needs a
secondary<00:03:09.650> then<00:03:09.950> put<00:03:10.160> Cabernet<00:03:10.640> red<00:03:10.910> as<00:03:11.120> the

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
secondary then put Cabernet red as the

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.180 
secondary then put Cabernet red as the
secondary<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.079> all<00:03:12.170> blends<00:03:12.470> nicely<00:03:12.739> and

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
secondary so it all blends nicely and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.500 
secondary so it all blends nicely and
this<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.640> kind<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:13.940> for<00:03:14.090> those<00:03:14.180> people<00:03:14.420> who

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
this is kind of for those people who

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.330 
this is kind of for those people who
like<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.989> lava<00:03:15.230> reds<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.829> stuff<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.160> those

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
like the lava reds and stuff like those

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.640 
like the lava reds and stuff like those
red<00:03:16.609> and<00:03:16.850> oranges<00:03:17.329> together<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.989> think<00:03:18.350> it's<00:03:18.590> a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
red and oranges together I think it's a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.280 
red and oranges together I think it's a
little<00:03:18.709> bit<00:03:18.890> darker<00:03:19.400> than<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.450> actual<00:03:20.989> lava

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
little bit darker than the actual lava

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.500 
little bit darker than the actual lava
red<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:21.890> can<00:03:22.040> make<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:22.489> personally<00:03:23.480> I

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
red that you can make but personally I

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.910 
red that you can make but personally I
think<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:23.989> one<00:03:24.140> looks<00:03:24.260> better<00:03:24.410> because<00:03:24.650> the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
think this one looks better because the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.970 
think this one looks better because the
darker<00:03:25.340> red<00:03:25.489> goes<00:03:25.760> really<00:03:26.120> nice<00:03:26.420> with<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:27.739> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
darker red goes really nice with the the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.800 
darker red goes really nice with the the
brighter<00:03:28.280> orange

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.309

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.199
