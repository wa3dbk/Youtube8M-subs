00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.400
 actually I wanted a video today 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:07.600
 make by talking about it 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.639
 that I sound my message 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.320
 Feels surprisingly weak when leveling 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.830
 and I was still bad at some places 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.480
 problems 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.449
 especially when against opposing groups and 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.460
 is there I have but then shortly before 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.410
 still on the advice of a friend heard 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.869
 and I'm in one of the dungeons 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.490
 gone because his tip was easy 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.869
 my dungeons are not just there 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.640
 whole circle but also still 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.289
 experience a bit of blood and 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.199
 unite a crafting point for 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.760
 every dungeon I have that too 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.559
 and then I am here as all 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.329
 first time in the relocation scenes 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.800
 went 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.890
 By the way, my very first dungeon 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.610
 I do in this at all and like that 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.530
 that's how she runs you now 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.770
 is not the first boss with the group 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.910
 but I believe the third one but me 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.530
 found that was a very meaningful 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.149
 example to show that the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.539
 assessment of one's own class, after all 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.739
 sometimes can be very subjective so you 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.629
 sees the rust in the background already 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.640
 but our tank had the idea 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.130
 that we have the small lamps here before 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.590
 ever clear a good general 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.170
 idea did not work because 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.619
 unfortunately the chest has seen that and 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.540
 to attack us 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.909
 while the boss attacks the tank or 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.110
 here in hailer I asked 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.610
 actually the idea that you first 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.560
 to clear away the little pug 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.330
 it should just as little as possible 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.079
 Damage to the tank gets at least 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.810
 out of as few sources unfortunately was 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.130
 I'm pretty much the only one with the idea 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.320
 Now she has another dvi 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.600
 connected what I found very nice and 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.950
 we were able to do that relatively quickly too 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.540
 still blow away 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.020
 but unfortunately our healer was already there 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.979
 then 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 and now our day was with us 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.840
 so only for two against an instance 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.310
 boss with want because of using 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.469
 the model of the boss extremely 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.640
 I think I like it better and 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.159
 However, in the previous mark 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.100
 so harvest when you see the boss here 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.030
 as I said first time 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.860
 I thought I am this attack 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.140
 by the way, but apparently evaded 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.369
 not quite 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.459
 tactics of the boss what I have so far 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.989
 He was also in the fight he is 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.709
 milli boss he in between on the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.120
 Of course you thought of soil and skeletons 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.590
 must clear the skeletons first 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.190
 so that you do not hurt us too much 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.709
 because we do not marry 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.970
 otherwise it worked pretty well until then 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.250
 works a bit too kiting 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.380
 The skeletons were a bit like that 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.880
 clear away 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.870
 and there were still two for what 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 has halfway worked 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.820
 i have change on the weapons 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.530
 this job waives another 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.480
 weapons during two and a half weeks 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.910
 because I did not want to be in the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.010
 range from them otherwise this will happen 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.920
 put off the idea happened he was 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.800
 also there the boss had 40 and 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.600
 I was alone against him and I'm here 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.340
 even by wearing tilts added eight 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.260
 hours had to be used in the stop 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.580
 off and the fight with it reset but to 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.590
 happiness came out somehow 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.120
 and somewhere is now at this point 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.050
 The skeletons are also absorbed 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.820
 not bad 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.200
 we do not do much harm that can 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.590
 but you against a denominator of two 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.210
 Skill from the leaking tree 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.350
 by the way 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.880
 That's why I always have such a bit 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.410
 put fire on the floor and tried 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.730
 the opponents and in between times by 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.950
 to pull and otherwise in front of the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.060
 running away 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.230
 which worked amazingly well 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.430
 because the skeletons are not special 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.240
 were quick and I especially hard 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.240
 have struck 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.510
 and it works very well you could 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.290
 avoid the ice around boss very well 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.660
 so far 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.580
 and he has only 13 percent left 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.050
 So I have a chance 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.990
 has seen in the spot that the fight 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.920
 could even survive along with the 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.300
 requirements from chat metal tech 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.870
 and it works very well only two more 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.990
 I am then with mine 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.510
 altimeter received and managed and 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.950
 despite that I have the biggest here 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.330
 part of the fight alone 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.800
 I only get one iron club 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.090
 but then I already had one 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.130
 another video there anyway 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.280
 to be improved but as you can see 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.730
 I thought my blade was clear 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.680
 too weak 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.170
 and yet I managed one 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.060
 to pick up posts and that also relatively 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.010
 without problems because I hardly have 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.360
 suffered damage 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.300
 You can see how subjective again 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.650
 the assessment by is good 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.200
 of course , because it is in the case 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.370
 an ibis was and against these in general 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.980
 No problems because I'm not easy 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.180
 but they can shoot away from them 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.410
 individual groups 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.810
 It looks quite different otherwise 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.640
 it was natural with this video as well 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.050
 a separate video to indicate one 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.790
 There is another god for this video 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.260
 Of course not a thank, of course, too 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.640
 again to the group with me here 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.040
 was inside and knew nothing about it 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.570
 that they are taken up 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.080
 and thanks for watching until the 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.080
 next time
