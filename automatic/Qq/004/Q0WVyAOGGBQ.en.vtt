00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
shape or form so that's kind of weird

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.380

you<00:01:02.670> would<00:01:02.789> think<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.059> would<00:01:03.210> at<00:01:03.270> least

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you would think they would at least

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.920 
you would think they would at least
glide<00:01:03.769> he<00:01:04.769> flies<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:06.060> that's<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
glide he flies so that's not going to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.270 
glide he flies so that's not going to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
actually flies you know I was I was

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.179 
actually flies you know I was I was
hoping<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.840> Sandman<00:01:19.080> would<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.680> something

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
hoping to Sandman would do something

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.630 
hoping to Sandman would do something
like<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.970> Iceman<00:01:21.390> does<00:01:21.860> only<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.009> sand<00:01:23.310> but

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
like what Iceman does only with sand but

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.950 
like what Iceman does only with sand but
that's<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> case<00:01:24.330> he<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.630> does<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that's not the case he just does a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.910 
that's not the case he just does a
double<00:01:25.320> jump<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.900> that<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.310> uh<00:01:30.530> yeah<00:01:31.530> he

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
double jump and that is it so uh yeah he

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.200 
double jump and that is it so uh yeah he
flies<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.590> on<00:01:34.590> any<00:01:34.890> event<00:01:35.130> let's<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.640> get

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
flies so on any event let's just get

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.410 
flies so on any event let's just get
going<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:36.720> Polaris<00:01:37.939> you<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.030> obviously

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
going with Polaris you know obviously

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.020 
going with Polaris you know obviously
she's<00:01:39.780> probably<00:01:40.020> gonna<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.560> far<00:01:40.770> as

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
she's probably gonna go as far as

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.740 
she's probably gonna go as far as
magneto<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> storm<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.520> Jean<00:01:44.520> Grey<00:01:44.549> did<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.509> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
magneto and storm and Jean Grey did so I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.840 
magneto and storm and Jean Grey did so I
don't<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.619> anticipate<00:01:46.890> her<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.670> any

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
don't really anticipate her going any
