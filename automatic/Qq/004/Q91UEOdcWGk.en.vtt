 how sister started from flouze 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.600
 may not be all that because 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.860
 you wanted our son to be able to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.130
 buy small range well 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.390
 nice or on the contrary to have fun 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.370
 by buying his godfather or whatever 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.970
 either but rld facebook that sounds that's 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.379
 parra today we will talk about a 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.510
 to manage a subject but no it is rather a 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.550
 activity you can do on dofus who 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.100
 is very very little known who used 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.290
 not very big and who pays 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.420
 really enormously so I'm going to you 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.950
 talk about this trick mavs in gt1 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.110
 specified that it works for all 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.130
 level for the fact that you have just 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.259
 I do not have but the specials and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.119
 of a suicide caused either age suits 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.670
 whether you are either I have a tribute to 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.170
 Damage body as soon as you have that you 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.550
 are full I am typing 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.369
 in the micro tech I get angry 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.680
 as soon as you have that you can do 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.880
 this technique without bothering you or 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.259
 go see someone who makes you 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.180
 for free if you already have in your 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.440
 guild who wants who you who you 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.880
 authorize it who want to give a 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.620
 little bit of their time so I 'm doing 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.350
 talk about a subject called the fm 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.490
 says m for pdp low level then you 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.320
 tell me it's a little blurry when you 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.790
 do it in the cus but then if we 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.140
 look present will take at random the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.240
 case of the mule and the bandit you go 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.890
 see at the beginning it is cheap so 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.310
 I mean to buy it's not in itself 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.659
 what will ruin us 1500 kama this is in 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.580
 no we did not go crazy wallet 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.590
 but if we go down a little bit more we see 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.240
 that acquired are up to 300 thousand km 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.700
 until then it's huge for some 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.220
 thing we bought remember 1500 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.439
 camara while doing and well just 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.700
 you go fm this object then I you 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.430
 quickly shows in a he just adds 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.119
 from deûle to vitality and it sells 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.840
 very very well trust me 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.610
 one hundred and fifty thousand common for a +65 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.660
 110 the same I mean it's not 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.440
 really something that will you 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.829
 to be expensive at m 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.079
 the runes life with what the 7.5 me 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.650
 leaving here you can easily 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.989
 do one with 100 runes and buy a 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.230
 an amulet it will cost you went 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.879
 perhaps 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.620
 break everything ten thousand cases month for the 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.480
 to frankly frankly I'm me 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.459
 think it's a good investment 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.810
 if you have not much to put 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.110
 in after you can ride more 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.120
 top of the top there are 4 is also known 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.879
 freezes to us jay leno papn so not you 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.769
 know good it's not really good 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.049
 new since a lot of people 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.459
 use the gelatine our it's really this 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.410
 who goes everywhere so I think I even 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.319
 that I create myself alone and naked and yes 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.760
 here you see even level 199 on 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.769
 use the gene to us when we do not have 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.180
 Too many gifts without a good little 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.310
 investment a good little 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.720
 investment 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.069
 so there you see I have the anoci we ride 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.190
 a little yes good the a22 stop it's a 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.540
 little bit hard but I'll find them 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.680
 price of freezes to our people loves 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.000
 they are not hot to increase his 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.680
 advance was at maybe two million 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.060
 five years can have a year does not offer 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.310
 in gold frankly to go maybe two 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.780
 million had frankly good short on 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.670
 is not on this subject there so to you 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.260
 see the fashion right now it's all 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.579
 which is resistance and especially the 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.799
 critical resistances in pvp 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.840
 it's really really appreciated 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.250
 since when someone will make a move 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.560
 critical actually it's going to limit cancel 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.480
 turn and I did not know that before 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.010
 and it's during a kolizéum video 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.989
 in fact I had put on my channel and 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.669
 who I saw I'm going to do the guy who 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.430
 did a blow create a I made a blow 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.299
 critical to the flamiche and I'm doing 0 of the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.049
 coup I did not renew but in fact 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.310
 what they had resistances 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.180
 critics like that it's really 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.190
 something that is fashionable 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.019
 I rather propose to you 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.299
 throw if you're not too kama 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.370
 on things easier to do 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.639
 kind with cheaper roads by 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.669
 example 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.590
 fm your g the ring with vitality and 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.730
 then from a father it's very easy to 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.620
 do you want to have no tutorials 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.970
 years on youtube so if you want to do 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.489
 and there you see really good there it's 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.780
 the critical distance but 145 vitality 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.989
 a father a million cases but 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.000
 frankly guys here are we here we 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.799
 look you can do really like 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.690
 you want if there is no there is not 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.900
 of receipt you can put that 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.060
 you want on what you want yes 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.099
 to celebrate it's 5 days but you 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.570
 will understand then rld went to see 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.240
 give others find little example 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.330
 are there signs of food 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.070
 I had already seen we will see them no 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.590
 so that's good now we're going to 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.790
 see the gym and elsewhere but once 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.980
 I saw in the case of someone who 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.820
 was selling a ring you leclerc blues is 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.190
 clear good short 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.130
 yeah that's our buzz lightning so the 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.340
 Exo father and vent wall 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.690
 kind 15-20 million 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.850
 it's really big business finally 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.490
 it's really well thought of him 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.170
 so almost good there it is rather and the 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.360
 f1 is rather fm is not really 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.440
 exo when I talk about exo for that 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.480
 do not know me I did not know before 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.300
 for when I talk about exo that means 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.140
 add a feature is not 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.460
 they were not there studies 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.980
 correct me in the comments if I 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.050
 deceive me i think that and fmc just 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.560
 increase a characteristic so before 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.730
 I was doing a little amalgam d2 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.970
 here you see for example there he is 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.820
 just fmh wisdom me that it's really 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.480
 it's really more expensive than you see 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.440
 here 7999 kama go one last small 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.180
 example by whose rate said what he 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.300
 we propose something a little something 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.900
 a thing to the biguine not what to do 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.610
 also explain to know you see 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.570
 it's not very well known, I told you 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.860
 is that in foot visit was not 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.120
 it's not something that was done by 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.950
 everyone I'm not mistaken it's 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.720
 watch almost nothing that has exo 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.180
 no no no there is hardly anything 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.980
 exodus years in the age of time so I 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.320
 think it's a business that has 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.240
 the future and you had asked me 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.730
 precisely techniques that works for 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.730
 all the Bella is a good example of 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.770
 techniques that works for level 10 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.630
 at level 200 it works as well 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.880
 once you are launched that you 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.590
 have a lot of stuff on sale its part 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.150
 like buns finally like 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.920
 buns you I swear to you because 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.460
 the low level pvp really starts to 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.470
 take 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.330
 not the scale but it starts to 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.410
 to democratize before we saw that 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.420
 or so I closed my eyes 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.740
 but who do not you could not see you 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.130
 not had a lot of good news 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.900
 who did everything that was stalking 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.550
 so I'm talking about that time because in 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.790
 going through the little trac dedication to 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.100
 next I'm talking about that his channel that has 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.050
 just launched a fucking concept that 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.790
 I think it's really stylish 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.150
 redo an adventure followed but in 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.200
 version 1.29 it seems to me I you 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.660
 advise to go see his channel so 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.700
 it's already honest and it's really a 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.090
 good youtuber and with a golden voice that 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.560
 I like 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:05.240
 so here is the parenthesis is closed 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.470
 good I have no other example to you 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.300
 give me to know it's something 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.310
 that exists and that you can do so 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.600
 I hope you have who is doing the 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.700
 buddies me i'll leave you a year I 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.230
 was worth I will continue to do my 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.420
 small business kama and all the brothel 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.890
 I make you the husband everything and then you 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.820
 know next to next for 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.820
 new videos
