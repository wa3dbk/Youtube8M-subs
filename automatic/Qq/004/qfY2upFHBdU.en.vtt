00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hey, guys, it's all right, I came today. 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.269
 bring a video here with you the week 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.719
 talking about hairstyles that are expected 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.210
 in a movie of medieval characters 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.580
 It's one thing I've always looked for in the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.510
 youtube to see all of them involve 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.779
 dance 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.730
 only I never thought I was always away 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.900
 too complicated is not a simple thing 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.669
 and basic and easy to make a day 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.700
 1243 hairstyles is from photos I saw today 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.090
 20 that I saw on the internet and I hope 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.410
 would you like to need these 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.610
 staples - here just ram 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.590
 I think silicone does not have much 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.870
 mystery where to catch 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.870
 is picking apart a piece of hair 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.250
 and hence the works linked to xinhua that is 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:15.560
 this heart and then we will start 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 braid a braid here just gonna do 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.420
 the work is a new phase down 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.090
 let me get a low cooking and 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:38.509
 reaps the first step and now the tonic 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.380
 the other we will start picking up the 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:46.039
 mexico down here even breathe it 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.789
 also in three pieces and will 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.789
 a normal child 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.910
 and if the first 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.240
 So, this is who I am. 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.250
 to do second hairstyle now is a 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.340
 a little more complicated but nothing 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:20.160
 impossible to do and not on time is 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:23.160
 My Website Car And Styled Hairstyle 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.620
 in the character the character in the movie as 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.990
 train your dragon who is a villain but 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.920
 I did not open a character I did not see 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.480
 slow I want to see but yes I will leave one 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.880
 link on the channel she down here for 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:43.790
 you see a check on her video 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:48.500
 so I pick up the brush and it will go 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.500
 separate this part of the hair 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.920
 and then I get a part of mexico here 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.250
 from below it will separate and 13 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:19.860
 already to leave ready to dance, here it is 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:22.080
 God only knows my space here and there it goes 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.970
 to start to launch is not so she 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.890
 like it's going to stay like it's 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.890
 a tiara we entered with this transaction 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.910
 the people 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.170
 hair pass percent 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.280
 to surf did not appear 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.610
 the beginning of the braid and we will win and 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:00.550
 will train here under the truck 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.740
 today I'm stuck here in computer science 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.270
 Now we're going back to the side. 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.000
 hair 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:13.720
 we will do as transit only that 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:19.450
 There it is to wake up, I just spoke here in 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:23.380
 down at 18 on top and thence with a 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.580
 left of everyone who does not read we will 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.580
 make a change in attack 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:41.670
 now I think it was the last one we will 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.500
 pick up these two pick up be it hair and 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.500
 will leave France again 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.349
 let's just go to the third and last stepson 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.990
 So you thought of with hairstyle or 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:59.190
 very difficult this is more tranquil and it is 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.900
 very similar to him 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.330
 We're going to mess with this part of the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:11.580
 front of the hair there will start separating the 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:18.479
 that we are going to make braids that 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:22.169
 So I stay put because we have 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:28.490
 envy is more complicated for three 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.490
 wicks and will start to braid 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:37.889
 So we 'll see you here. 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.069
 that has an hour that will end the panel 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:45.210
 its fringe and will get very thin then 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:48.960
 Who's going to do it before we finish? 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:53.460
 You'll get a piece here from another one. 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:57.050
 Braid gear to keep everything 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.050
 more or less with the same amount 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:09.620
 It was cool the elastic 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:12.410
 baby do not dance here just the game 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.250
 hair everything to this side we go 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:18.580
 overcome the low and braid with it 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.580
 also 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:33.240
 the analog signal and picks up 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:39.760
 so we'll catch traffic strans 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:42.990
 and we're going to go back around the 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.990
 hair that stayed south 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:50.889
 different design with the logical one that 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:53.569
 so ends the last world champion 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:56.419
