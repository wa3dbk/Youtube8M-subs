00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
10 out of 10 I think it's really

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.300 
10 out of 10 I think it's really
detailed<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.850> like<00:05:38.090> the<00:05:38.330> belts<00:05:39.310> there's

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
one else and there's two well I think

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.820 
one else and there's two well I think
with<00:05:47.960> it<00:05:48.169> being<00:05:48.910> the<00:05:49.910> big<00:05:50.120> show<00:05:50.390> -<00:05:50.500> no<00:05:51.500> offense

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
with it being the big show - no offense

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.140 
with it being the big show - no offense
to<00:05:52.040> but<00:05:52.310> I<00:05:52.340> think<00:05:52.840> it's<00:05:53.950> extended<00:05:54.950> by<00:05:55.760> my<00:05:55.910> right

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150
