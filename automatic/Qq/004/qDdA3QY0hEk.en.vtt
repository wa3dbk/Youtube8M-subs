00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and we would see them that they figured

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.719

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
and put it into the actual sheets and it

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.130 
and put it into the actual sheets and it
would<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> better<00:01:41.670> job<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> not<00:01:42.329> letting<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
would do a better job of not letting the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.170 
would do a better job of not letting the
wind<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.649> through<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.640> catch<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
wind go through and it would catch the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.389 
wind go through and it would catch the
wind<00:01:45.360> pull<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> lot<00:01:47.369> of

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
wind pull and that's so we see a lot of

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.889 
wind pull and that's so we see a lot of
fishermen<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> lot<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
fishermen and we actually see a lot of

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.289 
fishermen and we actually see a lot of
clothing<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.100> come<00:01:50.340> from<00:01:50.369> old<00:01:50.700> sails

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
clothing that would come from old sails

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.819 
clothing that would come from old sails
and<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.750> would<00:01:51.869> still<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> lot<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and it would still have a lot of the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.530 
and it would still have a lot of the
same<00:01:53.100> properties<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.820> being<00:01:54.149> waterproof

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
same properties of being waterproof

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.749 
same properties of being waterproof
which<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.170> very<00:01:55.380> good<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.829> work<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.310> on

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
which is very good if you work out on

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.660 
which is very good if you work out on

this<00:02:43.860> green<00:02:44.670> drab<00:02:45.300> color<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.710> a

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
this green drab color so this is a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.130 
this green drab color so this is a
little<00:02:47.220> bit<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.610> kind<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.210> just<00:02:48.390> blending<00:02:48.930> in

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
little bit of kind of just blending in

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.900 
little bit of kind of just blending in
to<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.470> natural<00:02:49.770> environments<00:02:50.550> not<00:02:50.670> really

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
to the natural environments not really

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.270 
to the natural environments not really
camouflage<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:52.020> it's<00:02:52.140> also<00:02:52.350> not<00:02:52.680> sticking

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
camouflage but it's also not sticking

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.940 
camouflage but it's also not sticking
out<00:02:53.430> as<00:02:54.000> many<00:02:54.570> hunters<00:02:55.050> know<00:02:55.200> doesn't<00:02:55.800> really

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
out as many hunters know doesn't really

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.040 
out as many hunters know doesn't really
met<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.220> color<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.940> less<00:02:57.540> important<00:02:57.990> you

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
met the color is less important you

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.360 
met the color is less important you
could<00:02:58.200> actually<00:02:58.350> go<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.710> bright<00:02:58.980> orange

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
could actually go with a bright orange

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.040 
could actually go with a bright orange
and<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.670> would<00:02:59.790> probably<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.180> better<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.780> know

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
and that would probably be better I know

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.780 
and that would probably be better I know
a<00:03:01.140> lot<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.380> hunting<00:03:01.680> stores<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.190> sell<00:03:02.220> or<00:03:02.700> you

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
a lot of hunting stores do sell or you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.430 
a lot of hunting stores do sell or you
could<00:03:02.940> wear<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> vest<00:03:03.330> with<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.930> still

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
could wear a vest with this and still

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.750 
could wear a vest with this and still
wear<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.800> traditional<00:03:05.280> jacket<00:03:05.610> but

wear this traditional jacket but

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.030 
wear this traditional jacket but
oftentimes<00:03:06.200> what<00:03:07.200> we<00:03:07.350> see<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.710> these<00:03:07.830> is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
oftentimes what we see on these is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.700 
oftentimes what we see on these is
placement<00:03:09.000> for<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.240> hands<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> big

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
placement for the hands so this is a big

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.500 
placement for the hands so this is a big
one<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.490> have<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.820> place<00:03:12.090> where<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.330> can

jacket I've got it right here on this
jacket<00:03:17.910> they<00:03:18.030> do<00:03:18.090> not<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.110> button<00:03:19.620> over

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
jacket they do not have that button over

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.650 
jacket they do not have that button over
but<00:03:19.950> they<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.700> same<00:03:20.940> placement<00:03:21.270> at

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
but they do have the same placement at

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.140 
but they do have the same placement at
this<00:03:22.200> level<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.710> the<00:03:23.400> arms<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.820> for<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
this level for the arms and for the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.390 
this level for the arms and for the
hands<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:24.810> higher<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.740> that<00:03:25.890> if<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.220> have

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
hands it's higher so that if you have

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.280 
hands it's higher so that if you have
your<00:03:26.520> rifle<00:03:27.000> slung<00:03:27.330> over<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:28.020> still

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
your rifle slung over you can still

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.140 
your rifle slung over you can still
comfortably<00:03:28.920> put<00:03:29.160> your<00:03:29.310> hands<00:03:29.490> in<00:03:29.610> here<00:03:29.730> they

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
comfortably put your hands in here they

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.450 
comfortably put your hands in here they
also<00:03:30.300> have<00:03:30.630> these<00:03:30.780> large<00:03:31.170> lower<00:03:31.740> pockets<00:03:32.310> and

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
also have these large lower pockets and

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.370 
also have these large lower pockets and
again<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> see<00:03:33.240> these<00:03:33.390> on<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.600> Timberland<00:03:34.260> as

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
again I see these on the Timberland as

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.350 
again I see these on the Timberland as
well<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:35.010> you're<00:03:35.370> see<00:03:35.670> those<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.030> Barbour

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
well and you're see those on the Barbour

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.390 
well and you're see those on the Barbour
can<00:03:36.810> anybody<00:03:37.050> guess<00:03:37.320> with<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.620> large<00:03:37.890> lower

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
can anybody guess with the large lower

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.890 
can anybody guess with the large lower
pockets<00:03:38.910> are<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.800> anyone<00:03:41.660> ammunition<00:03:42.660> right

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
pockets are for anyone ammunition right

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.350 
pockets are for anyone ammunition right
so<00:03:43.200> that's<00:03:43.410> where<00:03:43.710> you<00:03:43.800> would<00:03:43.920> actually<00:03:44.360> open

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
so that's where you would actually open

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.480 
so that's where you would actually open
this<00:03:45.480> up<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.870> could<00:03:46.140> put<00:03:46.380> large<00:03:46.800> amounts

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
this up and you could put large amounts

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.070 
this up and you could put large amounts
of<00:03:47.550> ammunition<00:03:47.940> or<00:03:48.270> anything<00:03:48.510> else<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.930> need

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
of ammunition or anything else you need

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.990

important thing in getting back to what

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.560 
important thing in getting back to what
we're<00:04:02.430> talking<00:04:02.610> about<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.850> wax<00:04:03.000> cotton<00:04:03.480> is

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
we're talking about the wax cotton is

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.410 
we're talking about the wax cotton is
the<00:04:03.930> outside<00:04:04.410> these<00:04:04.890> are<00:04:05.420> water-resistant

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
the outside these are water-resistant

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.480 
the outside these are water-resistant
not<00:04:06.630> waterproof<00:04:07.170> waterproof<00:04:07.860> you've<00:04:08.250> got<00:04:08.400> to

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
not waterproof waterproof you've got to

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.310 
not waterproof waterproof you've got to
have<00:04:08.610> actual<00:04:09.030> rubber<00:04:09.330> something<00:04:09.990> that<00:04:10.140> you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
have actual rubber something that you

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.600 
have actual rubber something that you
could<00:04:10.500> leave<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.890> water<00:04:11.040> on<00:04:11.160> there<00:04:11.400> for<00:04:11.580> a

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
could leave the water on there for a

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.850 
could leave the water on there for a
while<00:04:11.850> these<00:04:12.450> aren't<00:04:12.780> water-resistant<00:04:13.740> so

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
while these aren't water-resistant so

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.729 
while these aren't water-resistant so
they<00:04:14.010> will<00:04:14.190> resist<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.850> high<00:04:15.300> amount<00:04:15.870> water's

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
they will resist a high amount water's

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.770 
they will resist a high amount water's
just<00:04:16.770> going<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.130> roll<00:04:17.310> off<00:04:17.520> and<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:18.420> could<00:04:18.660> be

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
just going to roll off and you could be

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.270 
just going to roll off and you could be
caught<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.080> a<00:04:19.109> storm<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.620> will<00:04:19.830> remain

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
caught in a storm and you will remain

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.300 
caught in a storm and you will remain
dry<00:04:20.670> underneath<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.750> will<00:04:21.989> absorb<00:04:22.140> just<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:23.100> bit

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
dry underneath it will absorb just a bit

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.000 
dry underneath it will absorb just a bit
but<00:04:23.850> we're<00:04:24.690> talking<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:25.110> minut<00:04:25.560> amount<00:04:25.830> because

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
but we're talking a minut amount because

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.870 
but we're talking a minut amount because
the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.610 
the
ex-con<00:04:27.270> another<00:04:27.720> great<00:04:27.930> thing<00:04:28.080> about<00:04:28.290> it<00:04:28.470> is

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
ex-con another great thing about it is

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.370 
ex-con another great thing about it is
it's<00:04:29.220> actually<00:04:29.700> woven<00:04:30.120> with<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.690> type<00:04:31.200> of

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
it's actually woven with a type of

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.800 
it's actually woven with a type of
cotton<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:32.040> already<00:04:32.340> has<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.820> film<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.570> it

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
cotton that already has the film on it

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.650 
cotton that already has the film on it
so<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.800> cut<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.160> wax<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.610> basically<00:04:35.910> woven<00:04:36.450> in

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
so the cut the wax is basically woven in

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.840 
so the cut the wax is basically woven in
to<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.410> actual<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.980> depends<00:04:38.340> on<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.580> actual

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
to the actual it depends on the actual

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.940 
to the actual it depends on the actual
who<00:04:39.300> made<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:39.780> what<00:04:40.200> mill<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.560> came<00:04:40.770> from

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
who made it and what mill it came from

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.860 
who made it and what mill it came from
but<00:04:41.460> normally<00:04:42.000> for<00:04:42.030> these<00:04:42.300> jackets<00:04:42.780> you're

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
but normally for these jackets you're

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.570 
but normally for these jackets you're
going<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.050> see<00:04:43.170> that<00:04:43.350> they<00:04:43.500> used<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.950> good<00:04:44.370> a

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
going to see that they used a good a

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.930 
going to see that they used a good a
good<00:04:45.060> waxed<00:04:45.510> cotton<00:04:45.720> thread<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.940> afterwards

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
good waxed cotton thread and afterwards

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.480 
good waxed cotton thread and afterwards
they<00:04:48.270> treated<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.900> as<00:04:49.020> well<00:04:49.500> now<00:04:50.070> one<00:04:50.310> of<00:04:50.340> the

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
they treated it as well now one of the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.040 
they treated it as well now one of the
things<00:04:50.700> with<00:04:50.850> wax<00:04:51.060> cotton<00:04:51.450> a<00:04:51.510> lot<00:04:51.690> why<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.870> lot

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
things with wax cotton a lot why a lot

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.690 
things with wax cotton a lot why a lot
of<00:04:52.140> people<00:04:52.350> look<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.920> avoid<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.490> they<00:04:53.550> go

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
of people look to avoid it and they go

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.310 
of people look to avoid it and they go
with<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.880> modern<00:04:54.300> equivalent<00:04:54.570> or<00:04:54.990> something

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
with a modern equivalent or something

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.930 
with a modern equivalent or something
different<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:56.190> they<00:04:56.340> don't<00:04:56.460> want<00:04:56.580> to
