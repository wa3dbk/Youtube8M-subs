00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.250
 what's up another for how are you driving 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.230
 in this video of the grand theft auto 5 les 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.830
 I will teach or I will tell you more 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.340
 something that is not so cool and what happens 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.200
 is that rockstar just banned all 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.820
 the mods just got a 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.659
 update as you can see in 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.659
 screen 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.369
 so with this update the bikes 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.080
 they were absolutely disabled 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.669
 by the way the videos that I uploaded about 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.279
 mods there will be and will stay for the 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.070
 posterity because they do not even serve 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.830
 so I think rockstar should 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.290
 consider that there are many people in the 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:44.360
 which I include that they have already passed the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.309
 game three times twice and that then 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.589
 obviously after you spend the 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.660
 game then those times several times 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.510
 doubles that you've gone through you know it 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.059
 we know it by heart the game and then 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.250
 I think that people, even the 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.140
 modders are going by another option or 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.750
 something different you can do as 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.220
 stupid already in the game as well as like that 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.259
 of the zombies putting zombies like that 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.479
 because yes and I think that is very 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.580
 fun and what I think roster does not 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.649
 is considering and that probably 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.899
 he will never do it because for some reason 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.380
 they have some kind of regime 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.119
 authoritarian that only his game is like 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.649
 they want it to be their game and it's 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.840
 well because it's a game but well 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.500
 also if there were no people will pay for 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.920
 their game would not have the success that 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.110
 and that's what the modders or the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.200
 people who make the mods are not charging 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.020
 nothing to the people who plan all that does not 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.270
 he does not charge or you are going to download the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.840
 you grab it free of the links that 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.850
 they put themselves and put downloads and 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.950
 what you try and have fun because it's 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.110
 what is involved is not pure fun and 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.990
 let's say that if there is a model someone 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.180
 I will grab a mod and say no, I'm going to 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.390
 charge 100 several for this mode that you 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.850
 you become spider-man or a mode of 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.190
 jurassic park and that dinosaurs come out and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.080
 I'm going to charge 500 pesos to anyone who wants it 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.170
 play and be certified if they want 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.209
 but something that I find very strange is 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.060
 that are so against the mods 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.290
 when it's something really free that does not 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.050
 affects the experience of others 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.180
 players because these mods only 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.250
 were to play them in the campaign was not a 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.950
 mosquito diges no yes yes if you get 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.330
 as algete to online and there, then, people 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.640
 that is putting modes and is that they are 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.920
 whale falling from the sky and that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.380
 they are exploiting that they shoot cars with 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.550
 another car 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.250
 start doing those kinds of things that a 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.510
 people would bother but if it's something 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.980
 individual is this quite normal and I 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.510
 I think there's nothing wrong with it, it's like 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.970
 that you can do what you want in your 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.220
 house or if you live you can only do what 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.230
 you want not but provided no 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.990
 bother neighbors do not be doing 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.460
 nonsense apart from bothering people do not you 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.800
 It can be whatever you want, I believe in 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.210
 your game that you bought and see if 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.050
 someone from rockstar does not see this video 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.030
 vanian but if that would be like my 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.150
 I do not think they're taking it 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.670
 very very strong that is, they are thinking 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.700
 things like very dense here are here 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.620
 the prohibition of all do not know not 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.180
 makes me so chido to do that but and 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.970
 good one good news is that there was 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.400
 seen in a place that you could download 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.870
 the executable of the gta now yes that the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.480
 launcher that is to put the game 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.849
 he was as modified he had been 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.470
 modified the online features 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.909
 you if you got into that executable was going to 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.280
 put normal game alone that was going to 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.170
 block all gta servers not 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.230
 online you were not going to be able to connect 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.360
 I have not tried it because I must see well 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.370
 how it works because it's not going to be like 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.110
 at the mere hour that you do that and no longer 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.420
 you can get online it's never something 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.790
 that I would not like it to happen and in fact 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.310
 would be very unpleasant if that happen if 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.720
 no but it is supposed that obviously if 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.280
 they block the rockstar servers is 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.349
 as if you had like the game already 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.660
 installed but apart if you did not have 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.970
 as very personal and you could use there 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.030
 the mods you want as well as take away 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.040
 the update to the game is what 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.599
 what is this this executable does not remove 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.180
 all the updates that have been 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.970
 and it allows you to enter from a version 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.039
 very old gta no and in this version 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.500
 where if the mods were accepted because 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.539
 you can play and everything but you should check 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.169
 well how that works so well then nothing 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.600
 more for now 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.550
 rockstar blocking all modes 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.849
 servers is that option that I tell them 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.789
 but it will not be so reliable 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.349
 nothing more would that be all I hope that 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.429
 Have you enjoyed watching this video and 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.429
 until next time
