00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.329 
least not work as hard as you normally
do<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.539> your<00:01:04.140> body's<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
do because your body's going to this in

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.940 
do because your body's going to this in
this<00:01:05.549> detox<00:01:06.000> starting<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> detox<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this detox starting the detox and you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.800 
this detox starting the detox and you
know<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.310> leads<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.060> energy<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.630> for

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
know it leads all the energy can get for

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
know it leads all the energy can get for
that<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.260> basically<00:01:10.439> working<00:01:10.890> away<00:01:11.159> try

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that so it's basically working away try

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.010 
that so it's basically working away try
to<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:12.000> rid<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.270> these<00:01:12.420> toxins<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.960> have

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
to get rid of all these toxins that have

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
to get rid of all these toxins that have
been<00:01:13.200> built<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.220> more<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> other<00:01:14.670> junk

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the same as me but whatever is cause you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to gain weight is most likely to be dt

to gain weight is most likely to be dt
the<00:01:22.020> wrong<00:01:22.170> types<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.560> food<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.130> have

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
the wrong types of food so if they have

to be no the residual you know results

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.590 
to be no the residual you know results
of<00:01:26.700> those<00:01:26.759> products<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.390> eliminated

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
of those products have to be eliminated

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
of those products have to be eliminated
somehow<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> toxins<00:01:28.820> toxins<00:01:29.820> are<00:01:29.939> normally

this<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> diet<00:02:53.940> but<00:02:54.209> what<00:02:54.630> I'm<00:02:54.690> getting<00:02:54.959> at

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
this is a diet but what I'm getting at

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.990 
this is a diet but what I'm getting at
is<00:02:55.080> other<00:02:55.440> other<00:02:56.190> methods<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.640> do<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:56.820> dual

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
is other other methods to do with dual

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.760 
is other other methods to do with dual
similar<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.510> guess<00:02:57.720> there's<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.350> juice<00:02:58.530> fast

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
similar to guess there's the juice fast

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.440 
similar to guess there's the juice fast
in<00:02:58.950> terms<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.280> how<00:02:59.670> your<00:02:59.820> body<00:02:59.970> reacts<00:03:00.270> with

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
in terms of how your body reacts with

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.270 
in terms of how your body reacts with
weight<00:03:00.600> loss<00:03:00.630> but<00:03:01.020> what<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.650> was<00:03:01.770> getting<00:03:01.890> at<00:03:02.100> is

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
weight loss but what I was getting at is

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.580 
weight loss but what I was getting at is
is<00:03:02.430> very<00:03:02.459> few<00:03:02.940> other<00:03:03.060> players<00:03:03.390> out<00:03:03.840> there<00:03:03.870> so

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
is very few other players out there so

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.920 
is very few other players out there so
players<00:03:04.920> instead<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.280> dyes<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.930> actually

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
players instead of dyes that actually

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.449 
players instead of dyes that actually
give<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> place<00:03:07.560> great<00:03:07.890> results<00:03:08.280> like

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
give you the place great results like

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.280 
give you the place great results like
you<00:03:08.550> know<00:03:08.640> 1.4<00:03:09.209> kilograms<00:03:09.330> three<00:03:09.900> pounds

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
you know 1.4 kilograms three pounds

weight<00:03:10.590> loss<00:03:10.770> in<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:10.980> first<00:03:11.160> day<00:03:11.400> that's<00:03:12.330> a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
weight loss in the first day that's a

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.030 
weight loss in the first day that's a
good<00:03:12.630> start<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.170> feel<00:03:13.380> pretty<00:03:13.530> pretty<00:03:13.830> good

about<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.640> motivates<00:03:15.090> me<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.480> keep

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
about that and that motivates me to keep

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.970 
about that and that motivates me to keep
going<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.200> I'm<00:03:16.350> sure<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.680> you'll<00:03:16.800> focus

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
going so I'm sure that you'll focus

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.290 
going so I'm sure that you'll focus
yourself<00:03:17.220> with<00:03:17.640> your<00:03:17.730> weight<00:03:17.880> loss<00:03:18.030> you're

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
yourself with your weight loss you're

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.240 
yourself with your weight loss you're
generally<00:03:19.290> your<00:03:19.440> first<00:03:19.650> day<00:03:19.830> is<00:03:19.950> going<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.130> be

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
generally your first day is going to be

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.850 
generally your first day is going to be
the<00:03:20.340> most<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.700> some<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:21.060> probably<00:03:21.860> you

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
the most and some of that's probably you

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.100 
the most and some of that's probably you
know<00:03:22.890> water-based<00:03:23.580> loss<00:03:24.060> as<00:03:24.239> well<00:03:24.420> because<00:03:24.959> a

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
know water-based loss as well because a

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.360 
know water-based loss as well because a
knock<00:03:25.290> but<00:03:25.320> obviously<00:03:25.739> because<00:03:26.070> you're<00:03:26.250> not

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
knock but obviously because you're not

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.880 
knock but obviously because you're not
actually<00:03:26.519> eating<00:03:26.970> solids<00:03:27.390> your<00:03:27.959> stomach<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
actually eating solids your stomach and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.500 
actually eating solids your stomach and
intestines<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:29.760> forth<00:03:30.000> are<00:03:30.090> going<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.450> be

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
intestines and so forth are going to be

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
intestines and so forth are going to be
as<00:03:30.570> for<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:30.959> because<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:31.380> basically

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
as for this because it's basically

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.400 
as for this because it's basically
Jerusalem<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.280> after<00:03:32.640> two<00:03:32.850> or<00:03:32.880> three<00:03:33.120> days

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
Jerusalem so after two or three days

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.509 
Jerusalem so after two or three days

thesis as well is that of course what

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.090 
thesis as well is that of course what
you<00:03:48.420> have<00:03:48.570> something<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.110> do<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.950> have<00:03:50.070> a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
you have something to do you have a

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.590 
you have something to do you have a
juice<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.580> morning<00:03:50.730> or<00:03:51.150> whatever<00:03:51.330> you

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
juice in the morning or whatever you

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.150 
juice in the morning or whatever you
have<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:51.810> actually<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.709> actually<00:03:53.010> get<00:03:53.130> a

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
have but actually you actually get a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.530 
have but actually you actually get a
better<00:03:53.370> fit<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.820> straightaway<00:03:54.209> because<00:03:54.330> it

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
better fit to straightaway because it

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.120 
better fit to straightaway because it
only<00:03:54.660> takes<00:03:54.900> about<00:03:55.019> 10<00:03:55.410> minutes<00:03:55.440> or<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:55.950> from

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
only takes about 10 minutes or so from

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.580 
only takes about 10 minutes or so from
your<00:03:56.280> body<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:57.510> start<00:03:57.810> absorbing<00:03:58.170> down<00:03:58.440> and

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
your body to start absorbing down and

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.420 
your body to start absorbing down and
putting<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.860> straight<00:03:59.220> into<00:03:59.400> your

putting that straight into your

full quicker if you're like me and you

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.729

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
have got a signal that takes a long time

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.610 
have got a signal that takes a long time
to<00:04:07.950> register<00:04:08.250> 30<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.209> cool<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.290> tend<00:04:10.500> to

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
to register 30 of cool so you tend to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.110 
to register 30 of cool so you tend to
overeat<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.070> then<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.400> catches<00:04:11.760> up<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.060> you

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
overeat and then it catches up and you

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.539 
overeat and then it catches up and you
think<00:04:12.299> I<00:04:12.420> want<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.870> eat<00:04:13.019> so<00:04:13.230> much<00:04:13.380> that's<00:04:14.370> the
