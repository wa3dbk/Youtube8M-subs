00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
think I get all more every fighting time

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.510 
think I get all more every fighting time
they<00:02:53.600> had<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.750> new<00:02:54.020> champion<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.650> very<00:02:55.220> strong

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
they had a new champion a very strong

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.910

one<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.820> very<00:02:55.970> good<00:02:56.120> one<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:57.410> all<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.890> my

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
one and a very good one so all of my

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.620 
one and a very good one so all of my
fights<00:02:58.160> are<00:02:58.310> tighter<00:02:58.489> than<00:02:58.580> around<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.150> think<00:02:59.570> a

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
fights are tighter than around I think a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.700 
fights are tighter than around I think a
460<00:03:00.140> times<00:03:00.350> over<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.709> that's<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.760> lot

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710
