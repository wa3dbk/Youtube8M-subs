00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
the way is a fabric generator I've set

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.070 
the way is a fabric generator I've set
it<00:00:13.860> from<00:00:14.160> its<00:00:14.339> I<00:00:14.639> set<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.999> default<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.570> canvas

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
it from its I set the default to canvas

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.370 
it from its I set the default to canvas
I<00:00:16.320> added<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.280> tint<00:00:17.550> color<00:00:17.760> added<00:00:18.330> about<00:00:18.510> that

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
I added a tint color added about that

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.410 
I added a tint color added about that
much<00:00:19.650> tinting<00:00:20.190> to<00:00:20.310> make<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.640> sort<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.940> a<00:00:21.090> warm

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420

most<00:00:23.940> of<00:00:24.120> these<00:00:24.210> generators<00:00:24.780> they're<00:00:24.960> just

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
most of these generators they're just

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.970
