00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 when I was a child my mother gave me 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.080
 told the story of how the devil 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 he wanders about the earth he sometimes said 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.470
 takes on human features to punish the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.150
 damned before claiming their soul 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.270
 those who choose are gathered and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.350
 tortured and gods hides between them 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.090
 pretending to be one of them I always have 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.090
 thought it was a legend 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.549
 I think some things can't be done 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:11.590
 forgive but you are already at a good point 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.880
 I really like it 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.509
 but when I think of the guy he killed 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.000
 philadelphia I do a lot of work a 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:25.170
 To believe in something 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.170
 machine 6 0 2 to 2 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.870
 there is a gift for you yes 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 so reduce a van by falling from a 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.740
 palace so low it threw itself if 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.270
 someone had pushed him to a rosary 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.950
 in hand 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.720
 if he had turned someone up to one 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.970
 rosary in hand 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:08.880
 if they had it, someone wouldn't be at home in 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.950
