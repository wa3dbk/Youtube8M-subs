00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.129
 Hi, everyone. Welcome to another class. 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.800
 advancing biology gives lessons today are 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.460
 the nucleic acids best known as 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 molecules of dna and mother for gln people 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.480
 these molecules she has last name 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.960
 in fact the DNA molecule it 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.270
 calls all ribonucleic oxygens that the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.919
 dna molecule called star 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.520
 ribonucleic acid 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.230
 which, after all, these molecules with names 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.230
 so strange, right? 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 The dna molecule is formed by two 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.250
 chains that we call candeias 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.160
 can nucleotides 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.800
 are these two tapes that are connected 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.820
 urchin each other is where the line is made 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.550
 simple in her has one had only those who 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.589
 it's the tapes and what's up? 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.399
 result of this chain may in the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:05.040
 also spoke of this means that the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.890
 dna molecule as well as proteins by 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.170
 example are molecules that we treat 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.479
 as the polymer sus or what is 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.460
 is a polymer a polymer a molecule 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.159
 which is formed by several 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.409
 molecules small molecules smaller 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.229
 these small molecules smaller than 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:32.040
 constitute dna molecules the monomers 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:36.829
 we call nucleotides each 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:42.119
 fragment itself is a nucleotide am 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:44.729
 light gave these goals they make up 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.600
 both the dna tapes and the tapes of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.670
 how many nuclei make up 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.000
 the tape everyone calls this chain of 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.299
 the pole in the critic because it can mean 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.939
 several is a chain formed by 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.119
 several active nuclei but at the end of 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.180
 what accounts is but is significant 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.130
 because it is composed of people 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.770
 these nucleotides are composed 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.270
 for three units, right? 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.370
 this skill that I presented for 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.819
 black balls represents the grouping 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.160
 phosphate in accessibility that is in 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:27.430
 blue represents actually a suca one 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.950
 in the case of dna we call this 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 old design sugar 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.340
 in the case of rn we call sugar 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.980
 boston 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 the difference between the sugar of dna iguaçu 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.340
 pr is the presence of a naive act as 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.489
 I gave the dna sugar does not have oxygen to 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.799
 People call him dezzotti and he's bose. 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.720
 indicating that this sugar is not 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:56.530
 presented oxygen 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:58.180
 now the ribose of rn presents the other 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.140
 grouping that is because the implant 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.030
 is called the nitrogenous base and the 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.970
 nitrogenous bases they can be 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.750
 several types in his case we can 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:15.640
 have mines girls we can have 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.100
 also guanine and cerbasi cytosine 13 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.560
 day belongs rma 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.170
 we will not end up in the place of 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.140
 thymine the chain can nucleus tijuca vai 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.430
 present a single type of base 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.790
 nitrogen 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.079
 when we join the phosphate group 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.329
 the sugar 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:39.459
 my base among the journey, we already 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:41.859
 has a nucleotide when we join a 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.550
 nucleotide or other one has the 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.660
 chain may believe 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.400
 dr n the nitrogenous base house né 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.780
 for example now if I do not 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.820
 intimidating 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.880
 crude steel has to be necessarily 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.970
 an old woman just recapturing so many people 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.340
 the url may have adenine and guanine may 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.610
 to have been sina but never a mining team 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.540
 will have always uses whistles the dna may 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.300
 mine is not going to have to 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.220
 cures silva but it can have adenine 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.580
 guanine and good cytosine you should already have 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.410
 several terms such as 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:27.050
 chromosome chromatin 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.840
 all these terms always make 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.350
 reference dna molecules or pieces 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.830
 of the dna molecule a gene for example is 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.750
 a fragment of an ama dna carries 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.580
 has the necessary information to 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.300
 constitute a feature of your 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.250
 body 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.350
 suddenly some interesting protein 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.510
 no people 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.640
 Let's talk a little more about the 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.669
 reasons why they are part of the 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.260
 of our nucleic acids attained 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.100
 they can be sorry 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.040
 the nucleotides and can present the 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.130
 some kind of basis to the bases that people 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.400
 public bases and the bases that 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:11.600
 we call the bases and myths the bases 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.190
 public are girls and girls 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.990
 Call basis involving the journey 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.880
 points between agencies we find 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.660
 on these bases and the legal bases you 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.470
 admire 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.760
 the creek mill queue personal site 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.070
 differences the public bases generally 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.300
 generally present we present 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.990
 two rings, right? 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:37.400
 and the political basis presents the manel 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:40.520
 only seven staff only to complete 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.160
 so dna function it has all the 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.730
 genetic characteristics of our body 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.860
 in the goaninha function we go 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.130
 study later I work a lot 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.170
 transcription and translation process 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.660
 It is actually an intermediary between the 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.630
 let's say let's say so is the 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.300
 end product that would be a protein 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.460
 there are different types of DNA by 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.280
 example exists is stuffed in this genre 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.190
 no rn the carrier to the renaissance 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.130
 like us is so on the 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:17.210
 shipping company 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:19.460
 rn this way and to the medical ribas 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.510
 so each of them has a function 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.910
 specific 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.160
 hoineff engineer it used to be a 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.750
 copy of a gene that needs to be 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.640
 expressed in 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.140
 how are you going to do to make this 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.330
 gene is expressed 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.130
 it will route you to a window that 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:39.020
 flame ribosome 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:41.360
 the ribosome has the ability to 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:45.919
 produce proteins from the message 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.780
 from nsg then walk like that to us 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.270
 will succeed in being able to 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.570
 protein that was the side - knot message 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:57.460
 DNA carrier RNA that has the function 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.460
 to carry mino assis 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.509
 an as the proteins are formed by 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.330
 amino acids and who produces this protein 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.220
 it is the body revolution not the hemosul 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.479
 need someone to deliver the 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.220
 amino acids for him who will do this 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.669
 m is the transport of the molecule 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:21.729
 the woman carrier with gnr but the 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:24.909
 she constitutes flights or she joins 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:27.340
 some proteins to form the great 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:29.860
 rival sum because the organelle that you 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:33.430
 can find the function of it but 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.259
 specifically in the classes seen today it leaves 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.219
 staff we will enter these 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:38.460
 details here 

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:45.520
 a class that we call class of 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:47.020
 translation and transcription transcription 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.930
 process by which we form 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:53.440
 dna molecules and translation process 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:56.819
 by which is messenger is translated into 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.710
 thanks to the help of the great emotion 

00:07:56.819 --> 00:08:02.099
 certain people until the next class and a 

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.099
 grace
