00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
probably the most efficient here there

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.180 
probably the most efficient here there
is<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.600> it's<00:05:54.930> advertised<00:05:55.590> as<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:56.070> you<00:05:56.160> can

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
see I would have naturally thought the a

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.070 
see I would have naturally thought the a
sort<00:06:45.600> of<00:06:45.660> Palin<00:06:46.110> did<00:06:46.230> he<00:06:46.350> mix<00:06:46.590> would<00:06:47.100> be<00:06:47.370> an

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
sort of Palin did he mix would be an

car hmm because those all sort of match
what<00:06:55.980> I<00:06:56.010> think<00:06:56.460> paladin<00:06:57.060> is<00:06:57.240> whereas<00:06:57.870> what

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
what I think paladin is whereas what

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.740 
what I think paladin is whereas what
you've<00:06:58.140> got<00:06:58.290> there<00:06:58.470> is<00:06:58.590> a<00:06:58.940> ranged<00:06:59.940> DPS<00:07:00.000> a

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750
