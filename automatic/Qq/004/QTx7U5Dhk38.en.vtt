00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.010
 start with a wrap i only have left 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.760
 need a beer wait google 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.420

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.420
 is you the beat 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.110
 horrible offers then now we are ready to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.610
 to rap 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.980
 it was a lazy bye , it seems to me 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.430
 accident there apple don't you go for you 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.730
 play 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.520
 counter staff is crazy shooter 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.210
 hauliers park here also hates that 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.470
 ok mine to show off 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.800
 yes this is your boy your nero's fish 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.800
 he has a thick tube 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.150
 Well I just leave it at dear 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.799
 Keeping this is not really my thing 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.120
 at least i'm mattie from fifa 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.370
 unload through and I will continue with fifa 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.870
 fridays series week division go 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.339
 almost on ultimate team in the first 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.080
 contest of this episode mother me 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.119
 type of shot and skew because 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.559
 look this way it looks first and like me 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.540
 it changes here too quickly because yes 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.290
 all those players get tired injured 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.450
 knows all that 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.860
 ultimate team aids but we are 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.270
 by now all have now engaged yet 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.979
 no 4 of seen so let's go to the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.200
 next game and his team is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.940
 well you can easily interpret that in 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.470
 the that but this was it still goes 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.180
 good start from us because here is one 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.620
 ball to marco van ginkel and that is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.150
 by and I'll tell you 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.590
 he is going to score and you can feel it 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.300
 probably we will arrive again 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.280
 in the 11th minute we can do all that fun 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.050
 are going to Turks 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.460
 because that's what he does but it seems 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.110
 a bit of the marco van competition 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.180
 to be a shimmer because here he is again 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.620
 by and her lottery a panty keeper 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.170
 and then you usually throw because look 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.940
 no tiki 3 stands still and why 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.290
 I find that funny I have no idea 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.670
 but after these two zero points mine 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.080
 opponent has been completely enough 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.690
 and he love match properly 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.860
 six points come in the vision 8 but 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.750
 the next game is mocking with that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.120
 really only bad because of this 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.650
 is the team in the first match and 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.080
 this is the team in the second game 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.810
 and this second game played against 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.280
 fcc winetroub I think that is such an epic 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.500
 namibia why we are team is not 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.090
 bad certainly not bad but if you do 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.129
 check ebay channel because it is still 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.390
 always the vision 8 then that states 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.519
 actually is almost for such a competition 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.319
 because here is del piero with the goldie 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.709
 real longer playing time early I mentioned 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.269
 loyal to him will adele pierrot but yes that 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.310
 is that i am not funny or just here 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.380
 comes the pier del delo and that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.910
 does not touch the being put back 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.130
 because of this class that puts him back or 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.110
 van ginkel and the dutch justin 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.280
 bieber who scores him and people said 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.140
 against me her does not look like justin 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.400
 bieber well he really just looks like 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.560
 justin bieber and i will and 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.600
 ask oh mark oh yes he justin anyway 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.520
 bieber to class anyway 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.290
 See you have that discussion 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.480
 also the world from which helped and there 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.280
 there will be another page in this lesson 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.959
 nice round if these lamps was gone 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.860
 had gone very sexy am ayco 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.270
 The one time or another hobby I 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.890
 a groupie ' you with 10 apparently I have 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.569
 a copy you immediately who scores him and 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.220
 then this competition ends 3 0 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.430
 I pick up three dots again so I pick up 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.810
 9 points are shown in the 8 man vision 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.760
 is my base that is finally one again 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.410
 a bit fit so then I switch with 10 of 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.450
 this after this really follow me you there 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.970
 completely crazy that he is the tenth 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.530
 so out and then she the tenth so but me 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.420
 will just continue to do well 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.480
 pointing in the form I get away to league 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.670
 bbva team ate something or she or him 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.640
 keep an eye on that guy because here is the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.830
 45th minute and then eat pimping bouncing ball 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.090
 eat eat then you will not get well 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.380
 and then you also find one and iso one 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.700
 match where it is all that delicious 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.680
 had or so then you just have to worry 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.150
 that you are a goaltje mike and not one 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.980
 period and if you then get a zero 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.690
 find out then is or proteins minutes 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.700
 Do you not feel that it is still good 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.629
 this whole game is going to never come 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.129
 mind is already there 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.360
 and do n't believe it or believe in it 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.120
 next time there will be another good one 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.300
 attack and came through ella and through again 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.300
 then 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.260
 score which of course he ghoul 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.420
 if someone brings two one and that 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.990
 means that we no longer rear he 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.810
 well seen where you so 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.770
 hit 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.770
 no the cream 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.360
 yes that's true fate strikes but 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.920
 it is also good for too long 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.990
 I have gone since the beginning of 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.670
 the series played 18 times already 18 times 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.890
 won and that had to go wrong once 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.049
 and that happens here also look you see this 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.400
 woman here who symbolizes what's there 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:27.010
 happened to me in this competition 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.330
 because yes here is the two two and here 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.970
 you see the three two in front of me 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.530
 opponent I lose so so then sit 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.430
 nothing else to be tasty together 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.430
 howl 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.930
 achja shit happens like i used to 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.520
 say shit happens 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.870
 this recipe is lost and therefore 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.290
 I decide to do something about my setup 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.310
 to do 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.680
 I change from this to this and oh 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.150
 why can it four times in some episodes 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.810
 difference is that I'm a little defensive 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.680
 play through the my cm string cdm swatches 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.060
 in other words 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.640
 defensive midfielders instead of 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.010
 now fill the mill in the middle so the next one 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.550
 match is against fc 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.760
 or the fifa will give him the team 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.860
 football club 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.479
 and the first goal from this one 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.760
 contest is going to be for me and then me 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.220
 Looking back at these clips I saw the on 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.510
 quite a nice gormer's 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.220
 combination football and finally every 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.600
 ball at antonia who put it in it 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.580
 going long shoot is that guy 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.530
 of those little ones got up with his 90p 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.930
 but if only 10 now finished but then 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.550
 right now a corner a that's just 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.960
 Morocco and you know he just could 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.400
 puts it in the hands of the keeper 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.250
 and check good moodies or that 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.630
 happens yes and when we do that is only one 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.620
 comment what I can come up with here 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.240
 and he falls 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.500
 and what do you think happens because what 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.760
 do you think who what do you think goes here 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.000
 to happen 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.810
 just a penalty for me 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.880
 penalty of lobes year is used 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.260
 be anyway because he is his boss with 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.729
 penalties and at the end of the 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.070
 he comes up with another corner 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.050
 bomma you ring me making this 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.100
 wisdom 3 0 is going to end and where that 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.419
 I finally have a wish again 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.710
 finally another least one 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.700
 west not won but for the gallows 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.650
 So long ago 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.720
 but this episode is also going to see you 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.240
 end that sounds very neat 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.410
 also a nice plate i hope so 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.360
