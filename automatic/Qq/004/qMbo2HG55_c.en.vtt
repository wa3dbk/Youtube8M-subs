the<00:02:40.170> way<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.380> was<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.890> beginning<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:43.290> don't

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
the way it was in the beginning I don't

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.310 
the way it was in the beginning I don't
think<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.130> that's<00:02:44.700> not<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.180> happen<00:02:45.360> you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
think so that's not going to happen you

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.840 
think so that's not going to happen you
know<00:02:46.410> that's<00:02:46.650> kind<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.040> people<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.670> get

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
know that's kind of like people that get

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.520 
know that's kind of like people that get
divorced<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.540> wish<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.140> could<00:02:49.230> all<00:02:49.380> be

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
divorced and wish that it could all be

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.110 
divorced and wish that it could all be
the<00:02:49.560> same<00:02:49.740> way<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.220> was<00:02:50.340> what<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.670> was<00:02:50.820> when

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
the same way it was what it was when

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.920 
the same way it was what it was when
they<00:02:51.209> first<00:02:51.390> met

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
they first met

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.190 
they first met
I'm<00:02:52.380> not<00:02:52.709> going<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.950> happen<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.430> know<00:02:54.270> because<00:02:55.020> I

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
I'm not going to happen I know because I

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.110 
I'm not going to happen I know because I
was<00:02:55.380> divorced<00:02:55.620> twice

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
was divorced twice

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.250 
was divorced twice
I<00:02:57.150> shouldn't<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.570> said<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.760> so<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.820> have

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
I shouldn't have said that so you have

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.760 
I shouldn't have said that so you have
two<00:03:01.260> dogs<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:02.870> have<00:03:03.870> decided<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.440> fight<00:03:04.650> in

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
two dogs that have decided to fight in

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.350 
two dogs that have decided to fight in
the<00:03:04.830> house<00:03:04.980> they<00:03:05.489> don't<00:03:05.670> fight<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.180> walk

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the house they don't fight on the walk

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.610 
the house they don't fight on the walk
the<00:03:06.600> reason<00:03:06.840> they<00:03:06.900> don't<00:03:07.020> fight<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> walk

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
the reason they don't fight on the walk

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.720 
the reason they don't fight on the walk
is<00:03:07.800> because<00:03:08.040> you're<00:03:08.190> there<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.489> probably

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
is because you're there you probably

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.090 
is because you're there you probably
have<00:03:09.150> them<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.390> leashes<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.900> would<00:03:10.050> think<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.440> my

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
have them on leashes I would think so my

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.920 
have them on leashes I would think so my
guess<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.760> you're<00:03:12.000> not<00:03:12.150> letting<00:03:12.420> them<00:03:12.690> run

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
guess is you're not letting them run

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.500 
guess is you're not letting them run
around<00:03:13.310> what<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.430> have<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.670> do<00:03:14.790> now<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.180> manage

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
around what you have to do now is manage

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.150 
around what you have to do now is manage
the<00:03:15.690> dogs<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.170> have<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.530> have<00:03:16.680> three<00:03:16.980> dog

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
the dogs you have to have three dog
