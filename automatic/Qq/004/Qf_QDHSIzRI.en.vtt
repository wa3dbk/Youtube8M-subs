00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.430
 I will now present some premises for planning the control of 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.439
 access 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.409
 whenever we thought we would deploy the access control system 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.769
 technology, it is important that 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:31.669
 looking for 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.909
 and worse the guarantor to remember keiko control access to the process 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.640
 preventive security 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.320
 and its purpose is to enable it to prevent access by persons 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.010
 of vehicles 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 and I say only materials in restricted environments 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410
 another important thing 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.700
 is that the success of the implementation of an access control system 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 depends exclusively on the quality of this planning 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.600
 mainly of a security policy of the organization 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 a policy that has been discussed 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.130
 and that is actually implemented 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.830
 should preferably be composed of physical elements 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260
 human elements 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.930
 and organizational 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.630
 whose tactical combination is highly controlled and is expected to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.680
 we will speak in detail of each of these elements 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.160
 another very important premise in the implementation of a control system 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.310
 access 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.410
 is that it should make it possible to trace age 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.110
 which are held by means of the records 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.360
 control of various events 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.180
 the entrance agency 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.760
 out the name of the people the name of the users the entry schedule many 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.980
 times the exit times of passage through the controlled companies who are these 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.220
 groups of users in the controlled areas in which critical areas 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.220
 will be controlled and other important information 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.749
 the system must allow 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.070
 issuing reports based on these 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.470
 this success 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.360
 of the band is therefore will have the ability to integrate with other systems 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 fire detection and alarm systems closed circuit systems 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.020
 perimeter alarm systems 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.959
 panic 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.609
 and in building automation systems, among others
