not bad arm sadly this is not one of
those<00:02:02.729> case<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.329> could<00:02:03.509> use<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:05.280> stand

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
those case that you could use as a stand

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.419 
those case that you could use as a stand
but<00:02:06.869> hey<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> very<00:02:07.680> nice-looking<00:02:07.890> case

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
but hey is a very nice-looking case

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.089 
but hey is a very nice-looking case
let's<00:02:09.330> go<00:02:09.599> ahead<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.780> take<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.560> look<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.860 
let's go ahead and take a look at the
white<00:02:11.310> one<00:02:11.550> which<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.790> obviously<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> same

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
white one which is obviously the same

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.610 
white one which is obviously the same
one<00:02:13.110> but

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
one but

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:26.059 
one but
wait<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.890> take<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.940> out<00:02:24.709> let's<00:02:25.709> see<00:02:25.890> how

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
easy it is to take it out from the case

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.210
