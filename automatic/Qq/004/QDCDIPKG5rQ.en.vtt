00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
weird reason it wasn't working because I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.039 
weird reason it wasn't working because I
was<00:01:40.290> lagging<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.549> does<00:01:41.759> work<00:01:41.899> but<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.020> does

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
was lagging but it does work but it does

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.719 
was lagging but it does work but it does
work<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.220> happened<00:01:44.579> just

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
work I think what just happened just

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.969 
work I think what just happened just
there<00:01:44.970> was<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.930> accidentally<00:01:46.380> shot<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.190 
there was I accidentally shot that
carriage<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.390> carriage<00:01:48.869> killed

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
carriage and that carriage killed

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
carriage and that carriage killed
someone<00:01:49.590> running<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.100> me<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:51.119> carriage

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
someone running to me and that carriage

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.260 
someone running to me and that carriage
also<00:01:51.840> killed<00:01:52.049> me<00:01:52.229> oh<00:01:52.530> my<00:01:53.220> gosh<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:54.030> a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.500 
about it's about killing people but this
map<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.680> basically<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.940> don't<00:02:21.180> know<00:02:21.360> how

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
map is basically like a I don't know how

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.020 
map is basically like a I don't know how
you<00:02:21.540> said<00:02:21.780> ideological<00:02:22.680> type<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.489> experiment

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
you said ideological type of experiment

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.220 
you said ideological type of experiment
so<00:02:24.299> they're<00:02:24.450> kind<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.599> like<00:02:24.720> digging<00:02:24.989> around

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
so they're kind of like digging around

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.070 
so they're kind of like digging around
this<00:02:25.440> area<00:02:25.739> on<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.250> map<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.790> basically<00:02:27.780> they

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
this area on this map and basically they

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.630 
this area on this map and basically they
found<00:02:28.319> aliens<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:28.920> stuff<00:02:29.099> this<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.430> why

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
found aliens and stuff this is why

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.490 
found aliens and stuff this is why
there's<00:02:30.180> all<00:02:30.450> these<00:02:30.569> like<00:02:30.780> weird<00:02:30.989> alien

easter egg DLCs and all that it's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.770 
easter egg DLCs and all that it's
because<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:34.670> how<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.730> map<00:02:35.970> was<00:02:36.150> made<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.599> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
because of how the map was made like a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.600 
because of how the map was made like a
geological<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.560> if<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.980> don't<00:02:38.130> know<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.489> is

reload but as you see this map is quite

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.100

cool<00:04:03.340> it's<00:04:03.550> very<00:04:03.580> small<00:04:04.090> as<00:04:04.300> I<00:04:04.840> said<00:04:04.900> before

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
they tried to make the maps more

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.690 
they tried to make the maps more
fast-paced<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.920> be<00:04:09.010> honest<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.370> think<00:04:09.430> they

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
fast-paced and to be honest I think they

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.580 
fast-paced and to be honest I think they
nailed<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.120> down<00:04:10.270> pretty<00:04:10.540> well<00:04:10.780> because<00:04:11.290> the

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
nailed it down pretty well because the

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.350 
nailed it down pretty well because the
