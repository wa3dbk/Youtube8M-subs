00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.669
 It is a very simple gift but to look 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.340
 it also seems that it is very tender has not 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.290

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.550
 do so well I'll show you me 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.370
 the first thing we all go to the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.860
 letter that I did tells you with cuts 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.860
 of magazines this is the cover 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.239
 and now we open it 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.239
 wait 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.970

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.800

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.470

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.180
 sister and talking about sisters my 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.060
 this little sister finished this letter 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.670
 it seems to me beautiful call if it is not 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.840
 divine colored I think that better than 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.640

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.370

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.890
 what are these cookies the data of 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:37.480
 heart and there I bring you with chocolate and 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.510
 if you can realize all 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.250
 this is me today this is the one and they have their 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.330
 little eyes 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.770
 he has a sick little bear and they are 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.450
 giving a peak 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.369
 so 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.369
 here I let you see them closer 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.260
 I know it's not like that divide then 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.810
 have to comment cookies to me 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.310
 boyfriend fascinated him then I decided to 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.280
 do them because I think they are edition 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.660
 Limited and good, they were not as I thought 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.900
 that they were going to stay there will be more and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.240
 perfect divine but well there more or 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.209
 least I tried I know that you are going to 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.450
 be much more beautiful so that's 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.459
 all hope you like and continue watching 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.530
 to enter the dish I'm 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.470
 using a little piece of bread and what 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.030
 I wrapped in that silver paper now 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.250
 let's see check out our chocolate bar 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.730
 I'm using a mix already 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.240
 melted you're going to take your gold and you're going 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.180
 to put in the chocolate 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.760
 you will turn them until all 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.340
 white chocolate covered 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.310
 I thought that they will be perfect but 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.230
 not if they have any other way to 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.569
 wrap it so they look pretty 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.129
 count in the comments 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.189
 Now he will submit it to the freezer and 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.159
 while we wait we are going to put the 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:08.530
 eyes like caritas I'm using 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.170
 two jett bubbles 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.600
 with a toothpick you're going to help you and you're going to 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.930
 fix the eyes and there are the 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.930
 little eyes 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.989
 now that they are frozen because they are not 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.359
 frozen and the chocolate dried up you're going to 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.260
 remove with a knife those bits 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.209
 of chocolate and there are the bubbles 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.609
 they are on a spoon so they do not 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.500
 move so easy now with another little 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:39.230
 of melted chocolate you're going to put it in 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.230
 half for the bubbles to stick 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.070
 now you are going to put them 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.329
 and when they dry, you will be able to 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.700
 decorate them as you want me to 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.150
 use chocolate coffee as not coffee 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.549
 milk 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.510
 and there I made little hearts, I made them with 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.010
 chopsticks 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.280
 today they will be able to see how I am doing 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.860
 making their hearts are like 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.860
 misshapen but good 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.909
 and there you can see it from afar 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.150
 now you are going to take a cycle sachet 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.920
 with what you have and you are going to cut her 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.440
 puntita 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.950
 and you're going to put the melted chocolate in there 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:34.390
 and write what you want 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.390
 I'm going to decorate the plate 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.800
