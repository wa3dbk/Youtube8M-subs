00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
trouble with it but never mind we'll see

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.349 
trouble with it but never mind we'll see
how<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.049> goes<00:00:16.910> okay<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.980> he<00:00:20.699> doesn't<00:00:21.029> hit<00:00:21.180> for

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
how this goes okay so he doesn't hit for

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.300 
how this goes okay so he doesn't hit for
a<00:00:21.390> great<00:00:21.600> deal<00:00:21.810> he<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.470> about<00:00:22.680> 7k

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.880 
it did approximately 50 K damage which
to<00:00:39.000> most<00:00:39.210> people<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.469> very

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
to most people is going to be very very

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.850 
to most people is going to be very very
painful<00:00:42.230> but<00:00:44.120> yeah<00:00:45.120> hehe<00:00:45.870> apart<00:00:46.379> from<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.620> he

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
painful but yeah hehe apart from that he

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.910 
painful but yeah hehe apart from that he
really<00:00:47.219> doesn't<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> lot<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> damage<00:00:48.920> if

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
really doesn't do a lot of damage if

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160 
really doesn't do a lot of damage if
you're<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> tank<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.789> anything<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.930> decent

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

you're a tank or anything with a decent
amount<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.649> self-sustained<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.610> healing<00:00:54.000> then

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
amount of self-sustained or healing then

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.400 
amount of self-sustained or healing then
it<00:00:54.660> should<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.199> no<00:00:55.559> worries<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:57.079> okay<00:00:58.079> at

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
least we'll get to see if it's a hundred

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.100 
least we'll get to see if it's a hundred
percent<00:01:00.059> chance<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.320> elixir<00:01:01.500> strong

going to say I'll try get hit by it just

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.990 
going to say I'll try get hit by it just
to<00:01:14.730> show<00:01:14.910> you<00:01:14.970> how<00:01:15.150> much<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.480> does<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.670> we'll

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to show you how much it does so we'll

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.600 
to show you how much it does so we'll

try get hit by the next one if he

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.230 
try get hit by the next one if he
doesn't<00:01:23.850> die<00:01:23.940> by<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.660> go

gray<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:11.110> that's<00:02:11.800> another<00:02:12.040> thing<00:02:12.280> which

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
gray so that's another thing which

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.900 
gray so that's another thing which
should<00:02:12.850> hopefully<00:02:13.090> be<00:02:13.390> changed<00:02:13.870> but<00:02:14.910> called

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
should hopefully be changed but called

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.270 
should hopefully be changed but called
the<00:02:16.000> blade<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:17.500> was<00:02:19.200> approximately<00:02:20.280> I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
the blade and that was approximately I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.500 
the blade and that was approximately I
have<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.670> look<00:02:21.760> back<00:02:21.940> at<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.150> video<00:02:22.360> actually

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
have to look back at the video actually

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.510 
have to look back at the video actually
but<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.140> can't<00:02:23.380> have<00:02:23.470> been<00:02:23.620> two<00:02:23.800> hours<00:02:23.830> for

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
but that can't have been two hours for

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.190 
but that can't have been two hours for
him<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.640> respawn<00:02:25.060> again<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:27.540> who<00:02:28.540> knows<00:02:28.720> maybe

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
him to respawn again so who knows maybe

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.800
