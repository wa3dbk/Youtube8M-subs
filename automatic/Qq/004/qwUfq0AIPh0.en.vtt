raid or something ok before eigen boo oh

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.490 
raid or something ok before eigen boo oh
yeah<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.950> was<00:02:45.220> right<00:02:45.610> i<00:02:45.640> guess<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:47.200> was

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
yeah this was right i guess so this was

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.460 
yeah this was right i guess so this was
the<00:02:47.530> decor<00:02:48.100> in<00:02:48.310> 10<00:02:48.519> grams<00:02:48.790> for<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.260> just

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
the decor in 10 grams for but it just

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.630 
the decor in 10 grams for but it just
became<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:51.040> legendary<00:02:51.700> engrams<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.920> for<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.340> i

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
became a legendary engrams so for that i

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.000 
became a legendary engrams so for that i
think<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:56.470> was<00:02:56.709> fine<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.239> many<00:02:58.269> ways<00:02:59.010> of

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
think it was fine in so many ways of

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.600
