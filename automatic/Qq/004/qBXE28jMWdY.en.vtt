00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.304
 "Gluten Free Diet: Separating Grain from Defamation" 

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:12.105
 A few years ago, the entire scientific community claimed 

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:16.004
 that a wheat protein called gluten can cause an adverse reaction 

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.871
 only in people with rare diseases such as celiac disease or wheat allergy. 

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:24.905
 However, in early 2013, scientists began to admit more 

00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:29.970
 that even patients without celiac disease may suffer from gluten or wheat susceptibility. 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.970
 The panel of experts finally agreed and now officially recognizes a total of three 

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:39.239
 gluten-related diagnoses: wheat allergy, celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.504
 How much of the population should avoid wheat? 

00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:50.187
 Only about one in 1000 people have wheat allergy, but nearly 1 in 100 can have celiac disease. 

00:00:50.187 --> 00:00:58.430
 It seems that celiac disease is on the rise, yet the likelihood that you get it 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.740
 as an American in that year, they are barely 1: 10,000. 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.897
 How many people suffer from wheat sensitivity? 

00:01:05.897 --> 00:01:12.584
 Our best current estimate is just over 1%. 

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:18.432
 But this, too, is theoretically the millions of people who can suffer from this problem for years. 

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:21.831
 In doing so, they would be helped by a simple diet. 

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:27.260
 However, this problem has been overlooked by the medical community, no one has helped people. 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.594
 Although gluten sensitivity is slowly beginning to be recognized by doctors, 

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:33.827
 we still do not know how it happens, or what amount of gluten they can tolerate. 

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.325
 We don't even know if it can be reversed or what complications it might be 

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:40.160
 time to bring if the patient does not follow a gluten-free diet. 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.820
 Given the lack of information, perhaps gluten-sensitive people should try 

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:47.090
 reassign him / her every year, 

00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:50.020
 to see if they are still causing them trouble. 

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:53.250
 The reason why doctors don't want people to keep a gluten-free diet without proven 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.510
 diagnosis is that for the 98% of people 

00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:00.670
 which gluten does not make trouble are wholemeal 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.040
 cereals, including those with gluten (wheat, barley, rye), a healthy food. 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.100
 Their consumption is associated with reduced 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.500
 risk of coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity and other chronic diseases. 

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:14.680
 It's like peanuts. Just because some people are allergic to them 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.300
 they should not be avoided by everyone. 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.730
 There is no evidence to suggest a gluten-free diet 

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:25.590
 it brings some significant benefits to the general population. 

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:30.380
 There is some evidence to suggest that a gluten-free diet may have an adverse effect 

00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:34.950
 on intestinal health in people without celiac disease, allergy or sensitivity to gluten or wheat. 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.420
 Talking about this study, she found that a month on a gluten-free diet 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.780
 may damage intestinal flora and immunity. 

00:02:41.783 --> 00:02:45.710
 Theoretically, people can endanger the gluten-free diet by overgrowth 

00:02:45.714 --> 00:02:49.380
 harmful bacteria in the intestines. Why? 

00:02:49.382 --> 00:02:53.180
 It is paradoxical, but it is the same ingredients that people do 

00:02:53.182 --> 00:02:57.380
 with wheat sensitivity problems - carbohydrates falling under the so-called FODMAP, specifically fructans. 

00:02:57.384 --> 00:02:59.500
 Fructans serve as prebiotics, feeding our beneficial intestinal bacteria. 

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:03.400
 Gluten itself in turn can strengthen the immune system. 

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:09.280
 In less than a week after the inclusion of gluten, there was a noticeable increase in NK cell activity. 

00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:14.670
 From this, a better body ability to fight cancer and viral infections can be deduced. 

00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:18.540
 High gluten bread improves triglyceride levels better 

00:03:18.547 --> 00:03:22.860
 than bread with normal gluten. 

00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:30.300
 Ironically, gluten itself may be one of the greatest threats to a gluten-free diet. 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.730
 By prescribing a gluten-free diet yourself, we will reduce the ability to recognize 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.690
 celiac disease, a more serious form of gluten intolerance. 

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:41.110
 The diagnosis of celiac disease is done by looking for signs of inflammation 

00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:43.620
 caused by gluten in people who experience the symptoms of celiac disease. 

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:47.430
 However, if people did not eat gluten very much, we do not need to recognize the disease. 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.190
 Therefore, in people suspected of celiac disease 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.130
 instead of a gluten-free diet they would have welcomed them if they ate a lot of gluten. 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.360
 I mean about 4-6 slices of plain bread a day, for at least one month. 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.530
 Then we will be able to diagnose the disease unambiguously. 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:08.530
 Why is it so important to have a formally diagnosed disease when we eat gluten-free? 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.560
 This is a hereditary disease, so if your family is to be tested, you will find it. 

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:19.760
 And more importantly, many people on gluten-free diet actually eat it. 

00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:24.320
 Even 20 particles per million can harm a person with celiac disease. 

00:04:24.324 --> 00:04:30.360
 Many people consciously consume some gluten on the supposedly gluten-free diet. 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.010
 Sometimes gluten contaminates gluten-free foods. 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.630
 So even foods labeled "gluten-free" may not be safe for celiac. 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.000
 That's why we need to know. 

00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:48.120
 The paradox expressed in the prominent medical journal is, 

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:51.350
 that there are many celiacs who do not know about their illness, 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.790
 and, at the same time, many people who do not have celiac disease, and yet have eliminated gluten from their lives. 

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:59.730
 This can be considered a public health farce.
