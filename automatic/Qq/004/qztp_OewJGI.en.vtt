 good afternoon today i want to do a review 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.480
 universal interior cleaner from 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.360
 Koh company means what we have means 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.510
 she is in two forms already finished 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.939
 concentrated agent 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.660
 concentrate I grow 1 to 5 here in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.449
 ordinary distilled water when i 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.390
 bought it for the first time for some reason 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.469
 the manager in the store did not offer here 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.140
 concentrate so I took it worth it 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.899
 they are the same but here it turns out 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.410
 roughly speaking five times more for the same 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.899
 the most money means today we will clean 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.840

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.360

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 nuances we need a brush is desirable 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.270
 tough pile rag means 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.780
 Well, in general, instead of rags desirable 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.020
 use water vacuum cleaner will be much 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.020
 more efficient 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.950
 we ended up on the whole process literally 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.950
 spent 4 minutes 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.700
