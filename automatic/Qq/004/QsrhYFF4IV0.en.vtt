00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.569
 Good day at the microphone Michael 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.670
 especially for stealing dot com today i 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.300
 tell you how to build a portal to hell and 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.040
 portal to the edge in Minecraft 1.8 version that 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.070
 Well let's start to build 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.949
 portal to hell we will need to get 14 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.720
 or ten pieces of obsidian obsidian 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.810
 get very easy we need to find 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.539
 cave fame then pour lava water and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.269
 we get obsidian obsidian can 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.329
 dig only with a diamond pick 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.829
 let's start building the portal in order 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.480
 to build a portal we need 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.920
 dig up four blocks it will 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.520
 foundation of our portal 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.120
 then another 4 blocks up this we will have 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 so let's say the wall of our portal and then 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.610
 make the roof that's all the portal is ready for us 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.559
 need to activate it with a cigarette lighter voila 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 everything works there is also a budget version 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.809
 this portal 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.949
 it is done very simply not 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.520
 corners are used that is all exactly 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.549
 also but without corners that is like this 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.760
 here here and this portal also 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.470
 works fine for him we 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.900
 used on two pieces of obsidian 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 less which is naturally better also 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.000
 new versions of Minecraft you can 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.220
 build a portal of any length or width 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.930
 that is, not or other heights rather 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.580
 For example, here is such a portal if you have 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.180
 there is a lot of obsidian then you can 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.009
 easy to do here 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.060
 high portal or let's say this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.250
 wide portal you can also calmly 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.759
 do that is you can do the portal 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.700
 any size but not less so let's say 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.680
 standard ie at least 10 blocks 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.619
 you still need this one 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.479
 portal well portal to hell is enough 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.189
 just now let's deal with the portal in 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.630
 edge to make a portal to the edge to you 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.399
 enjoy here are blocks you can 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.100
 find them in the decorative blocks section 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.930
 here they are portal in the end and then you 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.210
 will need u Conder which you can 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 find in section different 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.740
 immediately say that the portal to the edge to you 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.630
 survival cannot be built 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.880
 survival you have to find it but in 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.770
 creative you can build it 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.440
 independently so we do this 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:20.070
 the frame is pretty simple and then 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.410
 fill it with the eyes of ender and here 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.390
 there is such a feature or such a bug so 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.260
 let's say the games you will need to break one 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.080
 portal blog 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.060
 then put it again and voila 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.730
 only then the portal is activated too 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.710
 there is nothing difficult in principle here 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.540
 that's all, in principle, I told you how 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.970
 build a portal to hell how to build 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.860
 portal edge hope this information for 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.080
 you will be helpful and with you was mikhail 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.080
 good luck everyone all bye
