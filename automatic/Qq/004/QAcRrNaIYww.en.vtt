in<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.319> lesson<00:00:01.560> we'll<00:00:02.040> learn<00:00:02.340> how<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.669> create

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
in this lesson we'll learn how to create

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.190 
in this lesson we'll learn how to create
carpet<00:00:03.570> using<00:00:03.750> Maya<00:00:04.049> fur<00:00:04.710> here<00:00:05.520> we<00:00:05.640> have<00:00:05.790> this

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
carpet using Maya fur here we have this

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.900 
carpet using Maya fur here we have this
simple<00:00:07.200> plain<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.740> file<00:00:08.160> texture<00:00:08.580> attached

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
simple plain and file texture attached

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.970 
simple plain and file texture attached
to<00:00:09.090> it

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
to it

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.589 
to it
so<00:00:10.980> I'll<00:00:11.040> select<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.519> surface<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.150> then<00:00:12.480> I'll

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
so I'll select the surface and then I'll

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.039 
so I'll select the surface and then I'll
go<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.780> fur<00:00:13.110> attached<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.009> description<00:00:14.580> you

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
go to fur attached for description you

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.769 
go to fur attached for description you
okay<00:00:16.080> let's<00:00:16.770> increase<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.699> U<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.119> V<00:00:18.270> samples

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
okay let's increase the U and V samples

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.679 
okay let's increase the U and V samples
for<00:00:19.199> fur<00:00:19.710> feedback<00:00:20.930> right<00:00:22.250> 128<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.460> 128<00:00:23.910> with

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
for fur feedback right 128 and 128 with

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.940 
for fur feedback right 128 and 128 with
u1b

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
u1b

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.970 
u1b
okay

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.560 

all<00:00:32.550> right

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
all right

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.869 
all right
so<00:00:35.079> on<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.230> first<00:00:35.410> description<00:00:35.739> we<00:00:36.280> have<00:00:36.309> base

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
so on the first description we have base

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.910 
so on the first description we have base
color<00:00:37.179> and<00:00:37.269> tip<00:00:37.629> color<00:00:37.839> and<00:00:38.140> we<00:00:38.379> plug<00:00:38.649> in<00:00:38.800> the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
color and tip color and we plug in the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.799 
color and tip color and we plug in the
same<00:00:39.129> texture<00:00:39.579> that<00:00:39.969> we<00:00:40.210> attach<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.539> this

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
same texture that we attach to this

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.560 
same texture that we attach to this
plane<00:00:41.109> so<00:00:41.890> go<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.070> window<00:00:42.420> rendering<00:00:43.420> later

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
plane so go to window rendering later

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.369 
plane so go to window rendering later
hypershade<00:00:44.670> under<00:00:45.670> files<00:00:45.940> under<00:00:46.600> textures<00:00:47.140> we

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
hypershade under files under textures we

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.109 
hypershade under files under textures we
have<00:00:47.559> file<00:00:47.800> one<00:00:48.449> middle<00:00:49.449> Mouse<00:00:49.600> drag<00:00:49.629> it<00:00:50.170> over

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:51.119 
have file one middle Mouse drag it over

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:56.939 
have file one middle Mouse drag it over
base<00:00:52.119> color<00:00:52.479> and<00:00:53.219> tip<00:00:54.219> color<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.940> hit<00:00:55.570> bake<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
base color and tip color and hit bake to

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.329 
base color and tip color and hit bake to
bake<00:00:57.129> these<00:00:57.339> two<00:00:57.579> textures<00:00:58.079> okay<00:01:01.530> okay<00:01:02.530> so

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
bake these two textures okay okay so

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.990 
bake these two textures okay okay so
let's<00:01:03.519> start<00:01:03.789> with<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.479> density<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.899> 80,000

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:22.400 

okay<00:01:11.600> it's<00:01:13.190> legal<00:01:14.190> end

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.090 

went<00:01:23.410> off<00:01:23.860> point<00:01:24.340> to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:40.929 

okay<00:01:27.729> I<00:01:27.970> just<00:01:28.780> follow<00:01:29.560> attribute

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.059 

pull<00:01:41.450> out<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.189> 226<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:44.530> take<00:01:45.530> little<00:01:45.829> bit<00:01:45.950> of

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
pull out you 226 and take little bit of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:56.570 
pull out you 226 and take little bit of
tip<00:01:46.310> Club<00:01:49.719> Madrid<00:01:50.719> but<00:01:52.359> typical

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.690 

point<00:01:57.800> seven-five<00:01:59.630> okay<00:02:00.980> scroll<00:02:01.980> down<00:02:02.010> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
point seven-five okay scroll down and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:11.010 
point seven-five okay scroll down and
give<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.900> Scrabble

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:19.760 

five<00:02:11.760> okay<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.230> Scargill<00:02:14.230> frequency<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.010> age

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:46.010 

let's<00:02:20.580> take<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.820> quick<00:02:21.060> gander

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.620 

okay<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.430> our<00:02:47.550> output

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.310 

now<00:02:51.630> let's<00:02:51.840> adjust<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.560> detail<00:02:52.890> values<00:02:54.320> so

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
now let's adjust the detail values so

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.070 
now let's adjust the detail values so
it's<00:02:55.620> called<00:02:55.890> down<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.120> find<00:02:57.630> out<00:02:58.190> details

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
it's called down and find out details

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.490 
it's called down and find out details
give<00:03:01.080> them<00:03:01.440> some<00:03:02.120> length<00:03:03.120> wise<00:03:03.540> amplitude<00:03:04.380> of

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
give them some length wise amplitude of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.620 
give them some length wise amplitude of
point<00:03:04.800> zero<00:03:04.890> eight<00:03:06.680> also<00:03:07.680> set<00:03:08.370> follow<00:03:09.030> miles

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
point zero eight also set follow miles

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.570 
point zero eight also set follow miles
amplitude<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:11.270> 1:06

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
amplitude to 1:06

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:21.800 
amplitude to 1:06
ticka<00:03:14.580> ticka<00:03:18.650> point<00:03:19.650> four

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
ticka ticka point four

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.020 
ticka ticka point four
okay<00:03:22.880> it's<00:03:23.880> kragle

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.850 

so<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.720> schedule<00:03:28.020> -<00:03:28.470> one<00:03:29.310> time

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.340 

let's<00:03:32.730> crank<00:03:33.000> up<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.240> density<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.160> 100,000

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
let's crank up the density to 100,000

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:45.589 
let's crank up the density to 100,000
and<00:03:38.810> check<00:03:39.810> Devendra

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.679 

take<00:03:46.599> little<00:03:47.140> time<00:03:48.069> because<00:03:48.629> density<00:03:49.629> is

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
take little time because density is

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:58.120 
take little time because density is
quite<00:03:49.930> high<00:03:50.200> now

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.220 

okay<00:03:58.790> so<00:03:59.630> this<00:03:59.810> is<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.920> final<00:04:01.280> output<00:04:02.230> pretty

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
okay so this is the final output pretty

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.150 
okay so this is the final output pretty
simple<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.940> you<00:04:04.970> can<00:04:05.870> create<00:04:06.260> any<00:04:06.410> any<00:04:06.770> carpet

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
simple and you can create any any carpet

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.180 
simple and you can create any any carpet
using<00:04:07.640> this<00:04:07.790> technique
