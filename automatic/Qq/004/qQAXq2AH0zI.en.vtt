00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
into items into program create item we

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.710 
into items into program create item we
create<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> new<00:00:27.300> file<00:00:27.860> and<00:00:29.180> if<00:00:30.180> you<00:00:30.300> watch<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
create a new file and if you watch the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.069 
create a new file and if you watch the
previously<00:00:31.259> tutorial<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.399> will<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.730> how<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
previously tutorial you will know how to

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.920 
previously tutorial you will know how to
create<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.170> why<00:00:34.470> might<00:00:34.680> file<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.750> you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
create a why might file so if you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.119 
create a why might file so if you
haven't<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:37.829> easy<00:00:38.039> so<00:00:39.079> I<00:00:40.079> tipped<00:00:40.769> Y

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
haven't it's very easy so I tipped Y

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
haven't it's very easy so I tipped Y
melt<00:00:41.399> we're<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.239> call<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.050> save

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
melt we're going to call it and we save

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.610 
melt we're going to call it and we save
it<00:00:43.969> we<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.120> delete<00:00:45.359> this<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.260> now<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.410> got

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it we can delete this one so now we got

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.329 
it we can delete this one so now we got
the<00:00:46.859> blankie<00:00:48.050> yml<00:00:49.050> file<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.469> we're<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
the blankie yml file and we're going to

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.810 
the blankie yml file and we're going to
create<00:00:50.640> our<00:00:50.820> item<00:00:51.769> so<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:52.890> first<00:00:53.070> thing<00:00:53.280> we

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
create our item so the first thing we

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
create our item so the first thing we
type<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.269> the<00:00:54.600> CMD<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.670> command<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:58.320> setting

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
type is the CMD or command and setting

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.660 
type is the CMD or command and setting
name<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.609> we're<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> call<00:01:00.179> it<00:01:00.329> test<00:01:00.539> item

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
name so we're going to call it test item

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.530 
name so we're going to call it test item
and<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:02.940> two<00:01:03.239> spaces<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.519> ID<00:01:06.120> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and we do two spaces and we do ID and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.660 
and we do two spaces and we do ID and
the<00:01:07.020> ID<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.670> ID<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> item<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.550> all

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the ID is the ID of the item and we all

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.210 
the ID is the ID of the item and we all
know<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.060> 3<00:01:12.480> 1<00:01:12.660> 1<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> diamond<00:01:13.530> armor<00:01:13.800> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
know that 3 1 1 is a diamond armor so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.130 
know that 3 1 1 is a diamond armor so
let's<00:01:14.580> create<00:01:14.730> a<00:01:14.820> diamond<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.050> add

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
let's create a diamond on then we add

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.750 
let's create a diamond on then we add
data<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:18.120> data<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:19.100> is<00:01:20.100> used<00:01:20.400> by<00:01:20.550> some

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
data and the data is is used by some

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.630 
data and the data is is used by some
items<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.990> rule<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.740> example<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.430> data

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
items like a rule for example the data

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
items like a rule for example the data
is<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.120> color<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.480> the<00:01:24.570> wool<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.380> since

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
is the color of the wool but since

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.500 
is the color of the wool but since
diamond<00:01:26.310> armor<00:01:26.520> doesn't<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.910> an<00:01:27.000> adapter<00:01:27.360> we

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
diamond armor doesn't have an adapter we

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.180 
diamond armor doesn't have an adapter we
just<00:01:27.690> put<00:01:27.870> 0<00:01:28.080> oh<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:29.120> then<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:30.830> next<00:01:31.830> thing<00:01:31.980> up

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
just put 0 oh and then the next thing up

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.770 
just put 0 oh and then the next thing up
is<00:01:32.220> amount<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:34.220> we<00:01:35.220> put<00:01:35.610> 1<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:37.520> then<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.730> have

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
is amount and we put 1 and then we have

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.910 
is amount and we put 1 and then we have
display<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.910> items<00:01:42.420> title<00:01:42.920> so

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
to zero zero two and this will actually

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.660 
to zero zero two and this will actually
make<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.510> player<00:05:54.080> move<00:05:54.380> faster<00:05:54.770> if<00:05:54.980> we<00:05:55.160> do<00:05:55.310> -

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
make the player move faster if we do -

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.390

he<00:05:56.300> will<00:05:56.450> move<00:05:56.600> slower<00:05:56.900> but<00:05:57.560> we<00:05:57.740> since<00:05:58.130> this<00:05:58.250> is

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
he will move slower but we since this is

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.790
