00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.060
 the most common 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.800
 drivers make mistakes in winter 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.340
 particular parents of crossovers with full 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 driven 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.289
 sometimes people need all-wheel drive 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.410
 especially heart- wheel drive not 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.380
 constantly pseudo i.e. turn on 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.719
 connect and did not have time for flax connect 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 and should when reads but that is very 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.300
 dangerous thing because they are very 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.950
 insulting sometimes for something like dude 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.930
 okay 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.420
 feeling better of course 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.989
 and he can not catch up with him and the first 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.850
 error is this i can't catch it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.300
 giving helped but try to catch up with him 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.920
 from here it is developing a terrible 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.030
 the first second when I know from myself 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.299
 you under the knead 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.619
 four -wheel drive blind cool he cool 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.680
 feel confident before accelerates 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.860
 four -wheel drive is much better than 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.610
 monodrive 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.640
 especially well there than back as well, of course 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.850
 he brakes you all the laws 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.210
 here it is this it cannot be forgotten and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.619
 one more trouble what is she even common 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.390
 said more than that specifically full 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.280
 drive or crossover lies here and god 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.340
 backs like he does not sit and I do not know maybe 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.490
 they eat little by little that's why 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.380
 gaining he rides on will go 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.320
 a person who is too dense 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.470
 many thinks about his mulan arrow on 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.300
 he reached out well 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.540
 yes beauty and 1 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.550
 he passed he can a little more than 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.420
 ordinary SUV slightly more than 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:09.200
 normal crossover but still we already 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.750
 proved yes without insurance but you need either 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.440
 from the second one is not worth it to leave 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.690
 deep snow deep sand eat hug 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.730
 by work 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.230
 know send home this winter 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.460
 a car without a cable like any other 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.020
 without a good end of the guys without strong 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:33.260
 operators calluses hands 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.730
 guest peel is something real we can 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.790
 just leave the car somewhere in the field 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:43.460
 sooner or later and the crew you know such 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:46.160
 long walk can looking 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.910
 what will you need to run this time 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.890
 the year has come 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.710
 got used all right ok do you drink well 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.810
 ride somewhere already 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.270
 began to keep the distance even lift 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.160
 she is not serious about the world and understand what is there 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.310
 someone pressing in especially in the cork yes 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.670
 cool just pk slowed down the poster 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.140
 people started to keep their distance 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.480
 rebuild in advance because 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.310
 thanks in advance to slow down 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.930
 lower others before turning 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.360
 hope not even let have become 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.980
 cultured and then comes the moment 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.690
 those people who get high in winter 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.490
 they understand a second 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.590
 i'm cool i can i have a mod pilot 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.360
 what the full translation and he starts already 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.280
 they begin to dare 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.560
 especially it concerns drivers who 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.740
 drive first in their life land 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.260
 critical of yourself and now not 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.630
 up to actually evaluate yes that is 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.030
 the moment comes when people are sure 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.200
 in that i'm cool i can change 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.020
 tonsillitis. 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.090
 I have my super-wheel drive is the most 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.280
 important all-wheel drive and dicky winter is not 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.710
 scary so here it is not necessary here in 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.720
 this moment i would i be here 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.380
 would put someone nearby who would say 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.390
 no hurry no pepper no no 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.470
 just need to be careful 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.880
 like a burnt cake it happens then 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.390
 eat or not ready cake 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.610
 either burned that's good when it's 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.880
 pie can be made new and if this 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.880
 a life
