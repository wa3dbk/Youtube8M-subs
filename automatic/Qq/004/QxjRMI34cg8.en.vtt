apples apples are high in vitamin C

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
apples apples are high in vitamin C
vitamin<00:01:51.060> C<00:01:51.720> has<00:01:51.840> been<00:01:51.990> shown<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.500> reduce

vitamin C has been shown to reduce
inflammation<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.549> lot<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.939> anti-inflammatory

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
inflammation a lot of anti-inflammatory

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.420 
inflammation a lot of anti-inflammatory
supplements<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.470> contain<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> vitamin<00:01:56.189> C

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
supplements will contain a vitamin C

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.770 
supplements will contain a vitamin C
because<00:01:56.640> they<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> key<00:01:57.659> ingredient

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
because they know it's a key ingredient

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.859 
because they know it's a key ingredient
and<00:01:59.030> also<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> Apple<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.630> sweeten

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
and also the Apple is going to sweeten

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.819 
and also the Apple is going to sweeten
it<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.469> taste<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.740> lot

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
it up so it's going to taste a lot

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.300 
it up so it's going to taste a lot
better<00:02:01.890> -<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.299> got<00:02:03.530> celery<00:02:04.530> celery

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310

has a duh

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.399 
has a duh
I<00:02:06.479> think<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.899> called<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.079> fight<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
I think it's called a fight a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.949 
I think it's called a fight a
phytonutrient<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:09.030> let's<00:02:09.690> call<00:02:09.810> it

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
phytonutrient and it's on let's call it

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.080 
phytonutrient and it's on let's call it
luetin<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.489> might<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.730> pronouncing

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
luetin I think I might be pronouncing

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.740 
luetin I think I might be pronouncing
that<00:02:12.180> wrong<00:02:12.330> but

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
that wrong but

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.600 
that wrong but
it<00:02:13.020> basically<00:02:13.200> inhibits<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.430> co-main

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
it basically inhibits one of the co-main

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.450 
it basically inhibits one of the co-main
causes<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.450> inflammation<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.320> silver<00:02:17.280> hairs
