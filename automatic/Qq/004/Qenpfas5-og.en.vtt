00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.979

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.029
 no hassle 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.029
 which has not been up to now in the EU 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.019

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.899
 okay that you have already been shot 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.310
 I mean 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.310
 think 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 That's where I have to go to the next level 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.510
 yeah 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.510
 okay, I just wanted to move to the next level very fast 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.110
 that these 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.940
 it is that we are the last one 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.980
 Bechmann the first 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.980
 could be used 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 okay then I try the last time there 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540
 I mean that's not gonna be funny 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.050
 where I am now 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.050

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.830

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 So, who come as one half way 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.570
 it has to go now 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.800
 Pinault 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.150

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.100
 To make Bree Olson 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.250
 Organizer should have happened 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.250

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.329
 definitely something unexpected 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.579
 would 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.419
 Daun is also Norbert Haug 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.419
 they do not turn around at all 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.029
 right out there 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.659
 1 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.659
 It's really fun again 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.039
 Euro 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.069
 Nothing comes out of nothing 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.069
 has appointed as a comic version 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.160
 Billion euros 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 hang there 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.759
 I've got my own swamp but now I already have a hat 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.759
 brings her plan figured out how it could work 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.039
 I believe that I learn my absolute ass 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.549
 I think that's my absolute Kassel 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.819
 worse there is also what i need to play in this as well 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.029
 Georg and how do I get now 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.009
 stand there 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.299
 Beqiri so if there is not just everything that was yes 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.299
 for children 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.969
 there you have to turn so well that's very nice 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.429
 We did it. People are defeated Romas, but that does not mean that 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:04.669
 everyone around Zwolle that I'm getting much worse 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.309
 what is waiting for us now the product of all Germany 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.369
 all over 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.829
 not important to me 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.449
 Of course the pictures are 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.830
 I can do it but I do not enjoy it which one 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.710
 because what is true and what waits for me in there is nothing with joy 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.319
 to do 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.319
 that's just the absolute horror 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.020
 therefore could 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.020
 also bats 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.569
 I'll do it 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.099
 Nani do things 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.789
 Horst misfortune bats 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.789
 So they still give their lives 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.370
 from the hedgehog 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.370
 Here we go 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.539
 Sexually arresting August on time 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.860
 What is it 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.699
 Freighter Langeland 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:46.460
 okay people on you the offenders this opponent but not forever in power 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.569
 As he continues in the next episode I search new the next one 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.569
 checkpoint 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.389
 Of course the authenticity shimmers the mollusk I think the worst thing 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.389
 is 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:27.150
 Cerberus is one 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.150
 ahead 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.639
 the VERBIO my demand 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
 there again funny I mean many politicians the Co 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:01.999
 Arnold has 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.639
 especially trampling places I did not have to think now all wandered 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.639
 Front engine could drive over it 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.530
 okay people overcomes the next episode reps I'm percent 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:29.569
 In light of what I face, it's easy to get motivated 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:32.240
 So, what's good 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.230
 until the next episode
