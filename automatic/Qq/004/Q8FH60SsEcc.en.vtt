inside where the pronto body is we just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.899 
inside where the pronto body is we just
want<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.710> close<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.430> throttle<00:01:56.670> plate

be careful when you're disconnecting

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.970 
be careful when you're disconnecting
things<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.960> either<00:02:32.960> can<00:02:33.230> mark<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.620> or<00:02:33.770> just

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
things you either can mark it or just

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.680 
things you either can mark it or just
make<00:02:34.520> sure<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.730> know<00:02:34.760> where<00:02:35.120> there's<00:02:35.360> all<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
make sure you know where there's all the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:53.640 
make sure you know where there's all the
stuff<00:02:35.870> connects<00:02:36.110> back<00:02:36.290> up<00:02:36.440> to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.449 

okay<00:02:54.160> here<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:54.340> go<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.849> air<00:02:55.629> intake<00:02:56.459> right

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
okay here we go the air intake right

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.180 
okay here we go the air intake right
here<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.819> put<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> little<00:02:58.420> sliver<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.200> inlet

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
here I put a little sliver in the inlet

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.040 
here I put a little sliver in the inlet
so<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.760> gas<00:03:00.970> has<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.330> place<00:03:01.599> an<00:03:01.900> easy

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
so that the gas has a place an easy

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.259 
so that the gas has a place an easy
place<00:03:02.349> for<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.650> flow<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.760> actually<00:03:04.030> makes

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
place for it to flow it actually makes

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.180 
place for it to flow it actually makes
it<00:03:04.390> go<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:04.750> direction<00:03:04.930> which<00:03:05.769> is<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.129> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
it go in this direction which is in the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.960 
it go in this direction which is in the
bottle<00:03:06.640> body<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.930> engine<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.819> could

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
bottle body in the engine and you could

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
switch that we can use to maintain

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.090 
switch that we can use to maintain
maintenance<00:04:49.200> assistant<00:04:49.680> if<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.830> have<00:04:49.950> to

maintenance assistant if you have to

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.440 
maintenance assistant if you have to
mount<00:04:50.820> that<00:04:50.940> on<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.210> top<00:04:51.360> of<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.480> box<00:04:53.450> right

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
mount that on the top of the box right

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.150 
mount that on the top of the box right
here<00:04:54.660> we're<00:04:54.810> going<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.020> go<00:04:55.740> ahead<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.010> figure

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
here we're going to go ahead and figure

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.570 
here we're going to go ahead and figure
out<00:04:56.250> how<00:04:56.400> we're<00:04:56.520> gonna<00:04:56.640> mount<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:57.090> switch

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
out how we're gonna mount this switch

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.600 
out how we're gonna mount this switch
onto<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.670> 3-way<00:05:00.030> box<00:05:01.100> we<00:05:02.100> got<00:05:02.190> stuff<00:05:02.430> on<00:05:02.520> the

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
onto the 3-way box we got stuff on the

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.000 
onto the 3-way box we got stuff on the
inside<00:05:02.940> we<00:05:03.120> got<00:05:03.240> to<00:05:03.360> take<00:05:03.780> into<00:05:03.930> account<00:05:04.260> the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
inside we got to take into account the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.600 
inside we got to take into account the
play<00:05:05.250> so<00:05:05.310> this<00:05:05.640> would<00:05:05.790> be<00:05:05.850> sitting<00:05:06.060> like<00:05:06.240> this

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
play so this would be sitting like this

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
play so this would be sitting like this
so<00:05:08.610> it's<00:05:08.730> not<00:05:08.820> really<00:05:09.000> gonna<00:05:09.090> work<00:05:09.240> less<00:05:09.450> that

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
so it's not really gonna work less that

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.380 
so it's not really gonna work less that
we<00:05:09.810> wanted<00:05:09.990> over<00:05:10.200> on<00:05:10.290> this<00:05:10.380> side<00:05:11.000> obviously<00:05:12.000> I

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
we wanted over on this side obviously I

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:33.460 
we wanted over on this side obviously I
bring<00:05:12.570> for<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.780> right
