 ingredients 1 following two honey and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.430
 a little less than the half cup of 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.769
 oil will give about 15 more or more 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.109
 less 50 ml of oil 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.290

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:39.540
 cup of oil tea 1 tablespoon 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:44.190

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.660
 begin 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.410
 to start you put the two games 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.410
 on the indicator 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 People I 'm not breaking the egg apart 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.640
 in a bowl because I did that trick 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.619
 put in the water to know if 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.080
 it 's cool not then you already knew 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:18.570
 she was spoiled 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:22.970
 there will put the oil still tell me 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.970
 cup of milk tea 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.800
 do not need warm milk, we do not 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.320
 portrait of the environment a cup of tea 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.730
 milk and then you'll hit it very well 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.270
 15 minutes to avoid being smelled 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.270
 egg 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.590
 now that you've hit a few minutes 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.870
 and we are going to make the second clothes that are 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.020
 put the dry ingredients that 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:04.460
 mix then put here the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:06.800
 yeast the salt and the fresh river and to 100 grams 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.229
 grated cheese 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.370
 I think I forgot to mention the recipe. 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.720
 which will have grated cheese grass 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.090
 are 100 grams of grated Parmesan cheese 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.130
 have people start ball she also stays 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.390
 good that I'm absolutely delicious 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:32.030
 but I think that dog not only to make fun 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:35.690
 a road on it and now you're going 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.420
 add that little 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.280
 blender 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.709
 I did not hit the blender in the blender. 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.989
 people hitting the conscience is 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:49.130
 Another but you can hit game I 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:52.940
 I prefer to mix later with the average hand 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.330
 manually because of the yeast and 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.330
 mix well 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.290
 looking at all the ingredients 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.330
 this recipe is you can put it in the 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.000
 coke cups a pat of 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.420
 any place in it always paper and only 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.620
 iron or said choe and put 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.319
 in shape 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.930
 or you can put those forms of 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.260
 cake a hole in the middle she calls 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.930
 political music through a hood and me 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.120
 places for the sasha is more or less a 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.950
 30 minutes to propose but you keep giving 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.700
 a look when you start over now 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.090
 You can ever take away or in my case I will 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.579
 I'll make that machine to do 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:55.910
 Dough cheeses clean the dough and stir 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:04:06.940
 with us, I 'm fine 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:10.910
 the male and now there is only one form of pudding 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.489
 or the cases just marry or if you go 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.630
 doing those on that machine because 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.829
 who do not need us anymore, I found the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.720
 recipe is already 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.030
 already has enough noise not to 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.500
 stick it so now I'll have my mark 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.229
 I'll be back here now that I've left 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.470
 my pop cake machine warming a 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.570
 little they do not need this you can see 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.300
 and staying there unplanned does not need 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.940
 because everything already has cheese and no oil 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.590
 need not even stick cheese bread 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:48.789
 now you will simply fill the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.789
 the cavities 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:57.820
 is more than touch does not leave too empty 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.280
 but it also does not fill much because otherwise 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.300
 she will overflow 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:09.810
 it's more or less a spoon and a 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.810
 a little of these teaspoons 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.440
 in check everything and as soon as you finish 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.720
 I'm coming back here to show you 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.480
 You can see that I ended up exaggerating. 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.420
 leaked a little because of the injury 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:29.890
 I'm going to close now wait delay 15 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.420
 little times sometimes less to stay 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.400
 right little ball 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.830
 a tip is also that I did not do 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.620
 you want to avoid dirt you can 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.410
 put the idol is that mass in a band 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.410
 It is much easier to make confectionery. 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.390
 I did this and also formed dirt but not 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.980
 There's a problem, so I'll soon 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.190
 I 'm going to show you how it's that. 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:55.540
 are the cheese bread balls 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:58.570
 good now you take out when you candy them 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.150
 stay at the most brown - tan criterion 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.340
 It is at your discretion only excuse noisy 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.070
 I think he's already kind of noisy. 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.950
 today your dog, little tomcat 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:13.720
 We used to talk at the door so we did not 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:16.860
 There's a lot to do there, God. 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.420
 I put it I did not put it much 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.340
 he ended up leaking a little bit 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.660
 I did not put it much, it did not 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.180
 getting too round then you have to 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.770
 It was in between can not put 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.930
 much more is missing very little 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:33.880
 because if he gets a little annoying people I 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.470
 I'm going to make one more batch this time. 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.540
 the match in the ball round to 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.210
 show you guys but she does with your 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.340
 super cute little roundies do more 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.630
 an already back soon and let cool 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.190
 Little bit to play and show 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.910
 You how it stays inside is good already 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.430
 back 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:53.200
 and this is the end result of 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:56.230
 cheese can see that it stays round 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.710
 When you hit the amount it 's too much. 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:04.610
 pretty 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:07.580
 and inside also very soft and crispy 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.010
 outside and soft inside 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.230
 and you may be doing in the machine 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.270
 shock can do in the machine any 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.790
 which can make of a cake form of 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.650
 pudding with a hole in the middle anyway 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.960
 or in the family of empada everybody 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.450
 It looks wonderful, I hope you have 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:28.210

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:28.210
 recipe at home until the next key
