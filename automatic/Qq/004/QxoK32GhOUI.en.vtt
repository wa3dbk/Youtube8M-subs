00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
 Welcome to planet 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.090
 today we are going to make a spider for 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.599
 halloween for it we're going to need 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:14.889
 clean wool black pipes scissors 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.980
 glue mobile eyes and you have cardboard or 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:22.120
 fork the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.520
 to make a pompom is to take the wool and 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.980
 obie what can we do to get it out 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.170
 large with two cardboard circles that 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.140
 would do something like this or 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.789
 do it with a fork that we're going 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.710
 coiling and we would get a pompom more 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.650
 If you want to learn how to do 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.270
 a pompom you can click on the links of 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.780
 up here to learn how to make a 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 incredible a pompom 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.380
 with a fork 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.690
 when we already have the pompoms 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.940
 this would be done with the wheel with the 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.300
 like lang river and this done with a 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.240
 fork already depends on the size that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.850
 you want your spider to have one time 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 we have this we take the clean 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.400
 pipes 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.350
 You need not be the same of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.350
 same size more or less approximate 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.470
 and how the spider has eight legs 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.410
 we have picked four clean 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.390
 pipes and now we will do eight this 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.260
 it's longer we'll use it for 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.950
 roll it up 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.950
 A) Yes 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.070
 once we have gone around the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.260
 we separated as if it were a bar and a 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.190
 fan and so we will have the 8 legs of 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.220
 the spider 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.280
 we are going to give legs 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.670
 simply molding clean pipes 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.320
 bending in the corners down and 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.320
 pressing them down a bit 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.609
 depending on the surface we are going 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.479
 shape to the legs and we would have them 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.479
 now with the glue 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.310
 we would throw a little in the center 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.830
 and we would take our pompom in the part 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.030
 from below we combed it a little bit and what 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.030
 we would pay the legs 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.460
 and now to finish the spider we're going 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.680
 to stick some eyes as we told you 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.210
 if you have moving eyes for what 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.580
 do and if you can not do it with 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.920
 cardboard 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.220
 we drop a drop of glue on each 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.220
 eye 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.550
 and we will beat 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.840
 we paste 1 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.010
 and we would pay the other and we would have 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.210
 our terrifying spider who is going to 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.660
 dare now will enter you 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.660
 room 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.830
 you have a good watchman 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.480
 and here our craft today 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.480
