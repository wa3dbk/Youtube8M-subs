00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
they're just starting to notice that I

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.740 
they're just starting to notice that I
just<00:00:16.410> threw<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.710> there<00:00:17.090> so<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.420> guess

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
just threw it in there so you can guess

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.609 
just threw it in there so you can guess
what<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.260> quick<00:00:21.320> they<00:00:22.320> love<00:00:22.590> it

they<00:00:22.740> rip<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.160> apart<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.820> kind<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
they rip it apart it's kind of like a

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.450 
they rip it apart it's kind of like a
activity<00:00:25.289> forum<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.099> they<00:00:26.189> get<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
activity forum and then they get the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.880 
activity forum and then they get the
food<00:00:26.640> inside<00:00:29.840> it's<00:00:30.840> actually<00:00:31.289> just

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.180

oatmeal and you can pretty much get any
type<00:00:39.460> its<00:00:40.030> I'm<00:00:40.360> guessing<00:00:40.750> it's<00:00:40.870> just<00:00:41.140> fine<00:00:41.410> for

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710

brand or anything and then it's just
kind<00:00:52.540> of<00:00:52.570> like<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.750> fun<00:00:53.019> little<00:00:53.140> thing<00:00:53.290> for<00:00:53.680> them

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
kind of like a fun little thing for them

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:03.819 
kind of like a fun little thing for them
they<00:00:54.220> rip<00:00:54.400> it<00:00:54.519> open<00:00:54.610> they<00:00:54.970> get<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.239> food

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.399 

I<00:01:03.890> got<00:01:04.549> apple<00:01:04.879> cinnamon<00:01:05.239> this<00:01:05.420> time<00:01:05.689> usually<00:01:06.200> i

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
I got apple cinnamon this time usually i

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.249 
I got apple cinnamon this time usually i
buy<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.360> plane<00:01:08.360> stuff<00:01:08.750> because<00:01:09.020> then<00:01:09.170> it

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
buy the plane stuff because then it

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:10.960 
buy the plane stuff because then it
doesn't<00:01:09.409> have<00:01:09.590> any<00:01:09.740> flavoring<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:10.430> there

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
doesn't have any flavoring and there

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.490 
doesn't have any flavoring and there
which<00:01:11.450> is<00:01:11.479> probably<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.990> little<00:01:12.110> bit<00:01:12.290> better

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
which is probably a little bit better

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.410 
which is probably a little bit better
for<00:01:12.799> them<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.670> I'd<00:01:13.759> recommend<00:01:13.850> getting<00:01:14.210> the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
for them so I'd recommend getting the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.760 
for them so I'd recommend getting the
plane<00:01:14.659> stuff<00:01:15.020> if<00:01:15.170> you're<00:01:15.259> going<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.470> do<00:01:15.619> this

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
plane stuff if you're going to do this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.980 
plane stuff if you're going to do this
but<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.909> flavoring<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.450> probably<00:01:17.720> not<00:01:17.840> going

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
but the flavoring is probably not going

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:28.649 
but the flavoring is probably not going
to<00:01:18.080> hurt<00:01:18.229> them

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659
