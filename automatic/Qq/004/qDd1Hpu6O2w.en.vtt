00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.100
 Pretty much everyone knows them from the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.040
 Past time she smokes and rattles 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.470
 offered space for two people the simson 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.600
 swallow built with a small one 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.880
 internal combustion engine since the middle of the 60s 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.950
 years she stands in the ddr for the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.470
 upswing in East German two wheel construction 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.720
 even after the turn conquers the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.150
 Scooter many fan hearts and enjoys the 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.489
 same status as a beetle or the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.039
 vespa scooter and now she is in the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.249
 arrived in the future for the middle of the year 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.749
 Should you start the electric swallow 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:42.489
 this swallow is not here yet 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.989
 now no motor in it finished 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.920
 this is a design model 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.829
 swallow look like 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.850
 the prototypes are already running for the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.409
 will not measure prototypes 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.960
 used because the currently quite 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.190
 just for the homologation 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 the series production is needed 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.059
 should start at the end of may 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.760
 right now is the development of 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.649
 swallow at the company in resident of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.500
 I'm still in the final stage behind 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.090
 development will be practical and from may on 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.369
 then the first models produced and 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.979
 to the individual dealers Schwalbe 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.030
 sales partner shipped so that 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.729
 the end customer finally from june / july 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.420
 with the first models to buy 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.770
 can count 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.250
 The swallow will be in three different 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.659
 Configurations produces that means we 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.399
 once have a final speed of 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.250
 25 km / h we have one 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.270
 final speed of 45 km / h and in 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.619
 at the third level we have one 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.359
 end speed of 80 km h so the 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.299
 Schwalbe becomes one 20 years ago 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:45.609
 bring a lot of fun to the drivers 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.429
 so the price is still there 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:51.130
 no specification from the manufacturer 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.999
 performance data is expected to be so 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.439
 a swallow between 4000 and 5000 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.719
 have a lot of power so 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.490
 fast enough as it used to be quickly 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.319
 to drive through the city and overland 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.869
 The range of the swallow is 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.050
 expected between 60 and 200 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.210
 kilometer with a battery we have 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.010
 here simply the possibility the 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.640
 to increase battery performance by going to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.250
 example still 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.569
 further battery in addition series battery in addition 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.390
 can stick and thus you can his 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.010
 expand this performance accordingly 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.550
 luggage rack comes from an original 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.569
 Swallow good to recognize again very much 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.970
 beautifully restored 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.470
 so as a small reminiscence he will 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.170
 probably in this form at the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.600
 new e swallow not standard 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.740
 it is a true-to-life 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.720
 swallow 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.310
 I can say that in any case 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.790
 Of course she has a lot 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.590
 more modern line guidance and design 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.690
 is simply the time of today 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.670
 owed something because it is not a motor 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.350
 in the sense no gasoline month in it 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.239
 but we have electric motors in it 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.010
 we have batteries in the disc installed 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.450
 this has also broadened a bit 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.760
 We have recently been to a conference 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.470
 together with the manufacturer the vehicle 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.310
 presented and found there 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.720
 So there are citizens in the age of 70 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.670
 Years of getting watery 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.840
 eyes because the 20 years ago practically 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.940
 with the swallow still on the way every day 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.380
 were and the slice is today 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.640
 still in traffic but it will be 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.600
 but more and more rare and here you can see 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.540
 now the next one 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.350
 evolutionary stage away from gasoline towards 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.350
