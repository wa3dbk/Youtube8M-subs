00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.450 
what I'm doing I like to copy my
background<00:00:31.500> layer<00:00:31.650> because<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.369> never

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
background layer because you never

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.889 
background layer because you never
really<00:00:32.730> want<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> touch<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.090> because<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
really want to touch it because if you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.150 
really want to touch it because if you
mess<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.380> don't<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.590> what<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.829> did<00:00:34.950> you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
mess up or don't like what you did you

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
mess up or don't like what you did you
can<00:00:35.309> always<00:00:35.520> go<00:00:35.640> back<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.870> original

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
can always go back and the original

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.560 
can always go back and the original
where<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> started<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.239> you<00:00:39.239> never<00:00:39.390> want<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
where you started and you never want to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.690 
where you started and you never want to
lose<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.309> we're<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> do

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
lose that so what we're going to do

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.900 
lose that so what we're going to do
first<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.530> we're<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> make<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.520> new<00:00:44.730> layer

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
first is we're going to make a new layer

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.610 
first is we're going to make a new layer
and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.510> choose<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.930> color<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.559> I'm

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and then choose the color and I'm

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.080 
and then choose the color and I'm
probably<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.850> choose<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
probably I'm just going to choose a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.950 
probably I'm just going to choose a
green<00:00:49.039> like<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.129> darkish<00:00:50.460> kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.789> green<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.660> ok

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
green like a darkish kind of green it ok

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.290 
green like a darkish kind of green it ok
make<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> your<00:00:53.070> brush<00:00:53.280> tool<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.579> zoom<00:00:53.879> in

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
make it your brush tool and zoom in

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.689 
make it your brush tool and zoom in
close<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:54.989> there's<00:00:55.949> always<00:00:56.160> room<00:00:56.399> for

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
close because there's always room for

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.479 
close because there's always room for
error<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.690> nobody's<00:00:58.140> perfect<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.770> my

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
error because nobody's perfect and my

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.860 
error because nobody's perfect and my
computer's<00:00:59.879> lagging<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.270> bit<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.750> this

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
computer's lagging a little bit so this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.139 
computer's lagging a little bit so this
may<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.199> bit<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.850> have

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
may be a little bit off because I have

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.300 
may be a little bit off because I have
Camtasia<00:01:03.979> running<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:09.619> yeah<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:10.950> see

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
Camtasia running on it and yeah I'm see

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.260 
Camtasia running on it and yeah I'm see
how<00:01:11.400> i'm<00:01:11.490> getting<00:01:11.610> i'm<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.909> doing<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
how i'm getting i'm not doing it

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.510 
how i'm getting i'm not doing it
perfectly<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.979> don't<00:01:14.130> really<00:01:14.280> need

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
perfectly because you don't really need

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.420 
perfectly because you don't really need
to<00:01:15.170> this<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.650> close<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> ass

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
to this is a really close up of the ass

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
to this is a really close up of the ass
so<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.420> imperfections<00:01:19.080> better<00:01:19.320> but

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so you can see imperfections better but

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190 
so you can see imperfections better but
if<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:20.009> doing<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.540> actual

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
if you're doing a little like of actual

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
if you're doing a little like of actual
picture<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.830> somebody<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.250> actually

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
picture of somebody that's actually

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030 
picture of somebody that's actually
standing<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.409> big<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.920> deal

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
standing up it's not that big of a deal

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
standing up it's not that big of a deal
don't<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.600> they're<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.930> be

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
don't have it they're not going to be

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.780 
don't have it they're not going to be
zooming<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> focal

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
zooming in on it and it's not a focal

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.420 
zooming in on it and it's not a focal
point<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.750> um<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.130> make<00:01:32.250> sure

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
point but um you just make sure

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.100 
point but um you just make sure
everything<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.090> whole<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> color<00:01:34.020> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
everything the whole I that you color it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.730 
everything the whole I that you color it
is<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.159> color<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.610> decide<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:37.200> then

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
is the color that you decide and then

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.760 
is the color that you decide and then
you<00:01:38.159> zoom<00:01:38.340> back<00:01:38.460> out<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.909> you're<00:01:39.659> done<00:01:40.850> now<00:01:41.850> um

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
you zoom back out and you're done now um

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.429 
you zoom back out and you're done now um

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
thumbnail delay the color you just chose

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
thumbnail delay the color you just chose
for<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> eye<00:01:49.610> then<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.729> going<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> click

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
for the eye then you're going to click

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.170 
for the eye then you're going to click
layer<00:01:51.479> 1<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.640> something<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.119> do

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
layer 1 and this is just something I do

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.020 
layer 1 and this is just something I do
because<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.079> want<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.259> make<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:56.030> black

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
because you want to make it on a black

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.420 
because you want to make it on a black
and<00:01:57.390> white<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:58.320> color<00:01:58.500> they<00:01:58.799> blend<00:01:59.040> best<00:01:59.250> with

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
and white the color they blend best with

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.940 
and white the color they blend best with
black<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.820> white<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.110> original

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
black and white and so the original

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.310 
black and white and so the original
color<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> odd<00:02:02.369> doesn't<00:02:02.579> affect<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.659> outcome

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
color the odd doesn't affect the outcome

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.499 
color the odd doesn't affect the outcome
of<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.619> color<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.280> coming<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.909> and

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
of the color that is coming out and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419 
of the color that is coming out and
you're<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> layer<00:02:07.020> via<00:02:07.350> copy<00:02:07.429> your

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
you're going to layer via copy your

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.619 
you're going to layer via copy your
might<00:02:08.580> click<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> selection<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.390> layer<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
might click the selection a layer of

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.440 
might click the selection a layer of
your<00:02:09.840> copy<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.340> ends<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.910> layer<00:02:12.120> by

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
your copy so it ends up on this layer by

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.640 
your copy so it ends up on this layer by
itself<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
itself and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.589 
itself and
and<00:02:13.739> you're<00:02:14.370> going<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.519> desaturate<00:02:14.879> this

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and you're going to desaturate this

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.460 
and you're going to desaturate this
layer<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:17.579> new<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.239> this<00:02:18.870> changes<00:02:19.349> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
layer of the new I and this changes it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.170 
layer of the new I and this changes it
to<00:02:19.500> black<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.980> white<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.489> can<00:02:20.819> get<00:02:21.030> that

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
to black and white so you can get that

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.449 
to black and white so you can get that
better<00:02:21.420> flow<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.079> you're<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.189> change

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
better flow and you're going to change

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.009 
better flow and you're going to change
the<00:02:23.640> blend<00:02:23.879> mode<00:02:23.939> of<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.450> layer<00:02:24.629> with<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
the blend mode of the layer with the

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.850 
the blend mode of the layer with the
color<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.980> eye<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:27.569> overlay<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> blends

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
color of the eye to overlay so it blends

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.390 
color of the eye to overlay so it blends
with<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.989> then<00:02:30.989> you're<00:02:31.170> gonna<00:02:31.400> just

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
with it and then you're gonna just

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.920 
with it and then you're gonna just
change<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.000> opacity<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.890> think<00:02:35.930> it

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
change the opacity of it and I think it

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.530 
change the opacity of it and I think it
looks<00:02:36.959> realistic<00:02:37.379> around<00:02:37.859> I<00:02:38.040> mean<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:39.390> just

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
looks realistic around I mean you just

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.910 
looks realistic around I mean you just
don't<00:02:39.599> want<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.900> too<00:02:40.019> bright<00:02:40.319> or<00:02:40.530> too<00:02:40.560> dokes

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
don't want it too bright or too dokes

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.190 
don't want it too bright or too dokes
that<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.340> looks<00:02:41.579> just<00:02:41.939> fake<00:02:42.629> I<00:02:42.840> mean<00:02:42.989> anywhere

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that it looks just fake I mean anywhere

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.830 
that it looks just fake I mean anywhere
between<00:02:43.439> it<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.099> mean<00:02:45.680> 75<00:02:46.680> would<00:02:47.099> be<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> max<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
between it I mean 75 would be a max and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.500 
between it I mean 75 would be a max and
then<00:02:49.079> prob<00:02:49.620> about<00:02:49.799> 25<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> be<00:02:50.489> at<00:02:50.609> maksimir

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
then prob about 25 a be at maksimir

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.170 
then prob about 25 a be at maksimir
between<00:02:51.780> 75<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.200> 25<00:02:52.709> would<00:02:52.859> be<00:02:52.950> good<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:53.400> let

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
between 75 and 25 would be good so let

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.119 
between 75 and 25 would be good so let
me<00:02:54.269> just<00:02:54.420> keep<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.750> at<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:54.930> 50<00:02:55.709> or<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.010> and

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
me just keep it at like 50 or so and

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.729 
me just keep it at like 50 or so and
it'd<00:02:56.250> be<00:02:56.310> probably<00:02:56.489> be<00:02:56.639> good<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.750> um<00:02:57.930> that's

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
it'd be probably be good and um that's

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.030 
it'd be probably be good and um that's
pretty<00:02:59.069> much<00:02:59.159> it<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.519> mean<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:01.590> there's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
pretty much it I mean you there's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.649 
pretty much it I mean you there's
there's<00:03:02.459> your<00:03:02.609> before<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.299> there's<00:03:03.480> you're

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
there's your before and there's you're

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.240 
there's your before and there's you're
after<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.109> they<00:03:04.230> look<00:03:04.409> pretty<00:03:04.620> pretty<00:03:05.040> good

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
after and they look pretty pretty good

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.860 
after and they look pretty pretty good
and<00:03:05.639> if<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.849> have<00:03:05.970> any<00:03:06.090> ideas<00:03:06.359> just<00:03:06.540> let<00:03:06.780> me

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and if you have any ideas just let me

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
know on tutorials and that's about it

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.979 
know on tutorials and that's about it
then<00:03:10.189> I'm<00:03:11.189> calling<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.549> out<00:03:11.639> on<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:11.909> one

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989
