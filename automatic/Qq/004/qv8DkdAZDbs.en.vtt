00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.650
 Welcome back to one 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.149
 another pb preview video and I show 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.700
 this time you will be the new game mode 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.379
 namely the team is the yes there 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.299
 a little longer at the first 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.639
 Unfortunately, I was not there in the test phase 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.859
 therefore a little late but better 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.180
 than never the team pictures you will find completely 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.210
 normal if you press on top of play 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 then at pvp classic collector's rift 5 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.750
 against 5 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.130
 and here game team then you have fancy 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.230
 as always the possibility either you 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.150
 to register alone or friends before 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.340
 to invite if you invite friends 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.320
 you are after and the chef from the team 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.760
 Of course we will register solo here 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 and then you have the opportunity to be 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 champion or man 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.050
 must choose his champion 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.520
 Of course you can take everything 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 Of course, it's not like 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.120
 We also live here and then 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.620
 we still have the possibilities skin 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.000
 Unfortunately, none have 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.949
 is and therefore I take the classics 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.829
 but you can do it here on everyone 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.629
 case already do if we choose ours 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.030
 We must have met next 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.280
 set our position here so 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.140
 either top middle anyway or jungle 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.670
 in fact we can choose what we are 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.130
 we do not want them on somehow 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 a meter therefore I go 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.370
 but right down to the bottom 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.020
 line as a supporter that really shows 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.090
 also important here with position and role 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.760
 because that is our wait time afterwards 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.230
 defined role apropos here becomes us 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.100
 Of course, proposed armchairs with the 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.510
 little stars 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.240
 but here too we can theoretically 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.950
 take everything are relevant position and 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 Incidentally, this is mainly due to the fact that 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.010
 when we have found the team 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.450
 Team leader knows what we are planning to do what we do 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.830
 want to do and then he has the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 possibility to either say okay 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.670
 We need someone like you or stop 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.020
 not when we are ready, we have 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.940
 still the possibility summoner magic 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.320
 to choose rest and championships in the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.730
 Contrast to the other stuff is that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.200
 He really is not final 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.940
 we can just team up later 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.860
 change from that we just look for them 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.570
 a group and then we can really 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.930
 first the new beautiful music too 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.930
 listen to 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.500
 thanks to the magic of video editing 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.030
 we also have a team here directly 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.260
 found and then just have to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.819
 nor the invitation only times assume 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.920
 so that we are not on k , of course 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.489
 after that we also land directly in the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.140
 team 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.010
 and here we have as before 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.840
 mentions the possibility again 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.190
 conjuror spell rest and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.049
 to adapt championships 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.220
 otherwise we can of course first 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.840
 Watch the team where we are here at all 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.459
 landed at the top is the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.799
 team leader that it is longer in the jungle 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.269
 when it's in the top lane we call 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.459
 and she wants to be the father 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.290
 in the middle viktor as a magician and 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.750
 our hd carey we are currently looking for 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.790
 still at the bottom, of course, we ourselves 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.290
 supporter we should now dissatisfied 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.849
 be with the team or the people 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.500
 prove here below right in the chat 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.239
 somehow as suboptimal 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.280
 then I can either down the left either 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.930
 completely abandoned team pictures or me 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.340
 Just leave the team country 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.620
 immediately back in the queue and 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.819
 I look for something new when we are satisfied with it 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.560
 but our team is called 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.940
 otherwise just wait until all 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.690
 places are occupied you can 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.010
 of course, with the people 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.569
 entertain what you have here so many 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.579
 tactics before and so on 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.349
 or you just use the moment around 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.120
 to go loo because the game is not working 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.319
 Let's go before you are ready for us 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.299
 have down there so a developed 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.069
 ready button we can really 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.079
 first activate or all 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.200
 You can only activate this when complete 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.220
 So five players in the team are me 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.560
 now sit only once a turn 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.790
 little thumb 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.380
 while I'm turning here at the BrÃ¼nnchen 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.000
 But I can give you some info 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.560
 First of all, the team will not make you 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.359
 somehow limit to the meter 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.889
 we have already seen as lok 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.480
 and every position and every role 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.280
 select and of course that applies to 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.200
 all other champions, too 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.790
 it just depends on the team boss of 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.620
 the team we land in with the one 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.930
 Start with us or not 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.669
 In addition, as far as the waiting loop is concerned 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.130
 first said clearly that that 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.810
 a separate enormous gamecube is where to go 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.310
 can register for example if you necessarily 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.359
 want to try the champion 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.970
 So here is a very nice one 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.319
 possibility for otherwise otherwise 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.329
 they also said that they were 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.560
 but keep that open as well 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.359
 maybe in raid mode too 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.090
 implement either complete or 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.859
 only in a certain way and of course 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.510
 not to forget the waiting times 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.040
 Please do not give her a big clue 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.180
 that it is on the pps he was here 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.950
 very few people on the way 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.180
 besides, it is pretty late where I am 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.250
 degree record will take so long 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.410
 everything a bit longer 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.820
 speaking of waiting 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.410
 together could really mean mine here 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.970
 blanket I mean meanwhile 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.739
 I'm not big picky anymore 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.770
 is completely no matter what one 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.050
 main thing I do not know where she is 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.370
 not the best, but he does not care 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.930
 He assumed he is in our team 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.300
 in there and now everyone can talk about the 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.220
 As soon as everybody is ready, you can do it 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.110
 also directly into the game and we come 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.370
 in the loading screen what me so 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.050
 I'm a bit surprised 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.460
 thought as soon as my opponent would have to 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.110
 they only confirm all again 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.060
 and press on accept but 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.620
 apparently could not do it of course 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.450
 because we are really instant here 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.920
 have found opponents and us shortly 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.940
 before with the reggae button yes as 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.760
 had agreed 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.080
 and so much for the expiration of the team builder 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.730
 from the loading screen here it is 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.040
 of course, a normal five against 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.630
 five collectors rift game and general 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.950
 to the new waiting loop I can only 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.690
 say I think nobody can 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.550
 complain or something has already been 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.780
 long desired by the community 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.710
 you really position yourself and roll 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.450
 can sign up 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.270
 so that there is no stress in the team afterwards 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.380
 There are somehow great games degenerate 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.000
 Personally, I am especially happy 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.320
 that's enough for me somehow 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.820
 on the meta restricts who more 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.200
 You can really see for everything 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.580
 sign up with every champion 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.410
 In addition, you can even actually 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.210
 Build teams where everyone goes to the center 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.860
 or three top 2 in the middle no 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.640
 jungle or double jungle and so 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.080
 on and on 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.330
 Here is really complete 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.770
 Of course, it can be left to team leaders 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.390
 take a while to join the team 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.250
 where I am also satisfied 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.660
 but ultimately with the experiences 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.250
 which I really have after a game 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.470
 something enriches and there is not 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.090
 more so much stress from me so much 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.440
 team if you have questions write 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.450
 in the comments I will tell you 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.890
 answer as best as possible and otherwise 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.850
 Thanks for seeing and see you in the 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.850
 next video thanks
