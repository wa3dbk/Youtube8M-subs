the bails vigorously and then screed it

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.520 
the bails vigorously and then screed it
off<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:19.489> brought<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:20.789> nice<00:04:21.090> finish<00:04:21.539> usually

off and brought to a nice finish usually
this<00:04:22.680> top<00:04:22.950> side<00:04:23.219> will<00:04:23.610> be<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.789> interior

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
this top side will be the interior

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.050 
this top side will be the interior
finish<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.260> wall<00:04:25.440> so<00:04:26.099> more<00:04:26.460> care<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.880> given

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
finish of the wall so more care is given

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.579 
finish of the wall so more care is given
in<00:04:27.479> traveling<00:04:27.990> out<00:04:28.110> that

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:28.589 
in traveling out that

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:31.639 
in traveling out that
to<00:04:29.459> give<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:29.849> finish<00:04:30.119> of<00:04:30.209> the<00:04:30.359> wall<00:04:30.539> the<00:04:31.319> idea

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:31.649 
to give the finish of the wall the idea

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:32.989 
to give the finish of the wall the idea
is<00:04:31.769> that<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:32.039> panels<00:04:32.369> can<00:04:32.549> be<00:04:32.609> brought<00:04:32.969> to

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:32.999 
is that the panels can be brought to

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.359 
is that the panels can be brought to
site<00:04:33.359> and<00:04:33.569> paint<00:04:34.379> it<00:04:34.529> directly<00:04:34.859> on<00:04:35.099> this

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:35.369 
site and paint it directly on this

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:36.859 
site and paint it directly on this
surface<00:04:35.759> so<00:04:35.789> the<00:04:36.089> finish<00:04:36.389> here<00:04:36.599> is<00:04:36.689> quite

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:36.869 
surface so the finish here is quite

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:39.019 
surface so the finish here is quite
important<00:04:37.409> although<00:04:38.039> if<00:04:38.369> you<00:04:38.459> wanted<00:04:38.789> to<00:04:38.909> do<00:04:38.999> a

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:39.029 
important although if you wanted to do a

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.079 
important although if you wanted to do a
skim<00:04:39.329> coat<00:04:39.359> on<00:04:39.659> site<00:04:39.929> you<00:04:40.259> would<00:04:40.349> need<00:04:40.589> to<00:04:41.089> hear

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:42.089 
skim coat on site you would need to hear

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:47.429 
the cured panels are brought to the site

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:49.639 
the cured panels are brought to the site
with<00:04:47.639> a<00:04:47.669> boom<00:04:47.879> truck<00:04:48.199> we<00:04:49.199> would<00:04:49.349> typically

with a boom truck we would typically
like<00:04:49.859> to<00:04:49.889> transport<00:04:50.549> them<00:04:50.699> in<00:04:50.789> an<00:04:50.909> upright

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:51.239 
like to transport them in an upright

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:53.029 
like to transport them in an upright
position<00:04:51.269> but<00:04:51.899> this<00:04:52.139> truck<00:04:52.379> couldn't<00:04:52.769> do<00:04:52.889> that

position but this truck couldn't do that
so<00:04:53.369> here<00:04:54.179> there<00:04:54.389> stood<00:04:54.659> up<00:04:54.839> and<00:04:55.049> brought<00:04:56.039> on<00:04:56.339> to

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
so here there stood up and brought on to

whole process for this house took about

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.149 
whole process for this house took about
two<00:05:03.539> two<00:05:03.809> and<00:05:03.839> a<00:05:03.989> half<00:05:04.139> hours<00:05:04.529> to<00:05:04.679> place<00:05:04.889> all

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:07.529 
the walls as you can see they go

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.889 
the walls as you can see they go
directly<00:05:08.399> on<00:05:08.579> the<00:05:08.699> foundation<00:05:09.269> there<00:05:09.749> are<00:05:09.869> a

directly on the foundation there are a

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:11.299 
directly on the foundation there are a
