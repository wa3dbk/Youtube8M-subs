00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
biggest thing about this set is the way

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.730 
biggest thing about this set is the way
the<00:02:05.520> wings<00:02:05.729> open<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.959> to<00:02:07.080> pick<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.319> up<00:02:07.409> for

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the wings open I have to pick it up for

the wings open I have to pick it up for
this<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.190> show<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.269> full<00:02:09.569> effect<00:02:09.959> here<00:02:10.110> if

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
this to show you the full effect here if

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.250 
this to show you the full effect here if
you<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.519> turn<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.330> piece<00:02:12.540> right<00:02:12.780> here<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you just turn this piece right here and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.199 
you just turn this piece right here and
the<00:02:13.350> wings<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:13.680> pop<00:02:14.069> open<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.970> see<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
the wings just pop open and see the

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.210 
the wings just pop open and see the
rubber<00:02:15.330> bands<00:02:15.600> holding<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.260> together<00:02:16.799> right

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
rubber bands holding it together right

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.650 
rubber bands holding it together right
now<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.730> they<00:02:20.850> should<00:02:21.030> pop<00:02:21.180> open<00:02:21.360> like<00:02:21.540> that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
now so they should pop open like that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.220 
now so they should pop open like that
and<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.590> set<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.799> down<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.190> kind<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
and if you set it down it kind of and it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.350 
and if you set it down it kind of and it
doesn't<00:02:25.560> sit<00:02:25.950> right<00:02:25.980> because<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.910> wings<00:02:27.120> open

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
doesn't sit right because the wings open

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.039 
doesn't sit right because the wings open
further<00:02:27.780> than<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.650> part<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:30.030> then<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.900> just

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
further than this part but then you just

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:38.720 
further than this part but then you just
pop<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.320> back<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:37.230> here's<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.680> inside<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
pop it back so here's the inside of the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.259 
pop it back so here's the inside of the
wings<00:02:38.910> here<00:02:40.250> close<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.400> back<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:41.940> easier

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
wings here close it back to it's easier

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.289 
wings here close it back to it's easier
to<00:02:42.900> show<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.620> everything<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:45.000> can<00:02:45.150> see

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
to show you everything and you can see

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.849 
to show you everything and you can see
there's<00:02:45.510> an<00:02:45.660> extra<00:02:46.049> piece<00:02:46.260> right<00:02:46.560> here

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
there's an extra piece right here

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.640 
there's an extra piece right here
because<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.790> read<00:02:48.420> five<00:02:48.750> or<00:02:49.109> read

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
because this can be read five or read

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.699 
because this can be read five or read
six<00:02:50.359> obviously<00:02:51.359> right<00:02:51.570> now<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.200> as<00:02:52.380> read

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
six obviously right now have it as read

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:06.860 
six obviously right now have it as read
six<00:02:55.819> here's<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.970> top<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.540> right<00:02:57.569> here<00:03:05.870> so

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
six here's the top of it right here so

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.009 
six here's the top of it right here so
here<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.530> cockpit<00:03:08.329> it<00:03:09.329> opens<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.840> like

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
here is the cockpit it opens up like

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.580 
here is the cockpit it opens up like
