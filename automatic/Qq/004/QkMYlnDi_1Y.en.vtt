right now we get that's the boil kettle
and<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.430> chop<00:01:19.640> see<00:01:19.820> I'll<00:01:19.939> set<00:01:20.180> up<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.450> coiled<00:01:20.990> is

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
and a chop see I'll set up the coiled is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.010 
and a chop see I'll set up the coiled is
in<00:01:21.409> there<00:01:21.740> attached<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.549> lid<00:01:23.020> you

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
in there attached to the lid you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.010 
in there attached to the lid you
probably<00:01:24.439> be<00:01:24.590> able<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.799> see<00:01:25.010> this<00:01:25.159> very<00:01:25.400> well

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
probably be able to see this very well

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.850 
probably be able to see this very well
but<00:01:27.020> I'll<00:01:27.140> show<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.380> better<00:01:27.560> when<00:01:27.770> they

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
but I'll show you better when they

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.380 
but I'll show you better when they
actually<00:01:27.979> go<00:01:28.280> into<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.520> brew<00:01:28.729> day<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.060> how<00:01:29.210> all

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
actually go into a brew day and how all

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.990 
actually go into a brew day and how all
this<00:01:29.570> works<00:01:29.810> exactly<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.680> what<00:01:30.799> I'm<00:01:30.920> thinking

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
this works exactly and what I'm thinking

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.310 
this works exactly and what I'm thinking
and<00:01:32.000> that's<00:01:32.090> also<00:01:32.360> gonna<00:01:32.570> serve<00:01:32.869> as<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.140> work

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
and that's also gonna serve as the work

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.469 
and that's also gonna serve as the work
chiller<00:01:33.680> I<00:01:33.979> think<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:34.850> have<00:01:35.030> figured<00:01:35.330> out<00:01:35.420> how

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
chiller I think I have figured out how

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.999 
chiller I think I have figured out how
I'm<00:01:35.659> going<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.840> do<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:36.110> I'm<00:01:36.320> gonna<00:01:36.530> fill<00:01:36.860> up

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
I'm going to do that I'm gonna fill up

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.570 
I'm going to do that I'm gonna fill up
the<00:01:37.040> mash<00:01:37.880> tun<00:01:38.150> with<00:01:38.330> cold<00:01:38.630> water<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.650> also

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
the mash tun with cold water and also

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.060 
the mash tun with cold water and also
some<00:01:40.939> ice<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:41.930> then<00:01:42.409> what<00:01:42.590> I'll<00:01:42.710> do<00:01:42.860> is<00:01:42.890> I'll

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
some ice and then what I'll do is I'll

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.719 
some ice and then what I'll do is I'll
just<00:01:43.189> recirculate<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:44.000> through<00:01:44.299> that<00:01:44.960> and

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
just recirculate it through that and

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.880 
just recirculate it through that and
dual-purpose<00:01:46.729> that's<00:01:47.119> what<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.329> like<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.600> see

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
dual-purpose that's what I like to see

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.050 
dual-purpose that's what I like to see
anyway<00:01:48.890> here<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.369> are<00:01:49.400> we're<00:01:49.700> working<00:01:49.880> on<00:01:50.000> the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
anyway here we are we're working on the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.410 
anyway here we are we're working on the
mash<00:01:50.240> tun<00:01:50.509> today<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:52.310> far<00:01:52.549> I've<00:01:52.700> got<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.180> Lord

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
mash tun today so far I've got the Lord

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.039 
mash tun today so far I've got the Lord
valve<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.640> there<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.880> little<00:01:56.329> bit<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.930> a

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
valve in and there is a little bit of a

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.590 
valve in and there is a little bit of a
leak<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:58.640> I've<00:01:58.790> been<00:01:58.939> waiting<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.390> come

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
leak that I've been waiting to come

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.270 
leak that I've been waiting to come
through<00:01:59.810> so<00:01:59.840> we'll<00:02:00.200> take<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.409> up<00:02:00.890> hopefully

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
through so we'll take that up hopefully

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.620 
through so we'll take that up hopefully
that's<00:02:01.700> squared<00:02:02.149> away

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
that's squared away

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.130 
that's squared away
I<00:02:02.659> just<00:02:03.259> got<00:02:03.409> enough<00:02:03.590> water<00:02:03.829> in<00:02:04.100> there<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:05.140> test

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
I just got enough water in there to test

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.960 
I just got enough water in there to test
that<00:02:06.320> one<00:02:06.560> then<00:02:06.950> I'll<00:02:07.070> fill<00:02:07.310> put<00:02:07.790> the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
that one then I'll fill put the

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.669 
that one then I'll fill put the
temperature<00:02:08.599> probe<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.079> once<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:09.409> get<00:02:09.560> that

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
temperature probe in once I get that

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.979 
temperature probe in once I get that
leak<00:02:09.920> stopped<00:02:10.299> and<00:02:11.299> right<00:02:11.569> now<00:02:11.689> I'm<00:02:11.749> working

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
leak stopped and right now I'm working

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.780 
leak stopped and right now I'm working
on<00:02:12.200> putting<00:02:12.409> in<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
on putting in the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.850 
on putting in the
valve<00:02:14.299> for<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.599> spark<00:02:14.900> darn<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.739> one

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
valve for the spark darn that one

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.199 
valve for the spark darn that one
doesn't<00:02:16.010> know<00:02:16.129> it<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.370> be<00:02:16.489> weak<00:02:16.670> tested<00:02:17.120> all

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
doesn't know it to be weak tested all

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.089 
doesn't know it to be weak tested all
that<00:02:17.420> well<00:02:17.599> so<00:02:18.500> I'm<00:02:18.560> gonna<00:02:18.650> get<00:02:18.799> this<00:02:18.920> taken

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
that well so I'm gonna get this taken

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.619 
that well so I'm gonna get this taken
care<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.760> think<00:02:19.879> I<00:02:20.150> know<00:02:20.209> what<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.480> problem

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
care of I think I know what the problem

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.149 
care of I think I know what the problem
is<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.170> then<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.409> the<00:02:21.500> same<00:02:21.530> mistake<00:02:21.980> I've

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
is and then it's the same mistake I've

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.099 
is and then it's the same mistake I've
made<00:02:22.189> yes<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.700> other<00:02:22.819> day<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.329> I'm<00:02:23.870> gonna<00:02:23.959> get

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.109 
made yes the other day so I'm gonna get

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.289 
made yes the other day so I'm gonna get
that<00:02:24.260> done<00:02:24.469> and<00:02:24.799> we'll<00:02:25.700> take<00:02:25.849> a<00:02:25.909> look<00:02:26.030> at<00:02:26.180> it

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
that done and we'll take a look at it

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.869 
that done and we'll take a look at it
when<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:26.540> all<00:02:26.659> said<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.439> done<00:02:27.530> all<00:02:27.829> right<00:02:28.609> so

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
when it's all said and done all right so

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.550 
when it's all said and done all right so
there<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.269> I<00:02:29.480> got<00:02:29.629> to<00:02:29.719> make<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.959> last<00:02:30.230> part

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
there it is I got to make this last part

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.800 
there it is I got to make this last part
quick<00:02:30.859> because<00:02:31.159> I'm<00:02:32.090> gonna<00:02:32.239> get<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.450> trouble<00:02:32.750> I

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
quick because I'm gonna get in trouble I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.149 
quick because I'm gonna get in trouble I
got<00:02:32.930> some<00:02:33.109> housework<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.650> got<00:02:33.769> to<00:02:33.890> get<00:02:34.010> done

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
got some housework and I got to get done

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.460 
got some housework and I got to get done
but<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:35.030> wheeled<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.750> into<00:02:35.989> this<00:02:36.079> other<00:02:36.260> room

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
but I wheeled it into this other room

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.960 
but I wheeled it into this other room
just<00:02:36.709> because<00:02:36.859> I<00:02:36.950> wanted<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.340> test<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.730> pump

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
just because I wanted to test the pump

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.300 
just because I wanted to test the pump
and<00:02:38.120> there's<00:02:38.299> now<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:38.689> real<00:02:38.870> close<00:02:39.310> so

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
and there's now but real close so

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.209 
and there's now but real close so
basically<00:02:40.760> for<00:02:41.000> recirculating<00:02:42.010> will<00:02:43.010> turn

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
basically for recirculating will turn

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.899 
basically for recirculating will turn
that<00:02:43.370> bovine<00:02:44.829> we<00:02:45.829> go<00:02:45.980> down<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.400> three<00:02:46.760> way

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
that bovine we go down the three way

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.580 
that bovine we go down the three way
ball<00:02:47.150> valve<00:02:47.480> that's<00:02:47.720> coming<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.349> up

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
ball valve that's coming in and up

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:59.229 
ball valve that's coming in and up
through<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:48.950> pump<00:02:50.290> into<00:02:51.290> my<00:02:51.409> HLT<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.030> comes

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
through the pump into my HLT so it comes

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.440 
through the pump into my HLT so it comes
in<00:02:59.530> through<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.709> one<00:03:00.980> which<00:03:01.879> was<00:03:02.060> leaking<00:03:02.389> a

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
in through this one which was leaking a

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.599 
in through this one which was leaking a
little<00:03:02.659> bit<00:03:02.780> tighten<00:03:03.079> that<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.290> fixed<00:03:03.829> at<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
little bit tighten that up fixed at the

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.270 
little bit tighten that up fixed at the
compression<00:03:05.030> fitting<00:03:05.180> got<00:03:05.840> my<00:03:06.019> stuff<00:03:06.290> comes

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
compression fitting got my stuff comes

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.990 
compression fitting got my stuff comes
back<00:03:07.489> out<00:03:07.780> through<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:09.049> line<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:10.310> then<00:03:10.579> I

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
back out through this line and then I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.819 
back out through this line and then I
put<00:03:11.209> another<00:03:11.419> ball<00:03:11.659> valve<00:03:11.959> on<00:03:12.109> here<00:03:12.409> that<00:03:12.709> way

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
put another ball valve on here that way

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.080 
put another ball valve on here that way
I<00:03:12.859> can<00:03:13.099> control<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.790> flow<00:03:14.680> during<00:03:15.680> sparge<00:03:16.159> so

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
I can control the flow during sparge so

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:27.300 
I can control the flow during sparge so
let's<00:03:17.209> plug<00:03:17.389> it<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.449> I'm<00:03:24.139> she<00:03:24.470> goes

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.600 

all<00:03:28.310> right<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:32.060> that's<00:03:32.569> basically

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
all right and that's basically

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.619 
all right and that's basically
recirculating<00:03:34.610> like<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.790> champ<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.360> don't<00:03:35.510> have

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
recirculating like a champ I don't have

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.289 
recirculating like a champ I don't have
a<00:03:35.659> spar<00:03:35.989> arm<00:03:36.230> in<00:03:36.439> there<00:03:36.590> yet<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:38.120> I'll<00:03:38.180> get

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
a spar arm in there yet but I'll get

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.559 
a spar arm in there yet but I'll get
that<00:03:38.510> in<00:03:38.689> later<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.939> think<00:03:41.329> it's<00:03:41.420> got<00:03:41.540> a

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
that in later but I think it's got a

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.360 
that in later but I think it's got a
little<00:03:41.870> bit<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.079> Airlines<00:03:42.769> but<00:03:43.010> other<00:03:43.189> than

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
little bit of Airlines but other than

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.899 
little bit of Airlines but other than
it's<00:03:43.670> going<00:03:44.000> really<00:03:44.329> good<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:45.579> I'm<00:03:46.579> getting

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
it's going really good and I'm getting

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.229 
it's going really good and I'm getting
pretty<00:03:47.720> excited<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.409> must<00:03:48.650> say<00:03:49.000> anyway<00:03:50.000> that's

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
pretty excited I must say anyway that's

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.940 
pretty excited I must say anyway that's
the<00:03:50.390> end<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.659> this<00:03:50.750> video<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.170> hope<00:03:51.379> everyone's

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
the end of this video I hope everyone's

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.920
