00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
showing you what you need to prepare a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.339 
showing you what you need to prepare a
tank<00:00:05.759> for<00:00:06.529> fish<00:00:07.529> life<00:00:08.690> so<00:00:09.690> there's<00:00:10.110> stuff

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
tank for fish life so there's stuff

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.650 
tank for fish life so there's stuff
called<00:00:10.620> ammonia<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.460> chlorine<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:12.330> tap<00:00:12.630> water

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
called ammonia and chlorine in tap water

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.110 
called ammonia and chlorine in tap water
and<00:00:13.200> I'm<00:00:13.740> pretty<00:00:13.980> sure<00:00:14.099> most<00:00:14.309> people<00:00:14.670> fill

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
and I'm pretty sure most people fill

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.109 
and I'm pretty sure most people fill
their<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.960> know<00:00:16.080> tanks<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.740> tap<00:00:17.100> water<00:00:17.130> so

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
their you know tanks with tap water so

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.000 
their you know tanks with tap water so
to<00:00:18.210> prepare<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.350> get<00:00:19.500> ammonia

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
to prepare that for it you get ammonia

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.170 
to prepare that for it you get ammonia
clear<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.580> any<00:00:20.850> other<00:00:21.140> ammonia<00:00:22.140> thing<00:00:22.820> I<00:00:23.820> use

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
clear or any other ammonia thing I use

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.170 
clear or any other ammonia thing I use
this<00:00:24.359> orc<00:00:24.869> seems<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> work<00:00:25.410> really<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.980> best

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
this orc seems to work really the best

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.580 
this orc seems to work really the best
it's<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.539> little<00:00:27.750> tab<00:00:28.080> right<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.289> but

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it's just this little tab right here but

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.839 
it's just this little tab right here but
starts<00:00:28.830> visiting<00:00:28.980> up<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.519> throw<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> in

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
starts visiting up you can throw it in

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.780 
starts visiting up you can throw it in
right<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.210> fish<00:00:31.040> fish<00:00:32.040> will<00:00:32.250> die<00:00:32.279> pretty

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
right with you fish fish will die pretty

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.209 
right with you fish fish will die pretty
quickly<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.200> they're<00:00:34.500> exposed<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
quickly if they if they're exposed to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.690 
quickly if they if they're exposed to
pneumonia<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.230> chlorine<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.710> core<00:00:38.070> mine<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
pneumonia and chlorine and core mine and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.240 
pneumonia and chlorine and core mine and
it's<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.320> refill<00:00:40.950> tank

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it's just like when you refill tank

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.830 
it's just like when you refill tank
you're<00:00:41.489> cleaning<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.030> once<00:00:42.600> you're<00:00:42.719> done

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
you're cleaning it once you're done

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.119 
you're cleaning it once you're done
cleaning<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.469> new<00:00:43.620> water<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
cleaning it you have new water and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.770 
cleaning it you have new water and
that's<00:00:44.280> tap<00:00:44.520> water<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.329> throw<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> these

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that's tap water just throw one of these

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.860 
that's tap water just throw one of these
bugs<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.700> you<00:00:47.700> put<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.180> end<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.660> every

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
bugs in and you put one end for every

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.979 
bugs in and you put one end for every
ten<00:00:49.079> gallons<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.149> couple<00:00:51.149> tanks<00:00:51.539> but

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
ten gallons so I have a couple tanks but

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.889 
ten gallons so I have a couple tanks but
my<00:00:52.410> main<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.039> ten<00:00:53.219> gallon<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.690> just

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
my main one is at ten gallon and I just

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.110 
my main one is at ten gallon and I just

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so I just throw one in and it starts

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.930 
so I just throw one in and it starts
visiting<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.600> safe<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.079> use<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.940> it's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
visiting it's safe to use with all it's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.340 
visiting it's safe to use with all it's
safe<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> use<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.629> freshwater<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
safe to use with freshwater and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.590 
safe to use with freshwater and
saltwater<00:01:01.680> aquariums<00:01:07.520> yeah<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:09.570> after

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
saltwater aquariums yeah and then after

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.730 
saltwater aquariums yeah and then after
you<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.020> you're<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> give

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you do that you're going to want to give

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.320 
you do that you're going to want to give
it<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> minute<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.939> you're<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> get

it a minute then you're going to get
these<00:01:13.250> it's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.369> test<00:01:15.320> click<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.939> there<00:01:17.939> come<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
these it's a test click it there come in

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.310 
these it's a test click it there come in
like<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.509> box<00:01:18.950> it's<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:21.320> but

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
like a little box it's like this but

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.740 
like a little box it's like this but
then<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.979> pull<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> thing<00:01:23.460> out<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.600> do

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
then you pull this thing out what you do

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.130 
then you pull this thing out what you do
to<00:01:24.930> use<00:01:25.080> these<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> test<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.140> um

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to use these this is the test that um

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.149 
to use these this is the test that um
I'm<00:01:28.680> pretty<00:01:28.920> sure<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.579> one<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> for

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
I'm pretty sure it's this one is for

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.240 
I'm pretty sure it's this one is for
your<00:01:32.270> pneumonia<00:01:33.270> ammonia<00:01:33.780> levels<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
your pneumonia ammonia levels which is

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.950 
your pneumonia ammonia levels which is
tap<00:01:35.490> water<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:35.970> after<00:01:36.180> you're<00:01:36.299> done<00:01:36.420> with

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
tap water so after you're done with

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.210 
tap water so after you're done with
these<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.470> completely<00:01:37.710> solved<00:01:38.130> you're

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
these and it's completely solved you're

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.380 
these and it's completely solved you're
going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> get<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:39.450> open<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
going to get these just open it up and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.399 
going to get these just open it up and
you<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.630> put<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> right<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.290> water

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you don't just put it right in the water

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.440 
you don't just put it right in the water
and<00:01:43.649> try<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> touch<00:01:44.189> those<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.970> white<00:01:45.149> tabs

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and try to touch those on the white tabs

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.060 
and try to touch those on the white tabs
that<00:01:45.630> are<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.200> you're<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.920> pull

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
that are on there you're going to pull

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.230 
that are on there you're going to pull
out<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.310> vile<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.579> fill

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
out this vile and then you just fill

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.539 
out this vile and then you just fill
this<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.630> three-fourths<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> way<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
this up three-fourths of the way to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.420 
this up three-fourths of the way to
about<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:53.909> line<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.930> top<00:01:55.140> line<00:01:55.430> scoop

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
about what line is the top line scoop

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.850 
about what line is the top line scoop
poop<00:01:56.610> poop<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.290> pick<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.469> all<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:58.649> that
