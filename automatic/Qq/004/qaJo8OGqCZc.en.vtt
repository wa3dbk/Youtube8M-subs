black<00:03:15.910> on<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.930> paint<00:03:17.230> doesn't<00:03:17.650> get<00:03:17.920> as

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
black on it the the paint doesn't get as

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.590 
black on it the the paint doesn't get as
you<00:03:18.310> can<00:03:18.459> see<00:03:18.579> it's<00:03:18.700> really<00:03:18.940> messed<00:03:19.239> up<00:03:19.390> now

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
you can see it's really messed up now

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.090 
you can see it's really messed up now
but<00:03:19.870> that's<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.170> because<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> lot<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.769> wear<00:03:21.070> and

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
but that's it because a lot of wear and

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.449
