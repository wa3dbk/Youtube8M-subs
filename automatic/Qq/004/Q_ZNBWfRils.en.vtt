00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.189
 Well, this was the neighborhood area 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.800
 so here we are going to leave a sensor 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.830
 movement and the other where we listen 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.540
 those strange sounds then we go 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.289
 to withdraw let's start and do this 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.090
 to see if something moves and captures it 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.910
 any 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.330
 entity that it does not and give some energy 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.240
 because of those energies that were 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.720
 here distributing 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.700
 they still continue and the energies of 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.860
 pain and death also hovering by 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.860
 here we go from here we go 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.210
 later we went to the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.400
 next area where we would leave the other 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.680
 motion sensor but some 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.820
 events took us by surprise at all 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.820
 the research team 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.430
 the parts 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.430
 this step and that 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.810
 and it happened to you 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.820
 and it started to thunder around here then 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.820
 and that joke 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.830
 very good there 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.470
 9 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.329
 the alarm started to sound everything was 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.329
 simultaneous 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.710
 like me 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 two 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.930
 for all 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.229
 constantino 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.090
 in fact here above also already 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.830
 they begin to see shadows give themselves uproar 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.530
 more the energies as if they had been 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.790
 asleep for a long time and right now 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.490
 again they were revived with all this 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.750
 what is happening and to learn more is 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.100
 sounding because it is already detecting 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.100
 our presence leaves the blackout 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.110
 that you saw something jerry 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.110
 where 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.530
 that costs that there are many noises there 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.350
 much an event inside 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.020
 there are many noises there is much once 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.230
 we are many noises there are many 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.230
 movements 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.380
 where 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.250
 and I'm by your side 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.740
 you do not see it iron 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.090
 it's a nice touch with a tip 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.160
 here there is nothing has gotten someone 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.160
 who got in someone 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.599
 did you see something 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.680
 unless they decided 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.680
 if not 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:49.300
 and something that happened dancing 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.319
 at the head of that person that you say that 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.170
 dresses 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.290
 it was not a positive energy is in my 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.290
 arms 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.709
 to the passage here parked up hill 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.709
 no no no 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.949
 someone who was dancing careful with 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.949
 insurance 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.300
 because here we are already talking about 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:39.990
 energy is even more negative here already 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.990
 we are simply leaving that aside 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.990
 Oh 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.460
 it was not ship 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.350
 in cake 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.850
 after the intense events 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.040
 I suggested leaving the vision camera 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.770
 night at one of the points where 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.590
 comments that entities roam after 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.390
 of 17 minutes the camera managed to register 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.460
 a strange figure that looks like 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.570
 I would like to go down the stairs to 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.570
 then fade 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.400
 with incense to offer light to the 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.259
 energies is how we culminate the 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.469
 investigation in that hotel in acapulco 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:56.300
 that keeps great mysteries for 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.300
