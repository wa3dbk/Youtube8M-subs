benefits let's quickly break them down a
very<00:03:34.170> prominent<00:03:34.650> component<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.640> xft<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.480> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
very prominent component in xft is a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.949 
very prominent component in xft is a
unique<00:03:37.700> organometallic<00:03:38.700> burn<00:03:39.090> rate<00:03:39.330> modifier

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.590 
unique organometallic burn rate modifier
this<00:03:40.830> works<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.400> lower<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.850> ignition<00:03:42.390> point

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
this works to lower the ignition point

this works to lower the ignition point
of<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.959> fuel<00:03:43.230> by<00:03:43.410> several<00:03:43.829> hundred<00:03:43.860> degrees

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.819 
of the fuel by several hundred degrees
that's<00:03:44.840> important<00:03:45.840> because<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.260> causes<00:03:46.500> the

that's important because it causes the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.680 
that's important because it causes the
fuel<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.370> start<00:03:47.430> burning<00:03:47.880> sooner<00:03:48.510> and

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
fuel to start burning sooner and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.930 
fuel to start burning sooner and
