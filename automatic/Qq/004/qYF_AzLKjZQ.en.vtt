00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.130
 hey people what 's up 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.110
 autumn concert third episode of mine 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.940
 secret locations series today 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.560
 I have three locations for you 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 picked out of which I do not think 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.800
 that each one of you knows this and that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.740
 are pretty cool on 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.000
 we start directly with the first one 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.769
 First, I have a power station 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.039
 for you this is here 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.480
 northeast in the city â€‹â€‹and just like that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.340
 if you see it then you can do it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.739
 barely recognizing salt are all the same 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.570
 normal walls you see so first 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.430
 with a helicopter so high then flies 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.070
 you can look in there and then 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.050
 you can see what the whole thing should represent 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 I like that so much because the whole 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.250
 not real feeling of one 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.500
 state building is indeed 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 with longer city but feels like 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.129
 if somehow in the middle of the country 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
 could not imagine that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.850
 I have something with the city at gta 5 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.520
 In addition one must consider that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.980
 this one power plant here the whole 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.690
 City the kat with electricity 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.610
 It's pretty cool too 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.930
 Also a cool place to go with friends or 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.520
 so easy to explore here too 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.409
 inside karma good deathmatch or something 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.630
 host or a deathmatch in the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.220
 counter create creator and then 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.210
 a lot to friends or other people 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.770
 have fun 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.140
 Next, I have a location 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 maybe not so sigl she is there 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.340
 after the most expensive apartments in gta 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.409
 5 online mode is located and you there 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.970
 relatively often actually drives a long 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.009
 maybe some just have straight on 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.810
 paid attention to the street and sms that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.740
 not so noticed this 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.630
 sports field here 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.520
 it offers different possibilities 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.220
 for different sports has 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.439
 pole vault is seen here now 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.509
 small part for the discus throw has 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.430
 you still have different obstacles 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.829
 the runway and here is another 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.180
 mat on which you also jump robbery 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.820
 can and of course the normal 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.380
 runway where you can walk around to 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.899
 in the end you also have benches for 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.939
 viewers left it just university or 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.380
 So college is definitely 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.880
 pretty cool place the hammer 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.049
 pour me should definitely 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.659
 Good case 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.610
 as the third and last location we have 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.530
 in the opinion of the most beautiful location 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.539
 That's a cover at all 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.640
 The caves always come with you 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.900
 great on the here on the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.239
 map and the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.159
 is almost completely under water 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.620
 Here you see the whole is huge 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.879
 that shows how much bigger than the first 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.950
 I cave you in the first episode 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.810
 featured in this series 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.010
 there you have as a person just 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.900
 fit in here you can get a whole 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.299
 partying in it and all over 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.769
 take helicopter with it and at 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.750
 sunrise, it's just that 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.400
 most beautiful location here on the water and 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.709
 when you get out of the height exit 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.599
 Print because it just looks right 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.060
 Everyone should be really brilliant 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.980
 once did and if gta 5 then 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.470
 on the nextgen consoles and on the pc 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.849
 outside then you can see the graphic and 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.650
 I think the sunrise in here 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.060
 I am looking forward to enjoying even more 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.680
 just extreme 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.750
 In addition, you can cave in this 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.970
 Of course, swim and get up 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.609
 small platforms on the side all the way 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.439

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.480
 and there I go out and 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.730
 managed to place seven 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.540
 real flowers and arguing 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.540
