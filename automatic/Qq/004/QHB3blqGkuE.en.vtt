00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.949
 how 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.430
 ah 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.290
 very good to all kids I 'm from 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.580
 this new here and good these little ones 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.650
 updates that I bring you from time to time 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 when about what happens in the game of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.410
 Romero this is work and I announced that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.870
 tomorrow, March 26 , 2014 we will have 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.160
 a little update of the game a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.020
 great little update because 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.290
 supposedly the patch 11 arrives with 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.930
 she with we do not know the patch 11 11 such 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 what if I called it like that but yes 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.690
 a patch will come with new improvements 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.540
 equilibrium improvement techniques in 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.240
 units improvements in the campaign improvements 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.950
 of laia etc and good some of the things 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.660
 most remarkable since that we do not know 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.690
 nothing this morning that take out the packs 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 'notes is that they will bring first 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.670
 historical monuments that is to say let's 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.500
 find us on the map wonders 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.620
 style the citadel of ban 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.140
 and we will also see the lighthouse of Alexandria 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.360
 the colossus of rhodes as well as other 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.340
 wonders like stoner that will be 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.890
 spread across the map a lot of people are 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.770
 you complained because so far it 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.110
 you know near Rhodes and then there was no 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.850
 Colossus of Rhodes and well they have added 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.030
 this wonder so that when I fought 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.190
 on maps in the area, then the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.900
 wonders in particular that apart from the 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.270
 pyramids that were the only ones that up 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.280
 now it seems there was also another 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.509
 novelty a precious scoop that others 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.640
 they have not wanted they have not been able or have not 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.119
 to see is that they have finally heard 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.220
 to the public and have put the stations to 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.500
 which you play on the campaign map to 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.149
 those that not all know for campaign to 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.160
 those who play the main campaign and do not 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.690
 the stays expansions you know that 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.670
 Caesar in Galia brought stations 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.070
 spring summer autumn winter and now 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.649
 the new expansion of cartago will do 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.600
 the same thing of aníbal in the doors 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.060
 they have also introduced the stations 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.680
 within the main campaign the great 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.770
 those who do not have expansion is also 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.989
 you will have stations that yes the problem 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.130
 is that the shift is maintained per year with 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.870
 which each year will be 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.870
 with different very long features 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.390
 but if it's compatible announced with the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.030
 mod of the stations with which if 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.760
 you have the mod of four shifts per year 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.130
 then you will have stations in their periods 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.370
 correct 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.870
 another novelty are the new units that 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.970
 five new units are coming for 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.930
 the Carthage faction in the first place 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.430
 we have light Celtic horses 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.280
 mercenaries and good are units 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.200
 pretty good for skirmishes are 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.300
 fast and will probably be worth 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.940
 just to finish with the three 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.220
 enemy archers but his melee attack 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.930
 escuté 42 which is nothing 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.020
 despicable and can be quite 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.510
 pretty good at the combat of ml for 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.100
 retain higher cost units in 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.870
 second place we have the son of the 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.850
 Balearic Islands that are added to the faction of 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.170
 I'm writing and that the truth is good 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.420
 They are not bad for the price they have 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.420
 380 will be a few units 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.360
 competent but not elite of course 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.190
 in at the time of combat of 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.650
 good projectiles after we have for 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.320
 here the mercenaries the swordsmen 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.590
 italic mercenaries that well they are 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.720
 a rather shabby combat unit already 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.270
 so to speak but they are not bad 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.100
 melee attack and probably 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.230
 as creative has presented us 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.069
 assembly is based on attacking the 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.290
 projectile units 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.999
 friends and try to end them with 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.099
 this unit or to exercise detours with 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:42.099
 her with his body as good body 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.450
 can do a lot of damage if the emt is 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.859
 in the back or on the side of the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.870
 enemy in penultimate place we have the 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.730
 the noble mercenary fighters that 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.150
 apparently they have told us they are 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.519
 an elite unit of the best there is 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.810
 the truth is that I do not see him so 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.750
 elite because they have less armor 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.390
 and less melee attack than 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.819
 a unit of cuts of mouth tics follows 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.950
 probably they will eat it and the 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.500
 price round by air in the area but 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.330
 the skills that those and the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.669
 head hunter for example loading 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.950
 frantic because they will be quite useful 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.169
 when using communities 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.210
 shock let's see how these work 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.410
 when the patch comes out but for now the 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.880
 truth is that they are pretty good 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.370
 paints though a little expensive at 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.730
 better and finally we have the 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.000
 mercenary cavalry in noble numidia 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.790
 that we will be like the name of the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.130
 noble but from what they have told us that 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.229
 the pressure of a little more refined not 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.389
 he has bad statistics and his prediction 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.889
 It's not bad but you have to see how it 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.330
 it behaves on the battlefield because 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.889
 The truth is that I'm not a big fan of 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.070
 these cavalries with a little body to 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.880
 body and very good load but you have to 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.890
 see everything 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.840
 and it is not that the load stands out in 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.910
 this case so it's about a 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.010
 pretty mediocre cavalry at a price 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.530
 that seems pretty high to me 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.270
 see how balanced that is what 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.820
 always at the end it can be amazing 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.390
 because it's a melee email 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.190
 it's quite high but that's the thing 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.810
 let's see how the units turn out 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.220
 let's see how the news turns out 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.990
 these that have presented us those of 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.460
 creative assembly let's see how the 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.290
 Patch especially the corrections 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.870
 techniques and if the 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.620
 replace or not so nothing kids 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.600
 remember that on the 27th the tlc of 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.980
 Anibal at the doors and well then 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 we will start a campaign that I follow 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.790
 waiting for you to tell me if you want it 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.110
 with clothes or you want it with cartago well 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.400
 that we see the next episode like 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.090
 if you liked a greeting to all and 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.090
 see you guys later
