through for even distribution with a
fine-tooth<00:00:59.160> comb<00:00:59.370> i<00:01:01.460> start<00:01:02.460> mapping<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.120> tip

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
fine-tooth comb i start mapping the tip

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.780 
fine-tooth comb i start mapping the tip
of<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:03.660> hair<00:01:04.019> around<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.739> rod<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.760> i

of my hair around the rod and then i

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.420 
of my hair around the rod and then i
continue<00:01:06.540> upwards<00:01:07.080> till<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.680> reach<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.040> root

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
continue upwards till I reach the root

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.179 
continue upwards till I reach the root
as<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.420> wrapped<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.900> hair<00:01:10.140> upwards<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.830> making

with<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.530> crow<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> take<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.700> rods<00:01:17.909> out

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
with the crow when you take the rods out

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.400 
with the crow when you take the rods out
the<00:01:18.600> following<00:01:18.930> day

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.500 

then<00:01:24.410> snap<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.460> perm<00:01:25.760> rod<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.330> secure<00:01:26.810> it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
then snap in the perm rod to secure it

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.680 
then snap in the perm rod to secure it
so<00:01:29.510> let's<00:01:30.020> see<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:30.710> again<00:01:31.330> apply<00:01:32.330> your

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
so let's see that again apply your

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.900 
so let's see that again apply your
mapping<00:01:32.930> solution<00:01:33.290> then<00:01:33.920> detangle<00:01:34.760> with<00:01:34.880> a

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
mapping solution then detangle with a

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.490 
mapping solution then detangle with a
fine-tooth<00:01:35.420> comb<00:01:35.450> for<00:01:35.930> even<00:01:36.229> distribution

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
fine-tooth comb for even distribution

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.040 
fine-tooth comb for even distribution
and<00:01:37.070> then<00:01:37.670> simply<00:01:38.060> start<00:01:38.330> rolling<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.870> hair

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
and then simply start rolling the hair

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.530 
and then simply start rolling the hair
from<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.560> tip<00:01:39.770> moving<00:01:40.520> upwards<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.150> keeping

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
from the tip moving upwards and keeping

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:50.380 
from the tip moving upwards and keeping
the<00:01:41.690> head<00:01:41.960> Todd<00:01:48.280> secure<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.490> perm<00:01:49.760> rod<00:01:50.060> and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
the head Todd secure the perm rod and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.320 
the head Todd secure the perm rod and
then<00:01:50.960> repeat<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.500> process<00:01:51.710> until<00:01:52.340> all<00:01:52.970> of

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
then repeat the process until all of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.460 
then repeat the process until all of
your<00:01:53.509> hair<00:01:53.750> has<00:01:54.020> been<00:01:54.200> running<00:01:54.560> up<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:57.140> size

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
your hair has been running up the size

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.469 
your hair has been running up the size
of<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.860> rod<00:01:58.070> will<00:01:58.100> determine<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.030> size<00:01:59.270> of

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
of the rod will determine the size of

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.320 
of the rod will determine the size of
the<00:01:59.570> curl<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.410> for<00:02:00.649> tighter<00:02:00.920> ringlets<00:02:01.580> use<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
the curl so for tighter ringlets use the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.780 
the curl so for tighter ringlets use the
smallest<00:02:02.720> perm<00:02:03.050> rods<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.710> for<00:02:04.190> curls<00:02:04.490> and

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
smallest perm rods and for curls and

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.370 
smallest perm rods and for curls and
ways<00:02:05.030> they<00:02:05.420> use<00:02:05.750> larger<00:02:06.320> perm<00:02:06.530> rods

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.280 

I<00:02:11.490> had<00:02:12.490> hoped<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.880> use<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.420> tangerine<00:02:13.960> perm

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
I had hoped to use the tangerine perm

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.500 
I had hoped to use the tangerine perm
rods<00:02:14.560> all<00:02:14.800> through<00:02:15.220> my<00:02:15.370> hair<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:15.880> then<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.120> ran

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
rods all through my hair but then I ran

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.650 
rods all through my hair but then I ran
out<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.380> choose<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.980> use<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.580> light<00:02:19.390> on

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
out and so I choose to use the light on

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.170 
out and so I choose to use the light on
