00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 if you pull the shorter one when you enter 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.390
 longer mobile phone charging cable uses that 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.390
 you can find out here in our testcenter 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.070
 We tried out here in the test center 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.570
 if a short charger I had one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.240
 advantage in charging 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.859
 smartphones or even tablets and have 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 determined yes it can be an advantage 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.460
 bring in part even up to one 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.050
 half an hour does not have to hang 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.010
 easy from the terminal and can also 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.420
 depend on the cable 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.060
 but we have quite a part 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.030
 spectacular results at the sony xperia 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.520
 z3 a highend smartphone we have with 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.020
 a short cable 30 minutes shorter 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.969
 had loading times as with the standard 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.570
 charging cable 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.850
 basically it just depends 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.239
 what resistance this charging cable too 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.500
 has if that is significantly less than 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.559
 the one of a standard cable from the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.360
 long cable then lands more overall 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.940
 performance at the terminal because less up 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.410
 the cable is lost and it can do so 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.000
 lead that charging goes faster 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.859
 but does not always work because like 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.350
 said the terminal must be synonymous 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.300
 at all the offered more power 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.010
 we accept for example on 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.000
 the iphone 6 measured and could 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.799
 no difference at all 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.270
 between short cable long cable 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.520
 we have taken yet network that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.560
 offers significantly more power namely 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.570
 with 2 ampere charging current twice as much 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.520
 Like standard power adapter, the iphone has it all 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.170
 did not care just the the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.540
 performance ignored and only so much 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.310
 As recorded by the standard power supply 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.840
 Also, the consequence is that easy 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.400
 take always the same length regardless of whether the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.890
 iphone 6 with long short cable or 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.140
 charge with a stronger power supply 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.049
 basically like that so the effect 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.549
 through a stronger power supply quite 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.990
 so who can be very large for 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.150
 example also has a tablet at home 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 can quite use it be try 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.090
 tablet charger to use this 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.799
 to load smartphone 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.649
 because usually much higher 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.149
 streams are offered and if that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.110
 Smartphone that accepts it too 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.399
 go much faster and easy 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.380
 do not be afraid that it's the battery 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.850
 harms because the charging electronics in 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.500
 smartphone makes sure not to 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.810
 a lot of power is absorbed 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.540
 then automatically regulates down if it 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.440
 it could be harmful for the battery 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.960
 There is also a new technology 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.360
 quick charge is called that and that 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.920
 is it there so that the power supply and that 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.330
 mobile phone exchange with each other when 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.120
 you notice that both war touch 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.640
 then support increased power supply too 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.110
 the voltage and the voltage can also 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.090
 To increased tension means also I can 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.620
 offer more power and it will 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.530
 partly really dramatically shorter 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.060
 loading times we have at galaxy s 6 to 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.500
 Example loading times of one and a half 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.660
 measured hours which is super fast 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.100
 for the battery in there and 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.640
 we also had a tablet that 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.680
 Sony Xperia Z4 tablet of the normal 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.030
 standard charger five hours needed 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.520
 to charge that really long 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.080
 is and annoys and it loads to war 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.270
 charles charger in three hours that 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.270
 actually 40 percent of the charging time or 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.320
 two hours which is as significant as 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.460
 said you have to be careful 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.220
 does not always work and in everyone 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.870
 but you definitely should 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.010
 Just order a cable and 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.400
 Try it if it is faster then 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.540
 is good 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.250
 otherwise it can be done again 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.560
 send back so I did not use them 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.430
 so easy off and from therefore came easy 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.430
 Try if it works
