00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
sk5 that's 154cm steel the edge will

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.530 
sk5 that's 154cm steel the edge will
last<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.430> longer<00:01:08.490> than<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.060> it's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.560 
on the spine this is a quarter inch
spine<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> mean<00:01:48.000> you're<00:01:48.119> looking<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
spine so I mean you're looking at the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.859 
spine so I mean you're looking at the
same<00:01:48.780> thickness<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.070> BK<00:01:50.460> -<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:51.689> that's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
same thickness as like a BK - and that's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.179 
same thickness as like a BK - and that's
why<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> say<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> mean<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.740> feels<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
why I say I mean it just feels like a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.310 
why I say I mean it just feels like a
pry<00:01:53.490> bar<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:54.600> know<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.750> could<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.020> pry<00:01:55.290> open

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
pry bar you know you could like pry open

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.050 
pry bar you know you could like pry open
almost<00:01:55.740> anything<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.640> does<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:56.969> this

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
almost anything it does have this

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.690 
almost anything it does have this
tapered<00:01:57.479> edge<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:59.310> know<00:01:59.399> they<00:01:59.490> kind

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
tapered edge up here you know they kind

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.280 
tapered edge up here you know they kind
of<00:01:59.850> designed<00:02:00.149> us<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.390> supposedly<00:02:01.049> kind<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
of designed us to be supposedly kind of

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.260 
of designed us to be supposedly kind of
like<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> tactical<00:02:01.920> knife<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.430> could<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.000> guess<00:02:03.060> I

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
like a tactical knife I could I guess I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.690 
like a tactical knife I could I guess I
could<00:02:03.420> see<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.130> could<00:02:05.520> play

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
could see that you know it could play

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.010 
could see that you know it could play
either<00:02:06.000> role<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.869> kind<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:08.149> 5050

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
either role it's it's kind of like 5050

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.130 
either role it's it's kind of like 5050
is<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.890> an<00:02:10.979> OK<00:02:11.310> tactical<00:02:11.790> knife<00:02:11.940> yes<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.480> it

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
doesn't necessarily blow the competition

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.910 
doesn't necessarily blow the competition

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
out of the water on either end but it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.180 
out of the water on either end but it
could<00:02:20.040> play<00:02:20.190> both<00:02:20.430> roles<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.930> this

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
could play both roles but with this

little bit faster than you would if this

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.480 
little bit faster than you would if this
was<00:02:42.660> just<00:02:42.810> solid<00:02:43.350> quarter<00:02:44.100> inch<00:02:44.280> thickness

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
was just solid quarter inch thickness

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.610 
was just solid quarter inch thickness
all<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.880> way<00:02:44.970> through<00:02:45.210> but<00:02:45.750> very<00:02:46.140> very<00:02:46.350> thick

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
blade you're not gonna worry about

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.190 
blade you're not gonna worry about
breaking<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.540> if<00:02:48.630> you're<00:02:48.750> trying<00:02:49.080> to

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
breaking it you know if you're trying to

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.810 
breaking it you know if you're trying to
you<00:02:49.410> know<00:02:49.500> pry<00:02:49.740> something<00:02:50.040> sideways<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
you know pry something sideways and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.030 
you know pry something sideways and
split<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> piece<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.360> wood<00:02:51.510> or<00:02:51.780> whatever<00:02:52.040> so

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.130 
split a piece of wood or whatever so
that's<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.340> blade<00:02:53.580> really<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.840> did<00:02:55.110> a
