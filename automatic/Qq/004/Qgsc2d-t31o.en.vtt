efficient<00:03:12.319> way<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.500> go<00:03:13.159> between<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.519> few

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
efficient way to go between a few

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.699 
efficient way to go between a few
different<00:03:14.060> apps<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.569> didn't<00:03:15.349> get<00:03:15.440> in<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.590> way

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
different apps and didn't get in the way

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.129 
different apps and didn't get in the way
at<00:03:15.829> all<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.760> other<00:03:16.910> one<00:03:17.090> was<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.329> multi<00:03:17.840> window

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
at all the other one was a multi window

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.050 
at all the other one was a multi window
and<00:03:18.349> that<00:03:18.470> gives<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:19.010> ability<00:03:19.099> to<00:03:19.340> run<00:03:19.669> up

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
and that gives you the ability to run up

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.610 
and that gives you the ability to run up
to<00:03:20.209> two<00:03:20.419> different<00:03:20.569> apps<00:03:20.900> on<00:03:21.049> screen<00:03:21.349> at<00:03:21.440> once

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
to two different apps on screen at once

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.589 
to two different apps on screen at once
and<00:03:21.889> you<00:03:21.919> can<00:03:21.980> resize<00:03:22.489> them<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.970> found<00:03:23.450> this

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
and you can resize them I found this

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.390 
and you can resize them I found this
extremely<00:03:23.840> useful<00:03:24.470> but<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.709> really<00:03:25.069> do<00:03:25.220> wish

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
extremely useful but I really do wish

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.059 
extremely useful but I really do wish
they<00:03:25.730> would<00:03:25.879> open<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.209> up<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:26.359> more<00:03:26.660> apps

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
they would open it up to more apps

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.199 
they would open it up to more apps
typically<00:03:28.069> I<00:03:28.220> would<00:03:28.459> use<00:03:28.669> things<00:03:29.060> like<00:03:29.120> Google

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
typically I would use things like Google

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.990 
typically I would use things like Google
Play<00:03:29.629> Books<00:03:29.660> or<00:03:30.139> YouTube<00:03:30.769> along<00:03:31.250> with<00:03:31.430> Google

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
Play Books or YouTube along with Google

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.460 
Play Books or YouTube along with Google
Hangouts<00:03:32.359> I<00:03:32.569> wish<00:03:32.750> they<00:03:32.900> would<00:03:33.019> open<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.290> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
Hangouts I wish they would open up the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.800 
Hangouts I wish they would open up the
API<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.829> Twitter<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:35.329> way<00:03:35.419> I<00:03:35.450> could<00:03:35.660> use

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
API to Twitter that way I could use

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.770 
API to Twitter that way I could use
Twitter<00:03:36.139> in<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.379> same<00:03:36.680> way<00:03:37.329> but<00:03:38.329> anyway<00:03:38.599> let's

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
Twitter in the same way but anyway let's

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.360 
Twitter in the same way but anyway let's
go<00:03:38.900> ahead<00:03:39.139> and<00:03:39.349> talk<00:03:39.530> now<00:03:39.769> about<00:03:39.799> what<00:03:40.160> I

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
go ahead and talk now about what I

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.390 
go ahead and talk now about what I
didn't<00:03:40.879> like<00:03:40.940> about<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.569> Galaxy<00:03:41.989> Tab<00:03:42.169> s<00:03:42.400> the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
didn't like about the Galaxy Tab s the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.789 
didn't like about the Galaxy Tab s the

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
good either there were there was a lot

good either there were there was a lot
of<00:03:54.949> bloatware<00:03:55.310> some<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.060> which<00:03:56.239> I<00:03:56.480> never<00:03:56.599> would

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
of bloatware some of which I never would

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.289 
of bloatware some of which I never would
have<00:03:57.139> expected<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.680> see<00:03:57.799> including<00:03:58.549> a<00:03:58.790> weird

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
have expected to see including a weird

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.509 
have expected to see including a weird
screen<00:03:59.840> saver<00:04:00.290> app<00:04:00.470> which<00:04:00.799> you<00:04:01.129> would<00:04:01.489> think

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
screen saver app which you would think

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.369 
screen saver app which you would think
would<00:04:01.790> only<00:04:01.970> be<00:04:02.150> on<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.449> demo<00:04:02.870> units<00:04:03.290> you

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
would only be on the demo units you

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.740 
would only be on the demo units you
would<00:04:03.500> see<00:04:03.680> at<00:04:03.829> Best<00:04:04.069> Buy<00:04:04.419> but<00:04:05.419> either<00:04:05.540> way

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
would see at Best Buy but either way

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.240 
would see at Best Buy but either way
that<00:04:05.989> was<00:04:06.139> there<00:04:06.319> there's<00:04:06.560> tons<00:04:06.889> of<00:04:06.980> bloatware

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
that was there there's tons of bloatware

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.949 
that was there there's tons of bloatware
and<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.849> really<00:04:08.150> didn't<00:04:08.359> like<00:04:08.510> that<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.930> was

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
and I really didn't like that it was

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.199 
and I really didn't like that it was
kind<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.680> messed<00:04:09.859> up<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.040> experience<00:04:10.549> the

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
kind of messed up the experience the

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.360 
kind of messed up the experience the
software<00:04:11.629> was<00:04:11.780> designed<00:04:12.199> okay<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:12.769> can<00:04:13.160> live

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
software was designed okay I can live

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.949 
software was designed okay I can live
with<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.669> but<00:04:13.730> it's<00:04:14.599> got<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.750> lot<00:04:14.930> of

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
with that but it's got a lot of

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.689 
with that but it's got a lot of
bloatware<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.379> it's<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.650> very<00:04:15.889> heavy<00:04:16.250> skin<00:04:16.669> I

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
bloatware and it's a very heavy skin I

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.969 
bloatware and it's a very heavy skin I
notice<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.239> lot<00:04:17.510> of<00:04:17.570> lag<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.169> I<00:04:18.289> was<00:04:18.409> surprising

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
notice a lot of lag and I was surprising

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.289 
notice a lot of lag and I was surprising
because<00:04:19.130> this<00:04:19.219> is<00:04:19.340> a<00:04:19.370> very<00:04:19.789> very<00:04:20.030> powerful

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
because this is a very very powerful

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.599 
because this is a very very powerful
device

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
device

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.550 
device
but<00:04:22.509> next<00:04:22.750> let's<00:04:22.870> go<00:04:22.900> ahead<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.229> talk<00:04:23.379> about

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
but next let's go ahead and talk about

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.040 
but next let's go ahead and talk about
the<00:04:24.219> bezels<00:04:24.729> and<00:04:25.000> why<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.270> didn't<00:04:25.659> like<00:04:25.840> them

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
the bezels and why I didn't like them

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.499 
the bezels and why I didn't like them
now<00:04:26.439> it<00:04:26.650> has<00:04:26.800> very<00:04:27.009> thin<00:04:27.310> bezels<00:04:27.669> which<00:04:27.879> it<00:04:28.240> can

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
now it has very thin bezels which it can

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.990 
now it has very thin bezels which it can
be<00:04:28.539> viewed<00:04:28.810> as<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.020> good<00:04:29.199> thing<00:04:29.409> but<00:04:30.129> for<00:04:30.729> me<00:04:30.879> on

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
be viewed as a good thing but for me on

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.730 
be viewed as a good thing but for me on
a<00:04:31.030> tablet<00:04:31.509> I<00:04:31.599> don't<00:04:31.810> want<00:04:32.050> thin<00:04:32.319> bezels

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
a tablet I don't want thin bezels

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.200 
a tablet I don't want thin bezels
because<00:04:32.979> I<00:04:33.039> want<00:04:33.189> to<00:04:33.250> be<00:04:33.310> able<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.550> easily<00:04:33.699> hold

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
because I want to be able to easily hold

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.659 
because I want to be able to easily hold
a<00:04:34.389> tablet<00:04:34.750> up<00:04:34.930> above<00:04:35.650> me<00:04:35.889> when<00:04:36.129> I'm<00:04:36.250> sitting<00:04:36.490> in

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
a tablet up above me when I'm sitting in

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.240 
a tablet up above me when I'm sitting in
bed<00:04:36.849> or<00:04:37.090> lying<00:04:37.419> on<00:04:37.539> the<00:04:37.659> couch<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.169> reading<00:04:39.069> or

bed or lying on the couch and reading or
watching<00:04:39.699> movies<00:04:40.240> so<00:04:41.229> I<00:04:41.259> really<00:04:41.800> didn't<00:04:42.039> enjoy

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
watching movies so I really didn't enjoy

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.800 
watching movies so I really didn't enjoy
