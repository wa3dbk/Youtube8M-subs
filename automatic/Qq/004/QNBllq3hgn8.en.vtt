00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.490
 ae ae Joshua was still be guys there 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.500
 okay 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.719
 My name is Bruno. I'm here for today. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 tell you the differences between the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.359
 kick and sm 58 and kgb 5 both legendary 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.430
 microphones microphones to fantastic 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.140
 really really good brands though 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.910
 extremely different 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.740
 Each microphone has its own 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.410
 peculiarity 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.680
 has a very specific sound ah I go 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.809
 show the difference for you today 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.870
 two are plugged a table where to craft 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.329
 a in collected channels there is no change 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 the tonality of both through the table 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.579
 so you will hear the real sound of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.030
 each one of them separately right let's 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.030
 start at the luxury sm 58 dollar 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.670
 this is the sound of xuri m58 will realize 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.430
 which is well-bodied well taken well 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.470
 heavy to eat many forums the staff 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.390
 Usually you say with a voice to 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.210
 any man with a low voice is left with 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.100
 Cid's voice is basically the most 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 to realize that it fills very well 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.380
 the spaces get nice to listen has 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.140
 a reasonable gain is pretty cool and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.420
 main is very very very tough 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.460
 microphone is to last a lifetime the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.540
 forms if you are careful 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.579
 clear for hgb 5 the first thing that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.040
 you can see that he has much more 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.659
 I get a house of 5 he's a microphone 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.680
 that was made to be regulated through 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.000
 of a table 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.280
 then he has a very good weight and a gain 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.920
 high volume and this can be 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.040
 advantageous or not depending on the situation 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.079
 That's why I like it. I say it's him. 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.540
 going out is going to be used with a table you go 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.180
 make a regulation will make an average 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.200
 between the desk and the microphone he 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.340
 will really give you a result 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.640
 positive 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.219
 The jury m58 is a microphone that 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.000
 usually works very well with any 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.310
 appliances even if you 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 simply place it in the box 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.649
 sound 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.319
 not that the house of 5 will not give you a 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.209
 very good result but the 50 s and was 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.640
 made for it is enough 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.010
 balanced 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.170
 so are situations and applications 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.959
 quite different 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.580
 There are 5 people who prefer kgb 5 people 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.950
 who prefers the jury so the 58 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.830
 the two are great microphones both 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.190
 both between choosing a kick a 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.750
 kg will go on hand knocking on the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.920
 microphone will actually have a result 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.110
 very cool and the main durability 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.239
 both the kg when they thought they cherish 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.670
 this is not like any microphones in 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.520
 that is buying around Chinese lines 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.250
 simpler to have these two here 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.620
 durability of 10 15 20 years 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.410
 thing that the common microphone does not 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.630
 lasting more than 2 with keeping the standard 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.820
 says here they were made 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.870
 to face everything that can and can 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.959
 can not 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.250
 then live applications live soundings 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.590
 of bands and etc. 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.580
 they are very interesting today 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.580
 Show me the question. 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.820
 aesthetics of 2 kg 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.540
 it has a distinct look is in 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.209
 relation to the style of the 2558 because they 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.310
 They did something not to remember any of them. 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.280
 another brand is quite a style 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.690
 exclusive kg logo and below 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.370
 relief to black attack is not is not the 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.980
 silver plating that you usually have 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.110
 and there is this little border that also 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.470
 It's interesting this gray model 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.170
 sm 58 everyone copied from them so it's 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.269
 that classic microphone format does not 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.239
 has switch turns off so as kilograms 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.810
 ha has the writing of xuri so from 58 to 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.269
 around 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.549
 and the grill is very bright then it is a 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.769
 Mike really beautiful even 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.720
 having that pattern that is already known 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.730
 of any type of microphone you see 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.620
 in the market today 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.079
 to choose either one or the other will be 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.489

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.600
 What do you want to hear some more of? 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.600
