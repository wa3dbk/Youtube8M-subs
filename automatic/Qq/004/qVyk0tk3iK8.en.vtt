00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.869

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.840
 make more top five Spanish to know 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.300
 if you spoke black or did not do top 5 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.460
 Monthly applications to wish the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.980
 leave there they do not want do not leave 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.199
 a liquid and we'll see how it goes 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.210
 toxic applications in the first with 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.520
 Show time today, cheers are all 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.010
 free public as I said is to use 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 here is what is basically a game 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 which is absolutely fantastic as far as 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.110
 The game is very simple, I'll go. 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.790
 show is simply the face and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.790
 is not strike as much of the game 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:38.909
 in a climate of terror and you do not see 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:42.150
 Nothing and then when they see me the way 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:49.350
 even the door at your only sight is the sound 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:52.799
 sound and at this moment they play through 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.380
 Where do you want to go then you can stay with more 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.500
 strength and study the best by taking 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.270
 such things which they ought not to 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.930
 people paint protoc next to the wall try 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.800
 avoid some things but only 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.580
 can see and can imagine 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.440
 basically how this other 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.720
 process 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.340
 The second question is very funny. 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.380
 I think it's shown also very 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.430
 funny is a time when this 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.380
 easy application 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.590
 basically because it allows you to create and 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.260
 caricatures to brother chance is equal already 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.850
 I'm with you basically face with 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:45.390
 Your photo, for example, I'm going to partner. 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:50.070
 mouth that will turn into a 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.110
 it can save clock can 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.680
 sharing with social networks is a 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.450
 very very funny application is with 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.930
 sure we are the story is 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.360
 happening because it 's a brand day too 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.220
 of the camera is the fifth that the goal is to 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.070
 application basically allows you to 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.940
 manual controls almost on any 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.530
 on the track for example here the use does not 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.480
 it's pretty fast 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.080
 then you have here when you want to enter 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.290
 example the display can see the image 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.130
 more or less, you think, for example? 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.480
 that would be it 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.320
 then come here for seven years and have a 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.610
 lots of things have to choose hdr us 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.050
 to reduce the noise has several several 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.020
 things for people who like photography 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.470
 it's happening its very very good have 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.080
 far from having a lot of options long 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.540
 boring for example you can here 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.340
 can depress will goes projecting can see 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.410
 all this is very interesting this 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.140
 application is free late by fidel 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.480
 implemented the fourth application I 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.550
 because it's an application to be healthy 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.430
 we all spent time over the 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.110
 computer of 15m and practically this 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.420
 application of tourism 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:11.370
 the space is equal to an iphone sensor and 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.880
 behold how I was sleeping 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.120
 also night and 50.00 to 9.50 per 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.880
 Is not it time to go outside at this time? 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.760
 the table wants to leave soon may 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.810
 see here daily future statistics that 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.180
 they can add meals 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.270
 were running how do you feel the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.220
 and is basically a companion and 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.139
 life and health care that no 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.419
 experience that works great 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.210
 important and can experiment in 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.250
 Do not lose anything, I have no application. 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.190
 an application for students like me 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.530
 both high school with 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.139
 University of Engineering is one of the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.389
 application also fantastic and if not 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.690
 have on your ipad or iphone 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.960
 should be the fai this application is is 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:05.870
 absolutely incredible I use is many 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:08.060
 times I was what you want and 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.669
 for example in some way 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.380
 many people know physico-chemical 11th 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:18.430
 year for everything there is something here 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.080
 super complete with a fantastic thing 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.830
 talked to those people have 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.350
 has difficulty converting unit of 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.479
 converters have that many many 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.700
 Forensic things for example if they want 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.100
 know the density of a woman 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.289

 that any student from the south - kimi is 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.410
 one thing you should not know what 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:54.770
 it's win mexico 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.500

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.940
 these are the applications already know if 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.460
 they want to leave there and that parents 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.410
 had more than 300 light 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.870
 it's because it's a thing that people 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.340
 want to see if I would not say it's a thing 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.590
 that it's us who are not very 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.020
