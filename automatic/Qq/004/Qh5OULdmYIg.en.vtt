rotating<00:02:49.060> head<00:02:49.450> looks<00:02:50.170> like<00:02:50.350> we<00:02:50.500> have

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
rotating head looks like we have

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.449 
rotating head looks like we have
rotating<00:02:51.700> arms<00:02:52.390> oh<00:02:53.110> we've<00:02:53.680> got<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> little<00:02:54.340> bit

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459

of<00:02:54.549> hand<00:02:54.910> rotation<00:02:55.299> I<00:02:55.570> think<00:02:55.840> first<00:02:56.500> that

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
of hand rotation I think first that

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.830 
of hand rotation I think first that
might<00:02:56.920> kind<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.790> worries<00:02:58.060> me<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.480> don't<00:02:58.690> know<00:02:58.780> if

might kind of worries me I don't know if
that's<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.140> entik<00:02:59.500> I'll<00:02:59.950> waist<00:03:00.310> rotation<00:03:00.579> we

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
that's a entik I'll waist rotation we

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.870 
that's a entik I'll waist rotation we
can<00:03:01.450> rotate<00:03:01.660> his<00:03:02.230> waist<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.739> little<00:03:03.010> bit<00:03:03.160> some

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
can rotate his waist a little bit some

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.819 
can rotate his waist a little bit some
of<00:03:03.970> these<00:03:04.060> zombies<00:03:04.780> have<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.959> hinge<00:03:05.260> inside<00:03:05.680> we
