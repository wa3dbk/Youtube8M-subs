00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:13.149
 dance of the Vampires 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.209
 is one of the most popular musicals worldwide 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.800
 already more than five million viewers have been enthusiastic about it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.650
 to let 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.750
 In Germany, the vampires are already in Stuttgart Hamburg and last 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.750
 in Berlin her mischief 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.300
 Dance of the Vampires is a parody of that of Peer Shader the onlooker 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 leads into the dark Transylvania 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.510
 The musical based on Roman Polanski's feature film will do much during threesomes 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.219
 Children out 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.510
 and has long reached cult status 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.050
 then I start 600 seats 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.230
 We did not expect so much success 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.530
 that the musical two years intensively then two years in Stuttgart and the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.090
 every performance was virtually sold out. "That was far more than we expected 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.790
 to have 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.580
 just like that, network would be moving in the piece cattle of quirky characters with 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.600
 charismatic night figures 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.640
 And curious happen must be a mixture of humor goose bumps and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 tension 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.450
 Dr Lafontaine what fascinated the audience 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.030
 tell the actors from the Hamburg production 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.540
 I have it there is something in it for everything is possible 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.170
 Dr in nature 88 years old is palpable with the smallest 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 I think it's after his death and dying 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 from each division in what is what they are more expensive 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.189
 very rocking too 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.190
 Modern that people too 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.280
 from Werner 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.570
 and not everything is possible by far 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.929
 the desire partly very dramatic 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.450
 he is recovering 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.210
 and just to find this here is just today with bleeding wounds 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.410
 many people 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.410
 Dr 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.379
 r 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.459
 Michael Kunze made the cult film 100 he wrote the book 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.559
 the lyrics of the piece 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.179
 for me it was clear that 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.449
 to bring the piece to the stage I decide what sense 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:26.669
 before their historical count 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.409
 and this figure 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.999
 a, everything was in it 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.449
 not only good for the world 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:33.699
 these 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.699
 the citizens as soon as possible the whole 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:42.209
 as the percentages story of a young man 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.730
 who has to find his way around the world of vampires 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.289
 and finally percent should I just say my purchase price +11 purchase 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.289
 Percent growing up just what adults 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.849
 The world of vampires is for me the world adults 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.429
 4 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.429
 MR 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:06.959
 Dr 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.690
 Dr 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.129
 another key character of the musical is of course 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.939
 Count von Krolock 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.120
 The beautiful fountain has but also varied pieces of imposing 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:21.719
 Vampire i think no she is just fascinated by his 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:22.979
 charisma 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:23.800
 he has 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.899
 so calculated 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:30.619
 he exudes such a power Zara is just totally fascinated by it 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.619
 all that is new is she does not know that 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.139
 so one hears from the farmers circles or from such a charisma and such 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.399
 a 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:43.239
 Fascination triggers 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.919
 Coburg 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.709
 is a very interesting figure because 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.089
 he lives or is the life of Todt Seitz 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:53.109
 several hundred years 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.019
 Dr HAZ seen everything Kennzahl is nothing you can fool 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.719
 on the one hand, of course, it's great and interesting on the other 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:02.969
 but also one 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.119
 a tragic thing it has one 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:08.359
 certain tragedy 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.629
 because there is for him 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.479
 no beginning and no end 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.479
 no limits 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.219
 on 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.340
 Red 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.430
 Dr 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.430
 he is 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:35.599
 Roman Polanski tells, even if one from the play "With whom the rest 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.240
 Nerlinger I do not think my favorite character is the professor 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.569
 I have achieved a weakness for this type of character Windows 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.009
 Not the Clone Wars 3 the Arrival if you're the professor 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.889
 already played in Vienna Stuttgart and Hamburg 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.099
 the samples were a very special experience when Polanski is still on 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.580
 especially like his favorite role more 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.340
 is actually the one guy that takes care of it 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.860
 so you stop putting 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.150
 and around 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.710
 but also the one of the 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.210
 that's what they're taking right away 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.460
 if it's funny 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.770
 he decides what is funny and what is not so long has a very good one 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.770
 Hands for it 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.150
 now he clearly has that and resembled seven seals 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.819
 of course, by the great costumes 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.209
 how will dance scenes and the fantastic Mr 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:33.809
 Enjoy 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.029
