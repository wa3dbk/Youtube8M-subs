 Continued to adopt fr exceptionally 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.450

 The stance that back door is to be a 3-door hatchback 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.380
 The difference between the two is 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.050

 Turin is green out 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 We used retractable light 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.150

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.929
 Actually run it 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.929
 Power performance was not amazing 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.229
 With a light engine blowup 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.229
 Feeling as soon as sharp response 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.599
 Steering stability can not be said that the prefectural education commission is never high either 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.279
 Conversely using it 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.099

 There were rivals with similar specifications 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.059
 86 is 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.829
 Suggest that 83
