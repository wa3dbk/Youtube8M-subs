00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.340
 Yes, I think we've been without 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.960
 win here but the good thing we came with 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.330
 an illusion of being able to get it 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.340
 we had done great games in 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.260
 difficult fields and we have returned to 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.060
 repeat if there is a penalty not because we have 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.010
 had an option to do the 13th and 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.580
 when that does not happen, then you play 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.980
 suffer 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.930
 the balloons standing on everything that they 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.970
 it has it very well worked have a 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.739
 great punch and we have already suffered but 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.110
 but good has blessed the tele 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.629
 especially if it was approaching again 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.840
 many people and good has returned to live 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.480
 a fantastic night and enchanted and very 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.239
 thankful no doubt that we are seeing 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.579
 the team is very well worked a lot 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.620
 from the first part that we have 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.570
 put forward the second part has 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.680
 touched suffer and the team has worked 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.200
 very much and a victory that 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.180
 and well we go with hope to the three 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.340
 matches and it is clear that we are 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.860
 in front I think that good 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.720
 anoeta is going to explode next week and 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.490
 well let's hope to get a good result 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.290
 and get to the last day as well 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.820
 with that fourth good position we have 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.530
 I'm lucky that the door 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.870
 the team is working is doing 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.820
 good times and I already have that one very 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.280
 happy at the end what I am more 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.479
 tired but I think but not the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.790
 match the chances we 've had 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.610
 we have been more one counting on the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.940
 servant porter those against the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.310
 today but I think we have done a good 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.440
 offensive and defensive work also what 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.420
 How good that I've seen to say little 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.030
 more let's say it's good to 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.020
 beginning to take the site and then I 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.270
 I felt good at my companions 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.410
 that have helped me to be well in the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.840
 field and then yes fear not to leave it 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.930
 doing the best and bringing victory is 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.200
 what I and my colleagues had 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.680
 one goal was to win 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.180
 Of course we know that valence wins 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.500
 1-0 against the getafe but neither 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.420
 we would have put 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.400
 nervous is that we left only what 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.050
 we have to do until the end now 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.580
 well, this is not very important shared 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.230
 good is not against the real madrid of 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.230
 how it came out of them
