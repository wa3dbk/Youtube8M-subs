00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
if they don't get the first serve in

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.410 
if they don't get the first serve in
will<00:01:27.840> hit<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> second<00:01:28.470> sir<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.030> who<00:01:30.030> would<00:01:30.210> win

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
more points out of those hundred serves

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.890 
more points out of those hundred serves
so<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> hundred<00:01:34.500> serves<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
so here we have the hundred serves and

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.620 
so here we have the hundred serves and
well<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.020> take<00:01:37.200> sixty-four<00:01:37.979> percent<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.630> 100

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
well you take sixty-four percent of 100

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.429 
well you take sixty-four percent of 100
that<00:01:40.170> 64<00:01:40.920> first<00:01:41.759> serves<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.570> Federer<00:01:42.960> got<00:01:43.229> in

that 64 first serves that Federer got in

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.310 
that 64 first serves that Federer got in
and<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.100> multiply<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.610> by<00:01:45.110> point<00:01:46.110> eight

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and you multiply that by point eight

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.310 
and you multiply that by point eight
nine<00:01:46.590> eighty<00:01:46.920> nine<00:01:47.100> percent<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.320> federer

out of those hundred serves so he's

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.360 
out of those hundred serves so he's
actually<00:02:57.970> winning<00:02:58.420> more<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> match<00:03:00.190> you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
actually winning more in the match you

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.060 
actually winning more in the match you
one<00:03:00.640> more<00:03:00.880> points<00:03:01.440> when<00:03:02.440> he<00:03:02.590> stepped<00:03:02.860> up<00:03:02.980> to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
one more points when he stepped up to

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.340

the<00:03:03.100> line<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.370> serve<00:03:03.730> then<00:03:04.360> Roddick<00:03:04.870> did<00:03:05.140> and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
the line to serve then Roddick did and

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.650 
the line to serve then Roddick did and
that's<00:03:05.980> interesting<00:03:06.190> because<00:03:06.660> Federer

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
that's interesting because Federer

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.870 
that's interesting because Federer
didn't<00:03:07.900> break<00:03:08.140> erotic<00:03:08.620> until<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.610> very<00:03:09.790> last

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
didn't break erotic until the very last

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.360

game<00:03:10.240> of<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.420> match<00:03:10.630> yet<00:03:11.500> Roddick<00:03:11.980> broke

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
game of the match yet Roddick broke

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.360 
game of the match yet Roddick broke
Federer<00:03:13.120> twice<00:03:13.510> earlier<00:03:14.050> in<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.260> match<00:03:14.440> so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
Federer twice earlier in the match so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.940 
Federer twice earlier in the match so
what<00:03:15.520> that<00:03:15.550> says<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.030> well<00:03:16.720> it's<00:03:17.380> not<00:03:17.530> just<00:03:17.830> the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
what that says is well it's not just the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.380 
what that says is well it's not just the
number<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.340> points<00:03:18.520> you<00:03:18.700> win<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.239> a<00:03:19.270> degree

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
number of points you win to a degree

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.170 
number of points you win to a degree
it's<00:03:19.690> also<00:03:19.930> which<00:03:20.680> points<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.160> win<00:03:21.340> are<00:03:21.520> you

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
it's also which points you win are you

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.490 
it's also which points you win are you
winning<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.540> breakpoints<00:03:23.320> are<00:03:23.380> you

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
winning the breakpoints are you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.460 
winning the breakpoints are you
converting<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:24.790> bigger<00:03:25.090> points<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.840> if<00:03:26.380> you

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
converting the bigger points and if you

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.380 
converting the bigger points and if you
are<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.830> can<00:03:26.980> win<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.220> match<00:03:27.400> even<00:03:27.610> if<00:03:28.120> the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
are you can win the match even if the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.390 
are you can win the match even if the
other<00:03:28.540> guy<00:03:28.680> sometimes<00:03:29.680> wins<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.100> few<00:03:30.280> more

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
other guy sometimes wins a few more

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.330 
other guy sometimes wins a few more
points<00:03:30.670> than<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.660> do<00:03:31.860> now<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.920> question

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
points than you do now the question

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.780 
points than you do now the question
today<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.390> going<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.780> deal<00:03:34.989> with<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:36.340> second

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
today is going to deal with the second

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.040 
today is going to deal with the second
serve<00:03:37.000> percentage<00:03:37.239> there's<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.780> huge

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
serve percentage there's a huge

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.770 
serve percentage there's a huge
discrepancy<00:03:38.770> here<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:40.060> why<00:03:40.270> out<00:03:40.630> of

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
discrepancy here and this is why out of

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.390 
discrepancy here and this is why out of
those<00:03:40.870> hundred<00:03:41.230> serves<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.800> second<00:03:42.190> serves

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
those hundred serves the second serves

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.520 
those hundred serves the second serves
out<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.760> those<00:03:42.820> hundred<00:03:43.150> serves<00:03:43.360> federer<00:03:44.260> is

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
out of those hundred serves federer is

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.800 
out of those hundred serves federer is
winning<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.489> couple<00:03:46.180> more<00:03:46.390> points<00:03:46.630> than

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
winning a couple more points than

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.009 
winning a couple more points than
Roddick<00:03:47.260> is<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:48.600> there's<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.660> number<00:03:49.870> of

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
Roddick is so there's a number of

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.530 
Roddick is so there's a number of
reasons<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.860> not<00:03:51.760> just<00:03:51.880> at<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.120> club<00:03:52.330> level

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
reasons that not just at the club level

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.229 
reasons that not just at the club level
but<00:03:52.780> at<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.959> pro<00:03:53.170> level<00:03:54.000> everybody<00:03:55.000> loses

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
but at the pro level everybody loses

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.030 
but at the pro level everybody loses
more<00:03:55.600> points<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.200> second<00:03:56.560> serve<00:03:56.739> than<00:03:56.950> the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
more points on the second serve than the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.949 
more points on the second serve than the
first<00:03:57.280> serve<00:03:57.489> first<00:03:58.060> serve<00:03:58.360> it's<00:03:58.720> going<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.900> be

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
first serve first serve it's going to be

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.030 
first serve first serve it's going to be
a<00:03:58.989> bigger<00:03:59.200> served<00:03:59.560> you're<00:03:59.739> going<00:03:59.860> to<00:03:59.920> hit<00:04:00.010> it

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
a bigger served you're going to hit it

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.949 
a bigger served you're going to hit it
harder<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.580> your<00:04:00.970> placement<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.570> probably

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
harder and your placement is probably

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.900 
harder and your placement is probably
going<00:04:02.170> to<00:04:02.260> be<00:04:02.350> more<00:04:02.530> aggressive<00:04:02.910> particularly

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
going to be more aggressive particularly

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.220 
going to be more aggressive particularly
at<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.090> pro<00:04:04.269> level<00:04:04.300> those<00:04:04.720> guys<00:04:04.900> are<00:04:05.080> aiming

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
at the pro level those guys are aiming

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.199 
at the pro level those guys are aiming
for<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.500> corners<00:04:05.950> or<00:04:06.250> they're<00:04:06.880> trying<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.090> go

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
for the corners or they're trying to go

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.540 
for the corners or they're trying to go
into<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.600> body<00:04:07.750> on<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.080> first<00:04:08.290> serve<00:04:08.550> second

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
into the body on the first serve second

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.810 
into the body on the first serve second
serve<00:04:09.730> not<00:04:10.390> as<00:04:10.510> much<00:04:10.630> pace<00:04:10.900> more<00:04:11.890> conservative

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
serve not as much pace more conservative

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.910 
serve not as much pace more conservative
placement<00:04:13.780> somewhere<00:04:14.170> probably<00:04:14.680> more

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
placement somewhere probably more

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.070 
placement somewhere probably more
towards<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.340> middle<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.640> service<00:04:16.030> box<00:04:16.239> so

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
towards the middle of the service box so

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.320 
towards the middle of the service box so
the<00:04:17.200> returner<00:04:17.530> can<00:04:17.709> obviously<00:04:17.980> be<00:04:18.330> more

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
the returner can obviously be more

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.680 
the returner can obviously be more
aggressive<00:04:19.690> on<00:04:20.109> those<00:04:20.769> second<00:04:21.160> serves<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.570> the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
aggressive on those second serves so the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.870 
aggressive on those second serves so the
question<00:04:23.020> is<00:04:23.169> well<00:04:23.680> there's<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.580> number<00:04:24.760> of

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
question is well there's a number of

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.640 
question is well there's a number of
other<00:04:25.180> reasons<00:04:25.720> that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
other reasons that

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.499 
other reasons that
you'll<00:04:27.130> lose<00:04:27.310> more<00:04:27.550> second<00:04:28.000> sort<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.210> points

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
you'll lose more second sort of points

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.060 
you'll lose more second sort of points
than<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:28.720> do<00:04:28.840> on<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.050> first<00:04:29.199> serve<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.710> this

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
than you do on the first serve and this

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.400 
than you do on the first serve and this
is<00:04:30.190> an<00:04:30.310> open-ended<00:04:30.820> question<00:04:31.270> so<00:04:31.570> what<00:04:32.290> are

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
is an open-ended question so what are

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.040 
is an open-ended question so what are
some<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.710> those<00:04:32.800> other<00:04:33.009> reasons<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:34.810> can't

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
some of those other reasons you can't

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.080 
some of those other reasons you can't
just<00:04:35.259> say<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.919> two<00:04:36.310> things<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.610> are<00:04:36.789> out<00:04:36.910> for

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
just say the two things that are out for

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.189 
just say the two things that are out for
this<00:04:37.210> or<00:04:37.389> you<00:04:37.479> can't<00:04:37.690> say<00:04:37.840> well<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:38.080> hit

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
this or you can't say well you hit

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.960 
this or you can't say well you hit
harder<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:39.160> placement<00:04:39.400> stuff<00:04:39.759> for<00:04:39.880> those

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
harder and the placement stuff for those

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.939 
harder and the placement stuff for those
are<00:04:40.120> out<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:41.199> you<00:04:41.259> got<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.590> come<00:04:41.680> up<00:04:41.710> with<00:04:41.800> some

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
are out so you got to come up with some

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.529 
are out so you got to come up with some
of<00:04:42.009> these<00:04:42.100> other<00:04:42.310> reasons<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.090> when<00:04:43.449> you

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
of these other reasons and when you

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.990 
of these other reasons and when you
answer<00:04:44.020> show<00:04:44.830> your<00:04:45.039> work<00:04:45.310> don't<00:04:45.669> just<00:04:45.850> say

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
answer show your work don't just say

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.960 
answer show your work don't just say
well<00:04:46.270> it's<00:04:46.539> X<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.199> that's<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.830> give<00:04:48.699> me<00:04:48.820> the

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
well it's X and that's it give me the

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.390 
well it's X and that's it give me the
thought<00:04:49.210> process<00:04:49.810> involved<00:04:50.500> as<00:04:50.620> well<00:04:50.650> so<00:04:51.280> it's

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
thought process involved as well so it's

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.390 
thought process involved as well so it's
going<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.550> be<00:04:51.639> the<00:04:51.850> answer<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.750> think<00:04:53.020> is<00:04:53.400> clever

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
going to be the answer I think is clever

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.060 
going to be the answer I think is clever
or<00:04:54.759> acceptable<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:55.660> you<00:04:56.470> show<00:04:56.710> your<00:04:56.860> work

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
or acceptable and you show your work

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.460 
or acceptable and you show your work
your<00:04:57.190> explain<00:04:57.580> your<00:04:57.729> thought<00:04:57.940> process<00:04:58.419> now<00:04:59.410> I

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
your explain your thought process now I

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.800 
your explain your thought process now I
have<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.860> particular<00:05:00.430> answer<00:05:00.699> in<00:05:01.330> mind<00:05:01.539> of<00:05:01.690> this

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
have a particular answer in mind of this

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.409 
have a particular answer in mind of this
question<00:05:02.320> so<00:05:02.979> it's<00:05:03.010> likely<00:05:03.639> that<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.120> answer

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
question so it's likely that the answer

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.750 
question so it's likely that the answer
that's<00:05:04.570> closest<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.139> what<00:05:05.350> I<00:05:05.410> think<00:05:05.800> one<00:05:06.729> of

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
that's closest to what I think one of

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.060 
that's closest to what I think one of
the<00:05:06.880> main<00:05:07.289> reasons<00:05:08.289> that<00:05:08.500> you<00:05:08.560> lose<00:05:08.800> more

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
the main reasons that you lose more

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.350 
the main reasons that you lose more
points<00:05:09.280> on<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.610> second<00:05:09.940> serve<00:05:10.090> than<00:05:10.300> the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
points on the second serve than the

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.850 
points on the second serve than the
first<00:05:10.600> serve<00:05:10.780> so<00:05:10.810> whoever<00:05:11.169> comes<00:05:11.410> closest

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
first serve so whoever comes closest

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.290 
first serve so whoever comes closest
probably<00:05:12.460> is<00:05:12.520> going<00:05:12.610> to<00:05:12.699> win<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.910> autograph

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
probably is going to win the autograph

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.120 
probably is going to win the autograph
but<00:05:14.080> if<00:05:14.229> somebody<00:05:14.410> says<00:05:14.740> something<00:05:14.770> that's

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
but if somebody says something that's

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.860 
but if somebody says something that's
pretty<00:05:15.280> insightful<00:05:16.030> maybe<00:05:16.389> something<00:05:16.720> I

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
pretty insightful maybe something I

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.540 
pretty insightful maybe something I
hadn't<00:05:17.139> thought<00:05:17.169> about<00:05:17.289> then<00:05:17.770> they<00:05:17.979> certainly

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
hadn't thought about then they certainly

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.750 
hadn't thought about then they certainly
could<00:05:18.940> could<00:05:19.599> come<00:05:19.780> away<00:05:19.990> with<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.199> autograph

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
could could come away with the autograph

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.050 
could could come away with the autograph
as<00:05:21.760> well<00:05:21.820> so<00:05:23.039> when<00:05:24.039> you<00:05:24.160> answer<00:05:24.610> this<00:05:24.729> question
