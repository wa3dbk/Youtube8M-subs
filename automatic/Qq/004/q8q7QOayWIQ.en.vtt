infinite<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:05.770> i'm<00:01:05.860> going<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.009> really<00:01:06.310> swap

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
infinite so i'm going to really swap

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.600 
infinite so i'm going to really swap
like<00:01:07.090> really<00:01:07.689> slam<00:01:07.960> this<00:01:08.140> one<00:01:08.350> BAM<00:01:08.829> there<00:01:09.520> we

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
like really slam this one BAM there we

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.490 
like really slam this one BAM there we
are<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:10.630> that's<00:01:10.750> got<00:01:10.930> me<00:01:11.020> around<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.350> corner

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
are so that's got me around that corner

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.100 
are so that's got me around that corner
so<00:01:11.770> that's<00:01:11.920> pretty<00:01:12.130> useful<00:01:12.399> to<00:01:13.210> actually<00:01:13.659> take

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
so that's pretty useful to actually take

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.800 
so that's pretty useful to actually take
a<00:01:14.140> shot<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.740> I<00:01:15.070> tap<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.880> hold<00:01:16.090> on<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.450> screen

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
a shot and I tap and hold on the screen

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.260 
a shot and I tap and hold on the screen
and<00:01:16.990> then<00:01:17.439> I<00:01:17.530> draw<00:01:17.950> back<00:01:18.310> as<00:01:18.640> if<00:01:18.820> I'm<00:01:19.000> sort<00:01:19.210> of

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
and then I draw back as if I'm sort of

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.109 
and then I draw back as if I'm sort of
drawing<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.659> queue<00:01:20.020> or<00:01:20.049> you<00:01:20.469> know<00:01:20.590> swinging<00:01:21.369> you

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
drawing a queue or you know swinging you

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.029 
drawing a queue or you know swinging you
know<00:01:22.210> holding<00:01:22.899> back<00:01:23.049> a<00:01:23.079> putter<00:01:23.469> I<00:01:23.619> suppose

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
know holding back a putter I suppose

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.249 
know holding back a putter I suppose
then<00:01:24.609> that<00:01:24.640> actually<00:01:25.210> aims<00:01:25.539> forward<00:01:26.170> and

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
then that actually aims forward and

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.709 
then that actually aims forward and
you've<00:01:26.350> got<00:01:26.439> this<00:01:26.530> really<00:01:26.710> useful<00:01:27.219> little

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
you've got this really useful little

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.770 
you've got this really useful little
aiming<00:01:28.719> reticle<00:01:29.439> thing<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:30.939> I'm<00:01:31.030> going<00:01:31.179> to<00:01:31.210> let

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
aiming reticle thing so I'm going to let

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.590 
aiming reticle thing so I'm going to let
go<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.829> then<00:01:33.070> we<00:01:33.219> are<00:01:33.369> we've<00:01:33.520> got<00:01:33.729> got<00:01:34.210> down<00:01:34.420> to

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
one and that's what I'm going to do I'm

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:00.929 
one and that's what I'm going to do I'm
going<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.159> move<00:02:00.249> on<00:02:00.399> to<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.549> next<00:02:00.609> one<00:02:00.759> so

going to move on to the next one so

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.819 
going to move on to the next one so
you'll<00:02:01.119> see<00:02:01.270> there<00:02:01.479> that<00:02:01.509> I'm<00:02:02.170> on<00:02:02.350> kind<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.649> a

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
you'll see there that I'm on kind of a

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.859 
you'll see there that I'm on kind of a
raised<00:02:03.159> angle<00:02:03.729> right<00:02:03.850> now<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:04.210> maybe<00:02:04.359> I<00:02:04.509> what<00:02:04.840> I

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
raised angle right now so maybe I what I

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.889 
raised angle right now so maybe I what I
could<00:02:05.079> do<00:02:05.259> is<00:02:05.909> go<00:02:06.909> straight<00:02:06.969> across<00:02:07.420> that

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
could do is go straight across that

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.230 
could do is go straight across that
because<00:02:08.590> I'm<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.950> raised<00:02:09.280> angle<00:02:09.670> there<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.120> are

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
because I'm a raised angle there we are

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.700 
because I'm a raised angle there we are
brilliant<00:02:10.870> and<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.140> bounced<00:02:11.320> a<00:02:11.440> little<00:02:11.620> bit
