here I'm going to make a little cut what
cut<00:00:57.960> kind<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.469> lets<00:00:58.590> me<00:00:58.739> know<00:00:58.890> where<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> is

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
cut kind of lets me know where it is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.810 
cut kind of lets me know where it is
flipped<00:01:00.930> over<00:01:01.170> you'll<00:01:02.129> find<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> line

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
flipped over you'll find the line

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.840 
flipped over you'll find the line
there's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> line<00:01:03.359> right<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.670> then<00:01:05.670> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
there's a line right here and then this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.710 
there's a line right here and then this
is<00:01:06.000> how<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.180> figure<00:01:06.630> out<00:01:06.659> how<00:01:06.990> long<00:01:07.170> your

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
is how you figure out how long your

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.760 
is how you figure out how long your
contact<00:01:09.720> paper<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> book<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.710> to

yank<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.050> all<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.470> way<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.860> spine<00:04:42.160> which

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
yank it all the way to the spine which

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.190 
yank it all the way to the spine which
is<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.520> good<00:04:42.729> thing<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:43.600> didn't<00:04:43.780> have<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.020> glue

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
is a good thing you didn't have the glue

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.170 
is a good thing you didn't have the glue
otherwise<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:45.520> didn't<00:04:45.669> have<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:45.880> glue<00:04:46.030> the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
otherwise you didn't have to glue the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.030 
otherwise you didn't have to glue the
pages<00:04:46.570> of<00:04:46.630> fall<00:04:46.900> so<00:04:47.260> there's<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.470> little<00:04:47.740> bit<00:04:47.979> of

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
pages of fall so there's a little bit of

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.560 
pages of fall so there's a little bit of
a<00:04:49.590> cut<00:04:50.590> here<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.550> closest<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.030> can't<00:04:52.270> get<00:04:52.390> the

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
a cut here the closest I can't get the

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.860 
a cut here the closest I can't get the
spine<00:04:52.900> of<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.169> book<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.710> right<00:04:54.640> here<00:04:54.820> I'll<00:04:54.910> do

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
spine of the book and right here I'll do

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.170 
spine of the book and right here I'll do
same<00:04:55.990> thing<00:04:58.080> now<00:04:59.080> from<00:04:59.290> here<00:04:59.910> push<00:05:00.910> down<00:05:01.150> on

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
same thing now from here push down on

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.580 
same thing now from here push down on
the<00:05:01.420> top<00:05:02.280> push<00:05:03.280> down<00:05:03.490> on<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.850> bottom<00:05:04.500> open<00:05:05.500> it

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
the top push down on the bottom open it

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.280 
the top push down on the bottom open it
up<00:05:07.260> fold<00:05:08.260> that<00:05:08.530> in<00:05:08.770> from<00:05:09.370> there<00:05:10.080> just<00:05:11.080> like<00:05:11.200> you

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
up fold that in from there just like you

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.320 
up fold that in from there just like you
did<00:05:11.410> with<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.650> two<00:05:11.830> sides<00:05:12.160> do<00:05:12.880> for<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.120> top

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
did with the two sides do for the top

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.840 
did with the two sides do for the top
and<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.600> bottom<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:16.120> side<00:05:16.330> that<00:05:16.450> was<00:05:16.600> cut

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
and the bottom the side that was cut

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.280 
and the bottom the side that was cut
just<00:05:18.850> pushing<00:05:19.270> down<00:05:21.810> now<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:22.840> told<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.200> to

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
just pushing down now I told you to

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.170 
just pushing down now I told you to
mention<00:05:23.620> i<00:05:23.800> mentioned<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:24.370> leave<00:05:24.610> about<00:05:25.120> a

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
mention i mentioned to leave about a

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.660 
mention i mentioned to leave about a
millimeter<00:05:25.600> on<00:05:26.140> the<00:05:26.470> corner<00:05:26.920> if<00:05:27.220> you<00:05:27.370> look<00:05:27.520> at

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
millimeter on the corner if you look at

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.640 
millimeter on the corner if you look at
there<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:27.940> can<00:05:28.090> see<00:05:28.200> very<00:05:29.200> little<00:05:29.290> that's

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
there you can see very little that's

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.320 
there you can see very little that's
because<00:05:29.890> when<00:05:30.040> it<00:05:30.160> folds<00:05:30.430> it<00:05:30.700> will<00:05:30.820> kind<00:05:31.240> of

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
because when it folds it will kind of

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.170 
because when it folds it will kind of
overlap<00:05:32.370> so<00:05:33.370> that<00:05:33.520> kind<00:05:33.700> of<00:05:33.730> takes<00:05:33.940> care<00:05:34.150> of

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
overlap so that kind of takes care of

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.730 
overlap so that kind of takes care of
that<00:05:34.270> if<00:05:34.480> you<00:05:34.570> cut<00:05:34.720> it<00:05:34.810> too<00:05:34.930> short<00:05:34.960> the<00:05:35.410> corner

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
that if you cut it too short the corner

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.790 
that if you cut it too short the corner
of<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.950> book<00:05:36.130> are<00:05:36.250> exposed<00:05:36.700> and<00:05:37.500> well<00:05:38.500> you

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
of the book are exposed and well you

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.250 
of the book are exposed and well you
know<00:05:38.860> water<00:05:39.220> brain<00:05:40.000> all<00:05:40.390> that<00:05:40.690> bad<00:05:40.870> stuff<00:05:40.900> you

don't<00:05:41.380> want<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:41.680> have<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.980> books<00:05:42.160> could

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
don't want to have the books could

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.670 
don't want to have the books could
happen<00:05:42.760> again<00:05:43.570> I've<00:05:43.690> made<00:05:43.900> my<00:05:44.080> cuts<00:05:44.320> here<00:05:44.560> in

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
happen again I've made my cuts here in

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:52.650 
happen again I've made my cuts here in
here<00:05:47.280> press<00:05:48.280> it<00:05:48.430> across<00:05:49.980> open<00:05:50.980> it<00:05:51.220> back<00:05:51.340> up<00:05:51.660> and

here press it across open it back up and

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:03.629 
here press it across open it back up and
again<00:05:53.050> keep<00:05:53.490> pressing<00:05:54.490> down

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.760 

and<00:06:04.150> she's<00:06:04.330> gotten<00:06:04.569> that<00:06:04.810> you<00:06:05.289> should<00:06:05.530> be<00:06:05.620> left

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
with two other things this would be the

with two other things this would be the
part<00:06:07.689> of<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:07.900> spine<00:06:08.169> that<00:06:08.379> you<00:06:08.469> cut<00:06:08.939> all<00:06:09.939> you

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090
