00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.580
 very very well today is a very day 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.130
 special asked me 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.810
 one of my very pretty subscribers 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.980
 watching the inter videos and bars that 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.980
 is going to get married now in august 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.289
 The first thing I want to tell you 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.870
 things that you should keep in mind if you already 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.329
 your wedding date is near there are things 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.989
 that the skin is grateful that they do 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.239
 exfoliating facials all this kind of 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.549
 rituals to beautify the skin but what 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.699
 what else will you be grateful for on your wedding day 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.589
 is that nothing is done at least five days 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.619
 before now some characters in a 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.719
 week others say three days I say 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:01.960
 good at least five days before I do not know 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.390
 do no treatment outside of 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.259
 Normal for your skin do not make any 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.119
 exfoliation very very strong do not taste 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.190
 with new products, that is, do not try 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.690
 new creams or things because they do not know 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.970
 how your skin will react to it 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.640
 finally if they are going to do any 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.100
 self-tanning tanning camera or 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 any of those things also try 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.179
 of not doing it like a couple of days before 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.040
 It is very important also hair removal 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.850
 do not depilate 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.460
 or summarize, remove the eyebrow with thread 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.610
 mustache or any facial hair hours 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.130
 before or a day before at least three 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.500
 or four days in case anything comes out 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.200
 badly have time to review it so that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.420
 get burned or have their eyebrows pulled out 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.600
 or any of those things do it to them 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.850
 I say five days before, it's ideal because 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.400
 then they have time to investigate what 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.740
 do 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.050
 this most important to the days before 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.080
 your wedding or a month before your minimum wedding 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.630
 will be your food and your care of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.490
 the skin then try to eat the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.440
 more vegetables that can be 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.460
 more fruit with vitamin c 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.050
 and vitamin fruits and vegetables in particular 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.270
 If you want, you can take supplements 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.250
 Foods of vitamin C and vitamin E 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.340
 the vitamin is the one that will make your 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.170
 skin and your hair look radiant 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.510
 beautiful and in its best condition and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.160
 vitamin c is going to help them not only 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.450
 not to get sick but also 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.170
 Give that skin health 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.170
 no no 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.260
 the first thing they will do after 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.360
 wash your face wait for it to dry 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.560
 a little while independently if you 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.780
 they make up or if someone else 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.720
 make up after I like to spend a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.640
 little micellar water I think it's something 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.730
 very good nothing more to eliminate 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.239
 any residue that could remain and 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.349
 eliminate excess fat on the face 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.349
 this is going to help a lot 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.400
 Keep in mind that all this process 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.819
 they have to do at least half an hour before 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.370
 of starting to apply your makeup this 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.010
 is so they do not mix like the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.989
 creams and the herodes with the base and those 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.860
 things and can react differently or 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.410
 be of shorter duration 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.160
 the next thing is to apply a tonic the day 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.340
 of your wedding no matter how fatty your 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.710
 face do not use an astringent because it goes 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.260
 to dry your face if you flat 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.780
 they have too much oily skin 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.400
 use our people nothing more in the area 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.860
 of the cheeks and in the area t 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.040
 no more is with his skin care is 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.319
 let them dry the layers that go 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.540
 applying if they let dry the tonic leave 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.909
 dry next I'm going to apply is a 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.950
 zero of vitamin c this is a sample 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:59.650
 that I have being strict is the time 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.450
 to use is camu camu and good has 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.579
 a great concentrate of vitamins and 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.939
 apply it also in the area of ​​your 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.939
 neck 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.919
 apply a serum with vitamin c just 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.980
 before applying your makeup or that of 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.220
 help is going to be like that extra 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.669
 not that the moisturized skin looks juicy and 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.530
 very radiant to make them look beautiful 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.630
 It is very important to exfoliate your 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.750
 lips that's going to help the cells 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.720
 dead ones go 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.550
 of the surface and its labial lasts longer 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.200
 weather 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.150
 then they can do it with the 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.000
 efficient can do with a little 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.580
 sugar I already did it with my brush 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.720
 teeth and the best tip that I can give you 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:57.670
 is to use eye cream and lips 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.270
 the air berlin ay cream d 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.000
 volleyball 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.900
 and I'm going to apply it on my lips 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 and look for a gel because they are less 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.380
 emollients that the creams then does not go 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.890
 to sweat during the day but it's going to 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.950
 keep your areas of hydration very hydrated 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:20.790
 dark circles and his eyelid and this gel also 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.580
 helps to reduce inflammation because the sun rises 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.280
 with 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.379
 with inflamed skin try not to 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.479
 keep awake I say it's crazy always 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.669
 until the last minute but try not to 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.020
 keep awake and try not to ingest 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.479
 alcohol 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.060
 preferably one month earlier so that 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.539
 really do not go to bloated dawn 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.539
 nothing 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.490
 let's wait for it to dry very very 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.620
 ok this first layer and the following 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.570
 that we are going to apply is a cream 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.210
 moisturizer that is also between cream and 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.930
 gel and this is a little heavier this is not 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.930
 it's so much for 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.340
 This is not so much to reduce inflammation 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.030
 to keep hydrated 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.740
 the eye area eyelids and this all 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.449
 this seems like a lot but it's very 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.280
 important that they do it because this is going to 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.260
 keep your makeup in place 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.970
 it's worth investing a little bit 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.740
 more in your skin care and your 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.350
 makeup for that day then yes 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.290
 they have an access to bobbio if they have 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.690
 access to bobby braun for my taste are 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.400
 of the best formulas because they are like 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.650
 between cream gel are not so cream 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.180
 then they help a lot so that the skin does not 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.550
 sude in addition but stay very 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.150
 moisturized to have a face cream 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.940
 moisturizing this is the govern and apply 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:43.150
 the generously in all his face 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:48.160
 and in his neck is very important 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:51.790
 let's let that be we were going to the 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.760
 next step of the story water of 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.320
 mac if they have fix class if they have any 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.870
 sort of makeup fixer from another 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.000
 mark that you can use it too but 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.410
 this really is for mega hydrate the 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.090
 face then let's do very 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.870
 generous and we are going to soak our 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.870
 face with this 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.020
 top-down movements 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.490
 literally so 

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:24.259
 super humid this is one of the tips like this 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.689
 bigger than I have learned from the 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:29.649
 masterclass de mar we are going to wait for 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:29.649
 let this stay
