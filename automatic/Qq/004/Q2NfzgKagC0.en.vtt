00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
that's one of the cool reasons why I

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.710 
that's one of the cool reasons why I
bought<00:01:58.480> this<00:01:58.660> one<00:01:58.870> is<00:01:59.050> because<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.350> has<00:01:59.560> I

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
bought this one is because it has I

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.800 
bought this one is because it has I
guess<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.900> would<00:02:02.050> call<00:02:02.080> file<00:02:02.650> work

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
guess you would call file work

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.450 
guess you would call file work
I'm<00:02:04.810> sure<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.260> actually<00:02:05.620> done<00:02:05.800> by<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:05.980> machine

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
I'm sure it's actually done by a machine

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.930 
I'm sure it's actually done by a machine
but<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:08.100> just<00:02:09.100> thought<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.250> was<00:02:09.490> really<00:02:09.670> cool

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
but I just thought that was really cool

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.180 
but I just thought that was really cool
for<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:11.350> price

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
for the price

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.830 
for the price
so<00:02:13.460> I<00:02:13.490> think<00:02:13.580> focus<00:02:14.150> here<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:17.240> for<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.450> price

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
so I think focus here and for that price

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.770 
so I think focus here and for that price
to<00:02:18.080> get<00:02:18.170> something<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.650> has<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:20.270> cool

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
to get something that has that cool

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.990 
to get something that has that cool
little<00:02:20.990> detail<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.280> know<00:02:22.370> goes<00:02:22.610> into<00:02:22.910> the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
little detail and you know goes into the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.440 
little detail and you know goes into the

Clippers<00:04:48.860> kind<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.880> hard<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.090> do<00:04:50.240> one-handed

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.080 
Clippers kind of hard to do one-handed
and<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.920> guess<00:04:52.100> depending<00:04:52.250> on<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.700> size<00:04:52.940> of

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
and I guess depending on the size of

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.700 
and I guess depending on the size of
your<00:04:53.150> hand<00:04:53.420> that<00:04:53.630> still<00:04:53.930> could<00:04:54.140> be<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.410> little

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
your hand that still could be a little

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.210 
your hand that still could be a little
difficult<00:04:55.160> but<00:04:55.690> I<00:04:56.690> have<00:04:56.720> pretty<00:04:57.530> large<00:04:57.800> hands

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
difficult but I have pretty large hands

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.180 
difficult but I have pretty large hands

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
so it's easy for me to pop it one finger

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.690 
so it's easy for me to pop it one finger
back<00:05:01.430> in<00:05:02.530> it's<00:05:03.530> got<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.710> pretty<00:05:03.950> smooth<00:05:04.250> action

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700
