about<00:03:39.530> one<00:03:40.310> eighth<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.909> an<00:03:41.060> inch<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.390> play<00:03:41.510> on

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
about one eighth of an inch of play on

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.860 
about one eighth of an inch of play on
the<00:03:41.870> steering<00:03:42.319> damper<00:03:43.780> okay<00:03:46.390> want<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.510> tighten

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
the steering damper okay want to tighten

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.140 
the steering damper okay want to tighten
down<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.079> clamp<00:03:48.590> on<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.950> steering<00:03:49.400> damper

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
down the clamp on the steering damper

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:05.680 
down the clamp on the steering damper
with<00:03:50.569> an<00:03:50.900> allen<00:03:51.260> key

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.360 

this<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.840> how<00:04:06.990> our<00:04:07.200> steering<00:04:07.620> damper<00:04:07.800> should

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
this is how our steering damper should

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.490 
this is how our steering damper should
look<00:04:08.580> like<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:09.090> function<00:04:09.750> one<00:04:09.960> since<00:04:10.260> in

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
look like and function one since in

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.190 
look like and function one since in
installed<00:04:11.280> correctly<00:04:11.490> our<00:04:18.019> steering<00:04:19.019> damper

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
installed correctly our steering damper

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.640 
installed correctly our steering damper
is<00:04:19.530> fully<00:04:19.769> adjustable<00:04:21.260> meaning<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.470> could

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
is fully adjustable meaning you could

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.100 
is fully adjustable meaning you could
change<00:04:22.920> the<00:04:23.220> stiffness<00:04:23.760> by<00:04:24.240> going<00:04:24.780> clockwise

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
change the stiffness by going clockwise

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.320 
change the stiffness by going clockwise
to<00:04:25.650> make<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.980> stiffer<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.610> going

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
to make it stiffer and going

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.270 
to make it stiffer and going
counterclockwise<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:28.440> make<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.770> less<00:04:28.950> tip<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
counterclockwise to make it less tip the
