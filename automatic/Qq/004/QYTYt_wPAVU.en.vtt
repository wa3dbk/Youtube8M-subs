00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.920
 lately I feel that my life has 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.379
 become a hell sometimes 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.790
 I wonder why everything can not be 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.910
 like before 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.050
 my wife has left me I have lost everything 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.070
 my house my belongings everything now alive 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.039
 at my mother's house 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.770
 To add insult to injury the other day a group 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.080
 of extortionists of the ku kux klan me 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.080
 They stole the car and hit me a beating 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.550
 sometimes I think that 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.329
 and as if it was not enough today they have 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.749
 thrown out of work 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.710
 you have to put up, say the bad guys 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.710
 times will pass 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.370
 I hold on but I hope nothing is better 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.370
 I'm tired 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.700
 I often remember the gun that my 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.930
 mother keeps in her closet everything could 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.930
 finish so fast 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 at this point if it were not for him and his 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.930
 videos I do not know what would have happened to me 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.930
 maybe I would have a bullet in the skull 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.670
 to tell the truth the only reason why 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.009
 that I keep going home is to be able 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.720
 turn on the computer and see if it has 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.720
 uploaded some new video 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.990
 ah 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.090
 hello, my friends, I came back from beyond the grave 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.450
 to bring you a new video just 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.000
 baked and good as you have already read 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.370
 today I bring you an advanced tutorial 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.370
 equations let's start 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.790
 The first thing they will need is a 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.460
 magical cauldron of potions as ya 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.780
 they will know the cauldrons will be able to get them 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.310
 after rescuing the princess 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.160
 garnett from the clutches of the evil 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.080
 champion as long as of course 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.440
 have also gathered the balls of 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.720
 dragon to go to shadow moses cabe 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.330
 emphasize that all this can only be 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.960
 do from version 2.0 of 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.960
 world 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.130
 I hope it was clear to you what 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.390
 next we will need will be 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.390
 oxygenated water bottles 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.860
 you can get them by trading with 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.470
 villagers 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.480
 although they are also released by sender 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.090
 man at death or if you ask him please 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.080
 now we will have to transform the water 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.239
 oxygenated in magic water that we can 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.020
 do on the craft table or on a 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.170
 Anvil do it where it suits you best 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.170
 Y 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.540
 the longer you leave it better 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.540
 and 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.150
 just like I do 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.010
 the 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.170
 now that we already have the two items that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.590
 we need we can proceed to elaborate 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 Potions 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.459
 For this we will make hydrogen peroxide 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.459
 magic and we will throw it into the cauldron 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:14.810
 well and then the cauldron will return us 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.530
 an elaborate potion the potion us the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.220
 will randomly be careful 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.110
 I hope the tutorial was useful 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.010
