and<00:00:06.340> before<00:00:06.670> we<00:00:06.790> do<00:00:06.910> the<00:00:07.029> scissor<00:00:07.240> over<00:00:07.359> comb

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
and before we do the scissor over comb

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.030 
and before we do the scissor over comb
technique<00:00:07.689> I'm<00:00:08.109> going<00:00:08.290> to<00:00:08.350> show<00:00:08.530> you<00:00:08.559> picking

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
technique I'm going to show you picking

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.610 
technique I'm going to show you picking
it<00:00:09.130> up<00:00:09.280> what<00:00:09.460> I'm<00:00:09.549> actually<00:00:09.760> doing<00:00:10.500> what<00:00:11.500> I'm

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
it up what I'm actually doing what I'm

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.690 
it up what I'm actually doing what I'm
going<00:00:11.799> to<00:00:11.830> do<00:00:11.980> is<00:00:12.070> I'm<00:00:12.160> going<00:00:12.250> to<00:00:12.309> do<00:00:12.430> three

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
going to do is I'm going to do three

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.380 
going to do is I'm going to do three
half<00:00:12.910> closes<00:00:13.480> one<00:00:13.860> two<00:00:15.209> three

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
half closes one two three

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.939 
half closes one two three
and<00:00:16.510> the<00:00:16.720> last<00:00:16.869> one<00:00:17.110> is<00:00:17.199> the<00:00:17.289> full<00:00:17.500> close<00:00:17.740> and

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
and the last one is the full close and

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.109 
and the last one is the full close and
the<00:00:18.010> last<00:00:18.220> one<00:00:18.400> is<00:00:18.460> actually<00:00:18.580> going<00:00:18.880> to<00:00:18.940> take

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
the last one is actually going to take

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.180 
the last one is actually going to take
the<00:00:19.270> hair<00:00:19.449> off<00:00:19.480> so<00:00:20.289> what<00:00:20.440> we're<00:00:20.590> doing<00:00:20.619> is

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.190 
the hair off so what we're doing is

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.850 
the hair off so what we're doing is
we're<00:00:21.490> we're<00:00:22.060> taking<00:00:22.480> bulk<00:00:22.750> taking<00:00:23.350> bulk<00:00:23.620> and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
we're we're taking bulk taking bulk and

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.690 
we're we're taking bulk taking bulk and
then<00:00:23.950> at<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:24.190> very<00:00:24.220> end

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
then at the very end

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.290 
then at the very end
taking<00:00:25.030> length<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.820> we're<00:00:27.940> gonna<00:00:28.030> move<00:00:28.150> the

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
taking length so we're gonna move the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.270 
taking length so we're gonna move the
comb<00:00:28.480> slow

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:32.280 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.500 

you're<00:00:33.280> gonna<00:00:33.399> can't<00:00:33.700> stress<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.120> importance

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
you're gonna can't stress the importance

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.910 
you're gonna can't stress the importance
enough<00:00:34.780> you<00:00:34.899> want<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.110> take<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.350> sickness<00:00:35.710> out

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
enough you want to take the sickness out

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.979 
enough you want to take the sickness out
but<00:00:36.250> leaves<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.670> length<00:00:36.879> just<00:00:37.630> taking<00:00:37.930> a

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
but leaves the length just taking a

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.620 
but leaves the length just taking a
little<00:00:38.170> bit<00:00:38.410> of<00:00:38.500> length<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.090> noting<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.420> hair

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
little bit of length and noting the hair

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.540 
little bit of length and noting the hair
is<00:00:40.750> going<00:00:40.930> to<00:00:41.020> stay<00:00:41.170> back<00:00:41.380> a<00:00:41.650> lot<00:00:41.890> easier<00:00:42.310> and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
is going to stay back a lot easier and

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.740 
is going to stay back a lot easier and
the<00:00:42.610> other<00:00:42.760> thing<00:00:42.940> that<00:00:42.970> happens<00:00:43.360> is<00:00:43.450> when<00:00:43.630> the

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
the other thing that happens is when the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.229 
the other thing that happens is when the
haircut<00:00:44.050> grows<00:00:44.260> in<00:00:44.560> its<00:00:45.489> gonna<00:00:45.820> it's<00:00:46.060> got<00:00:46.210> a

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
haircut grows in its gonna it's got a

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.550 
haircut grows in its gonna it's got a
whole<00:00:46.390> bit<00:00:46.540> shader<00:00:46.780> these<00:00:47.020> are<00:00:47.170> clipper<00:00:47.440> over

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
whole bit shader these are clipper over

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.970 
whole bit shader these are clipper over
comb<00:00:47.680> technique<00:00:49.110> now<00:00:50.110> as<00:00:50.170> you<00:00:50.350> notice<00:00:50.530> the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
comb technique now as you notice the

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.830 
comb technique now as you notice the
Clipper<00:00:51.309> moves<00:00:51.520> fast<00:00:51.880> and<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.360> coal<00:00:52.570> moves

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
Clipper moves fast and the coal moves

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.810 
Clipper moves fast and the coal moves
slow<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.590> slower<00:00:53.890> you<00:00:54.100> move<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.399> comb<00:00:54.579> the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
slow the slower you move the comb the

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.940 
slow the slower you move the comb the
more<00:00:55.000> accurate<00:00:55.540> your<00:00:55.660> haircuts<00:00:56.079> gonna<00:00:56.350> be<00:00:56.530> and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
more accurate your haircuts gonna be and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.170 
more accurate your haircuts gonna be and
you<00:00:57.070> won't<00:00:57.219> have<00:00:57.340> to<00:00:57.460> keep<00:00:57.579> going<00:00:57.880> over<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
you won't have to keep going over the

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.350 
you won't have to keep going over the
same<00:00:58.380> section<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.640> start<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:01.000> little<00:01:01.149> lower

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
same section so start a little lower

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.160 
same section so start a little lower
towards<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.930> bottom<00:01:03.540> as<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.600> can<00:01:04.839> see<00:01:04.989> down

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
towards the bottom as you can see down

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
blend that out a little bit but we're

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:12.889 
blend that out a little bit but we're
gonna<00:01:10.270> leave<00:01:10.479> that<00:01:10.509> step<00:01:10.899> to<00:01:11.079> the<00:01:11.200> end<00:01:11.319> so<00:01:11.979> just

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
gonna leave that step to the end so just

gonna leave that step to the end so just
want<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:13.990> taper<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.469> a<00:01:14.530> little<00:01:14.770> bit<00:01:14.950> closer

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
want to taper it a little bit closer

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.309 
want to taper it a little bit closer
towards<00:01:15.939> the<00:01:16.060> bottom<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.749> then<00:01:17.020> we'll<00:01:17.139> worry

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:17.319 
towards the bottom and then we'll worry

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.629 
towards the bottom and then we'll worry
about<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:17.560> when<00:01:17.770> we<00:01:18.009> get<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.249> the<00:01:18.340> semi

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639 
about that when we get to the semi

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:21.429 
about that when we get to the semi
finished<00:01:18.969> section

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
finished section

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.719 
finished section
okay<00:01:22.439> we're<00:01:22.619> moving<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> opposite

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
okay we're moving on to the opposite

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.160 
okay we're moving on to the opposite
side<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.080> our<00:01:25.229> clipper<00:01:26.189> column<00:01:26.840> or<00:01:27.840> doing

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
side back to our clipper column or doing

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.780 
side back to our clipper column or doing
the<00:01:28.259> same<00:01:28.470> thing<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.280> little<00:01:29.490> clipper

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the same thing just a little clipper

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.899 
the same thing just a little clipper
over<00:01:29.880> comb<00:01:31.190> blending<00:01:32.190> in<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> where<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.729> left

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
over comb blending in to where we left

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.460 
over comb blending in to where we left
off<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> half<00:01:33.960> played<00:01:34.229> over

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
off with the one and a half played over

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.420 
off with the one and a half played over
comb<00:01:36.350> this<00:01:37.350> side<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.159> easier

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
comb this side will be a little easier

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.620 
comb this side will be a little easier
to<00:01:38.520> blend<00:01:38.759> out<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.030> there's<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.450> much

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
to blend out because there's not as much

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.980 
to blend out because there's not as much
of<00:01:39.690> a<00:01:39.869> line

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.640 

so<00:01:45.530> do<00:01:45.890> everything<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.340> can<00:01:46.549> first<00:01:46.940> with<00:01:47.180> your

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
so do everything you can first with your

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.020 
so do everything you can first with your
adjustable<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:48.979> larger<00:01:49.340> comb<00:01:49.520> before<00:01:49.850> we

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
adjustable and the larger comb before we

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.440 
adjustable and the larger comb before we
move<00:01:50.210> down<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.720> smaller<00:01:51.049> comb<00:01:52.330> then<00:01:53.330> we

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
move down to the smaller comb then we

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.630 
move down to the smaller comb then we
pull<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.720> ear<00:01:53.869> down<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.979> I'm<00:01:55.220> just<00:01:55.430> going<00:01:55.580> to

shave<00:01:55.909> in<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.180> little<00:01:56.510> bit<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.740> we<00:01:57.860> see<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.070> little

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
shave in a little bit so we see a little

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.899 
shave in a little bit so we see a little
bit<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.550> a<00:01:58.640> line<00:02:00.070> we<00:02:01.070> don't<00:02:01.250> want<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.460> shave<00:02:01.670> in

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
bit of a line we don't want to shave in

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.139 
bit of a line we don't want to shave in
that's<00:02:02.300> all<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.630> line<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:02.960> need<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.140> see
