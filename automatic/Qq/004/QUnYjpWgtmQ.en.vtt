it hasn't got the stuff that you would

downside of that is the lighting is

downside of that is the lighting is

well the jog wheels are really nice
they're<00:01:29.700> very<00:01:29.729> responsive<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:31.020> feel<00:01:31.320> great

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
they're very responsive they feel great

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.719 
they're very responsive they feel great
they<00:01:33.030> haven't<00:01:33.479> quite<00:01:33.659> got<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
they haven't quite got look the way to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.490 
they haven't quite got look the way to
higher<00:01:36.060> than<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> Sun<00:01:36.540> goggles<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:37.140> some<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
higher than the Sun goggles are some of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.289 
higher than the Sun goggles are some of
the<00:01:37.560> better<00:01:37.680> workout<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.850> swing<00:01:39.090> backs

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the better workout so for swing backs

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.760 
the better workout so for swing backs
and<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.750> they're<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.140> right<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.650> they're

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and so on they're all right but they're

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.289 
and so on they're all right but they're
not<00:01:40.860> perfect<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> said<00:01:42.000> they're

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
not perfect but that said they're

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.440 
not perfect but that said they're
mechanically<00:01:43.110> sound<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.680> can't<00:01:44.220> feel<00:01:44.610> anything

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
mechanically sound I can't feel anything

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.179 
mechanically sound I can't feel anything
that's<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> break<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.070> they

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
that's going to break on them and they

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.950 
that's going to break on them and they
do<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> job<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> big<00:01:48.810> plus

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
do the job so that's that's a big plus

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.499 
do the job so that's that's a big plus
point<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.119> fact<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.329> got

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
point for it the fact that it's got

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.969 
point for it the fact that it's got
filters<00:01:52.610> per<00:01:53.610> channel<00:01:56.030> right<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.540> nice

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
filters per channel right here is nice

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.980 
filters per channel right here is nice
it's<00:01:58.979> also<00:01:59.250> got<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.420> well<00:02:00.600> implemented

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
it's also got really well implemented

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.149 
it's also got really well implemented
RGB<00:02:01.799> pads<00:02:02.100> these<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.119> got<00:02:03.270> hot<00:02:03.509> cues<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.899> them

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
RGB pads these have got hot cues on them

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.839 
RGB pads these have got hot cues on them
let's<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.340> select<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.700> hot<00:02:05.820> key<00:02:05.969> mode<00:02:07.849> they

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
let's just select the hot key mode they

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.750 
let's just select the hot key mode they
go<00:02:09.000> hot<00:02:09.209> cues<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> got<00:02:09.599> up<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.869> top<00:02:09.959> view<00:02:13.760> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
go hot cues you got up to a top view and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.400 
go hot cues you got up to a top view and
you<00:02:14.910> can<00:02:15.090> get<00:02:15.510> delete<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> hot<00:02:15.989> cues<00:02:16.230> by

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
you can get delete the hot cues by

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.750 
you can get delete the hot cues by
pressing<00:02:16.770> shift<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.190> press<00:02:17.370> them<00:02:17.520> again

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
pressing shift and press them again

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.430 
pressing shift and press them again
pretty<00:02:18.000> standard<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.569> there's<00:02:18.989> also<00:02:19.230> a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
pretty standard that there's also a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.790 
pretty standard that there's also a
manual<00:02:20.390> looping<00:02:21.390> mode<00:02:21.599> which<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.989> unusual<00:02:22.709> on

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
manual looping mode which is unusual on

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.369 
manual looping mode which is unusual on
a<00:02:22.830> controller<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.849> set

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
a controller like this you can set

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.390 
a controller like this you can set
manual<00:02:25.379> loops<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:25.860> adjust<00:02:26.190> them<00:02:26.370> by

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
manual loops and then adjust them by

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.309 
manual loops and then adjust them by
holding<00:02:26.819> down<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.300> out<00:02:27.450> point<00:02:27.480> and

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
holding down the in or out point and

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.570 
holding down the in or out point and
moving<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.840> jog<00:02:30.840> wheel<00:02:31.129> so<00:02:32.129> that's<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.430> nice

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
moving the jog wheel so that's a nice

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.940 
moving the jog wheel so that's a nice
feature<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:33.360> got<00:02:33.510> an<00:02:33.660> auto<00:02:33.870> loop<00:02:34.290> mode<00:02:34.650> which

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
feature it's got an auto loop mode which

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.160 
feature it's got an auto loop mode which
is<00:02:35.129> when<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.670> will<00:02:36.060> loop<00:02:36.300> by<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> set<00:02:37.080> amount

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
is when it will loop by a set amount

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.540 
is when it will loop by a set amount
when<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.500> hold<00:02:37.709> down<00:02:37.800> one<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.069> these<00:02:38.160> buttons

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
when you hold down one of these buttons

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.089 
when you hold down one of these buttons
I<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.930> point<00:02:43.230> out<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.410> I've<00:02:43.680> got<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.920> full

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
I just point out that I've got the full

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.670 
I just point out that I've got the full
version<00:02:44.459> Serato<00:02:44.790> DJ<00:02:44.940> running<00:02:45.569> here<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.379> that

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
version Serato DJ running here and that

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.320 
version Serato DJ running here and that
would<00:02:46.830> be<00:02:46.950> slightly<00:02:47.129> limited<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.819> Serato<00:02:48.180> DJ

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
would be slightly limited in Serato DJ

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.240 
would be slightly limited in Serato DJ
intro<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.050> comes<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.069> access

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
intro that comes with it you can access

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.400 
intro that comes with it you can access
the<00:02:50.519> sampler<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.120> switch<00:02:51.300> sample<00:02:51.780> banks<00:02:52.080> it's

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
the sampler and switch sample banks it's

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.380 
the sampler and switch sample banks it's
also<00:02:52.560> got<00:02:52.800> what<00:02:53.430> they<00:02:53.550> call<00:02:53.849> roll<00:02:54.150> which<00:02:54.360> is

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
also got what they call roll which is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.030 
also got what they call roll which is
basically<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.110> same<00:02:55.290> loop<00:02:55.560> mode<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.769> just

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
basically the same loop mode I just

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
basically the same loop mode I just
showed<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:57.150> with<00:02:58.099> but<00:02:59.099> with<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.550> slicing

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
showed you but with but with the slicing

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.619 
showed you but with but with the slicing
so<00:03:00.379> everybody<00:03:01.379> going<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.239> hand<00:03:03.420> but

news<00:03:08.519> similar<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.840> Jack

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.720 

what's<00:03:14.350> happening<00:03:14.680> there<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.490> how

what's happening there is that the how

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.890 
what's happening there is that the how
to<00:03:15.790> stop<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.210> second<00:03:16.510> what's<00:03:16.630> happening

there<00:03:17.050> is<00:03:17.080> that<00:03:17.440> it's<00:03:17.800> doing<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.160> looping<00:03:18.550> but

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
there is that it's doing the looping but

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.640 
there is that it's doing the looping but
underneath<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.870> tracks<00:03:20.110> playing<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.560> when

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
underneath the tracks playing so when

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.720 
underneath the tracks playing so when
you<00:03:20.710> take<00:03:20.890> your<00:03:20.950> hands<00:03:21.190> off<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.400> carries<00:03:21.670> on

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
you take your hands off it carries on

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.880 
you take your hands off it carries on
from<00:03:21.880> where<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.120> was<00:03:22.240> quite<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.540> musical<00:03:22.750> way<00:03:23.560> of

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
from where it was quite a musical way of

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.310 
from where it was quite a musical way of
incorporating<00:03:24.400> looping<00:03:25.150> DJing<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.870> lot<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.110> fun

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
incorporating looping DJing a lot of fun

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.690 
incorporating looping DJing a lot of fun
because<00:03:26.800> you<00:03:26.920> can't<00:03:27.130> really<00:03:27.250> go<00:03:27.370> wrong<00:03:27.550> with

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
because you can't really go wrong with

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.930 
because you can't really go wrong with
it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
it

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.170 
it
so<00:03:28.150> also<00:03:28.690> links<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.460> fact<00:03:31.150> that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
so also links to that is the fact that

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.860 
so also links to that is the fact that
there's<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.480> slicer<00:03:31.990> which<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.650> another<00:03:33.460> way<00:03:33.790> of

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
there's a slicer which is another way of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.850 
there's a slicer which is another way of
chopping<00:03:34.870> up<00:03:34.960> the<00:03:35.050> Beatle<00:03:35.380> I'm<00:03:35.500> letting<00:03:35.770> it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
chopping up the Beatle I'm letting it

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.620 
chopping up the Beatle I'm letting it
play<00:03:36.010> along<00:03:36.250> underneath<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:36.910> also<00:03:37.150> unusual

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
play along underneath and also unusual

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.880 
play along underneath and also unusual
on<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> controller<00:03:38.140> like<00:03:38.320> this<00:03:38.350> actually

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
on a controller like this actually

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.130 
on a controller like this actually
these<00:03:39.520> are<00:03:39.760> trickle<00:03:40.450> down<00:03:40.480> from<00:03:40.630> more

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
these are trickle down from more

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.960 
these are trickle down from more
expensive<00:03:41.410> Serato<00:03:41.950> controllers<00:03:42.550> so<00:03:42.670> good<00:03:42.850> to

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
expensive Serato controllers so good to

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.650 
expensive Serato controllers so good to
see<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.120> on<00:03:43.360> there

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
see that on there

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.940 
see that on there
they're<00:03:43.930> definitely<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.350> plus<00:03:44.530> point<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:44.860> this

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
they're definitely a plus point of this

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.280 
they're definitely a plus point of this
controller<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.490> pads<00:03:45.700> here<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.120> minus<00:03:46.930> point

of<00:03:47.440> this<00:03:47.530> controller<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.130> this<00:03:48.550> tiny<00:03:48.940> little

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
of this controller is this tiny little

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.090 
of this controller is this tiny little
pitch<00:03:51.000> control<00:03:52.000> here<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.800> reason<00:03:54.040> that's

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
is a bigger unit you know it's going to

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.100 
is a bigger unit you know it's going to
appeal<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.240> slightly<00:04:07.480> different<00:04:07.630> audience

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
appeal to a slightly different audience

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.720 
appeal to a slightly different audience
due<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.380> its<00:04:08.500> size<00:04:08.710> and<00:04:08.740> so<00:04:09.070> on<00:04:09.220> but<00:04:09.610> the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
due to its size and so on but the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.640 
due to its size and so on but the
Mixtrack<00:04:10.000> Pro<00:04:10.090> 3<00:04:10.480> you've<00:04:10.930> got<00:04:11.050> a<00:04:11.080> hundredth<00:04:11.560> of

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
Mixtrack Pro 3 you've got a hundredth of

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.950 
Mixtrack Pro 3 you've got a hundredth of
a<00:04:11.740> BPM<00:04:12.160> easily<00:04:12.760> when<00:04:13.330> you're<00:04:13.450> adjusting<00:04:13.540> there

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
a BPM easily when you're adjusting there

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.150 
a BPM easily when you're adjusting there
so<00:04:14.110> if<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.260> want<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.440> use<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.680> for<00:04:14.709> manual<00:04:15.040> beat

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
so if you want to use it for manual beat

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.440 
so if you want to use it for manual beat
matching<00:04:15.400> you're<00:04:15.880> going<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.060> find<00:04:16.270> it<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.419> bit

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
matching you're going to find it a bit

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.940 
matching you're going to find it a bit
easier<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.900> do<00:04:17.080> it<00:04:17.200> on<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.380> controller<00:04:17.739> with<00:04:17.919> a

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
easier to do it on a controller with a

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.039 
easier to do it on a controller with a
slightly<00:04:18.370> finer<00:04:18.580> control<00:04:19.000> here<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.780> said

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
slightly finer control here that said

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.750 
slightly finer control here that said
you<00:04:20.260> can<00:04:20.530> beat<00:04:20.830> much<00:04:21.010> on<00:04:21.190> this<00:04:21.340> if<00:04:21.459> you're<00:04:21.580> used

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
you can beat much on this if you're used

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.150 
you can beat much on this if you're used
to<00:04:21.880> using<00:04:22.320> turntables<00:04:23.320> you're<00:04:23.860> not<00:04:23.980> going<00:04:24.100> to

Gemini that I've seen in many years and

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:23.629 
Gemini that I've seen in many years and
certainly<00:06:22.559> the<00:06:22.769> one<00:06:22.889> that<00:06:23.009> I<00:06:23.069> find<00:06:23.309> it<00:06:23.399> easiest

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
certainly the one that I find it easiest

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.369 
certainly the one that I find it easiest
to<00:06:23.729> recommend<00:06:24.179> now<00:06:24.749> there<00:06:24.899> is<00:06:24.990> another<00:06:25.199> one

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379 
to recommend now there is another one

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.279 
to recommend now there is another one
called<00:06:25.709> the<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:26.429> slate<00:06:26.699> 4<00:06:27.119> and<00:06:27.629> that<00:06:27.809> has<00:06:27.990> four

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
called the the slate 4 and that has four

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.230 
called the the slate 4 and that has four
channels<00:06:28.709> up<00:06:28.829> the<00:06:28.919> middle<00:06:29.189> instead<00:06:29.969> of<00:06:30.059> two

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
channels up the middle instead of two

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.909 
channels up the middle instead of two
and<00:06:30.509> that<00:06:30.569> unlocks<00:06:30.929> four<00:06:31.199> channels<00:06:31.529> in<00:06:31.619> Serato

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
and that unlocks four channels in Serato

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.949 
and that unlocks four channels in Serato
so<00:06:32.219> if<00:06:32.309> you're<00:06:32.429> interested<00:06:32.610> in<00:06:32.819> four<00:06:33.089> channel

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:33.959 
so if you're interested in four channel

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:35.509 
so if you're interested in four channel
DJing<00:06:34.319> that<00:06:34.499> might<00:06:34.709> be<00:06:34.829> the<00:06:34.919> one<00:06:35.039> to<00:06:35.189> look<00:06:35.309> at

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:35.519 
DJing that might be the one to look at

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:38.480 
DJing that might be the one to look at
but<00:06:36.119> this<00:06:36.269> has<00:06:36.419> been<00:06:36.629> the<00:06:36.929> slate<00:06:37.499> to<00:06:37.889> review
