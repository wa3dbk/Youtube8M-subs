has anyone ever heard of the Subaru Brat
in<00:00:02.700> real<00:00:03.689> life<00:00:03.899> like<00:00:04.200> I've<00:00:04.589> never<00:00:04.830> heard<00:00:05.009> I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
in real life like I've never heard I

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.760 
in real life like I've never heard I
didn't<00:00:05.400> know<00:00:05.490> it<00:00:05.549> was<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> real<00:00:05.910> car<00:00:06.180> like<00:00:06.960> why

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
didn't know it was a real car like why

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.640 
didn't know it was a real car like why
would<00:00:08.010> Subaru<00:00:08.580> go<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.389> build<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.719> car<00:00:09.960> it's<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
would Subaru go and build a car it's a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.070 
would Subaru go and build a car it's a
you<00:00:10.830> essentially<00:00:11.429> right<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.120> think<00:00:12.960> that's

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
you essentially right I think that's

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.660 
you essentially right I think that's
what<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.290> classification<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.130> then<00:00:14.580> it

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
what the classification is and then it

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.580 
what the classification is and then it
has<00:00:14.790> two<00:00:15.030> seats<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.599> trunk<00:00:15.900> because<00:00:16.080> why

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
has two seats in the trunk because why

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.640 
has two seats in the trunk because why
the<00:00:16.619> hell<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.690> so<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> don't<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.199> know<00:00:19.410> I

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the hell not so I don't really know I

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.010 
the hell not so I don't really know I
feel<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.430> they're<00:00:20.699> an<00:00:20.820> Australian<00:00:21.689> thing

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020

need back street tires I prefer those to
drift<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.050> other<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> want<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> try

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
drift on other I I kind of want to try

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510 
drift on other I I kind of want to try
drifting<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.440> those<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.039> see<00:00:53.309> what

drifting on those just to see what
happens<00:00:54.590> I'll<00:00:55.590> save<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.010> another<00:00:56.039> time

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
happens I'll save it for another time

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
those don't look as good as I thought

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.729 
those don't look as good as I thought
now<00:00:59.000> let's<00:01:00.000> lower<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.359> down<00:01:00.420> first<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.620> what

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
now let's lower this down first see what

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.329 
now let's lower this down first see what
that<00:01:01.859> does<00:01:02.160> oh<00:01:02.840> it's<00:01:03.840> pretty<00:01:03.989> cool<00:01:04.339> that's

pretty cool actually oh they look kind
of<00:01:09.240> dumb<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.740> yellow<00:01:11.040> goes<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.700> going

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
of dumb but the yellow goes so I'm going

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.380 
of dumb but the yellow goes so I'm going
with<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:13.700> that's<00:01:14.700> pretty<00:01:14.970> cool

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
with it that's that's that's pretty cool

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.789 
with it that's that's that's pretty cool
what<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.439> thousand<00:01:17.130> four<00:01:17.460> hundred<00:01:17.670> pounds

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
what it's a thousand four hundred pounds

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.399 
what it's a thousand four hundred pounds
how<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.460> light<00:01:21.020> flywheel<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.140> don't

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
how is it so light flywheel I don't

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.810 
how is it so light flywheel I don't
think<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.680> need<00:01:22.830> too<00:01:23.009> much<00:01:23.130> horsepower<00:01:23.580> this

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
think we need too much horsepower this

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.240 
think we need too much horsepower this
considering<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.509> were<00:01:25.020> thousand<00:01:25.979> four

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
considering we were thousand four

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.100 
considering we were thousand four
hundred<00:01:26.430> pounds<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.270> think<00:01:27.540> that's<00:01:27.780> perfect

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
hundred pounds I think that's perfect

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.469 
hundred pounds I think that's perfect
for<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:29.630> wait<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.720> second<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.590> too<00:01:31.799> bad<00:01:32.479> too

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
for it wait a second it's too bad too

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.760 
for it wait a second it's too bad too
bad

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
