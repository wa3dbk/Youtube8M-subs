00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.030 
wondering this read the silver and the
eye<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:22.480> all<00:02:23.480> paint<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.290> that's<00:02:24.470> nice<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.920> think

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
eye is all paint so that's nice I think

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.820 
eye is all paint so that's nice I think
that<00:02:25.490> was<00:02:25.580> nice<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.940> they<00:02:26.060> included<00:02:26.360> that

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
that was nice that they included that

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.810 
that was nice that they included that
but<00:02:27.830> um<00:02:27.980> yeah<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.850> yeah<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:31.130> he<00:02:31.490> doesn't<00:02:31.730> have

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
but um yeah and yeah so he doesn't have

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.460 
but um yeah and yeah so he doesn't have
any<00:02:31.970> other<00:02:32.150> modes<00:02:32.420> except<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> giant

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
any other modes except for the giant

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.770 
any other modes except for the giant
robot<00:02:33.770> mode<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.700> when<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:34.880> get<00:02:35.090> if<00:02:35.240> I<00:02:35.360> get<00:02:35.570> the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
robot mode so when I get if I get the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.330 
robot mode so when I get if I get the
other<00:02:36.940> vehicles<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.270> then<00:02:39.220> I'll<00:02:40.220> do

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
other vehicles and then I'll do

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.770 
other vehicles and then I'll do
individual<00:02:40.880> reviews<00:02:41.210> for<00:02:41.390> them<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.690> then

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
individual reviews for them and then

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.750 
individual reviews for them and then
probably<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.770> know<00:02:42.890> combine<00:02:43.340> them<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:43.700> make

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
probably you know combine them and make

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.210 
probably you know combine them and make
the<00:02:44.750> big<00:02:44.930> robot<00:02:45.110> or<00:02:45.470> something<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.040> do

about<00:04:01.610> these<00:04:01.910> things<00:04:02.209> is<00:04:02.540> they<00:04:03.500> are<00:04:03.620> made<00:04:03.860> in

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
about these things is they are made in

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.100 
about these things is they are made in
mind<00:04:04.190> but<00:04:04.820> they<00:04:05.120> do<00:04:05.180> not<00:04:05.420> attach<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.989> old

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
that's that's little disappointing but

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.650 
that's that's little disappointing but
you<00:04:17.660> know<00:04:17.900> oh<00:04:18.140> well

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.320 

would<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.690> pick<00:04:23.140> will<00:04:23.920> where<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:24.880> recommend

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
would I pick will where I recommend

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.510 
would I pick will where I recommend
these<00:04:25.860> um<00:04:27.510> not<00:04:28.710> individually<00:04:29.710> probably<00:04:30.430> if

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
these um not individually probably if

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.550

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you see like the whole set probably pick

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.240 
you see like the whole set probably pick
them<00:04:32.680> up<00:04:32.770> because<00:04:34.140> this<00:04:35.140> robot<00:04:35.620> looks<00:04:35.980> pretty

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250
