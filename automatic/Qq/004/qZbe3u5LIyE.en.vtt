00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.969
 hello to all this if I am not mistaken it is mine 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.990
 fourth proposal for neal art for san 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.230
 valentine 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.759
 I'm having fun but I'm doing more 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.189
 or not all of them enough 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.460
 simple this for example is realized 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.680
 with the stamping stencil where I am e 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.320
 that there of essence then products 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.420
 so it makes available and fanciful and there 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.040
 want a moment calculated that I am going to 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.600
 come out so I did this fifth 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.820
 uses all of those products 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.550
 they dry quickly in doing everything 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.380
 I will have taken at most 20 minutes 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.660
 obviously this is my idea you can 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.000
 play based on the molds you have 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.710
 in short, you want the colors you want 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.210
 however you prefer to leave you at 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.510
 Simple tutorials will join hours instead 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 Hello 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.790
 first thing I went to hang out 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.380
 a base on all nails and here 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.930
 used active pupal growth 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.619
 as color instead chosen lasting color 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.590
 January 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.469
 this is the number 0 20 a color 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.259
 black cherry and very covering and therefore 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:17.710
 let's say he married well with mine 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.540
 hurry because with a pass I had 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.820
 solved the problem and the asean color 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.049
 yellow gel effect really dry 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.220
 very fast to speed up 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.260
 further drying times 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.490
 I also went to apply I read 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.490
 China dries enamel 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.990
 at this point it is the turn of the stand 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.330
 ping out of the box thing 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.850
 very important if new goes to 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.310
 eliminate the plastic in at that protects 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:52.100
 precisely the plater await my scraper 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.500
 a spatula and the brino team here 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.050
 I use white enamel right with 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.100
 the specifics for nail art by per per 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.649
 essence stamping with a file I go 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.909
 even a buffer soul I'm going to dull 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.610
 also the brino team and this is a 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.090
 trick to better succeed him 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.280
 I choose my decoration I go to 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.300
 pass over the white enamel that 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.830
 which I chose eliminates the excess I go 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.630
 above by pressing with the trim 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.519
 the brino team and then i go then to 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.519
 press on the nail surface 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.380
 was obviously careful to watch the 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:38.390
 decoration to see how to position it 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.190
 on the nail then in a sheath at random is 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.230
 obviously the decoration moves 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.790
 on the nail he takes a soaked disk 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.940
 of nail polish remover and I go to 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.500
 remove the nail polish here 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.260
 this time the decor on the circle changes 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.030
 little heart because this I want to go to 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.030
 then apply over the rings 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.040
 same thing eliminates excess press the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.420
 brino team that I have previously 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.880
 therefore opacified at each step the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.900
 We press the opaque re brino team 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.150
 on the nail and this moves 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.739
 very good time to stop the stamping 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.810
 practically already under once 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.400
 is transferred to the nail mi 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.170
 I recommend however with the tenors cap 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.850
 passed too many times over the decoration 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.989
 otherwise you risk melting it and 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.760
 pull it away 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.230
 however, I hope so much to you both 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.840
 also liked this proposal of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.340
 in art for Valentine's Day and 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.390
 I send you a kiss and see you at 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.390
