00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.980
 this month 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.500
 hi people as you see I am already 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.660
 I'm super happy holiday already 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.689
 taken out to study, it was finished to review 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.439
 finished the notes all that and 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.590
 Summer finally starts a very summer 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.360
 long I hope it 's long in the 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.579
 that I have a lot of plans that I'm going to 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.349
 share with all of you because that 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.410
 ad that probably opens a channel 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.200
 of blogs because they will not be daily blogs 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.489
 but it's going to be blog quite often already 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.610
 from here on, I will keep it 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.960
 already throughout the year not only in summer 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.890
 but good as those subjects do already 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.800
 I will speak at another time because now it is 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.300
 time is the time to show you three 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.920
 little things that have come to me from two 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.210
 online pages and well well be it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.770
 first I am going to talk about the page of 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.660
 leslie how good I will leave you all 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.850
 links in the information box by 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.379
 if you want to take a look and less 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.049
 teach the two things that first 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.470
 place is this pendant that is a heart 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.650
 to see if you see it 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.870
 in golden color what good this plastic 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.730
 the truth but I like it because it is very 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.680
 subtle is very tiny and stays very 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.780
 stuck to the neck in fact you can 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.300
 adjust because you have the chain is 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.370
 so you can put everything stuck or 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.280
 detached that you want but to me 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.930
 like in plan chokers and pegadito and 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.310
 good anyway you're going to see how 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.310
 it remains because you have suffered 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.690
 many times I put clips and so 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.090
 at the end of the video you will leave an outfit 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.820
 complete with the three little things the second 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.100
 they sent me from 3leaf is a monkey in 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.520
 white now for the summer that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.990
 is this 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.179
 right now it will not be absolutely 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.860
 nothing good will be seen that has here about 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.370
 lace 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.960
 the back is like that the only thing that I have 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.210
 had a problem with this monkey because 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.580
 I measured myself to ask for the size 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.350
 I was asking for m and it turns out that it is super big 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.930
 I should have asked for a s but good 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.610
 I do not know I got in and they gave me the m but 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.619
 it turned out that not then there was a problem 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.500
 with that and my mother has had it for me 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.920
 fix then I put it on 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.990
 with the back crossed then like that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.210
 hold me more thrown up pull down 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.400
 and I'm much more beautiful and I also 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.910
 saw here on the side because if you see 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.700
 it's pretty low-cut on the side they have a 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.440
 great neckline itself a big opening but 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.610
 Well right now it does not look very good but 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.980
 do not worry you're going to see it 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.080
 afterwards and well the fabric is a bit 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.510
 transparent but whenever I have a 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.640
 meat underwear perfectly the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.340
 back you know with this or we go without 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.800
 bra or we put is that I do not know 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.560
 how is she but good the glasses these 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.750
 the breasts I want to be breasts or 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.000
 I do not know, I do not know, but we're good 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.100
 we put something we put anything 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.780
 and if not then those that we have little then 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.360
 we can go without bra that there is not 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.010
 no problem and the back stays 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.440
 totally to the air anyway I 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.760
 I'm going to use this monkey especially 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.190
 to go to the pool and on the beach 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.110
 because as it is white it must stand out 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.640
 much more in brunette then 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.260
 it probably comes from the strip of 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.480
 bathing suit color so pretty 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.480
 striking that as I do not care and I 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.150
 I know it will look good 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.159
 very well and finally I'm missing the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.349
 shoes to complete the outfit that 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.629
 I ordered in fashion pills I gave it to me 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.580
 grandma because she wanted to but go what 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.970
 taken as a gift of meets with 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.069
 These black crabs that I love 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.030
 At first I doubted whether to return them or 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.970
 not because he was at all 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.260
 convinced but I do not know now they change 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.910
 for nothing in fact I think they are the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.610
 shoes that I wear the most this summer 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.019
 where this summer this June that 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.860
 for me it's been summer but he has not 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.810
 been summer and well I like a lot are 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.760
 store Fashion pips from the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.349
 shoes is not a collaboration but you 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.079
 I say that if anyone wants to make a 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.910
 order or something and it was not registered it 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.260
 You can record saying that I have been 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.720
 the one that has sent you I do not know if it's a 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.550
 code 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.040
 or my email but I'll leave it 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.920
 in the information box that is like 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.140
 although either client and not 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.940
 collaborative as they reward me 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.290
 I think something of that just as if you 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.269
 Then you send a friend as she 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.310
 they reward you and nothing 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.810
 just in case you feel like it and now 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.609
 the time comes 10 hype you will be 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.010
 hoping it is to see how it is put 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.280
 so I do not roll up anymore 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.280
 why
