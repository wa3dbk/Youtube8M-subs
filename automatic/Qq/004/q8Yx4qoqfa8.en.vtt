00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.980
 fast and is neither on technical video on 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.529
 sung is a video of art in make 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.480
 up nothing is just for the news that 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.340
 of course it makes me very much 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.690
 happy for the development they also became a 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.820
 you 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.080
 I wanted to tell you precisely that tomorrow Thursday 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.220
 April 11th I'll be on raidue in the program 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.440
 of baternal caterina 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.269
 said fact that I also explain to you 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.640
 quickly so to understand how I am from 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.879
 do because they select you know but which 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.070
 you do it then it is a program where there is 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.629
 are various tutorials of all the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.750
 types ranging from dow live stylist to make 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.990
 up artist to the gardener to the cook e 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.149
 pizzaiolo who could in short everything 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.090
 and therefore a very nice program that 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.759
 it really serves to teach things really 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.660
 simple but very particular then but 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.130
 but there are things that one can imagine 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.539
 maybe he says how nice who knows how to do it 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.099
 in reality they are very simple fabio 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.720
 saw really cute hairstyles is 

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:26.539
 it's really easy to do 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.399
 and four moves so I recommend 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.530
 anyway if not regardless of whether 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.369
 you haven't seen him give a look again 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.050
 however I have got to see with 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.569
 the bet you produce is not a program 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.160
 there is to much found it very 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.890
 pretty especially a little for all 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.660

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.310
 of manicure evin and the art 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.280

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.989
 for DIY manicure for enel art 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.020
 we always say do it yourself so what it is 

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:56.130
 very easy to reproduce by everyone 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.040

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.490
