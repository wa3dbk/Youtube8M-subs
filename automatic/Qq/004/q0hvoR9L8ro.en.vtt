00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.799
 you can little hen love it's 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.240
 mister manic is so today we are 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.880
 found for a new video 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.519
 commented on call of duty black ops 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.220
 first of the name it is a scrum 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.619
 general on the map little radiation then 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.109
 little presentation of my class I 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.500
 was playing with age and May 11 at all and and 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.879
 ghosts was aiming for solid and marathon in 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.000
 secondary I had put the pythons 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.969
 akimbo but that I will not use the 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.460
 king in accessory a small dead key and 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.800
 my combination of kubrick was the drone 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.530
 the blackbird and the attack dogs 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.780
 very effective to quickly have the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.340
 enemy positioning especially that 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.890
 I noticed there are not many who 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.809
 play as a ghost in general melee and 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.019
 then it was easier to have 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.109
 you're boring who afterwards make a real 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.910
 carnage then here I have eleven it's a 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.979
 very good weapon that you unlock a 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.140
 time you bought all the rifles 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.420
 assault site a burst weapon but 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.280
 versatile it is effective at the body to 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.409
 body thanks to its excellent rate of 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.560
 shot but also effective by far 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.110
 thanks to its sublime precision why 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.570
 did I use the adjective sublime this 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.619
 does not matter we do not care but everything 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.079
 what I can tell you is that there 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.140
 all aim solid with age and 11 that 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.640
 makes a very good alliance because 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.729
 you'll be able to see it fast 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.700
 draw a lot to the judge and so is with 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.990
 the huge firing rate of ag 11 is 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.149
 solid old asset 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.180
 to say the enemy can not do anything 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.380
 do everything that's pretty special 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.290
 in this gameplay is that it's a 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.149
 attempt 32 ratio so good you the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.670
 know in general melee you have to do it 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.310
 can do maximum peace so it's 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.530
 either I'm going to die 0 x or I'm going 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.390
 to die once or so maybe 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.130
 I will die more times after all 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.149
 it's just an attempt at play does not say 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.439
 not if I will succeed the doc otherwise you 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.080
 have seen it in the introduction 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.390
 I will propose this gameplay to the chain 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.330
 community code qg so that I 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.850
 thanks obviously if he accepts 2000 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.570
 claude so what I'm going to do is 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.800
 a little presentation of my channel 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.560
 so my channel listened to the basics and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.360
 bomba on the main call of duty pts 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.520
 the old black ops one because I love 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.960
 this call of duty 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.240
 I do small live sometimes can 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.220
 also some offline gameplay I'm 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.660
 do not consider it a performance day 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.270
 but it's true that on be1 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.850
 I still manage to do very 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.340
 beautiful parties so I also like 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.460
 some concepts in place had some 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.340
 fun concepts I also do time in 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.250
 time some let's play small 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.730
 puzzling little fun compilation 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.320
 live with other people 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.940
 frankly I think this chain 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.290
 the means they please you 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.120
 I already have a thousand subscribers it is especially if 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.070
 you like the call of duty sorting 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.140
 like black ops 1 and black up from there 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.460
 for sure this channel is made for 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.030
 you but at least what I you 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.700
 proposes is to try to make a 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.490
 little trick and see if you like it 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.190
 and why not even after you 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.960
 subscribe so otherwise at the passage there you 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.320
 can see I'm unfortunately dead 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.240
 a first time because of an rc-xd 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.040
 so it's true that black ops a ya 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.080
 plus a lot the level on that the 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.880
 end like on most old 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.680
 codes but that's also what makes you 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.780
 take the most pleasure it is the fact 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.650
 that they have less level less than 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.180
 good players and so have made 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.330
 best parts and therefore inevitably 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.710
 takes more pleasure to play there too 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.840
 not for that I like black ops to 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.490
 angers but also a lot how that 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.770
 game is done and it's also my first 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.350
 call of duty therefore necessarily agitated 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.290
 more in love with this code 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.390
 so in any case I hope that the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.840
 gameplay please e 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.490
 he will soon get to nice so in 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.890
 Anyway I hope you have enjoyed 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.270
 do not hesitate to leave a baby 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.660
 a small comment 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.070
 and why not come to subscribe to 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.950
 my channel me it would make me very happy 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.630
 to see new subscribers disembark 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.630
 a so again great thanks to 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.640
 subject code if he accepts 2000 claude there 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.250
 you will be able to see that he does not 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.390
 remained more than one to make 1 32 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.610
 ratio is unfortunately I'm getting 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.010
 kill just before so finally I 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.110
 finished on 1.30 to 2 1 15 of ratio better 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.090
 it's still in great gameplay 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.710
 I hope you enjoy me 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.310
 tell the next people for a 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.850
 new video 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.850
