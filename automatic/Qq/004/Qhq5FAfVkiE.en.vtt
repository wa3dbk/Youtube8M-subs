anyways<00:03:01.569> I'll<00:03:01.780> start<00:03:02.019> downloading<00:03:02.439> and<00:03:02.889> um

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
anyways I'll start downloading and um

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.559 
anyways I'll start downloading and um
yeah<00:03:05.739> basically<00:03:06.459> all<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:06.879> have<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.150> do<00:03:07.299> just

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
yeah basically all you have to do just

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:18.910 
yeah basically all you have to do just
wait<00:03:07.689> for<00:03:07.900> all<00:03:08.139> to<00:03:08.379> download<00:03:08.760> download

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.200 

the<00:03:19.400> launched<00:03:19.940> or<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:21.020> launching<00:03:21.680> because

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
the launched or is launching because

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.700 
the launched or is launching because
yeah<00:03:23.210> not<00:03:23.690> only<00:03:23.720> took<00:03:23.990> like<00:03:24.080> one<00:03:24.500> more<00:03:24.650> minute

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
yeah not only took like one more minute

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.440 
yeah not only took like one more minute
so<00:03:25.250> I'm<00:03:25.430> assuming<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:25.910> download<00:03:26.150> takes

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
so I'm assuming this download takes

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.020 
so I'm assuming this download takes
about<00:03:26.540> five<00:03:26.990> minutes<00:03:27.410> with<00:03:28.010> average<00:03:28.550> internet

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
about five minutes with average internet

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.000 
about five minutes with average internet
so<00:03:30.020> let's<00:03:30.050> see<00:03:30.790> program<00:03:31.790> ash<00:03:31.970> bonding<00:03:33.010> it's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
so let's see program ash bonding it's

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.110 
so let's see program ash bonding it's
probably<00:03:34.370> just<00:03:34.550> because<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.880> first

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
probably just because it's the first

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:44.820 
probably just because it's the first
time<00:03:35.530> or<00:03:38.140> yeah<00:03:41.410> come<00:03:42.410> on

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830
