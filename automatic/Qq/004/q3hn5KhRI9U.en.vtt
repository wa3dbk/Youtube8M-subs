00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.180
 to prepare the salt dough for i 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.070
 our children need these 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.070
 few and simple ingredients 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:25.189
 of salt and water and possibly 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.050
 more vinyl glue if we want 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.570
 color enough salt for ours 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.019
 children that we can use or gods 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:38.949
 food or spice dyes 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:41.690
 colored like africa and curry or 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.830
 of the old tricks we don't use 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.469
 more or anything else can 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.719
 color the pasta for our children 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.350
 let's see how to prepare the pasta 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.350
 of salt 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.510
 we use 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.510
 as a measure 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.130
 a glass or a jar of yogurt or 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.420
 a cup 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.549
 in this case I use a cup 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.119
 to prepare this salt paste 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.119
 fill the cup with the flour 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.440
 then a cup of flour 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.409
 a cup 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.409
 the fine salt 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.409
 a spoon of vinyl glue 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.939
 now we fill half a glass of water 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:14.280
 that we will pay to you for non 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.510
 risk our salt dough 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 it becomes too soft 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.599
 let's start mixing 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.379
 it's a natural compound so it wo n't do 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.220
 love our children 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:08.730
 now at this point if we want 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.109
 we can add the dye i have 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:18.720
 since I 'll use those for the 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:23.250
 sweet we divide ours into three pieces 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.790
 we will give salt to each piece a 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.790
 different color 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.660
 as my liquid dye 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:56.250
 the dough tends to soften a little 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:59.480
 therefore we omit less water during the 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.060
 preparation phase or 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.750
 add half a teaspoon a 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.340
 teaspoon of flour once 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.340
 we have colored our dough 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:21.720
 Now we go to the pink color the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:28.260
 next dough and salt dough 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:30.540
 yellow the other is the colors prepared 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.840
 for our salt dough 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:38.100
 now it will be enough to put them inside a 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:44.100
 airtight container and these 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:48.230
 they will remain in the refrigerator for a long time 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.230
 even for a couple of months
