00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.969
 it seems that this is the 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.530
 two hundredth channel video is already 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.850
 boys until a few days ago novel 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.320
 I didn't even notice you did it 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.610
 note you in the comments 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320
 so you started asking me 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.689
 france do something special for 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.119
 the 200th video I thought of one 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.770
 little and in the end I said why not 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.140
 I never made a giveaway 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.450
 the last time I donated games is 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.430
 was when we did the contest 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.530
 of the thousand subscribers for the channel 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.940
 I haven't done anything since then 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.020
 because the two hundredth video must not 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.420
 be a giveaway 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.510

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.310
