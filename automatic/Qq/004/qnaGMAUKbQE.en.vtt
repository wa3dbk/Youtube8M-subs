00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.340
 welcome to portable screens with the following 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.140
 replace the screen of your touch very quickly 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.009
 what you need to replace the screen red 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.109
 a cutter is a few tools 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.720
 a small screwdriver the star 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.739
 a glass where to put 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.739
 any container where to put the screws 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.519
 a soft cloth 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.519
 or any other place where you can connect the panel 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.579
 safety first of all 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.570
 therefore 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.220
 we will start with one 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
 remove the battery 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.420
 opening of the notebook 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 on the frame we will notice that there are some rubbers 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.440
 usually vary from 4 * post 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.700
 sent these men there are screws 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 we proceed with us to remove links 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 and then I love the rubbers inside the glass 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.070
 we will proceed raquin say 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 I see written request &amp; gt 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.660
 using the tiny screwdriver the star 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.770
 for iphone and only thing always bit that 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.850
 plane or no container an ashtray anything so they don't go 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 thinks 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.020
 as you can see a very simple and fast operation 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.349
 once removed I saw the next step to take away the 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.549
 frame is very simple 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.449
 and framed I suggest 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:28.409
 starting from this side at the bottom left is simply putting them 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.699
 fingers between the frame itself the panel 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.699
 to disconnect 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:53.150
 now we are ready for root to remove what the water screen said 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:54.279
 panel 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.749
 to proceed with the replacement 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.749
 we use in this case 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.869
 small photo 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.769
 soft cloth or any other cloth 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.369
 ok let me have a little 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.369
 and we proceed split there are screws 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.159
 which must obviously be declared 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.579
 after removing the screws that hold the panel to the housing 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.459
 within the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.620
 d'annunzio 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.620
 we can stand the panel 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.529
 they are the last things to do remove the video cable 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.029
 the cable for the inverter if the screen 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.909
 real college in this case a lcd we are slaves had to be led 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.789
 we will be given that only your video that this one usually f 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:53.249
 attached with a 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.909
 forest film 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.510
 other times simply 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.020
 % a cable with terminals to the other that are to be pressed to be able to stand 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.059
 follow adhesive tape but not completely 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.509
 and then we pull 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.089
 how can I not hurt 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.469
 exact time 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.849
 the cable instead of the backlight is always a little lower 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.309
 et pull out 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.309
 the inverter cable 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.749
 boutique 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:32.999
 panel cost is practically 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.999
 totally layer 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.870
 competition 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.129
 last our destiny
