00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 well found boys in a cause of the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.160
 food so this is the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.350
 27th episode of the play for fun 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.330
 as you can see the episode opens by discarding 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.969
 three players who were three players 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.370
 who left me without me 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.859
 contract and with the credits I make 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.420
 discarding I buy them and evans that the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.090
 defender of the manchester that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.180
 Irish from Northern Ireland if not 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.439
 I'm wrong and then I take given I can also 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.720
 to take a good price considering that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.080
 this 800 was very expensive 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.930
 I got him 500 Irish goalkeeper who 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 we had also used it last time 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.010
 first match I meet a beautiful one 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.950
 team with five players in the form and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.809
 I was pretty worried it's mine 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.780
 concern let's say it turned out 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.719
 founded 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.870
 but fortunately at the 45th I put it 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.190
 let's say this ball in the door and I can 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.140
 to bring the game home to me since 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.790
 the game will end 1 0 thanks to this 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.960
 goal of ramsey a beautiful action is me 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.719
 liked I have to tell the truth it is me 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.920
 liked it just the way it is handled 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.239
 action also the game like that 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.320
 very well managed my opponent was 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.520
 however strong we still say that I can 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.750
 to say that I deserved the game 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.450
 at the end of the game I immediately go to 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.580
 play the second one against another 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.500
 very very strong team 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.710
 as you can see, it mattered to defense dancing 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.090
 pp masquerade alba moves in shape 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.009
 alonso benzema 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.770
 in short, a great team 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.159
 fortunately at the 45th it went into 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.159
 advantage with this great goal from jarvis 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.380
 torpedo at the corner that valdes says 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.869
 only to deviate but fails to 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.929
 save for luck so let's say 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.119
 at the first time on the 10th but barely 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.240
 the second half started 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.710
 my opponent draws 1 1 with 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.409
 let's say a lucky pass for 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.020
 benzema and then French can throw 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.369
 the ball in the goal is alone with them 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.990
 because with us how you remember not 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.570
 never never ever marked 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.130
 it is a phenomenon only with others al 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.380
 69th in addition to being a phenomenon 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.909
 also decide to win any 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.099
 rebound happens to him 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.780
 on the street and then throws in the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.160
 ball of 2 1 so I'm in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.440
 disadvantage to the seventieth, however 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.290
 fortunately in addition to attacking him yes 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.810
 forget also to defend and therefore 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.150
 just practically battle I can do 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.099
 goal with mireya the goal of 2 to 2 that me 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.540
 let's say let's reopen the game 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.549
 since I wanted to win it anyway 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.010
 because I deserved it I was attacking 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.530
 it's not like I'm just paying for it 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.080
 I though to me I was meditating and I 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.400
 fortunately the 79th if sign throws 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.040
 the 3 2 ball does not matter 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.440
 let's say that visco mark this goal 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.239
 quite deserved and then eventually to the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.160
 ninetieth that by now he had put 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.879
 offensive if I am not mistaken however it was 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.860
 trying to equalize it I can sign 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.019
 the goal of 4 2 with miraglia then a 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.879
 bring this game home 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.870
 dreams are very important 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.730
 especially given the team 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.920
 the opponent not the opponent but himself 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.019
 the team was very worrying 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.709
 then three more points 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.280
 two out of two for the moment six points 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.239
 so let's say a good start is 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.579
 finished the game I find this 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.730
 surprise I can sell four 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.170
 bronze players and with credits that 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.370
 more added than the first and the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.700
 second game I can buy you a 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.220
 good defender and that escort and you buy 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.260
 a sinister exterior who is a mother 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.940
 I don't do that stuff though 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.959
 play because he was 80 then fit 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.549
 I preferred to always play jarvis 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.950
 I'm going to play the third and last game 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.200
 in against a dubious team we say 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.099
 since it was supplied very strong 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.420
 quite worrying from the midfield 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.880
 up however we say 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.880
 not worrying the defense since it was 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.310
 all bronze and this above all 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.959
 takes advantage of miraglia with its speed at 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.489
 seventh minute no one takes it e 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.950
 manages to sign the goal of one to zero 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.230
 but my adversary equipped with 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.790
 strong enough players like 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.720
 sessegnon and who is a player 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.180
 fortissimo 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.860
 I also recommend it to you not only 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.290
 from my opponent but also for us 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.540
 also for our team is playing 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.370
 really very well is a player who 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.590
 I recommend you absolutely above all 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.680
 because it costs so much to 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.479
 reach of everyone to the 25th I was 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.100
 manages to do the 2 to 1 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.419
 quite doubt this action in 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.840
 actually I wanted to go to take it 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.280
 but I expected the defender to me 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.900
 did she slipped in front of the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.130
 player then I came back 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.650
 actually the player made it 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.870
 backwards so I was wrong though 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.620
 fortunately I managed to score the 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.330
 goal of 2 1 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.650
 bad luck however, that at the end of 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.370
 first time as their last action 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.070
 sessegnon his manage to put 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.740
 the 2 or 2 brace then matters 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.950
 we go to the end of the first half on 2 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.020
 at 2 to 65th so after quite a while 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.570
 minutes in fact now that I think about it 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.060
 I can do 3 2 with jarvis than on 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.890
 second pole gets ready in 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.530
 manages to blow this gored wind 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.960
 head first and then as you can 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.780
 see the action from the minutes practically 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.250
 and after aguero secures the 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.919
 result on 4 to 2 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.240
 a very difficult game especially 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.410
 when he attacked he is in the sense 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.150
 when I attacked it was parades of 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.039
 goalkeeper or kick the colo nevertheless the 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.510
 I did because of worrying actions 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.970
 however his defense was a rise of 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.500
 bronze, however, even when he attacked him 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.180
 because he was very good and having a 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.340
 golden attack so I had to stay a lot 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.510
 be careful, however, for how 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.760
 you can see towards the end of the 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.490
 game I can sign the 5 2 before the 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.210
 6 to 2 then with sessegnon the opponents 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.260
 by now he had given up the reins was 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.770
 a little let's say 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.570
 then I resigned myself to the lake towards 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.950
 the end of the game and go out as 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.090
 just like last action at 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.430
 ninetieth ness also deliver 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.650
 the last goal the 72 with aguero too 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.120
 of head perhaps a place accomplice 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.140
 goalkeeper even if in fact everything 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.850
 added his goalkeeper from gold then the 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.420
 bronze excuse in this case not 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.860
 there is 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.310
 as you can see, however, the game and not 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.610
 quite one -way and if I did 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.500
 25 shots of which 20 in goal then nothing 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.610
 guys this episode goes from god ho 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.690
 since I play three games three 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.550
 victories 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.780
 I leave you as always with the question 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.850
 and I recommend you put a nice I like it 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.780
 subscribe and nothing answer so many 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.780
 to the beautiful question
