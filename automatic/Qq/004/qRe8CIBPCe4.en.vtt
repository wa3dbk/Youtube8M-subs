would<00:04:25.660> probably<00:04:26.050> be<00:04:26.350> thinking<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.800> same<00:04:27.010> but

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
would probably be thinking the same but

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.690 
would probably be thinking the same but
but<00:04:27.970> he<00:04:28.120> Mia<00:04:28.330> my<00:04:28.750> theory<00:04:29.080> is<00:04:29.230> this<00:04:29.530> if<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:30.340> line

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
but he Mia my theory is this if the line

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.000 
but he Mia my theory is this if the line
you<00:04:30.940> have<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.270> sing<00:04:31.540> is<00:04:31.900> also<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.470> title<00:04:32.680> of

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
you have to sing is also the title of

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.220 
you have to sing is also the title of
the<00:04:33.340> song<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.910> if<00:04:34.510> we<00:04:34.540> all<00:04:34.750> sing<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.050> together

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
we just make it that much more likely to

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.960 
we just make it that much more likely to
come<00:04:37.420> true<00:04:37.750> right<00:04:38.470> so<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:39.340> light<00:04:39.550> you<00:04:39.700> have<00:04:39.880> to
