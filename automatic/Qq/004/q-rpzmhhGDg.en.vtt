00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.570
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.440
 new video you have on facebook 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.750
 tuned and that's why I have for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.550
 a shorthand for wedding guests but me 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.199
 Great thoughts and a few 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.660
 things for you 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.820
 Let's just go with the invitation 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.529
 You should really complete the invitation 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.360
 just read the next embarrassing than 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.220
 somewhere uncharged to appear so 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.890
 check if we are for the wedding 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.390
 invited to invite or for the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.140
 celebration afterwards or for the wedding eve 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.670
 and then tell the bride and groom in time 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.989
 your answer is usually there 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.360
 any deadline you should too 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.950
 comply with units because it is easy for 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.600
 the bridal couple important that with the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.120
 next preparations easy 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.649
 can go on if you are short term 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.609
 what happens in between then says so 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.170
 must necessarily depend if you cancel then 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.999
 justify the whole and send 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.499
 anyway a wedding present so gives 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.280
 maybe someone with it 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:03.210
 or send it by post 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.250
 Punctuality Christmas time always 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.659
 Of course you have to be married 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.600
 you then already up to a half 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.659
 hour he too be there 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.549
 in the case of clothing, the color of the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.150
 brews it white and that's why you should 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.570
 No white bear absolute taboos in 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.830
 jeans or very short skirts and at 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.960
 You should celebrate the church wedding 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.320
 Note the women need stockings 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.930
 Wear even in the summer and absolute taboos 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.330
 in the church deep decolletÃ©s or 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.940
 sleeveless clothing or for men 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.370
 also in the smoking so smoking you wear 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.080
 in the church just can not then 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.710
 but do not wear at the celebration afterwards 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.750
 in laakirchen clear for the arrival to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.250
 wedding and for the night is 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.650
 each self responsible and also 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.170
 Everyone pays that for themselves , of course 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.850
 bride and groom should take the phone should 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.260
 Turn it off or at least quietly 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.750
 then yes you should make religious 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.310
 simply accept ritual 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.150
 you do not necessarily have to join if 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.830
 you want to but he should do with up 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.310
 the others agree to get up 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.860
 just things just noticed that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.599
 wedding no freibier party is so 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.400
 So behave yourself accordingly 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.500
 Do not be there for the sake of your value 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.840
 wedding present back in you 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.470
 to feed or with beer or 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.970
 compensate for other alcohol 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.890
 Acceptance is definitely a requirement 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.690
 the bride always does not push 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.030
 between and the order is 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.620
 actually quite simple at first has the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.520
 bride and groom on the dance floor a few 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.100
 minutes for yourself 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.959
 then the brauteltern come to and 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.310
 then all other guests so urge you 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.770
 please not in the foreground 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.050
 this is the big day of the bride and the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.170
 Grooms you have another day again 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.060
 time to shine the chance gift 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.430
 you do not hand over before or directly 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.770
 after the church ceremony but 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.540
 just during the celebration and it is 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.370
 very important that you have a card 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.500
 Assigned by whom the gift is because it 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.239
 needs can not be with you 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.580
 thanks if it does not know which 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.320
 Gift is easy from you and the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.330
 most important rule for guests on one 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.430
 wedding is just have fun yourself 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.989
 a greater gift can the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.480
 do not even make bride and groom 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.610
 I hope this little knigge continuation 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.230
 guests helped you a lot was yours 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.570
 certainly known but maybe there was 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.370
 such a few little things for the wedding 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.459
