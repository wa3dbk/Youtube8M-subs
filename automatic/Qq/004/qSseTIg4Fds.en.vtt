00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.160
 hello youtube friends again this is 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.650
 for materials this time 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.900
 I bring a video to take out the code of 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.900
 1992 honda civic error 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.180
 and many others 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:21.090
 well what I'm trying to do here now 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:25.720
 is to generate a damage in the car an error 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.189
 releasing the sensor cable etc. which is 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.110
 which tells you the temperature of the 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.939
 car and the one that tells the computer 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.240
 what kind of mixing is the boss 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:38.470
 so here I am letting go 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.730
 good and I let it loose so I take it out and 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.620
 what I'm going to expect is that the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.350
 computer sends a wrong mix and 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.380
 the computer and the car and start 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.360
 explode 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.760
 well let's see this error usually it 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.250
 can present when that sensor is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.950
 bad and the car when you're going to start 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.270
 in the morning it is cold and after 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.710
 when the hot car is no longer there 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.790
 no problem no longer feels any 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.250
 error then let's turn on the car 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.270
 to see 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.270
 What's going on 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.330
 shanklin 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.830
 oops 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.770
 let's release the tone sensor 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.760
 completely for what 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.090
 so that to give us the damage 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.850
 you know that already gives out we're going to see if 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.850
 well not this year 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 all right 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.790
 back to the car 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.430
 as you can see 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.430
 elche who has learned 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.770
 the car this normal zone 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.850
 I do not think it sounds very good but 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.360
 well, the check is on and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.030
 we have explosions and it goes out and it's 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.640
 difficult it is difficult to grasp it is difficult 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.140
 turn it on quite hard 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.990
 we have to wait until the car 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.420
 Warm up so the car starts to 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.190
 work well and once the car already 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.870
 hot we come back and close now 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.800
 we closed the switch and saw it open and 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.800
 it is again normal 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.010
 explosion or a little bit if that 's the damage 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.350
 all right then what we have to do 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.100
 we already did the damage well now what 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.500
 we need is to open the practices are 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.150
 click or maybe with a small cable or 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.330
 maybe from this presentation that we have 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.210
 here is a clip and take it to the 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.980
 connection of two computer cables 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.160
 in this case the car has the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.150
 computer on the passenger side in 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.980
 the bottom of the glove compartment we're going to 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:12.230
 observe the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:16.069
 there is the computer and here in 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.220
 somewhere are the connections where 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:25.040
 they are here 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.990
 alright then let's go to this connection is 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.700
 the three-wire must have three wires 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.740
 have two I do not know why is the current 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.470
 scanner and that is what we can take out 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.670
 manually as for us to take out the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.860
 code manually the one that has 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.750
 only two wires you to the 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.860
 that we are going to raise but we need 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.530
 remove this plastic thing from the pachita 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.050
 well they are really not very difficult 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.460
 but here as with a camera in the 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.110
 hand is like complicated then I'm going 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.430
 to leave a moment on the floor of the menu 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.440
 second please ok it's already out 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.870
 so 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.730
 and we are going to raise it that is the appointment that 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.420
 we need not the three cables but the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.420
 of two cables 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.310
 there it is so it must look 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.760
 is already raised and what we are going to 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.579
 observe is the code the code that 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.940
 present the error of the car we are going to 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.940
 tell 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.500
 1 2 3 4 5 6 these codes can you 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.630
 easily find on the internet and then 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.110
 for the newer models of 2000 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:37.070
 until 2004 2005 I think let's observe 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.530
 the vips but longer for the first 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.030
 code number and so on corticos 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.800
 the second number this as is a 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.080
 old cart then obviously 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.520
 only going to show the global or 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.090
 only to show a code that is the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.400
 number 6 the sensor 7 and it tells me that it's 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.120
 wrong or is failing then we are going to 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.120
 correct the damage 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.710
 very well 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.490
 well we go back and connect our 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.530
 sensors etc 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.960
 by the way if I did not tell them before and I did not 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.270
 agreement that should not be two cables should 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.550
 be a connection a straw I have to 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.410
 I got hurt and I hurt myself 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.090
 broke through the heat or who knows and everything 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.670
 I put 22 cable quoted there does not pass 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.380
 nothing 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.390
 after they are well isolated not 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.880
 nothing happens 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.880
 now we remove the bridge to the 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.070
 computer 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.210
 but that just pull back and 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:39.479
 tie 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.479
 and put the green space that where it was 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.350
 true 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.950
 ok now let's see how it ended 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.950
 All this 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.810
 all right 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.810
 all right 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:04.920
 ok we turn on we open the switch and pum it 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.920
 turn off the check in the car turn on 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.920
 perfectly 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.940
 well thanks for watching
