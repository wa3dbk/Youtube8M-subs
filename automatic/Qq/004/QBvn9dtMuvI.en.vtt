00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 family is a great hug as 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.480
 It has always been a while since the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.630
 last time we met for one of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.670
 these informative videos so let's go 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.620
 to enjoy this video and let's start 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.410
 in this video we are going to talk about the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.330
 four fatal errors that people 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.760
 they commit when they are trying to lose 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 weight or enter a diet which 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 sabotages your plan to lose weight 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.400
 completely so let's see this 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.400
 video and let's pay close attention 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.440
 mistake number 1 believing that we are all 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.600
 equal and that every diet plan is 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.969
 applies identical to all people 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.460
 this is a very common mistake with a 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.260
 person trying to lose weight or want 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.420
 start a diet goes around the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.210
 internet as soon as you find a certain plan 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.820
 it's true video and try to grab that 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.199
 plan and apply it identical to them and not 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.879
 they realize that that person who is 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.280
 doing that is following that plan 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.280
 It has many different variants of you 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.949
 has maybe measured more is higher or is 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.390
 higher weighs more has different type 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.880
 of the body has a more metabolism 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.640
 fast or slower and all these 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.170
 variants accumulate and cause you 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.090
 follow that plan and suddenly you 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.549
 find that he is not giving you 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.770
 results and you get discouraged and suddenly 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.810
 you leave the goal you had from the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.210
 principle if you have problems with this 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.560
 remember that our community has what 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.890
 which is called the seven steps where 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.780
 you can follow them and you can customize 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.420
 absolutely all your diet plan you 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.700
 type of your type of exercise routines 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.450
 and absolved absolutely everything 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.960
 You need to customize your 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.969
 and not fall into this error so common mistake 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.399
 number 2 trying to start a plan of 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.890
 diets without understanding the concepts 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.810
 basic nutrition if you do not know that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.880
 they are calories or micronutrients or 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.909
 macronutrients please I beg you 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.250
 I beg you do not start a diet plan 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.890
 still first learn learn those 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.929
 concepts well know the learn the a 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.149
 how to use them and that's where your 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.710
 diet plan I'll give you example 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.099
 meterÃ­as a boxing ring with 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.840
 professional 300 200 pounds if ni 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.209
 you even know how to box or at least not 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.489
 you know how to dodge punches I doubt it 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.210
 I would jump out of a pool full of 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.960
 sharks 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.510
 without being inside a steel cell or 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.520
 something so protect you how hard it is 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.930
 exactly the same concept here not 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.060
 you are playing with carts you are not 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.040
 playing video games you are playing with your 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.290
 life and with your health that is the most 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.960
 important so please learn 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.080
 these concepts so you can enter 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.600
 a diet plan correct your problem of 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.280
 weight and then get out of there and continue 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.810
 simply a healthy lifestyle 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.630
 to be able to keep you is very simple 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.180
 number 3 to be pure cardio this is a 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.770
 very very repetitive error in people 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.440
 when they are trying to lose weight 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.090
 remember that if cardio is important 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.700
 but just as important are the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.160
 muscular resistance exercises or 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.170
 exercises with weights as you create them in 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.450
 the gym while you are trying 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.540
 lose weight because in this way 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.890
 you keep your metabolic rate high and you 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.730
 you assure that that weight that you are 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.580
 losing is not muscle and fat but 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.360
 mostly that way too fat 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.250
 make sure you can maintain an aspect 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.950
 physical fides when I finish this 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.830
 process and do not just become 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.090
 in a smaller version of what 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.220
 you are now number 4 and the most dangerous 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.709
 stay in a caloric deficit for a 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.140
 prolonged time remember that in a 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.420
 diet well made a plan to lose weight 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.150
 well done you will gradually lower your 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.450
 calories at a certain point but then you go to 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.700
 start to gradually climb to your new 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.190
 maintenance point there are many 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.320
 people who first 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.820
 enter directly from their level of 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.860
 maintenance they lower 500 calories and they go 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.260
 directly here and then that already creates a 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.120
 small problem there are other people who 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.160
 they do the excellent job of lowering 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.340
 gradually and get here but the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.100
 problem is that when they come down here 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.830
 they happen to care more about how they look in 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.780
 a mirror that how they feel with them 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.760
 they may feel tired 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.950
 fatigued has no energy at all 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.200
 but they 're so excited about how they 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.750
 They are looking in the mirror and ignoring 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.450
 they ignore all these signals and forget 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.600
 of the retroactive process to get to your 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.780
 new maintenance level this is a 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.550
 very common mistake even if you do not create it and 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.740
 dangerous because because that's where 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.230
 all those disorders begin 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.490
 food and nutrition there is 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.560
 when the problems of 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.380
 anorexia, that's when the 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.289
 bulimia problems because the body is going 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.539
 to reach a point 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.580
 stops losing fat and that rather 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.460
 start to accumulate fat because you're 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.199
 of a very low calorie level 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.779
 so that's why you have to have a lot 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.779
 be very careful especially with this 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:07.629
 error please remember that you need 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.520
 down if you were going to be down here but 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.249
 have confidence in going back up 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.009
 gradually your calories again for 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:17.039
 that you can maintain the body that you have 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.719
 but you can get to caloric levels 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.479
 normal that the body needs to 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.819
 to be able to work in the right way and 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.490
 make you feel good in the way 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.379
 correct as you should have dinner and good 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.740
