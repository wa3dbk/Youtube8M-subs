little of making a new blank that we
have<00:00:20.370> called<00:00:20.790> tornadic<00:00:21.350> twists<00:00:22.350> there's<00:00:22.950> a

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
have the twist and some of them are

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.959 
have the twist and some of them are
vertical<00:00:30.500> windows<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:32.250> an<00:00:32.340> interesting<00:00:32.610> new

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
vertical windows it's an interesting new

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.790 
vertical windows it's an interesting new
design<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.629> so<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> thought<00:00:34.020> I'd<00:00:34.199> spend<00:00:34.739> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
design and so I thought I'd spend a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.200 
design and so I thought I'd spend a
little<00:00:34.890> time<00:00:35.219> showing<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.760> how<00:00:35.879> to<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
little time showing you how to get a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.340 
little time showing you how to get a
great<00:00:36.390> pen<00:00:36.780> out<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.079> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
great pen out of it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.169 
great pen out of it
so<00:00:38.249> let's<00:00:38.429> get<00:00:38.609> started<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:41.670> receive<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
so let's get started you receive the

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.299 
so let's get started you receive the
blank<00:00:42.449> as<00:00:42.659> a<00:00:42.690> five<00:00:43.019> inch<00:00:43.289> piece<00:00:43.409> which<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
blank as a five inch piece which is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.989 
blank as a five inch piece which is
actually<00:00:44.879> composed<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.479> two<00:00:45.629> separate<00:00:46.109> pieces

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:46.999 
actually composed of two separate pieces

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:49.459 
actually composed of two separate pieces
the<00:00:47.999> best<00:00:48.179> way<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.420> I've<00:00:48.690> found<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.109> to<00:00:49.139> cut

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the best way that I've found is to cut

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.500 
the best way that I've found is to cut
this<00:00:49.679> right<00:00:49.979> down<00:00:50.249> the<00:00:50.460> middle<00:00:50.639> or<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.179> you<00:00:51.300> can

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
this right down the middle or if you can

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.660 
this right down the middle or if you can
see<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> separation<00:00:52.289> between<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.949> two<00:00:53.190> cut

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
see the separation between the two cut

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.719 
see the separation between the two cut
in<00:00:53.999> the<00:00:54.210> separation<00:00:54.809> between<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.319> two<00:00:55.729> in

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
in the separation between the two in

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.579 
in the separation between the two in
this<00:00:57.329> case<00:00:57.389> the<00:00:57.809> picture<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.199> worth<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
this case the picture is worth a

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.099 
this case the picture is worth a
thousand<00:00:59.069> words<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.789> see<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.690> black

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
thousand words you can see the black

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.140 
thousand words you can see the black
outline<00:01:01.409> of<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.670> round<00:01:03.559> blank<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.940> see

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
outline of a round blank and you can see

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.039 
outline of a round blank and you can see
that<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.510> has<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:07.020> red<00:01:07.440> Center<00:01:08.509> that's<00:01:09.509> really

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
that it has a red Center that's really

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.779 
that it has a red Center that's really
what<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.409> aiming<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.740> you'd<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.399> to<00:01:11.579> get

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
what you're aiming for you'd like to get

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.130 
what you're aiming for you'd like to get
the<00:01:12.360> center<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.140> marked<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.799> both<00:01:14.219> ends

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
the center of this marked on both ends

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
the center of this marked on both ends
once<00:01:16.140> you've<00:01:16.380> marked<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.070> center<00:01:17.399> of<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.670> on

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
once you've marked the center of it on

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
once you've marked the center of it on
both<00:01:18.149> ends<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.079> can<00:01:19.289> mount<00:01:19.469> it<00:01:19.590> between

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
both ends then you can mount it between

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.760 
both ends then you can mount it between
centers<00:01:20.609> to<00:01:21.390> turn<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.750> down<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.560> can

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
centers to turn it down so that you can

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.770 
centers to turn it down so that you can
drill<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.579> make<00:01:23.850> sure<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.299> you're<00:01:24.509> drilling

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
drill and make sure that you're drilling

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.389 
drill and make sure that you're drilling
in<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.259> dead<00:01:25.500> center<00:01:25.829> of<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.280> blank<00:01:28.399> having

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
in the dead center of the blank having

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.310 
in the dead center of the blank having
established<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.119> center<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.810> now<00:01:30.990> drill

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
established the center we can now drill

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.770 
established the center we can now drill
it<00:01:31.469> and<00:01:31.649> what<00:01:32.399> I<00:01:32.430> did<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.390> drill

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it and what I did with this was drill

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.859 
it and what I did with this was drill
both<00:01:34.130> pieces<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.789> ten<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.719> a<00:01:36.750> half

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
both pieces with a ten and a half

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.429 
both pieces with a ten and a half
millimeter<00:01:37.500> drill<00:01:37.890> bit<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.960> ten<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.350> half

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
millimeter drill bit the ten and a half

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.669 
millimeter drill bit the ten and a half
millimeter<00:01:40.920> bit<00:01:41.159> left<00:01:41.429> enough<00:01:41.759> meat<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
millimeter bit left enough meat on the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.590 
millimeter bit left enough meat on the
blank<00:01:43.679> that<00:01:44.429> I<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.789> comfortable<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.479> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
blank that I was comfortable that it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
blank that I was comfortable that it
would<00:01:45.719> not<00:01:45.869> shatter<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.469> it<00:01:46.619> didn't<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
would not shatter and it didn't it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.669 
would not shatter and it didn't it
worked<00:01:47.310> real<00:01:47.789> easily<00:01:48.229> then<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> picked<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
worked real easily then I picked the

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.810 
worked real easily then I picked the
side<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.159> wanted<00:01:50.429> to<00:01:50.549> be<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> cap<00:01:50.999> and<00:01:52.820> did

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
side that I wanted to be the cap and did

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520 
side that I wanted to be the cap and did
that<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> 12<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.749> a<00:01:54.780> half<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.229> put<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that in the 12 and a half so I put the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.319 
that in the 12 and a half so I put the
12<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> half<00:01:55.950> bit<00:01:56.310> through<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.939> hole<00:01:57.119> that

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
12 and a half bit through the hole that

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.550 
12 and a half bit through the hole that
I<00:01:57.390> had<00:01:57.509> already<00:01:57.659> made<00:01:57.899> with<00:01:58.109> a<00:01:58.140> ten<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> half

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
I had already made with a ten and a half

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.580 
I had already made with a ten and a half
it<00:01:59.490> was<00:01:59.700> relatively<00:02:00.119> simple<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.840> uneventful

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it was relatively simple and uneventful

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.020 
it was relatively simple and uneventful
so<00:02:02.159> that's<00:02:02.759> what<00:02:02.969> you're<00:02:03.149> seeing<00:02:03.179> here<00:02:05.030> once

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
so that's what you're seeing here once

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.550 
so that's what you're seeing here once
that<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.329> done<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.569> did<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> few<00:02:07.049> things<00:02:07.109> that<00:02:07.499> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that was done I did a few things that I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.600 
that was done I did a few things that I
did<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:07.920> videotape<00:02:08.610> first<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.300> all<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.610> blank

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
did not videotape first of all the blank

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.960 
did not videotape first of all the blank
was<00:02:12.180> back<00:02:12.810> painted<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.220> inside<00:02:14.790> of

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
was back painted that is the inside of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.350 
was back painted that is the inside of
the<00:02:15.060> hole<00:02:15.270> was<00:02:15.840> painted<00:02:16.350> with<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> burgundy

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
the hole was painted with a burgundy

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.170 
the hole was painted with a burgundy
which<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.900> self<00:02:19.200> mixed<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.739> ended<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.180> burgundy

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
which is self mixed it ended up burgundy

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.900 
which is self mixed it ended up burgundy
or<00:02:21.209> brown<00:02:21.920> I'm<00:02:22.920> learning<00:02:23.340> with<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.610> color

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
or brown I'm learning with the color

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.760 
or brown I'm learning with the color
this<00:02:24.180> back<00:02:24.480> paint<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:24.989> not<00:02:25.230> really<00:02:25.590> as

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
this back paint is not really as

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.320 
this back paint is not really as
important<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.610> fact<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.000> should<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.300> it

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
important as the fact that should do it

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.720 
important as the fact that should do it
the<00:02:28.080> background<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:29.099> turns<00:02:29.370> nice<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the background really turns nice and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.780 
the background really turns nice and
that<00:02:30.180> gives<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.569> much<00:02:30.840> better<00:02:31.080> end<00:02:31.920> product

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
that gives you a much better end product

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.740 
that gives you a much better end product
if<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:34.020> done<00:02:34.230> some<00:02:34.620> back<00:02:35.069> painting<00:02:35.750> in

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
if you have done some back painting in

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.690 
if you have done some back painting in
this<00:02:37.080> case<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.560> say<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.800> use<00:02:37.860> burgundy<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.459> could

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
this case I say I use burgundy I could

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.000 
this case I say I use burgundy I could
use<00:02:38.849> black<00:02:39.060> probably<00:02:39.680> don't<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.890> makes

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
use black probably don't think it makes

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.410 
use black probably don't think it makes
an<00:02:41.160> awful<00:02:41.280> lot<00:02:41.519> of<00:02:41.550> difference<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.239> does

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
an awful lot of difference but it does

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.839 
an awful lot of difference but it does
make<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.900> pen<00:02:43.290> look<00:02:43.500> really<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.220> much

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
make the pen look really it's much

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.500 
make the pen look really it's much
better<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.630> what<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> background<00:02:46.500> done

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
better with what the background done

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.190 
better with what the background done
here<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.370> tubas<00:02:50.370> finished<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.200> it's

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
here we have the tubas finished and it's

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
brass tube is from the end I'm going to

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.280 
brass tube is from the end I'm going to
have<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.980> cut<00:03:05.190> off<00:03:05.400> part<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.750> I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
have to cut off part of this and I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.020 
have to cut off part of this and I
wanted<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.650> show<00:03:07.890> how<00:03:08.220> much<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:08.849> to

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
wanted to show how much of it I have to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.500 
wanted to show how much of it I have to
cut<00:03:09.330> off<00:03:09.769> in<00:03:10.769> order<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.099> do<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.790> decided<00:03:12.269> I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
cut off in order to do that I decided I

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.350 
cut off in order to do that I decided I
wanted<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.989> do<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.680> lathe<00:03:14.180> because<00:03:15.180> it

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
wanted to do it on the lathe because it

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.330 
wanted to do it on the lathe because it
is<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> round<00:03:15.989> object<00:03:16.349> and<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.830> didn't<00:03:17.160> want<00:03:17.310> to

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
is a round object and I didn't want to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.050 
is a round object and I didn't want to
use<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.519> bandsaw<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:18.989> put<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.530> link<00:03:20.310> into<00:03:20.670> my

use a bandsaw so I put the link into my
scroll<00:03:21.660> Chuck<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.140> turned<00:03:22.859> off<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.310> end<00:03:23.690> this

working with these blanks from time to

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.979 
working with these blanks from time to
time<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.470> will<00:03:31.620> run<00:03:31.829> into<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.760> bubble<00:03:33.209> that

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
time you will run into a bubble that

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.009 
time you will run into a bubble that

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
they would made the blank now I used to

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.300 
they would made the blank now I used to
say<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.630> was<00:03:39.780> typical<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.530> handmade<00:03:40.739> blanks

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
say that was typical of handmade blanks

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.160 
say that was typical of handmade blanks
essentially<00:03:41.790> typical<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.209> any<00:03:42.510> blank<00:03:42.840> that

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
essentially typical of any blank that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.900 
essentially typical of any blank that
has<00:03:43.380> this<00:03:43.650> kind<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.040> pattern<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.549> it<00:03:44.730> we've

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
has this kind of pattern on it we've

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.970 
has this kind of pattern on it we've
purchased<00:03:45.390> some<00:03:45.840> from<00:03:46.200> commercial<00:03:46.739> outlets

and<00:03:47.489> there<00:03:47.730> they<00:03:48.480> also<00:03:48.660> have<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.109> problem<00:03:49.560> so

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
and there they also have this problem so

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.129 
and there they also have this problem so
what<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.850> need<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.120> do<00:03:51.269> is<00:03:51.480> learn<00:03:51.630> how<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.870> fix

what you need to do is learn how to fix

what you need to do is learn how to fix
it<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.530> what<00:03:53.340> we're<00:03:53.489> going<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.639> show<00:03:53.910> here<00:03:54.150> is

it and what we're going to show here is

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.069 
it and what we're going to show here is
taking<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:56.130> blank<00:03:56.639> with<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.269> small<00:03:57.600> air<00:03:57.840> hole

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
taking the blank with a small air hole

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.190 
taking the blank with a small air hole
or<00:03:58.380> air<00:03:58.769> bubble<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.280> how<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.299> played<00:04:00.870> with<00:04:01.049> it

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
or air bubble and how I played with it

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.809 
or air bubble and how I played with it
and<00:04:01.380> made<00:04:01.859> it<00:04:01.889> kind<00:04:02.609> of<00:04:02.760> disappear<00:04:04.819> first

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
and made it kind of disappear first

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.160 
and made it kind of disappear first
thing<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.180> need<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.359> be<00:04:06.569> aware<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:07.139> that

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
thing you need to be aware of is that

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.190 
thing you need to be aware of is that
you<00:04:07.530> want<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.310> be<00:04:08.430> absolutely<00:04:08.750> clean<00:04:09.750> if

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
you want it to be absolutely clean if

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.309 
you want it to be absolutely clean if
there's<00:04:10.620> dust<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.780> air<00:04:12.959> bubble

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
there's dust in the and the air bubble

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.250 
there's dust in the and the air bubble
it<00:04:14.220> will<00:04:14.370> show<00:04:14.579> up<00:04:14.700> as<00:04:14.819> being<00:04:14.880> white<00:04:15.389> and<00:04:15.720> when

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
it will show up as being white and when

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.020 
it will show up as being white and when
you're<00:04:16.410> finished<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.950> will<00:04:17.100> be<00:04:17.280> underneath

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
you're finished it will be underneath

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.659 
you're finished it will be underneath
the<00:04:18.209> repair<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.650> will<00:04:19.829> be<00:04:20.010> white<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.579> it

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
the repair and it will be white and it

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.790 
the repair and it will be white and it
will<00:04:20.850> not<00:04:21.000> look<00:04:21.180> good<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.410> first<00:04:22.620> thing

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
will not look good so the first thing

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.040 
will not look good so the first thing
you<00:04:22.889> need<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.100> do<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.580> clean<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:23.940> up<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.570> use

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
you need to do is clean it up I use

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.420 
you need to do is clean it up I use
boiled<00:04:26.039> linseed<00:04:26.250> oil<00:04:26.640> most<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.270> time<00:04:28.430> this

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
boiled linseed oil most of the time this

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.750 
boiled linseed oil most of the time this
particular<00:04:30.090> time<00:04:30.390> I<00:04:30.419> used

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
particular time I used

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.980 
particular time I used
alcohol<00:04:32.760> because<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.120> couldn't<00:04:33.480> find<00:04:33.660> any

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
alcohol because I couldn't find any

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.440 
alcohol because I couldn't find any
yellow<00:04:35.090> then<00:04:36.090> we<00:04:36.270> take<00:04:36.450> fin<00:04:37.410> CA<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.940> I<00:04:39.180> put<00:04:39.420> a

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
yellow then we take fin CA and I put a

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.040 
yellow then we take fin CA and I put a
little<00:04:39.840> pad<00:04:40.800> down<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.550> poured<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.750> there

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
little pad down and poured it on there

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.170 
little pad down and poured it on there
and<00:04:43.290> then<00:04:43.590> went<00:04:43.830> into<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.850> hole<00:04:45.090> with<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.080> q-tip

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
and then went into the hole with a q-tip

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.790 
and then went into the hole with a q-tip
it<00:04:48.180> doesn't<00:04:48.570> really<00:04:48.720> matter<00:04:48.960> how<00:04:49.230> you<00:04:49.290> do<00:04:49.620> this

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
it doesn't really matter how you do this

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.500 
it doesn't really matter how you do this
just<00:04:50.160> don't<00:04:50.310> get<00:04:50.550> a<00:04:50.610> whole<00:04:50.820> mess<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.360> on

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
just don't get a whole mess of it on

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.110 
just don't get a whole mess of it on
there<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:53.040> it'll<00:04:53.310> be<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.490> little<00:04:53.670> easier<00:04:53.820> to

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
there and it'll be a little easier to

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.150 
there and it'll be a little easier to
clean<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.480> up<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:54.990> if<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.140> can<00:04:55.440> put<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.890> but

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
clean it up so if you can put it on but

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.950 
clean it up so if you can put it on but
make<00:04:56.340> sure<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.700> is<00:04:56.910> proud<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.510> hole<00:04:57.690> make

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
make sure it is proud of the hole make

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.150 
make sure it is proud of the hole make
sure<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.320> when<00:04:58.470> you're<00:04:58.590> finished<00:04:58.920> you<00:04:59.130> have

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
sure that when you're finished you have

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.100 
sure that when you're finished you have
a<00:04:59.340> little<00:04:59.550> bump<00:04:59.790> there<00:05:01.940> once<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.150> CA<00:05:03.390> has<00:05:03.750> time

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
a little bump there once the CA has time

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.840 
a little bump there once the CA has time
to<00:05:04.470> set<00:05:05.250> thoroughly<00:05:05.970> our<00:05:06.780> 2<00:05:07.260> hours<00:05:07.640> time<00:05:08.640> that

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
to set thoroughly our 2 hours time that

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.360 
to set thoroughly our 2 hours time that
you<00:05:09.000> make<00:05:09.780> sure<00:05:09.810> that<00:05:10.170> it's<00:05:10.320> very<00:05:10.590> hard

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
you make sure that it's very hard

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.130 
you make sure that it's very hard
because<00:05:11.700> obviously<00:05:12.030> when<00:05:12.630> you're<00:05:12.750> going<00:05:12.960> to

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
because obviously when you're going to

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.510 
because obviously when you're going to
put<00:05:13.290> a<00:05:13.320> tool<00:05:13.590> across<00:05:13.980> that<00:05:14.190> you're<00:05:14.310> going<00:05:14.460> to

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
put a tool across that you're going to

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.550 
put a tool across that you're going to
take<00:05:14.670> a<00:05:14.700> sharp<00:05:15.030> tool<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:16.250> just<00:05:17.250> turn<00:05:17.490> off<00:05:17.760> that

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
take a sharp tool and just turn off that

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.020 
take a sharp tool and just turn off that
section<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:19.800> has<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.700> high<00:05:21.510> spots<00:05:21.870> there<00:05:22.170> so

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
section that has the high spots there so

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.220 
section that has the high spots there so
you'll<00:05:24.030> see<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.270> approached<00:05:24.660> this<00:05:24.900> fairly

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
you'll see I approached this fairly

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.090 
you'll see I approached this fairly
gently<00:05:26.160> it<00:05:26.940> is<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.150> very<00:05:27.510> sharp<00:05:27.810> half-inch<00:05:28.680> view

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
gently it is a very sharp half-inch view

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.030 
gently it is a very sharp half-inch view
and<00:05:29.480> I'm<00:05:30.480> really<00:05:30.780> trying<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.350> take<00:05:31.500> off<00:05:31.800> the

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
and I'm really trying to take off the

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.580 
and I'm really trying to take off the
glue<00:05:32.250> without<00:05:32.610> doing<00:05:33.030> much<00:05:33.750> more<00:05:34.080> turning

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
glue without doing much more turning

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.110 
glue without doing much more turning
because<00:05:34.919> it<00:05:35.130> was<00:05:35.310> just<00:05:35.669> about<00:05:35.850> the<00:05:36.000> right

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
because it was just about the right

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.620 
because it was just about the right
diameter<00:05:36.780> so<00:05:37.110> this<00:05:37.340> is<00:05:38.340> kind<00:05:38.610> of<00:05:38.760> fine<00:05:39.060> turning

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
diameter so this is kind of fine turning

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.510 
diameter so this is kind of fine turning
you're<00:05:39.960> making<00:05:40.440> sure<00:05:40.620> that<00:05:40.800> everything<00:05:41.310> comes

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
you're making sure that everything comes

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.170 
you're making sure that everything comes
off<00:05:41.850> and<00:05:42.380> trying<00:05:43.380> to<00:05:43.680> be<00:05:43.860> very<00:05:44.130> careful<00:05:44.669> not<00:05:44.880> to

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
off and trying to be very careful not to

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.240 
off and trying to be very careful not to
dig<00:05:45.419> into<00:05:45.630> your<00:05:45.930> blank<00:05:46.260> in<00:05:46.470> any<00:05:46.620> way<00:05:46.860> shape<00:05:47.100> or

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
dig into your blank in any way shape or

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.820 
dig into your blank in any way shape or
form<00:05:47.310> as<00:05:47.970> you<00:05:48.690> can<00:05:48.840> see<00:05:49.050> here<00:05:49.380> it's<00:05:49.530> hard

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
form as you can see here it's hard

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.190 
form as you can see here it's hard
because<00:05:50.040> it's<00:05:50.190> not<00:05:50.400> very<00:05:50.520> close<00:05:50.970> but<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:51.930> came

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
because it's not very close but it came

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.710 
because it's not very close but it came
out<00:05:52.380> really<00:05:52.650> well<00:05:52.770> this<00:05:53.669> came<00:05:54.120> off<00:05:54.300> almost

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
out really well this came off almost

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.800 
out really well this came off almost
completely<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.790> when<00:05:56.790> I<00:05:56.820> was<00:05:57.120> finished<00:05:57.479> I<00:05:57.630> had

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
completely and when I was finished I had

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.780 
completely and when I was finished I had
a<00:05:57.840> real<00:05:58.050> difficult<00:05:58.229> time<00:05:58.680> finding<00:05:59.220> where<00:05:59.490> that

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
a real difficult time finding where that

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.590 
a real difficult time finding where that
was<00:06:00.650> so<00:06:01.650> as<00:06:01.830> I<00:06:02.010> start<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.490> sin<00:06:02.790> you'll<00:06:03.210> see<00:06:03.419> that

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
was so as I start to sin you'll see that

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.040 
was so as I start to sin you'll see that
the<00:06:04.130> sandpaper<00:06:05.130> comes<00:06:05.970> off<00:06:06.240> relatively

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
the sandpaper comes off relatively

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.460 
the sandpaper comes off relatively
evenly<00:06:07.530> in<00:06:07.950> other<00:06:08.130> words<00:06:08.310> we<00:06:08.490> have<00:06:08.669> white

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
evenly in other words we have white

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.710 
evenly in other words we have white
sanded<00:06:10.470> section<00:06:10.860> all<00:06:11.640> across<00:06:12.180> it<00:06:12.450> we<00:06:12.570> don't

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
sanded section all across it we don't

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.890 
sanded section all across it we don't
have<00:06:12.990> any<00:06:13.169> shiny<00:06:13.770> spots<00:06:14.419> in<00:06:15.419> case<00:06:15.630> you<00:06:15.750> haven't

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
have any shiny spots in case you haven't

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.659 
have any shiny spots in case you haven't
seen<00:06:16.110> my<00:06:16.229> other<00:06:16.260> videos<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.950> shiny<00:06:17.220> spot<00:06:17.520> is

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
seen my other videos the shiny spot is

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.700 
seen my other videos the shiny spot is
generally<00:06:18.120> a<00:06:18.150> low<00:06:18.360> spot<00:06:18.660> where<00:06:18.960> you<00:06:19.169> dug<00:06:19.530> in

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
generally a low spot where you dug in

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.530 
generally a low spot where you dug in
too<00:06:19.950> far<00:06:20.190> and<00:06:20.430> so<00:06:20.610> you<00:06:20.669> have<00:06:20.880> to<00:06:21.030> see<00:06:21.210> him<00:06:21.300> down

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
too far and so you have to see him down

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.260 
too far and so you have to see him down
to<00:06:21.840> it<00:06:21.990> in<00:06:22.860> this<00:06:23.040> case<00:06:23.280> there<00:06:23.580> was<00:06:23.760> no<00:06:24.000> such

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
to it in this case there was no such

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.909 
to it in this case there was no such
problem<00:06:24.750> so<00:06:24.990> it<00:06:25.200> was<00:06:25.320> just<00:06:25.560> a<00:06:25.650> matter<00:06:25.800> of

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
problem so it was just a matter of

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.480 
problem so it was just a matter of
sanding<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.580> first<00:06:26.790> one<00:06:27.030> is<00:06:27.150> 400<00:06:27.720> grit<00:06:28.490> and

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
sanding it the first one is 400 grit and

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.710 
sanding it the first one is 400 grit and
what<00:06:29.760> I'm<00:06:29.880> trying<00:06:30.000> to<00:06:30.180> show<00:06:30.330> here<00:06:30.479> is<00:06:30.540> you

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
what I'm trying to show here is you

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.640 
what I'm trying to show here is you
really<00:06:30.960> can't<00:06:31.169> even<00:06:31.260> see<00:06:31.530> they<00:06:31.970> see<00:06:32.970> the<00:06:33.650> air

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
really can't even see they see the air

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.800 
really can't even see they see the air
bubble<00:06:34.950> anymore

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.650 

succession<00:06:38.440> then<00:06:38.590> is<00:06:38.800> 400<00:06:39.340> grit<00:06:39.550> to<00:06:39.850> 600<00:06:40.450> grit

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
succession then is 400 grit to 600 grit

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.290 
succession then is 400 grit to 600 grit
and<00:06:41.620> then<00:06:41.830> I<00:06:41.860> took<00:06:42.010> it<00:06:42.190> over<00:06:42.370> to<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.880> buffing

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
and then I took it over to the buffing

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.210 
and then I took it over to the buffing
station<00:06:43.780> and<00:06:44.050> buffed<00:06:44.290> it<00:06:44.500> with<00:06:44.650> Tripoli<00:06:45.100> and

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
station and buffed it with Tripoli and

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.060 
station and buffed it with Tripoli and
white<00:06:45.430> diamond<00:06:46.260> that's<00:06:47.260> all<00:06:47.530> there<00:06:47.680> is<00:06:47.800> to

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
white diamond that's all there is to

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.640 
white diamond that's all there is to
making<00:06:48.100> the<00:06:48.550> pen<00:06:48.840> it's<00:06:49.840> not<00:06:50.110> a<00:06:50.139> difficult

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
making the pen it's not a difficult

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.310 
making the pen it's not a difficult
process<00:06:51.690> remember<00:06:52.690> when<00:06:52.870> you're<00:06:53.080> lining

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
process remember when you're lining

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.260 
process remember when you're lining
everything<00:06:53.800> up<00:06:54.190> I<00:06:54.340> didn't<00:06:54.639> really<00:06:54.910> go<00:06:55.090> through

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
everything up I didn't really go through

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.260 
everything up I didn't really go through
this<00:06:55.510> when<00:06:55.870> you<00:06:55.990> take<00:06:56.230> when<00:06:57.160> you<00:06:57.310> put<00:06:58.060> your

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
this when you take when you put your

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.770 
this when you take when you put your
brass<00:06:59.169> tubes<00:06:59.560> in<00:06:59.850> measure<00:07:00.850> the<00:07:01.210> brass<00:07:01.419> tube

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
brass tubes in measure the brass tube

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.230 
brass tubes in measure the brass tube
against<00:07:02.410> the<00:07:02.620> blank<00:07:02.889> and<00:07:03.160> look<00:07:03.340> to<00:07:03.580> see<00:07:03.610> what

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
against the blank and look to see what

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.470 
against the blank and look to see what
you<00:07:04.510> want<00:07:04.810> to<00:07:04.990> end<00:07:05.169> up<00:07:05.380> with<00:07:05.560> you've<00:07:05.740> got<00:07:05.950> two

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
you want to end up with you've got two

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.830 
you want to end up with you've got two
radial<00:07:07.480> black<00:07:08.230> lines<00:07:08.620> and<00:07:09.250> they're<00:07:10.120> on<00:07:10.389> both

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
radial black lines and they're on both

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.450 
radial black lines and they're on both
ends<00:07:11.200> of<00:07:11.260> it<00:07:11.350> so<00:07:11.650> now<00:07:11.800> you<00:07:11.889> have<00:07:12.010> to<00:07:12.130> determine

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
ends of it so now you have to determine

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.640 
ends of it so now you have to determine
if<00:07:12.760> you're<00:07:12.880> going<00:07:12.970> to<00:07:13.060> cut<00:07:13.270> it<00:07:13.389> where<00:07:14.290> it's<00:07:14.530> not

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650 
if you're going to cut it where it's not

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.740 
if you're going to cut it where it's not
going<00:07:14.860> to<00:07:14.919> be<00:07:15.040> on<00:07:15.160> a<00:07:15.190> black<00:07:15.430> line<00:07:15.700> how<00:07:16.479> is<00:07:16.630> it

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 
going to be on a black line how is it

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.390 
going to be on a black line how is it
going<00:07:16.900> to<00:07:16.960> look<00:07:17.080> and<00:07:17.380> how<00:07:17.770> is<00:07:17.830> the<00:07:18.040> batter<00:07:18.250> and

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
going to look and how is the batter and

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.330 
going to look and how is the batter and
come<00:07:18.790> out<00:07:18.940> I<00:07:19.240> ended<00:07:20.080> up<00:07:20.169> with<00:07:20.440> one<00:07:21.100> that<00:07:21.280> I'm
