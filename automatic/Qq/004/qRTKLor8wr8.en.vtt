00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
makes this glitch is very cool is you

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.289 
makes this glitch is very cool is you
can<00:01:28.509> basically<00:01:29.439> put<00:01:29.829> any<00:01:30.039> wall<00:01:30.429> or<00:01:30.820> chalk

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
can basically put any wall or chalk

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.020 
can basically put any wall or chalk
piece<00:01:31.960> on<00:01:32.229> that<00:01:32.439> wall<00:01:32.649> you<00:01:33.429> don't<00:01:33.609> need<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.880> put

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
piece on that wall you don't need to put

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.870 
piece on that wall you don't need to put
the<00:01:34.119> an-94<00:01:34.479> but<00:01:35.049> I<00:01:35.079> prefer<00:01:35.649> to<00:01:35.679> do<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.009> from

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
the an-94 but I prefer to do it from

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.819 
the an-94 but I prefer to do it from
here<00:01:37.149> you<00:01:37.450> have<00:01:37.570> unlimited<00:01:37.750> ammo<00:01:38.229> for<00:01:38.530> it<00:01:38.590> and

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
here you have unlimited ammo for it and

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.590 
here you have unlimited ammo for it and
you<00:01:39.280> can<00:01:39.399> get<00:01:39.490> all<00:01:39.670> your<00:01:39.700> friends<00:01:40.119> in<00:01:40.210> here<00:01:40.390> and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
you can get all your friends in here and

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.989 
you can get all your friends in here and
you<00:01:40.750> can<00:01:40.840> get<00:01:40.960> power-ups<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.729> grain

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
you can get power-ups and that grain

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.080 
you can get power-ups and that grain
effect<00:01:43.990> from<00:01:44.229> virtual<00:01:44.710> aid<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.130> also<00:01:45.549> affected

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
effect from virtual aid is also affected

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.120 
effect from virtual aid is also affected
so<00:01:46.600> this<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:46.990> possibly<00:01:47.439> one<00:01:47.649> of<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.799> coolest

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
so this is possibly one of the coolest

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.149 
so this is possibly one of the coolest
and<00:01:48.520> best<00:01:48.549> glitches<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.299> do<00:01:49.509> so<00:01:50.439> be<00:01:50.679> very<00:01:50.920> much

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
and best glitches to do so be very much

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.370 
and best glitches to do so be very much
