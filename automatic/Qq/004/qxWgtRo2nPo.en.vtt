as a child it's of course rather

as a child it's of course rather
miserable<00:00:31.170> experience<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.540> beyond<00:00:33.540> the

miserable experience but beyond the
discomfort<00:00:34.410> what<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> means<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.610> toxins

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
discomfort what it means is that toxins

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.319 
discomfort what it means is that toxins
that<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> body<00:00:36.840> should<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.850> expelling<00:00:38.850> once

around the body too long has a lot of
Dilla<00:00:48.180> Tereus<00:00:48.629> effects<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.680> something

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
Dilla Tereus effects so it's something

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.600 
Dilla Tereus effects so it's something
that<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.789> definitely<00:00:51.059> want<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:52.199> address<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:53.550> my

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that we definitely want to address in my

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.619 
that we definitely want to address in my
20<00:00:54.570> plus<00:00:54.719> years<00:00:55.199> experience<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:56.160> found<00:00:56.629> exactly

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
20 plus years experience I found exactly

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.049 
20 plus years experience I found exactly
what<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.410> research<00:00:58.649> article<00:00:59.100> found<00:00:59.520> funnily

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
what this research article found funnily

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.540 
what this research article found funnily
enough<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:02.070> definitely

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
enough and that was that they definitely

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.179 
enough and that was that they definitely
saw<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> correlation<00:01:03.960> between<00:01:04.189> gluten

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
saw a correlation between gluten

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.810 
saw a correlation between gluten
sensitivity<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.560> constipation

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
sensitivity and constipation

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
sensitivity and constipation
specifically<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:09.060> were<00:01:09.119> looking<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.840> very

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
specifically they were looking at very

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.750 
specifically they were looking at very
young<00:01:10.979> children<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:12.960> window<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.159> six

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
young children and a window of six

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.060 
young children and a window of six
months<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.869> found<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.470> children

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
months so that they found that children

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.370 
months so that they found that children
that<00:01:17.430> were<00:01:17.520> introduced<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.450> gluten<00:01:18.810> at<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that were introduced to gluten at the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.010 
that were introduced to gluten at the
six-month<00:01:19.950> mark<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.580> younger<00:01:21.030> had<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> much

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
six-month mark or younger had a much

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
six-month mark or younger had a much
higher<00:01:22.290> incidence<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.070> constipation<00:01:23.700> than

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
higher incidence of constipation than

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
higher incidence of constipation than
those<00:01:24.720> who<00:01:25.049> were<00:01:25.170> introduced<00:01:25.650> later<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
those who were introduced later and that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.819 
those who were introduced later and that
six-month<00:01:27.270> mark<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.930> definitely<00:01:28.560> something

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
six-month mark is definitely something

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.060 
six-month mark is definitely something
we've<00:01:29.130> heard<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.970> before<00:01:30.470> even<00:01:31.470> associated

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
we've heard about before even associated

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
we've heard about before even associated
with<00:01:32.189> celiac<00:01:32.579> disease<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.450> studies<00:01:34.350> have

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
with celiac disease so studies have

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.160 
with celiac disease so studies have
shown<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.090> if<00:01:36.090> children<00:01:36.509> are<00:01:36.930> not

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
shown that if children are not

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.469 
shown that if children are not
introduced<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> gluten<00:01:38.220> prior<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.850> six<00:01:39.119> months

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
introduced to gluten prior to six months

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.420 
introduced to gluten prior to six months
they<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> lowered<00:01:40.560> risk<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:41.009> celiac

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
they have a lowered risk of celiac

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.910 
they have a lowered risk of celiac
disease<00:01:41.579> than<00:01:42.479> those<00:01:42.810> who<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.290> introduced

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
disease than those who are introduced

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100 
disease than those who are introduced
prior<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.790> time<00:01:45.030> period<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.689> it's

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
prior to that time period and it's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.780 
prior to that time period and it's
thought<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.500> associated<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
thought to be associated with the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.219 
thought to be associated with the
maturity<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> immune<00:01:48.840> system<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
maturity of the immune system and

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.730 
maturity of the immune system and
introducing<00:01:52.229> too<00:01:52.470> soon<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:54.049> very<00:01:55.049> damaging

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
introducing too soon is is very damaging

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.530 
introducing too soon is is very damaging
to<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> immune<00:01:56.280> system<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.299> more

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
to the immune system and it's more

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.810 
to the immune system and it's more
likely<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.259> result<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> more<00:01:59.159> serious

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
likely to result in the more serious

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.149 
likely to result in the more serious
celiac<00:02:00.450> disease<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:01.799> celiac

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
celiac disease now we know as celiac

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.580 
celiac disease now we know as celiac
there<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> genetic<00:02:03.299> preponderance<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.320> well

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
there is a genetic preponderance as well

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.430 
there is a genetic preponderance as well
but<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.399> timeframe<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.570> six<00:02:06.990> months

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
but this timeframe of the six months

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.890 
but this timeframe of the six months
definitely<00:02:08.010> something<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.580> has<00:02:09.240> come<00:02:09.840> up

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
definitely something that has come up

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.970 
definitely something that has come up
many<00:02:10.080> times<00:02:10.590> before<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:12.150> course<00:02:12.510> with

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
many times before and of course with

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.530 
many times before and of course with
celiac<00:02:13.980> disease<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.760> we've<00:02:14.970> talked<00:02:15.360> about

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
celiac disease what we've talked about

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.730 
celiac disease what we've talked about
is<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:17.130> too<00:02:17.490> often<00:02:17.760> as<00:02:18.260> clinicians<00:02:19.260> were

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
is that all too often as clinicians were

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.950 
is that all too often as clinicians were
taught<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.040> celiac<00:02:20.760> has<00:02:21.000> sort<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> classic

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
taught that celiac has sort of a classic

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.710 
taught that celiac has sort of a classic
relationship<00:02:22.650> with<00:02:23.460> diarrhea

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
relationship with diarrhea

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.580 
relationship with diarrhea
weight<00:02:25.140> loss<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.720> children<00:02:27.720> or<00:02:28.110> adults

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
weight loss and so children or adults

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.930 
weight loss and so children or adults
that<00:02:28.680> are<00:02:28.740> more<00:02:29.010> complaining<00:02:29.460> of<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
that are more complaining of the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.570 
that are more complaining of the
constipation<00:02:30.680> slower<00:02:31.680> bowel<00:02:32.040> movements

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
constipation slower bowel movements

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.450 
constipation slower bowel movements
would<00:02:33.030> not<00:02:33.240> be<00:02:33.480> an<00:02:33.600> instant<00:02:34.140> jump<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
would not be an instant jump to the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.250 
would not be an instant jump to the
traditional<00:02:35.970> clinician<00:02:36.540> thinking<00:02:36.960> about

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
traditional clinician thinking about

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.740 
traditional clinician thinking about
gluten<00:02:37.860> as<00:02:38.010> being<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.370> problem<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.510> was<00:02:39.720> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
gluten as being a problem so this was a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.780 
gluten as being a problem so this was a
good<00:02:40.020> study<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.680> really<00:02:40.980> brought<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.520> light

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
good study that really brought to light

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.000 
good study that really brought to light
the<00:02:42.270> fact<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.780> correlation<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.680> most

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
the fact that that correlation is most

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.340 
the fact that that correlation is most
definitely<00:02:44.580> there<00:02:44.850> they<00:02:45.390> also<00:02:45.600> mentioned

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
definitely there they also mentioned

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.640 
definitely there they also mentioned
that<00:02:46.880> dairy<00:02:47.880> intolerance<00:02:48.660> was<00:02:49.080> associated

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
that dairy intolerance was associated

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.310 
that dairy intolerance was associated
with<00:02:49.680> constipation<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.550> well<00:02:50.760> which<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:52.050> have

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
with constipation as well which we have

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.460 
with constipation as well which we have
definitely<00:02:53.310> seen<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.910> our<00:02:54.000> patients<00:02:54.630> they<00:02:55.200> did

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
definitely seen in our patients they did

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.300 
definitely seen in our patients they did
note<00:02:55.710> that<00:02:55.740> other<00:02:56.130> foods<00:02:56.490> like<00:02:56.640> eggs<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.510> soy

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
note that other foods like eggs and soy

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.760 
note that other foods like eggs and soy
tree<00:02:59.310> nuts<00:02:59.550> did<00:03:00.120> not<00:03:00.330> show<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.230> correlation

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
tree nuts did not show that correlation

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.130 
tree nuts did not show that correlation
when<00:03:02.340> they<00:03:02.490> were<00:03:02.550> introduced<00:03:03.240> so<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.960> does

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
when they were introduced so it does

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.780 
when they were introduced so it does
seem<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.560> something<00:03:04.920> more<00:03:05.310> associated

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
seem to be something more associated

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.010 
seem to be something more associated
with<00:03:05.910> gluten<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.570> dairy<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:08.160> this<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.670> an<00:03:09.330> area

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
with gluten and dairy so this is an area

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.900 
with gluten and dairy so this is an area
that<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.380> wanted<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:10.980> bring<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.430> light<00:03:11.610> because

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
that I wanted to bring to light because

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.570 
that I wanted to bring to light because
all<00:03:12.660> too<00:03:12.989> often<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.739> have<00:03:14.220> found<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:14.550> my

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
all too often I have found in my

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.130 
all too often I have found in my
clinical<00:03:15.120> experience<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.810> when<00:03:15.930> parents

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
clinical experience that when parents

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.880 
clinical experience that when parents

I<00:03:42.920> disagree<00:03:43.920> very<00:03:44.100> strongly<00:03:44.489> with<00:03:44.760> that

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
I disagree very strongly with that

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.199 
I disagree very strongly with that
and<00:03:45.360> sure<00:03:46.080> enough<00:03:46.110> have<00:03:46.739> found<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.489> when<00:03:47.970> the
