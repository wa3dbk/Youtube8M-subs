00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
operation dr. wash explained to me that

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.219 
operation dr. wash explained to me that
what<00:01:12.549> it<00:01:12.640> would<00:01:12.759> be<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:13.540> he<00:01:13.689> would<00:01:13.840> rear<00:01:14.049> out

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
what it would be that he would rear out

I<00:01:24.700> didn't<00:01:25.299> really<00:01:25.450> know<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:26.170> just<00:01:26.770> put<00:01:26.950> my<00:01:27.070> faith

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
I didn't really know I just put my faith

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.209 
I didn't really know I just put my faith
in<00:01:27.369> dr.<00:01:27.880> wersja<00:01:28.299> he<00:01:29.229> said<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.680> if<00:01:29.770> I<00:01:29.890> didn't

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
in dr. wersja he said that if I didn't

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.760 
in dr. wersja he said that if I didn't
have<00:01:30.369> surgery<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:31.180> would<00:01:31.450> grow<00:01:31.719> and<00:01:32.110> then

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
have surgery it would grow and then

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.620 
have surgery it would grow and then
after<00:01:33.130> three<00:01:33.340> months<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.939> six<00:01:34.210> months<00:01:34.390> it

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
after three months to six months it

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.990 
after three months to six months it
would<00:01:34.689> probably<00:01:35.110> kill<00:01:35.380> me<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:36.460> know<00:01:36.579> I<00:01:36.609> was<00:01:36.700> so

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
would probably kill me you know I was so

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.630 
would probably kill me you know I was so
happy<00:01:37.180> that<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:38.140> survived<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:39.039> thing<00:01:39.399> I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
happy that I survived this thing I

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.969 
happy that I survived this thing I
wanted<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.689> whole<00:01:40.840> world<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.409> know<00:01:41.439> about<00:01:41.560> it

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
wanted the whole world to know about it

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.279 
wanted the whole world to know about it
I<00:01:42.130> never<00:01:42.729> thought<00:01:42.820> that<00:01:43.210> people<00:01:43.420> lived<00:01:43.930> that

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
I never thought that people lived that

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.630 
I never thought that people lived that
long<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.859> thought<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.250> was<00:01:45.340> an<00:01:45.460> immediate

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
long and I thought it was an immediate

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.630 
long and I thought it was an immediate
death<00:01:46.060> sentence<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.630> it<00:01:46.719> certainly<00:01:46.990> isn't<00:01:47.640> so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
death sentence and it certainly isn't so

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.200 
death sentence and it certainly isn't so
now<00:01:48.820> eight<00:01:49.149> years<00:01:49.180> later<00:01:49.479> I'm<00:01:50.049> still<00:01:50.289> here

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
now eight years later I'm still here

now eight years later I'm still here

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
proof that you can make it even though
