encouragement would you give to a mom
who<00:04:01.920> seems<00:04:02.280> like<00:04:02.490> she's<00:04:03.390> not<00:04:03.570> really

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
who seems like she's not really

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.530 
who seems like she's not really
impacting<00:04:04.910> making<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.000> impact<00:04:06.270> that<00:04:06.390> she

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
impacting making the impact that she

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.410 
impacting making the impact that she
would<00:04:06.660> want<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.930> make<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:07.490> think<00:04:08.490> all<00:04:08.700> moms<00:04:08.970> are

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
would want to make I think all moms are

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.720 
would want to make I think all moms are
more<00:04:09.660> influential<00:04:10.170> than<00:04:10.380> they<00:04:10.680> realized

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
more influential than they realized

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.580 
more influential than they realized
just<00:04:12.209> by<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.420> virtue<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> fact<00:04:13.019> that<00:04:13.379> they

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
just by the virtue of the fact that they

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.979 
just by the virtue of the fact that they
have<00:04:13.769> time<00:04:14.040> with<00:04:14.280> your<00:04:14.430> children<00:04:14.670> in<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:15.629> home

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
have time with your children in the home

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.439 
have time with your children in the home
but<00:04:16.440> i<00:04:16.470> think<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:16.979> Natalie<00:04:17.940> really<00:04:18.209> touched

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
but i think that Natalie really touched

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.689 
but i think that Natalie really touched
on<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.840> when<00:04:18.989> she<00:04:19.139> talked<00:04:19.410> about<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.979> tug-of-war

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
on it when she talked about a tug-of-war

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.310 
on it when she talked about a tug-of-war
you<00:04:21.180> feel<00:04:21.329> like<00:04:21.449> you're<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.810> tug-of-war<00:04:22.079> for

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
you feel like you're in a tug-of-war for

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.219 
you feel like you're in a tug-of-war for
your<00:04:22.620> children<00:04:23.040> and<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:24.120> felt<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:25.080> at

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
your children and I felt like that at

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.170 
your children and I felt like that at
times<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.650> think<00:04:25.680> every<00:04:26.130> mother<00:04:26.370> has<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:27.030> you

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
times I think every mother has that you

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.719 
times I think every mother has that you
really<00:04:27.479> are<00:04:27.510> fighting<00:04:28.080> against<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.729> world

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
really are fighting against the world

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.510 
really are fighting against the world
system<00:04:30.510> you're<00:04:30.810> fighting<00:04:31.229> gets<00:04:31.530> other<00:04:32.070> kids

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
system you're fighting gets other kids

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.550 
system you're fighting gets other kids
that<00:04:32.760> influence<00:04:33.449> them<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.050> so<00:04:34.229> many<00:04:34.350> other

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
that influence them and so many other

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.830 
that influence them and so many other
things<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.100> media<00:04:35.490> television<00:04:36.030> all<00:04:36.540> of<00:04:36.660> that

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
things the media television all of that

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.879 
things the media television all of that
movies<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:38.639> think<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:39.090> have<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.330> be

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
movies and so I think you have to be

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.830 
movies and so I think you have to be
determined<00:04:40.889> as<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.280> mother<00:04:41.699> that<00:04:42.060> you're<00:04:42.360> not

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
determined as a mother that you're not

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.930 
determined as a mother that you're not
going<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.139> give<00:04:43.290> in<00:04:43.320> or<00:04:43.680> give<00:04:43.710> up<00:04:44.039> or<00:04:44.340> surrender

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
going to give in or give up or surrender

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.540 
going to give in or give up or surrender
and<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.870> just<00:04:46.229> are<00:04:46.650> determined<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.250> win<00:04:47.400> that

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
and you just are determined to win that

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.540 
and you just are determined to win that
tug<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:47.880> war<00:04:48.000> through<00:04:48.510> prayer<00:04:48.930> through<00:04:49.550> loving

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550

I<00:05:23.210> think<00:05:23.540> that<00:05:24.140> really<00:05:24.820> enables<00:05:25.820> you<00:05:26.000> to<00:05:26.170> to

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
I think that really enables you to to

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.050 
I think that really enables you to to
have<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.560> bigger<00:05:27.980> influence

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
have a bigger influence

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.750 
have a bigger influence
throughout<00:05:29.690> their<00:05:29.990> life<00:05:30.200> then<00:05:31.190> they<00:05:31.430> can<00:05:31.639> even

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
throughout their life then they can even

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.870 
throughout their life then they can even
imagine<00:05:32.770> they<00:05:33.770> start<00:05:34.220> with<00:05:34.340> that<00:05:34.460> there's<00:05:34.669> so

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
imagine they start with that there's so

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.640 
imagine they start with that there's so
many<00:05:34.970> other<00:05:35.210> things<00:05:35.300> i'm<00:05:35.810> a<00:05:35.840> big<00:05:36.110> proponent<00:05:36.139> of
