00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
technically I think he did everything

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.319 
technically I think he did everything
right<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.399> did<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> armbar<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.180> on

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
right when he did the armbar right on

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.180 
right when he did the armbar right on
Dan<00:00:51.510> Hardy<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.289> problem<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:52.980> he

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
Dan Hardy the problem was that he

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.709 
Dan Hardy the problem was that he
strained<00:00:53.550> out<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> armor<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.270> looking<00:00:54.570> for

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
strained out the armor was looking for

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.479 
strained out the armor was looking for
the<00:00:54.809> tap<00:00:55.020> right<00:00:55.680> that's<00:00:55.920> why<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.280> train

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the tap right that's why I don't train

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
the tap right that's why I don't train
for<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.760> when<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> train<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> gym<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.050> grab

hang<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> ground<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.110> before

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
hang on the ground we can get to before

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.410 
hang on the ground we can get to before
the<00:02:07.530> whole<00:02:07.890> idea<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.459> how<00:02:08.580> posturing<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.209> works

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the whole idea of how posturing up works

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.410 
the whole idea of how posturing up works
this<00:02:09.599> year<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.760> so<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.940> kind<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.390> guess

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
this year and so it's kind of I guess

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.210 
this year and so it's kind of I guess
you<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:12.780> call<00:02:12.870> them<00:02:12.959> sub<00:02:13.170> positions<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:14.069> a

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
you can call them sub positions it's a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.750 
you can call them sub positions it's a
way<00:02:14.340> where<00:02:15.290> well<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.440> well<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.650> better<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
way where well you well you better to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.309 
way where well you well you better to
explain<00:02:18.030> as<00:02:18.209> we're<00:02:18.330> doing<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.599> Colin<00:02:19.200> was

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
explain as we're doing it Colin was

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.750 
explain as we're doing it Colin was

drop big bombs on me I guess so the the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.910 
drop big bombs on me I guess so the the
idea<00:02:54.870> there<00:02:55.049> again<00:02:55.260> it's<00:02:55.440> trying<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.739> make<00:02:55.830> it

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
idea there again it's trying to make it

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.380 
idea there again it's trying to make it
a<00:02:55.950> little<00:02:56.040> more<00:02:56.160> organic<00:02:56.760> instead<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.209> having

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
a little more organic instead of having

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.930 
a little more organic instead of having
ok<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.840> have<00:02:58.049> position<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.590> position<00:02:58.650> B<00:02:59.280> it's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
ok you have position a position B it's

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.970 
ok you have position a position B it's
all<00:03:00.390> kind<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.780> within<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.170> position<00:03:01.739> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
all kind of within this position and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.920 
all kind of within this position and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
within other ground positions to where

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.660 
within other ground positions to where
now<00:03:04.049> CZ<00:03:04.410> starting<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.950> really<00:03:05.069> land<00:03:05.310> stuff<00:03:05.580> and

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
being up a little bit from the default

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.569 
being up a little bit from the default
position<00:03:22.109> is<00:03:22.200> down<00:03:22.500> another<00:03:23.100> thing<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.400> point

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
position is down another thing to point

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.710 
position is down another thing to point
out<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.120> get<00:03:24.209> back<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.420> half<00:03:24.540> guard

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
out if you can get back to half guard

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.690 
out if you can get back to half guard
here<00:03:24.870> Colin<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.489> down<00:03:26.670> position

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
here Colin is that in the down position

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.449 
here Colin is that in the down position
yeah<00:03:27.450> when<00:03:28.260> you're<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.280> down<00:03:29.430> position

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
yeah when you're in the down position

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.569 
yeah when you're in the down position
here<00:03:30.060> you're<00:03:30.840> better<00:03:31.470> at<00:03:31.739> defending<00:03:31.950> against

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
here you're better at defending against

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.220 
here you're better at defending against
the<00:03:32.609> opponent's<00:03:33.000> transitions<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:34.079> you're

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
the opponent's transitions but you're

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.349 
the opponent's transitions but you're
less<00:03:34.440> effective<00:03:34.859> at<00:03:34.950> your<00:03:35.069> striking<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:36.150> if<00:03:36.299> I

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
less effective at your striking so if I

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.059 
less effective at your striking so if I
want<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.600> control<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.109> guy<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.440> stay<00:03:37.650> down<00:03:37.859> in

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
want to control the guy can stay down in

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.289 
want to control the guy can stay down in
this<00:03:38.190> position<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:38.880> better<00:03:39.060> control

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
this position and I have better control

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.550 
this position and I have better control
of<00:03:39.480> them<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:39.870> harder<00:03:40.140> for<00:03:40.170> him<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.410> get

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
of them and it's harder for him to get

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.620 
of them and it's harder for him to get
out<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.519> posture<00:03:41.940> up<00:03:42.060> now<00:03:42.329> I<00:03:42.359> can<00:03:42.540> be

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
out but if I posture up now I can be

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.479 
out but if I posture up now I can be
more<00:03:42.750> effective<00:03:43.170> at<00:03:43.260> my<00:03:43.380> striking<00:03:43.739> but<00:03:44.280> now<00:03:44.430> I

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
more effective at my striking but now I

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.370 
more effective at my striking but now I
leave<00:03:44.670> myself<00:03:44.819> open<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.329> transitions<00:03:45.959> that's

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380
