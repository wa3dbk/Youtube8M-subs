you<00:00:03.300> know<00:00:03.420> I'm<00:00:03.870> more<00:00:05.060> concerned<00:00:06.060> about<00:00:06.180> the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
you know I'm more concerned about the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.150 
you know I'm more concerned about the
referee<00:00:06.870> being<00:00:07.170> absolutely<00:00:07.650> right<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.069> that

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
referee being absolutely right that that

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.799 
referee being absolutely right that that
was<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.520> right<00:00:09.000> penalty<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.540> give<00:00:09.660> at<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
was the right penalty to give at the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.470 
was the right penalty to give at the
scrum<00:00:10.080> when<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.639> scrums<00:00:11.910> were<00:00:12.119> reasonably

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
scrum when the scrums were reasonably

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.570 
scrum when the scrums were reasonably
steady<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.680> shall<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.949> reset<00:00:14.369> not

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
steady and it shall be a reset not

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.480 
steady and it shall be a reset not
patentable<00:00:15.029> you<00:00:15.420> know<00:00:15.539> we<00:00:15.719> make<00:00:16.170> those

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
patentable you know we make those

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.620 
patentable you know we make those
interpretations

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
interpretations

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.580 
interpretations
maybe<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.970> turned<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.180> time<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.660> looks<00:00:22.470> as

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
maybe we turned up on time and looks as

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
maybe we turned up on time and looks as
if<00:00:22.770> it<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.010> fit<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:24.000> they're<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.360> know<00:00:24.420> we

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
if it was fit and they're you know we

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
if it was fit and they're you know we
might<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.840> able<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.020> referee<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> little<00:00:25.500> bit

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
might be able to referee a little bit

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.200 
might be able to referee a little bit
better<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.920> future<00:00:28.160> yeah<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.280> turn<00:00:29.940> up<00:00:30.000> late

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
better in future yeah we turn up late

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.700 
better in future yeah we turn up late
into<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.630> change<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.990> rooms<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.380> obviously

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
into the change of rooms and obviously

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.150 
into the change of rooms and obviously
was<00:00:31.949> he<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.469> he<00:00:34.469> was<00:00:34.590> flustered<00:00:35.010> for

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
was he was there he was flustered for

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.500 
was he was there he was flustered for
some<00:00:35.280> reason<00:00:35.550> maybe<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> traffic<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.420> ER

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
some reason maybe with the traffic in ER

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.060 
some reason maybe with the traffic in ER
done<00:00:36.660> over<00:00:36.930> there<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.590> certainly<00:00:37.860> didn't

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
done over there you certainly didn't

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.880 
done over there you certainly didn't
refer<00:00:38.310> a<00:00:38.430> two-hour<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:42.680> just<00:00:43.680> think

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
refer a two-hour like you just think

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
refer a two-hour like you just think
that<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.460> know<00:00:44.489> we've<00:00:45.390> got<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.540> lot<00:00:45.720> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
that we you know we've got a lot of

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.810 
that we you know we've got a lot of
press<00:00:45.960> recently<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.739> we've<00:00:46.920> we've<00:00:47.220> made<00:00:47.430> huge

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
press recently and we've we've made huge

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.210 
press recently and we've we've made huge
strides<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.540> you<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.440> come<00:00:50.040> away<00:00:50.130> from

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
strides and you know we come away from

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.799 
strides and you know we come away from
so<00:00:50.610> always<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.239> think<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.510> always<00:00:51.600> more

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
so always I think it's always more

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.150 
so always I think it's always more
difficult<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.260> us<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.680> want<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> sound

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
difficult for us I don't want to sound

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.280 
difficult for us I don't want to sound
like<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.399> whinging<00:00:53.790> northern<00:00:54.540> get<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.050> you

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.110 
will go on the cowards well you know I
say<00:02:05.860> within<00:02:06.190> three<00:02:06.400> minutes<00:02:06.700> we<00:02:06.850> could<00:02:06.970> have

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
say within three minutes we could have

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.280 
say within three minutes we could have
won<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.330> game<00:02:07.480> and<00:02:07.540> should<00:02:07.990> have<00:02:08.080> won<00:02:08.200> the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
won the game and should have won the

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.900 
won the game and should have won the
game<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.649> think<00:02:08.770> we<00:02:09.010> can<00:02:09.160> see<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.550> penalty

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
game I think we can see that the penalty

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.910 
game I think we can see that the penalty
I<00:02:09.940> was<00:02:10.210> coming<00:02:10.420> down<00:02:10.540> from<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.780> press<00:02:10.960> box<00:02:11.140> so

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
I was coming down from the press box so

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.360 
I was coming down from the press box so
I<00:02:12.550> saw<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.360> gate<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.630> saw<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.900> scrums
