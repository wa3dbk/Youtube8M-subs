think<00:00:15.619> that<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:17.520> point<00:00:17.880> here<00:00:18.359> there's

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
think that this point here there's

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.779 
think that this point here there's
something<00:00:19.529> up<00:00:19.770> with<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.130> don't<00:00:20.369> think<00:00:20.460> that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
something up with it I don't think that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.060 
something up with it I don't think that
that's<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.090> good<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.390> point<00:00:21.570> at<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.890> looks

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that's a good you point at all it looks

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.490 
that's a good you point at all it looks
very<00:00:23.160> very<00:00:23.640> very<00:00:23.970> different<00:00:24.390> from<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.439> one

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
very very very different from this one

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.279 
very very very different from this one

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
here and all the rest of them which I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.529 
here and all the rest of them which I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
pictures and stuff I think this is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.639 
pictures and stuff I think this is
really<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:38.780> it's<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.260> Summer<00:00:40.530> Sun

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
really just it's just the Summer Sun

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.280 
really just it's just the Summer Sun
also<00:00:41.460> i<00:00:41.489> watered<00:00:41.940> them<00:00:42.090> pretty<00:00:42.780> well<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.050> don't

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
also i watered them pretty well I don't

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.700 
also i watered them pretty well I don't
water<00:00:43.680> them<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.750> viewers

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
water them you know one of the viewers

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.729 
water them you know one of the viewers
said<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.230> watch<00:00:49.469> over

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
said that you know you got to watch over

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
said that you know you got to watch over
watering<00:00:50.190> them<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.820> try<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> do

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
watering them and so I try not to do

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.220 
watering them and so I try not to do
that<00:00:52.190> but<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:53.789> they're<00:00:53.940> growing<00:00:54.480> pretty

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that but I think they're growing pretty

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
that but I think they're growing pretty
well<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.309> rained<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.000> lot<00:00:57.149> actually

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
well it just rained a lot actually

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.959 
well it just rained a lot actually
yesterday<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.469> hadn't<00:00:59.250> wanted<00:00:59.460> them<00:00:59.730> for<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
yesterday I hadn't wanted them for a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.539 
yesterday I hadn't wanted them for a
while<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> they're<00:01:03.059> growing<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:04.549> oddly

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
while so they're growing all right oddly

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.950 
while so they're growing all right oddly
enough<00:01:05.580> though<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.630> really

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
enough though the one that I really

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.260 
enough though the one that I really
thought<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.439> would<00:01:07.710> survive<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.640> really

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
thought that would survive it really

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
thought that would survive it really
hasn't<00:01:09.860> that<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.549> sort<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
hasn't that was the one that's sort of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
hasn't that was the one that's sort of
sprouted<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.570> first<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.290> was<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
sprouted up first and was one of the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.010 
sprouted up first and was one of the
ones<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.189> starting<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.670> big<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.780> that's

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
ones was starting to get big now that's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.200 
ones was starting to get big now that's
all<00:01:16.229> that's<00:01:16.350> left<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:19.850> that's<00:01:20.850> my

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
all that's left of it really that's my

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.230 
all that's left of it really that's my
other<00:01:21.330> plants<00:01:22.070> I've<00:01:23.070> got<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.549> started<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> sort

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
other plants I've got I started to sort

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.749 
other plants I've got I started to sort
of<00:01:24.330> grow<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:24.950> organic<00:01:25.950> garden<00:01:26.490> here

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
of grow a little organic garden here

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.810 
of grow a little organic garden here
with<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.780> organic<00:01:28.290> soil<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:32.340> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
with all organic soil and this is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.270 
with all organic soil and this is
organic<00:01:33.810> garlic<00:01:34.049> which<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.619> planned<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> from<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
organic garlic which I planned it from a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.710 
organic garlic which I planned it from a
bulb<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.850> organic<00:01:38.850> basil<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
bulb and this is organic basil and this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.280 
bulb and this is organic basil and this
is<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.259> think<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:41.610> organic<00:01:42.060> time<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.659> think

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
is I think the organic time I think

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.810 
is I think the organic time I think
that's<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.710> was<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.979> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.189> forgot<00:01:44.520> I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
that's what it was I kind of forgot I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.649 
that's what it was I kind of forgot I
think<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.540> time<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.670> those<00:01:47.909> these

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
think it is time and I got those these

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.330 
think it is time and I got those these
two<00:01:48.930> from<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> store<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.170> some<00:01:53.130> my

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
two from a store and you know some my

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.680 
two from a store and you know some my
other<00:01:53.520> plants

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.109 

but<00:01:59.830> you<00:02:00.830> know<00:02:00.950> as<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.369> goji<00:02:01.670> plants<00:02:02.000> have

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
but you know as the goji plants have

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.340 
but you know as the goji plants have
progressed<00:02:03.880> these<00:02:04.880> seem<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.750> really<00:02:06.050> be<00:02:06.170> the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
progressed these seem to really be the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.710 
progressed these seem to really be the
only<00:02:06.530> ones<00:02:06.800> that<00:02:07.040> are<00:02:07.159> left<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:08.179> ones<00:02:08.390> in<00:02:08.539> this

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
only ones that are left the ones in this

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.779 
only ones that are left the ones in this
pot<00:02:08.959> has<00:02:09.259> sort<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.619> died<00:02:09.830> out<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.310> think<00:02:10.670> it's

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
pot has sort of died out I think it's

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.120 
pot has sort of died out I think it's
because<00:02:11.200> when<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.290> get<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.680> summertime

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
because when you get to be summertime

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.270 
because when you get to be summertime
they<00:02:13.760> need<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.030> either<00:02:14.180> be<00:02:14.410> deep<00:02:15.410> down<00:02:15.770> or<00:02:16.160> they

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
they need to either be deep down or they

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.430 
they need to either be deep down or they
need<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.489> be<00:02:16.760> pretty<00:02:17.060> firmly<00:02:17.420> established<00:02:18.260> to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
need to be pretty firmly established to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.670 
need to be pretty firmly established to
survive<00:02:18.860> that's<00:02:19.190> my<00:02:19.640> experience<00:02:20.560> because<00:02:21.560> you

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
survive that's my experience because you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.880 
survive that's my experience because you
see<00:02:21.860> this<00:02:22.040> one<00:02:22.250> here<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:23.690> was<00:02:23.900> buried<00:02:24.380> deeply

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
see this one here this was buried deeply

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.860 
see this one here this was buried deeply
they<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.280> were<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.850> they<00:02:25.970> all<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.150> think<00:02:26.569> sort

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
they all were and they all I think sort

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.290 
they all were and they all I think sort
of<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.230> think<00:02:28.010> it's<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.220> heat<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.970> soil

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
of I think it's the heat of the soil

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.170 
of I think it's the heat of the soil
being<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.110> know<00:02:30.200> heated<00:02:30.530> by<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.680> Sun<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:31.280> think

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
being you know heated by the Sun I think

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.490 
being you know heated by the Sun I think
it's<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.840> then<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.080> fact<00:02:33.320> they<00:02:33.470> were

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
it's that and then the fact they were

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.680 
it's that and then the fact they were
shielded<00:02:34.220> from<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.489> direct<00:02:34.880> sunlight<00:02:35.300> and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
shielded from the direct sunlight and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.600 
shielded from the direct sunlight and
given<00:02:36.019> time<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.560> sort<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.950> develop<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.400> root

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
given time to sort of develop a root

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.470 
given time to sort of develop a root
system<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.300> think<00:02:38.930> that's<00:02:39.230> what<00:02:39.500> allowed<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.070> to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
system I think that's what allowed it to

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.150 
system I think that's what allowed it to
sort<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.620> survive<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.040> point<00:02:43.750> well

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
sort of survive to this point well

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.840 
sort of survive to this point well
that's<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.430> for<00:02:46.610> now<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:48.130> hope<00:02:49.130> everybody<00:02:49.610> who

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
that's it for now I hope everybody who

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.640 
that's it for now I hope everybody who
watches<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.420> doing<00:02:50.900> well<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.320> I<00:02:51.380> hope<00:02:51.410> you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
watches this doing well and I hope you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.430 
watches this doing well and I hope you
guys<00:02:51.800> stay<00:02:52.160> tuned
