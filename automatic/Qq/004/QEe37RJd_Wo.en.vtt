what<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.170> program's<00:03:16.590> original<00:03:17.040> purpose<00:03:17.370> was

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
what the program's original purpose was

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.080 
what the program's original purpose was
was<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:18.180> display<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.739> mini-map<00:03:20.130> larger

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
was to display the mini-map larger

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.809 
was to display the mini-map larger
because<00:03:21.630> that's<00:03:22.500> handy<00:03:22.829> it<00:03:23.069> would<00:03:23.370> only<00:03:23.549> be

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
because that's handy it would only be

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.490
