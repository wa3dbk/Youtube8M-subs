the<00:02:06.060> side<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.270> originally<00:02:06.870> jammed<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.070> me

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the side that originally jammed up on me

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.260 
the side that originally jammed up on me
so<00:02:08.460> that's<00:02:09.000> been<00:02:09.270> wonderful<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:09.900> happen

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
so that's been wonderful to have happen

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.430 
so that's been wonderful to have happen
but<00:02:12.270> then<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.450> also<00:02:12.600> got<00:02:12.870> curious<00:02:13.260> with<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
but then I also got curious with the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.050 
but then I also got curious with the
design<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.100> blaster<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.490> got<00:02:14.640> these<00:02:14.790> two

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
design of the blaster you got these two

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.490 
design of the blaster you got these two
drums<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.660> side<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:15.840> make<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.230> look<00:02:16.350> like

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
I started thinking well what would it

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.120 
I started thinking well what would it
look<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.290> different<00:02:22.770> clipper

side<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.940> won't<00:03:33.150> fire<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.510> at<00:03:33.600> all<00:03:33.720> however

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.429 

it's<00:03:38.209> not<00:03:38.330> even<00:03:38.540> feeding<00:03:38.870> this<00:03:39.019> side<00:03:39.260> this

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 
it's not even feeding this side this

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.660 
it's not even feeding this side this
sides<00:03:39.709> already<00:03:40.010> jammed<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:42.590> will<00:03:42.829> continue<00:03:43.549> to

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
sides already jammed it will continue to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.429 
sides already jammed it will continue to
shoot<00:03:43.909> as<00:03:44.090> long<00:03:44.269> as<00:03:44.420> there's<00:03:44.569> magazines<00:03:45.110> in

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 
shoot as long as there's magazines in

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.649 
shoot as long as there's magazines in
there<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.010> if<00:03:46.459> you're<00:03:46.760> out<00:03:46.849> of<00:03:46.879> ammo<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.420> one

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
there so if you're out of ammo and one

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.240 
there so if you're out of ammo and one
and<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.140> have<00:03:48.319> one<00:03:48.560> other<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:48.890> can<00:03:49.010> at<00:03:49.129> least

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
and you have one other you can at least

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.589 
and you have one other you can at least
stick<00:03:49.640> it<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:49.790> there<00:03:49.879> and<00:03:49.970> have<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.120> be<00:03:50.269> single

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
stick it in there and have it be single

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.699 
stick it in there and have it be single
fire<00:03:50.780> however<00:03:51.709> all<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.129> that<00:03:52.250> said<00:03:52.579> I<00:03:53.709> was

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
fire however all of that said I was

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.170 
fire however all of that said I was
really<00:03:54.980> hoping<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.549> going<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:55.790> be<00:03:55.909> a

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
really hoping this is going to be a

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.960 
really hoping this is going to be a
rapid<00:03:56.870> strike<00:03:57.170> doubled<00:03:57.739> up<00:03:57.860> but<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.489> can't<00:03:58.790> be

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
rapid strike doubled up but it can't be

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.640 
rapid strike doubled up but it can't be
because<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.299> rapid<00:03:59.599> strike<00:03:59.780> works<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:00.379> much

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
because the rapid strike works so much

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.190 
because the rapid strike works so much
better<00:04:00.920> than<00:04:01.069> this<00:04:01.250> system<00:04:01.690> so<00:04:02.690> if<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:02.989> want

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
better than this system so if you want

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.259 
better than this system so if you want
dual<00:04:03.500> blast<00:04:03.769> in<00:04:03.920> action<00:04:04.190> do<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.760> bow<00:04:05.000> below

right now it's attached to what you guys
are<00:04:10.730> watching<00:04:11.709> but<00:04:12.709> yeah<00:04:12.829> that<00:04:13.099> would<00:04:13.220> be<00:04:13.250> so

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
are watching but yeah that would be so

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.719 
are watching but yeah that would be so
much<00:04:14.120> better<00:04:14.329> so<00:04:14.739> I'm<00:04:15.739> really<00:04:16.039> disappointed

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
much better so I'm really disappointed

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.449 
much better so I'm really disappointed
that<00:04:17.269> they<00:04:17.810> didn't<00:04:18.199> fix<00:04:18.500> issues<00:04:19.070> with<00:04:19.340> the

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
that they didn't fix issues with the

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.090 
that they didn't fix issues with the
quality<00:04:19.910> or<00:04:20.120> with<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.510> with<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.560> timing<00:04:21.949> or

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
quality or with the with the timing or

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.650 
quality or with the with the timing or
with<00:04:22.220> whatever's<00:04:22.639> going<00:04:23.150> wrong<00:04:23.330> with<00:04:23.510> this

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
with whatever's going wrong with this

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.650 
with whatever's going wrong with this
but<00:04:24.500> then<00:04:24.620> also<00:04:24.800> sad<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.250> you<00:04:26.030> know<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.360> four

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
but then also sad that you know the four

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.350 
but then also sad that you know the four
grip<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.380> grip<00:04:27.530> up<00:04:27.710> front<00:04:28.010> could<00:04:28.820> really<00:04:29.180> be

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
grip the grip up front could really be

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.180 
grip the grip up front could really be
wider<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:30.050> could<00:04:30.199> be<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.380> much<00:04:30.680> better<00:04:30.919> for

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
wider that could be a much better for

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.680 
wider that could be a much better for
like<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.550> Vulcan<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.240> was<00:04:32.360> an<00:04:32.479> awesome

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690
