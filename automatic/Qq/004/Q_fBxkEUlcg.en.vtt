00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.030
 let's first see the other parts that 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:24.499
 comes in the box that are a little more 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.679

 bus and adapter for usb cable 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.819
 to charge the AC adapter and 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.149
 a little different because it comes with 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:53.850
 the one class feature that Chardy 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.490
 promises to charge the smartphone much more 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.149
 fast if it works even just how much more 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.340
 fast 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.400
 you will see in our new analysis 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.570

 this is symphony 2 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.190
 how can you see as much as 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.230
 greater than symphony 5 and is as follows 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.870
 We can not really be comparing us very 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.300
 it with no handset 51 because this handset 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.180
 here is not really a new version of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.670
 iphone 5 it enters a new segment o 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.210
 More top line segment and having 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.070
 more advanced specifications are 4 gb 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.810
 of ram one of the first 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.750
 devices announced with so much memory 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.100
 Yes, our version has 32 GB of 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.930
 internal storage 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.310
 only that the international versions do not 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.450
 16 options up to 128 points our 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.390
 affirm that here in Brazil we go 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.730
 receive the maximum of 32 gigas let's see the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.310
 If it's a pretty red and it's not for 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.900
 everyone but it 's cool to have a choice 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.670
 differential here ends up calling for more 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.620
 attention of people who like 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.510
 It's something you can see right away. 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.670
 that is worth mentioning is that the buttons 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.410
 volume have left here on the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.550
 sides we do not have any more 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:10.709
 button the off attack button on top and 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.970
 the volume went back here up go down 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.820
 lg doing school, right? 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.350
 here on the device he already comes with 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:23.500
 android 5.0 lollipop installed as 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.540

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.730
 3 megapixel 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.480
 This has already been said and even 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.830
 previously and finally it's legal to show 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.500
 Also here 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.200
 it comes with the function calls in motion 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.019
 Can you draw a letter on the screen? 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.519
 it goes straight to the shortcut linked to 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:48.340
 this letter for example if I make a w 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.129
 it will go directly to the web 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.319
 this is modifiable user can choose 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.910
 What he wants to marry in each area. 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.160
 they tried are standard that will not 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.330
 move there to the dark letters 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.069
 your way 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.080

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.540
 with design will tell you if you liked it more or 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.430
