00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
down the road so if you get really

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.710

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
river

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.490 
river
and<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.330> think<00:02:18.390> that's<00:02:18.690> actually<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.170> very

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and I think that's actually a very

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.710 
and I think that's actually a very
positive<00:02:19.980> thing<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.940> that's<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.239> John<00:02:24.450> same

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
positive thing so that's the John same

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.900 
positive thing so that's the John same
speech<00:02:25.019> Studio<00:02:25.410> kuru<00:02:26.480> kuru<00:02:31.010> good<00:02:32.010> relax<00:02:32.459> and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
speech Studio kuru kuru good relax and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.880 
speech Studio kuru kuru good relax and
then<00:02:33.120> there's<00:02:33.330> one<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.319> same-size

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
then there's one of the same-size

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.490 
then there's one of the same-size
underneath<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.390> that's<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.780> Robert<00:02:37.080> Cohan

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
