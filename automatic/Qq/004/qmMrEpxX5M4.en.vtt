00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.290 
such smaller sizes because they won't
last<00:03:17.660> more<00:03:18.020> than<00:03:18.080> two<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:18.950> three<00:03:19.190> times<00:03:22.300> the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
last more than two to three times the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.210 
last more than two to three times the
only<00:03:23.720> thing<00:03:23.930> I<00:03:24.050> can<00:03:24.260> agree<00:03:24.530> with<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:25.040> the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
only thing I can agree with is the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.920 
only thing I can agree with is the
perfume<00:03:25.670> because<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.300> don't<00:03:26.480> need<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.690> bigger

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
perfume because you don't need a bigger

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.000 
perfume because you don't need a bigger
sample<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.800> know<00:03:28.670> this<00:03:28.880> metal<00:03:29.270> so<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.830> is

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
sample to know this metal so this is

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.860 
sample to know this metal so this is
more<00:03:31.220> than<00:03:31.250> enough<00:03:31.490> but<00:03:31.970> other<00:03:32.210> products<00:03:32.660> I'm

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
more than enough but other products I'm

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.800 
more than enough but other products I'm
not<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:33.440> sure<00:03:33.910> such<00:03:34.910> small<00:03:35.270> samples<00:03:35.840> will

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
not so sure such small samples will

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:46.030 
not so sure such small samples will
really<00:03:38.810> help<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.260> but<00:03:41.080> still<00:03:42.820> check<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:43.910> out
