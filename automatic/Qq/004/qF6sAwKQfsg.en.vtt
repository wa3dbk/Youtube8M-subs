and<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:40.140> also<00:00:40.350> think<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.710> there's<00:00:41.010> various

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and I also think that there's various

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.540 
and I also think that there's various

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
a girl gamer a girl gamer is just a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.060 
a girl gamer a girl gamer is just a
gamer<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> vagina<00:01:09.590> but<00:01:10.590> then<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
gamer with a vagina but then you have to
wonder<00:01:11.340> why<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:13.049> big<00:01:13.200> deal

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
wonder why this is a really big deal

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
wonder why this is a really big deal
right<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:13.710> why<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.520> controversy<00:01:15.360> why

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
right now why is it a controversy why

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
right now why is it a controversy why
are<00:01:15.780> people<00:01:16.080> still<00:01:16.380> talking<00:01:16.979> about<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
are people still talking about it and I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.969 
are people still talking about it and I
think<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.060> stems<00:01:18.299> from<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.720> fact<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
think it stems from the fact that the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.770 
think it stems from the fact that the
video<00:01:20.250> game<00:01:20.549> industry<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:21.270> always<00:01:21.570> been

women were kind of excluded from it so
it<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> seems<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.640> sing

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
it just kind of seems like a for sing

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.459 
it just kind of seems like a for sing
and<00:01:58.340> they're<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.729> there<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:00.810> seems

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and they're in there for it just seems

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.010 
and they're in there for it just seems
surprising<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> woman<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.210> legitimately

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
surprising when a woman is legitimately

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.550 
surprising when a woman is legitimately
in<00:02:04.380> video<00:02:04.950> games<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.810> think<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> problem<00:02:07.110> also

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
in video games I think the problem also

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.889 
in video games I think the problem also
stems<00:02:08.099> from<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.789> fact<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.330> there<00:02:09.569> are<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.690> lot

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
stems from the fact that there are a lot

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.910 
stems from the fact that there are a lot
of<00:02:09.950> misconceptions<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.190> what

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
of misconceptions on what

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.240 
of misconceptions on what
we've<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.610> be<00:02:12.760> gamers<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.380> female<00:02:14.920> who

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
we've to be gamers you have a female who

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.880 
we've to be gamers you have a female who
plays<00:02:16.000> call<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.420> duty<00:02:16.870> with<00:02:17.170> her<00:02:17.440> brother<00:02:17.739> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
plays call of duty with her brother and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.640 
plays call of duty with her brother and
that's<00:02:18.190> like<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.670> big<00:02:19.420> game<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.349> everyone

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
that's like a big game and like everyone

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.740 
that's like a big game and like everyone
talks<00:02:21.099> about<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:21.880> if<00:02:21.940> she<00:02:22.000> assumed<00:02:22.510> that

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
talks about it so if she assumed that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.699 
talks about it so if she assumed that
she<00:02:22.989> is<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.319> gamer<00:02:23.709> because<00:02:24.340> she<00:02:24.910> plays<00:02:25.330> a

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
she is a gamer because she plays a

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.190 
she is a gamer because she plays a
mainstream<00:02:26.709> video<00:02:27.099> game<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.930> not

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
mainstream video game and it's not

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.170 
mainstream video game and it's not
necessarily<00:02:29.380> her<00:02:30.340> fault<00:02:31.680> but<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.850> know<00:02:33.970> when

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
necessarily her fault but you know when

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.240 
necessarily her fault but you know when
she<00:02:34.390> talks<00:02:34.720> about<00:02:34.930> how<00:02:35.260> big<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.680> game<00:02:35.890> or<00:02:36.100> she

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
she talks about how big the game or she

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.710 
she talks about how big the game or she
is<00:02:36.370> because<00:02:36.700> she<00:02:36.850> plays<00:02:37.120> all<00:02:37.330> these<00:02:37.480> games

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
is because she plays all these games

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.949 
is because she plays all these games
with<00:02:37.989> her<00:02:38.140> brother<00:02:39.239> then<00:02:40.239> she<00:02:40.510> gets<00:02:40.690> mocked

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
with her brother then she gets mocked

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.070 
with her brother then she gets mocked
for<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:42.760> think<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.030> problem<00:02:43.239> also<00:02:43.630> stands

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
for and I think the problem also stands

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.740 
for and I think the problem also stands
