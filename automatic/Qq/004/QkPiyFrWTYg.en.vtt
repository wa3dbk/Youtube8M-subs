00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.570
 I want to show you one of the finished ones 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.830
 albums this girl ordered her 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.860
 girlfriend cover soft on sintepon 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.630
 us on the grommets on the rings cover for 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:25.020
 decorated in american style in 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.579
 album size is 20 by 20 bookends i'm not 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.320
 decorated in this case see 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.939
 pasted here just ready such 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.969
 pocket from here where you can put 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.530
 some memorable stuff brought from 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:42.420
 travel seagulls tickets I'll tell you 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.809
 and pockets here they are the first 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 page this is a turn in such a gray 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.659
 blue scale 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.339
 And what do I want to draw your attention to, I 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.949
 try to use or the same 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.960
 paper for the substrate and somehow 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.879
 the thing is that the papers are in common 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.579
 Here's an example here I see this 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.390
 white paper with inscriptions and here it is 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.909
 is presented 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.220
 and whether the same applies to the elements 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.470
 That is because it is the blue arrow and blue 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.950
 blue airplane typewriter blue 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.930
 the sticker also you look here there 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.980
 book for 5 photos also learn 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.980
 make such books 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.400
 In this case, it holds 5 photo 9 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.050
 at 12 but if the customer he sent 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.940
 a smaller photo ie their 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.180
 accordingly you can shift more 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.890
 more will distinguish this size here such too 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.630
 gray-blue number after all 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.050
 printed identical photos 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.160
 style instagram to look beautiful 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.720
 and the photo composition in it is more 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.310
 such a bright turn and I try on 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.990
 each of their turns do 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.490
 such are journaling cards for 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.950
 records so people can record it 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.750
 memorable moment from traveling or here 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.520
 use these stickers here too 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.190
 You can write down the date of arrival 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.970
 Departures basis fly by plane 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.930
 journey 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.940
 I leave some pages without 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.440
 substrates i.e. it allows the client 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.660
 for example post pictures of such 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.170
 size as he wants here for example 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:11.080
 one photo is placed 9 by 13 if 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.810
 I live well, that's how my client again 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.310
 words small pictures you can 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.410
 place a few pieces in this one 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.680
 the case simply did not have photographs 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.320
 suitable here for this page 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.550
 so the client herself now stick 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:32.320
 post some of your photos here 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.370
 such a turn your live little book well and 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.860
 last page and bookend in thin 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.440
 who was at the beginning of the album if you 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.630
 liked my idea I will be glad if you 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.510
 do with me this travel album 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.510
