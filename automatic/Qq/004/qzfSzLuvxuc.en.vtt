underneath
the<00:01:25.320> girl<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.040> spin<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.350> guys

comes in one more time ending with hands
straight<00:01:31.829> across<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.810> that's<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.079> spinner

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
straight across so that's the spinner

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
straight across so that's the spinner
room<00:01:34.590> next<00:01:35.430> we're<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> slide

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
room next we're going to have the slide

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.330 
room next we're going to have the slide
this<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.780> good<00:01:36.990> move<00:01:37.229> when<00:01:37.860> your<00:01:38.009> hands<00:01:38.280> are

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
this is a good move when your hands are

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.130 
this is a good move when your hands are
straight<00:01:38.579> across<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> want<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> start<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
straight across and you want to start a

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.120 
straight across and you want to start a
move<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.979> crossed<00:01:41.610> hands<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.740> start<00:01:44.009> in

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
move with crossed hands so you start in

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.270 
move with crossed hands so you start in
the<00:01:44.220> basic<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.990> as<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.350> step<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.890> basic

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the basic and as you step for the basic

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.789 
the basic and as you step for the basic
let's<00:01:47.490> do<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.729> real<00:01:47.939> time<00:01:48.149> first<00:01:51.590> that's<00:01:52.590> all

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
let's do in real time first that's all

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.780 
let's do in real time first that's all
it<00:01:52.950> is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.870 
it is
so<00:01:54.540> let's<00:01:54.870> slow<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.230> down<00:01:55.410> so<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.460> you're<00:01:56.490> going

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so let's slow it down so if you're going

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.790 
so let's slow it down so if you're going
to<00:01:56.970> when<00:01:57.510> you're<00:01:57.630> stepping<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:58.440> your<00:01:58.620> right

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
to when you're stepping with your right

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.830 
to when you're stepping with your right
foot<00:01:58.830> like<00:01:59.550> you're<00:01:59.580> doing<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.030> basic<00:02:00.240> you're

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
foot like you're doing a basic you're

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.480 
foot like you're doing a basic you're
going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> basically<00:02:01.380> raise<00:02:01.740> your<00:02:01.980> arms<00:02:02.310> up

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
going to basically raise your arms up

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.270 
going to basically raise your arms up
and<00:02:02.730> your<00:02:03.570> forearms<00:02:04.260> are<00:02:04.440> going<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:04.800> run<00:02:04.980> into

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and your forearms are going to run into

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.670 
and your forearms are going to run into
each<00:02:05.310> other<00:02:05.490> before<00:02:05.970> our<00:02:06.450> fifth<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.530> you're

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
each other before our fifth then you're

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.490 
each other before our fifth then you're
going<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.040> basically<00:02:08.190> let<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.570> slide<00:02:10.110> away

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
going to basically let go and slide away

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.390 
going to basically let go and slide away
from<00:02:10.830> each<00:02:10.950> other

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
from each other

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.030 
from each other
catching<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.060> hand<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.290> now<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.770> should<00:02:13.920> be

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
catching that hand so now it should be

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.310 
catching that hand so now it should be
the<00:02:14.160> guy's<00:02:14.340> right<00:02:14.700> hand<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.870> girls<00:02:16.110> right

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
the guy's right hand and the girls right

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.490 
the guy's right hand and the girls right
hand<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.970> again<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.510> real-time<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.110> looks<00:02:19.350> like

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
hand so again in real-time it looks like

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.690 
hand so again in real-time it looks like
this<00:02:22.880> okay<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.450> next<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.230> tornado<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.670> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
this okay the next is the tornado so a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.960 
this okay the next is the tornado so a
lot<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:26.970> times<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.600> done<00:02:27.630> with<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> slide

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
lot of times this is done with the slide

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.310 
lot of times this is done with the slide
so<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.120> real<00:02:30.300> time<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.020> look<00:02:31.140> like

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
so in real time it's going to look like

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.880 
so in real time it's going to look like
this

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.140 

so<00:02:37.890> let's<00:02:38.100> slow<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.460> down<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.910> we're<00:02:39.030> going

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
so let's slow that down so we're going

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.480 
so let's slow that down so we're going
to<00:02:39.210> start<00:02:39.540> off<00:02:39.720> with<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.080> slide<00:02:40.380> slipping<00:02:41.340> on

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
to start off with the slide slipping on

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.400 
to start off with the slide slipping on
the<00:02:41.580> red<00:02:41.730> foot<00:02:41.990> sliding<00:02:42.990> away

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
the red foot sliding away

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.370 
the red foot sliding away
now<00:02:44.190> when<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.700> guy<00:02:44.850> has<00:02:45.180> his<00:02:45.450> right<00:02:45.810> hand<00:02:46.170> and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
now when the guy has his right hand and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.960 
now when the guy has his right hand and
the<00:02:46.500> girls<00:02:46.709> writing<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.760> really

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the girls writing it this is a really

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.150 
the girls writing it this is a really
good<00:02:48.270> move<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.930> use<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.530> switch<00:02:49.740> from<00:02:49.920> two

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
good move to use to switch from two

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.080 
good move to use to switch from two
hands<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.640> one<00:02:51.140> we're<00:02:52.140> going<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.880> spin<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
hands to one we're going to spin the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.830 
hands to one we're going to spin the
girl<00:02:55.130> counterclockwise<00:02:56.130> I'm<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.510> hand

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
girl counterclockwise I'm going to hand

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.740 
girl counterclockwise I'm going to hand
off<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.980> girl's<00:02:59.250> hand<00:02:59.550> from<00:03:00.120> my<00:03:00.300> right<00:03:00.510> hand

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
off the girl's hand from my right hand

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.930 
off the girl's hand from my right hand
to<00:03:00.989> my<00:03:01.020> left<00:03:01.410> hand<00:03:01.709> right<00:03:01.890> there<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.670> I'm

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
to my left hand right there and I'm

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.580 
to my left hand right there and I'm
going<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.239> spin<00:03:03.540> her<00:03:03.630> one<00:03:03.870> more<00:03:04.080> time<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
going to spin her one more time in the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.940 
going to spin her one more time in the
same<00:03:04.739> direction<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:06.470> then<00:03:07.470> we're<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.890> to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
same direction and then we're going to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.000 
same direction and then we're going to
join<00:03:08.250> hands<00:03:08.610> should<00:03:09.239> be<00:03:09.269> straight<00:03:09.660> across

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
join hands should be straight across

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.790 
join hands should be straight across
that<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> tornado<00:03:12.080> one<00:03:13.080> more<00:03:13.260> time<00:03:13.470> in

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
that is the tornado one more time in

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.890 
that is the tornado one more time in
real<00:03:14.130> time

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.140 

tada<00:03:22.140> Thanks
