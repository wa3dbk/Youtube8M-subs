00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.410
 hey what happens here here what v3 this 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.059
 new good video in this video you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.680
 I bring the new champions and raised a 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.049
 video recently about two images that 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.850
 they left and well they have already made it 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.910
 quite more here is that he lives in 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.970
 screen you have the explain that it's going to be 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.530
 it is worth to be already his the sword without equal honor 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.260
 that all the skill has been revealed 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.060
 in the game all good 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.880
 then left the description as always 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.910
 I'm not going to read the cartoon 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.080
 I am very heavy good of the skill of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.489
 also vital image and I put it here so 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.930
 with each small explanation but of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.629
 all ways with using in the small in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.629
 the pp I will explain each one 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.720
 concretely we will not see how the champ and 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.780
 such but when I do the good pp 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.120
 I go to the passive is called the path of the soul 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.430
 wandering the steel storm sees it 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.500
 double wall of cutting wind and oak 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.700
 Mariano if he wants to see what he does but 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.920
 well in the game I'll put the pp 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.710
 good and now the style of play here 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.990
 we have an image where it already comes out 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.700
 the game with throwing the different 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.640
 skills 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.280
 for the last one I think to throw it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.630
 you have to combine it with another skill 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.039
 shoot the enemies through the air and I've 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.240
 read is a bit strange to take the 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.240
 power or skills 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 remember a little jing zhao italy there 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.649
 It has some pretty movements 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.899
 similar and well basically this is the 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.310
 champ say they will be my trainer but 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.230
 the truth is that because of what I read 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.720
 it seems much more law you do not have 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.470
 is a good initiator and such because he has a 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.030
 last very in good area explained the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.380
 last I think it's that I do not have it very 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.510
 sure you get nothing is too expensive 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.460
 but what do you have to load the qy 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.890
 when he throws an enemy into the air 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.040
 they throw the ere and then it keeps it more 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.830
 time on the air and those who are 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.820
 around he also threw them I imagine 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.170
 that when he says in the air he 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.020
 will refer a little to the can crash 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.900
 because it is that the champ has has a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.110
 little of the theme of the wind and such 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.910
 basic basically because it's called 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.130
 steel storm wind wall then 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.450
 I imagine it will be wind themed and 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.290
 good 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.920
 basically they say you 're wearing the mid 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.700
 and it is good and want to do video 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.110
 not too long I leave the story in 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.900
 the description for me to see it count 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.760
 a little bit that good basically what 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.680
 that we had the other story was the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.230
 He told his brother Jon that 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.450
 true is dead good basically what 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.950
 what he says is that there were had sworn 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.950
 protect an old man june 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.330
 they believed that I had killed had I been the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.060
 that will protect him had killed the one 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.220
 he had sworn to protect and his had killed 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.740
 who had played the case well 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.300
 that's not true good according to him is not 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.890
 truth is what it says there is something that is not 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.110
 true then they go for all one 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.880
 land that you know is a land the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.370
 continent where all things are 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.230
 with white flirted front 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.480
 the world the league of legends is a 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.319
 land you pay for an entire land for 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.440
 find the killer well this all 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.180
 What do we know about your personal opinion? 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.610
 I'm pretty well my trainer that is 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.709
 I'd probably ask for it although 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.540
 we'll see why there are also some 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.860
 discussions that I avoid around riot 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.860
 with people they were talking about 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.629
 also to do support and autoplay 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.750
 nerd also the skills can 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.900
 do it jungle so good basically 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.299
 already you know that for anything 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.040
 new that we know I will make a video or 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.280
 that is attentive to the channel but astro 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.280
