00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.670
 without big zig and jags and without 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.440
 sink any sauce cares 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.690
 but make it at the Russian city 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.590
 the brandenburg stain is right 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.300
 Rustic things and Berlin make for 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.430
 our shot of the camera beats 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.430
 sometimes not so much and warsaw 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:57.050

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.699
 We have the pigs in the cinema 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.339
 I've been so in about 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.989
 then cut the big pieces 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.129
 forward your advantage is the onion where you 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.010
 a little bit the shells like that 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.420
 make island off then we have 300 here 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.850
 gram bacon then 400 gram liver tip 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.200

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.360
 let's just go away then we have her 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.900
 fourth child sacrifice so high on this 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.440
 size and so five to six spriewald 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.450
 back because yes are brando and danilo 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.310
 spreewald cucumbers in and there we have 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.300
 another teaspoon of black pepper 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.530
 fresh fruit and a teaspoon of salt and 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.470
 Of course, how to grill 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.660
 sharp knife and a board the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.710
 bosom friend is really going on 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.970
 pepper and salt to it and now ready 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.800
 always right through that right 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.170
 maybe nice with those salt and 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.790
 Pepper connects and then we can 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.930
 also start to get stuck because that 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.350
 do not have to long single else 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.620
 loses the meat must do better 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.000
 you really stick with it when you 're stuck 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.190
 There are actually no rules important 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.110
 just that every few years somewhere like that 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.190
 long as it is evenly proportionate 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.120
 spit and comes through a sausage 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.180
 pack is a nice how bit 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.590
 this would be very tasty good now always 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.200
 then yes, it's unbelievable how 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.239
 grilled can taste so good until the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.840
 no pool here, the materials sting 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.250
 again new 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.180
 I hold it because again 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.180
 does not have to go down 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:34.250
 Here were group pieces prefer 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.379
 for those who like the place where we are 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.319
 piece onions practically as always 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.580
 continue until we have our entire stock 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.580
 would rather have rehearsed 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Breakfast are you should be friends 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.000
 her be and also fit well has been 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.170
 now it's right on the field he is 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.560
 at 250 degrees before I hit you 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.630
 So far east will after 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.430
 our fathers kind of simply flat-chested 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.950
 is so without a big magic 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.690
 indirect heat but really only 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.370
 heat from the outside easier heat from below 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.280
 and then we would be a monument now 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.400
 Quite an hour and twenty minutes from 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.170
 all sides burning for me by the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.239
 motto but by grill gasthof 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.380
 So there is always something for me 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.769
 a bit count to the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.810
 disposal has a nice thing and that 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.200
 I'm doing the imperial just right again 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.200
 services 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:53.450
 before that was the hope that I 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.450
 first a little peace 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.680
 three minutes are over 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.030
 These look the first animals to equip 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.290
 now to turn to the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.700
 because here again makes it so 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.909
 has double player and so wide tip 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.650
 because their flesh does not turn 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.380
 but everything stays the same as mine is 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.519
 to take the last little round game 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.970
 then of course it's not too good too 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.979
 But they really do that too 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.570
 20 minutes are around 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.910
 and you are not always kicking it 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.490
 my money the osc right shoe 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:38.070
 excellent and now suddenly stick 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:42.410
 have to cost 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.410
 be sure to try this organ 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.530

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.110

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.449
 bacon differed from our 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.449
 pork meat 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.910

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:56.130
