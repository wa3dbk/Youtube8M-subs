00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.049
 in the american space it is like that 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.429
 Frank with the no means I think 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.080
 an ex rapper tecracer used for 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.760
 his new videos i'll show you this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.050
 this is what they are here are 2 like 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.730
 You say you call like devices and he can 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.160
 So that's really crass exercises 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.250
 how baykal aesthetics guys did it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.109
 really really great exercises here 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.520
 Unfortunately I am not 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.040
 I honestly but I still have 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.680
 These devices brought to you simply 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.030
 let's show how extensive you are with that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.070
 can train a device 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.860
 that means it will be a video series of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.160
 different breast muscle up 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.200
 back muscle legs and stomach and we 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.020
 will be a little at the end again 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.329
 So you get five workout here 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.969
 different video purely we catch today 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.460
 with the breast on and I'll show you 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.289
 what can you do with it like 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.979
 your chest with this device at home 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.320
 can also train at the first 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.320
 Exercise here is the classic 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.540
 push it up a little bit harder 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.689
 means I can go down here 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.520
 as a whole thing on the ground does that 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.360
 means the stress is something 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.090
 difficult 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 but I can still another 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.490
 Incorporate difficulty ever 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.740
 I closer with the feet at the levels ag 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.750
 the easier it is here 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.490
 It's super easy and the further I go with it 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.909
 the feet go back the more 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.970
 A pushchair becomes more difficult 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.259
 you can of the difficulty 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.990
 also very clearly vary 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.960
 you can vary even further and that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.780
 is the simplest variation I have 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 to put it all together and here relatively 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 makes a pushchair close to the legs 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.060
 that is when I have difficulties 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 then with the classic push-up 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.090
 i here a possibility me a little bit 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.750
 to work purely in the whole 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.939
 the next most difficult variant is 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.739
 I have you together again here 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.230
 I can vary that from the broad one 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.540
 means the wider I go the more 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.040
 the harder it gets the closer 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.150
 I go the more I have that too 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.910
 Triceps in it 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.310
 that is the next difficult one 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.500
 position is I give in my feet 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.780
 back and now I can, for example 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.500
 lift the legs at the back 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.040
 that means I only go with one leg 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.780
 as a stabilizer in the exercise purely 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.290
 that, of course, also does something 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.750
 harder and i can do a variation 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.480
 make by being at the forward 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.849
 is a bit heavier then normal 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.670
 something lighter that means the further that 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.340
 leg away from the body is the more 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.370
 difficult the exercise is these are 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.440
 now you have different variations in the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.629
 stand with equalizer in stand 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.799
 but we can also tilt the whole thing 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:06.380
 which means I'm considering your way around 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.139
 and can here again the 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.170
 make classic push-ups 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:17.690
 important on the floor here is the 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:20.690
 butt should stay up there then can 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.030
 I complicate the whole thing a bit more 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.840
 I'll try it out 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.380
 goes down together goes back to 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.380
 Outside 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.269
 and so I can do something here as well 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.530
 the width varies 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.819
 that means you can already do a lot here 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.190
 different variations also get out 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.650
 Here it is so if I have a push-up 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.799
 I can make that difficult by myself 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.090
 the whole thing is done with a leg 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.630
 just harder or by doing that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.549
 one leg still forward doing that 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.010
 variations the whole thing a bit 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.410
 they make it all the more lively 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.000
 complicate and suitable for people 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.330
 I say a normal push-up 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.160
 not too easy anymore 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.350
 I'm bored you have here 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
 Of course, many more possibilities 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.620
 with it 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.370
 you look at maxwell you can do a lot 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.560
 vary 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.299
 the good thing is depending on 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.580
 level of difficulty with your own 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.590
 Body weight also very intense and 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.150
 Work hard when you say you are 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.100
 then you can not start much 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.470
 can you there the simple methods 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.910
 Take the one you saw at the beginning and each one 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.640
 harder it gets the farther 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.620
 That tried to move the body away 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.220
 then bring the difficulty to 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.380
 increase 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.690
 If you say you 're in the beginning then 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.790
 Training beginner you can do the bow 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.860
 Take it across and start easily 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.720
 and the further you progress 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.790
 the further you do a foot in front of the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.190
 the way the harder the body gets 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.140
 Exercise that is, all the exercises you do here 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.030
 are you doing with your own 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.150
 body weight so you save yourself 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:01.260
 so to speak, the gym the 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:06.420
 Last variation is where I am here 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:11.460
 put it all over and behind the ex conductor 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:15.470
 has up and now I can here 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.470
 again in the typical position purely 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:23.150
 Of course, the butt stays up 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.280
 and so i can the difficulty level 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.880
 also increase if i say i still want to 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.300
 I can get a bit more difficult too 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:36.620
 lift it up, and I, of course, 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.620
 a little more variation 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.610
 I hope you like this breast 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.280
 variation will follow in the next few days 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.470
 the second workout is about 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.510
 Back exercises I show you all 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.300
 possible variations you can here with 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.640
 this device can do if you karl 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.169
 stix market that is if you like that 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.150
 want to train rod now with your own 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.250
 body weight and you actually have 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.440
 nothing near then that's really 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.490
 a good opportunity 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.110
 So see you in the next video 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.060
 again give me the thumb and yard for 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.860
 the video i'm looking forward to it good 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.860
 your flavio simonetti
