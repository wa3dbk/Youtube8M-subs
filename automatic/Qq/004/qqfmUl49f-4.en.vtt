foreleg<00:00:01.140> walking<00:00:01.620> robot<00:00:01.949> development<00:00:02.490> part<00:00:02.700> 1

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:02.959 
foreleg walking robot development part 1

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:05.180 
foreleg walking robot development part 1
we've<00:00:03.959> got<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.259> idea<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.589> I'd<00:00:04.859> like<00:00:05.040> to

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
we've got the idea that I'd like to

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.120 
we've got the idea that I'd like to
build<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.700> full-sized<00:00:06.270> mechanical<00:00:07.080> bull<00:00:07.890> horse

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
build a full-sized mechanical bull horse

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.190 
build a full-sized mechanical bull horse
and<00:00:08.429> also<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:09.000> mechanical<00:00:09.660> mountain<00:00:09.990> lion

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and also a mechanical mountain lion

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.919 
and also a mechanical mountain lion
full-sized<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.210> first<00:00:12.450> step<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.900> that

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
full-sized and the first step in that

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.250 
full-sized and the first step in that
process<00:00:13.080> will<00:00:13.710> be<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.070> get<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.570> working<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:16.230> a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
process will be to get a working for a

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.590 
process will be to get a working for a
leg<00:00:16.529> walking<00:00:17.220> machine<00:00:17.520> that's<00:00:17.789> fast<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.390> good

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
leg walking machine that's fast and good

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.750 
leg walking machine that's fast and good
for<00:00:18.869> all<00:00:18.990> sorts<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.380> terrain<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.490> I've<00:00:20.609> got

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
for all sorts of terrain so I've got

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.990 
for all sorts of terrain so I've got
this<00:00:20.880> design<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> drew<00:00:21.779> here<00:00:22.640> for<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> rear

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
this design that I drew here for a rear

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.589 
this design that I drew here for a rear
leg<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.019> 2d<00:00:25.439> physics<00:00:25.890> simulator<00:00:26.599> called

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
leg in a 2d physics simulator called

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.939 
leg in a 2d physics simulator called
I'll<00:00:27.869> go<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.230> I'll<00:00:28.410> put<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> link<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
I'll go do I'll put a link in the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.650 
I'll go do I'll put a link in the
description<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.699> want<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> try<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.179> it's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
description if you want to try that it's

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.600 
description if you want to try that it's
free<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> got<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> mechanism<00:00:35.160> working

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
free and so I got that mechanism working

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
free and so I got that mechanism working
ok<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> drawing<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.590> built<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
ok in the drawing then I built a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.190 
ok in the drawing then I built a
connects<00:00:38.219> model<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> decided<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.110> I

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
connects model and I decided that I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.100 
connects model and I decided that I
really<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.800> rear<00:00:41.070> leg<00:00:41.280> design<00:00:42.110> this

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
really like this rear leg design this

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.130 
really like this rear leg design this
wasn't<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.530> first<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.190> designed<00:00:44.579> but

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
wasn't the first one that I designed but

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
wasn't the first one that I designed but
that<00:00:46.140> was<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.680> had<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.629> and

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that was the one that had to go with and

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.410 
that was the one that had to go with and
since<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.530> liked<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.420> 3d

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
since I really liked that one I 3d

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900 
since I really liked that one I 3d
printing<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.219> it's<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> first

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
printing it it's going to be the first

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.660 
printing it it's going to be the first
part<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> small<00:00:54.809> model<00:00:55.430> that<00:00:56.430> will<00:00:56.520> put

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
part for a small model that will put

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.600 
part for a small model that will put
together<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:58.050> walking<00:00:58.440> mechanism

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.649 

you

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.039 

here's<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.619> first<00:01:09.189> completed<00:01:09.939> leg<00:01:10.180> actually

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
here's the first completed leg actually

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.240 
here's the first completed leg actually
it's<00:01:11.170> not<00:01:11.320> click<00:01:11.950> all<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.310> way<00:01:12.549> completed<00:01:13.119> but

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it's not click all the way completed but

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.100 
it's not click all the way completed but
you<00:01:15.250> can<00:01:15.399> see<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.700> mechanism<00:01:16.240> here<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:22.689> rests

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
you can see the mechanism here it rests

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
you can see the mechanism here it rests
on<00:01:23.320> two<00:01:23.710> axles<00:01:24.329> at<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.509> hip<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.710> it's

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
on two axles at the hip and it's

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.870 
on two axles at the hip and it's
controlled<00:01:27.549> by<00:01:27.700> one<00:01:28.149> cam<00:01:28.890> wheel<00:01:29.890> which<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.490> can

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
controlled by one cam wheel which is can

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.789 
controlled by one cam wheel which is can
your<00:01:31.569> teeth<00:01:31.810> around<00:01:32.079> the<00:01:32.140> edge<00:01:32.289> so<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.560> can<00:01:32.679> be

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
your teeth around the edge so it can be

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.460 
your teeth around the edge so it can be
easily<00:01:32.950> driven<00:01:33.460> by<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.640> motor<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:35.170> gear

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
easily driven by a motor that gear

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.960 
easily driven by a motor that gear
that's<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:36.039> thing<00:01:36.310> gear<00:01:36.520> that's<00:01:36.700> on<00:01:36.789> top<00:01:36.909> of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
that's the thing gear that's on top of

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.179 
that's the thing gear that's on top of
it<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.299> to<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.569> spacer<00:01:38.049> it's<00:01:38.590> not<00:01:38.829> actually

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
it is to the spacer it's not actually

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.779 
it is to the spacer it's not actually
needs<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.490> be<00:01:39.579> a<00:01:39.640> gear<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:41.229> spacer<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.640> is

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
needs to be a gear just a spacer this is

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.690 
needs to be a gear just a spacer this is
the<00:01:45.909> main<00:01:46.149> part<00:01:46.390> of<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.599> leg<00:01:46.810> obviously<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
the main part of the leg obviously the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
lower leg pivots a little bit as you

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.529 
lower leg pivots a little bit as you
move<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.750> up<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.020> down<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:07.119> not<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
move it up and down that's not the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.419 
move it up and down that's not the
unique<00:02:07.780> mechanism<00:02:08.019> that<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.560> came<00:02:08.739> up<00:02:08.860> with<00:02:08.920> I'd

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
unique mechanism that I came up with I'd

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.080 
unique mechanism that I came up with I'd
seen<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.729> leg<00:02:10.000> design<00:02:10.179> like<00:02:10.569> that<00:02:10.780> but<00:02:12.090> they

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
seen a leg design like that but they

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.759 
seen a leg design like that but they
came<00:02:13.299> up<00:02:13.480> with<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.750> way<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.140> driving<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.680> with

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
came up with this way of driving it with

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.039 
came up with this way of driving it with
a<00:02:14.829> wheel<00:02:15.100> by<00:02:15.700> having<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.090> slot<00:02:16.420> up<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.810> back

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
a wheel by having a slot up the back

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.509 
a wheel by having a slot up the back
that<00:02:17.890> connects<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.880> lower<00:02:19.180> leg<00:02:19.450> and

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
that connects to the lower leg and

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.680 
that connects to the lower leg and
drives<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.670> whole<00:02:21.819> mechanism<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.510> with<00:02:22.660> a

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
drives the whole mechanism just with a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:46.349 
drives the whole mechanism just with a
wheel

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.789 

pretty<00:02:47.359> happy<00:02:47.599> with<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.989> way<00:02:48.019> that<00:02:48.319> came<00:02:48.620> out

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
pretty happy with the way that came out

00:02:48.799 --> 00:03:01.420 
pretty happy with the way that came out
seems<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.879> be<00:02:49.969> working<00:02:50.329> good

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.250 

I'm<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.610> going<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.820> graph<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.660> movement

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
I'm just going to graph the movement

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.000 
I'm just going to graph the movement
pattern<00:03:04.710> of<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.430> foot<00:03:06.200> by<00:03:07.200> taping<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.620> sharpie

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
pattern of the foot by taping a sharpie

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:31.440 
pattern of the foot by taping a sharpie
to<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.250> end<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.460> it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.910 

you<00:03:32.450> can<00:03:32.569> see<00:03:32.720> it's<00:03:32.870> very<00:03:32.959> similar<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.650> the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
you can see it's very similar to the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.820 
you can see it's very similar to the
movement<00:03:34.310> pattern<00:03:34.640> of<00:03:34.849> the<00:03:35.300> model<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.680> the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
movement pattern of the model in the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.369 
movement pattern of the model in the
computer

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.380 

and<00:03:41.560> I'd<00:03:42.010> also<00:03:42.189> done<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.579> earlier<00:03:42.790> using<00:03:43.299> a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
and I'd also done this earlier using a

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.959 
and I'd also done this earlier using a
smaller<00:03:43.749> cam<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.409> was<00:03:44.499> driving<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.010> leg<00:03:45.129> and

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:45.969 
smaller cam that was driving the leg and

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.699 
smaller cam that was driving the leg and
you<00:03:46.120> can<00:03:46.269> see<00:03:46.450> how<00:03:46.629> it<00:03:46.780> makes<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.139> much<00:03:47.290> smaller

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
you can see how it makes a much smaller

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.259 
you can see how it makes a much smaller
step<00:03:48.249> so<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.150> think<00:03:49.269> on<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.599> final<00:03:49.900> version<00:03:51.269> the

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
step so I think on the final version the

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.259 
step so I think on the final version the
length<00:03:53.170> from<00:03:53.499> the<00:03:53.620> center<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:54.189> the<00:03:54.340> wheel<00:03:55.209> to

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
length from the center of the wheel to

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.929 
length from the center of the wheel to
the<00:03:55.780> point<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.920> cam<00:03:57.129> that's<00:03:57.400> driving<00:03:57.849> the

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
the point of the cam that's driving the

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.759 
the point of the cam that's driving the
leg<00:03:58.120> should<00:03:58.420> be<00:03:58.480> variable<00:03:59.079> so<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.319> can<00:03:59.469> adjust

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
leg should be variable so you can adjust

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:12.420 
leg should be variable so you can adjust
the<00:03:59.920> step<00:04:00.159> size

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.309 

and<00:04:12.909> that<00:04:13.030> dotted<00:04:13.209> line<00:04:13.360> represents<00:04:13.720> where

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
and that dotted line represents where

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.890 
and that dotted line represents where
the<00:04:14.349> ground<00:04:14.680> might<00:04:15.250> be<00:04:15.430> this<00:04:16.419> is<00:04:16.600> another

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
the ground might be this is another

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.670 
the ground might be this is another
mechanism<00:04:18.540> for<00:04:19.540> a<00:04:19.600> leg<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:20.229> would<00:04:20.410> be<00:04:20.530> like<00:04:20.620> a

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
mechanism for a leg this would be like a

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.010 
mechanism for a leg this would be like a
front<00:04:21.010> leg<00:04:21.190> it's<00:04:21.430> based<00:04:21.699> closely<00:04:22.150> on<00:04:22.449> Terry

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
front leg it's based closely on Terry

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.700 
front leg it's based closely on Terry
Anson's<00:04:23.500> leg<00:04:24.430> mechanism<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:29.350> one's<00:04:29.530> good

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
Anson's leg mechanism that one's good

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.820 
Anson's leg mechanism that one's good
because<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.940> makes<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.270> very<00:04:31.479> smooth<00:04:32.020> like

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
because it makes a very smooth like

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.340 
because it makes a very smooth like
movement<00:04:33.130> along<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.729> ground<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:35.020> can<00:04:35.050> see

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
movement along the ground you can see

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.420 
movement along the ground you can see
the<00:04:35.500> dotted<00:04:35.680> line<00:04:35.949> that<00:04:35.979> was<00:04:36.220> on<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.400> ground

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
the dotted line that was on the ground

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.090 
the dotted line that was on the ground
moved<00:04:36.910> very<00:04:37.660> going<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:38.560> straight<00:04:38.860> horizontal

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
moved very going to straight horizontal

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:53.560 
moved very going to straight horizontal
line

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.930 

and<00:04:53.750> this<00:04:54.230> was<00:04:54.380> actually<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.830> first<00:04:55.070> leg<00:04:55.730> that

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
and this was actually the first leg that

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.780 
and this was actually the first leg that
I<00:04:56.000> came<00:04:56.120> up<00:04:56.270> with<00:04:56.420> recently<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.610> thought<00:04:58.610> this

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
I came up with recently I thought this

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.130 
I came up with recently I thought this
was<00:04:58.940> going<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.120> be<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.270> rear<00:04:59.540> leg<00:04:59.720> when<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.020> was

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
was going to be a rear leg when I was

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.810 
was going to be a rear leg when I was
designing<00:05:00.260> it<00:05:00.680> but<00:05:00.890> now<00:05:01.190> I<00:05:01.220> think<00:05:01.400> it<00:05:01.610> would<00:05:01.670> be

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
designing it but now I think it would be

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.760 
designing it but now I think it would be
better<00:05:01.970> for<00:05:02.090> a<00:05:02.360> biped<00:05:02.870> leg<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:03.440> use<00:05:03.590> that

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
better for a biped leg and use that

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.070 
better for a biped leg and use that
other<00:05:03.920> leg<00:05:04.190> for<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.430> rear<00:05:04.640> leg<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:05.810> one<00:05:05.930> that

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
other leg for the rear leg the one that

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.160 
other leg for the rear leg the one that
I<00:05:06.140> 3d<00:05:06.470> printed<00:05:07.750> reason<00:05:08.750> I<00:05:08.780> think<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.050> would

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
I 3d printed reason I think this would

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.950 
I 3d printed reason I think this would
be<00:05:09.200> good<00:05:09.410> for<00:05:09.560> a<00:05:09.620> biped<00:05:10.070> leg<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.490> because<00:05:10.960> as

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
be good for a biped leg is because as

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.220 
be good for a biped leg is because as
you<00:05:12.080> can<00:05:12.230> see<00:05:12.380> here<00:05:12.650> one<00:05:13.550> of<00:05:13.670> the<00:05:13.870> bones<00:05:14.870> at<00:05:15.140> the

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
you can see here one of the bones at the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.500 
you can see here one of the bones at the
top<00:05:15.410> controls<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.040> thigh<00:05:16.430> movement<00:05:16.970> this

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
top controls the thigh movement this

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.270 
top controls the thigh movement this
other<00:05:17.720> one<00:05:17.930> in<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.140> front<00:05:18.850> controls<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:20.240> foot

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
other one in the front controls the foot

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.710 
other one in the front controls the foot
angle<00:05:23.410> and<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:25.430> one<00:05:25.730> in<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:25.940> back<00:05:26.120> controls

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
angle and the one in the back controls

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.450 
angle and the one in the back controls
the<00:05:26.900> lower<00:05:27.080> leg<00:05:27.380> angle<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:27.980> all<00:05:28.070> these<00:05:28.220> can<00:05:28.400> be

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
the lower leg angle and all these can be

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.790 
the lower leg angle and all these can be
controlled<00:05:29.000> independently<00:05:29.930> from<00:05:30.410> each<00:05:30.590> other

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
controlled independently from each other

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.430 
controlled independently from each other
and<00:05:31.100> they're<00:05:31.910> controlled<00:05:32.360> up<00:05:32.630> at<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:33.020> hip<00:05:33.200> so

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
and they're controlled up at the hip so

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.820 
and they're controlled up at the hip so
you<00:05:33.650> could<00:05:33.890> have<00:05:34.070> any<00:05:35.110> motors<00:05:36.110> or<00:05:36.380> components

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
you could have any motors or components

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.670 
you could have any motors or components
like<00:05:37.010> that<00:05:37.220> up<00:05:37.630> inside<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.900> mechanism<00:05:39.050> and

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
like that up inside the mechanism and

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.920 
like that up inside the mechanism and
sticking<00:05:39.980> out<00:05:40.100> below<00:05:40.420> is<00:05:41.420> basically<00:05:41.810> just

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
sticking out below is basically just

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.710 
sticking out below is basically just
metal<00:05:42.560> rods<00:05:42.770> and<00:05:43.100> a<00:05:43.670> foot<00:05:43.940> or<00:05:44.210> something<00:05:46.720> so

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
metal rods and a foot or something so

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.560 
metal rods and a foot or something so
you<00:05:47.780> can<00:05:47.990> have<00:05:48.110> fine<00:05:48.410> control<00:05:48.920> of<00:05:49.220> each<00:05:49.730> part

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
you can have fine control of each part

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.370 
you can have fine control of each part
without<00:05:51.230> having<00:05:51.740> any<00:05:51.890> sensitive<00:05:52.490> pieces<00:05:53.380> and

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
without having any sensitive pieces and

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.980 
without having any sensitive pieces and
heavy<00:05:55.250> pieces<00:05:55.580> down<00:05:56.090> in<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:56.420> other<00:05:56.660> part<00:05:56.960> of

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
heavy pieces down in the other part of

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.820 
heavy pieces down in the other part of
the<00:05:57.110> leg<00:05:57.880> and<00:05:58.880> this<00:05:59.030> is<00:05:59.210> a<00:05:59.470> model<00:06:00.470> in<00:06:00.590> that<00:06:00.740> same

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
the leg and this is a model in that same

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.830 
the leg and this is a model in that same
thing<00:06:03.830> that<00:06:04.070> same<00:06:04.240> physics<00:06:05.240> simulator<00:06:05.450> I

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
thing that same physics simulator I

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:14.040 
thing that same physics simulator I
guess<00:06:06.640> it's<00:06:07.640> called<00:06:08.230> of<00:06:09.230> that<00:06:09.530> leg

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.020 

so<00:06:14.590> it'll<00:06:14.770> probably<00:06:14.800> be<00:06:15.160> kind<00:06:15.610> of<00:06:15.759> a<00:06:15.819> while

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
so it'll probably be kind of a while

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.439 
so it'll probably be kind of a while
before<00:06:16.840> this<00:06:17.199> project<00:06:18.060> really<00:06:19.060> gets<00:06:19.330> done<00:06:19.539> but

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
before this project really gets done but

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.240 
before this project really gets done but
anyway<00:06:22.449> I'll<00:06:22.629> keep<00:06:22.840> working<00:06:23.050> on<00:06:23.319> it<00:06:23.379> thank<00:06:24.190> you

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
anyway I'll keep working on it thank you

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.030 
anyway I'll keep working on it thank you
for<00:06:24.340> watching<00:06:24.819> bye
