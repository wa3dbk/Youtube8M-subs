fragile<00:01:11.750> something<00:01:12.409> here<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:14.060> let's<00:01:14.329> move<00:01:14.570> up

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
fragile something here so let's move up

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.690 
fragile something here so let's move up
with<00:01:14.990> our<00:01:15.140> remaining<00:01:15.500> works<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.159> place<00:01:16.460> them

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
with our remaining works and place them

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.539 
with our remaining works and place them
for<00:01:16.909> frontal<00:01:17.270> attack<00:01:17.920> we<00:01:18.920> will<00:01:18.950> stay<00:01:19.340> with<00:01:19.490> our

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
for frontal attack we will stay with our

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.429 
for frontal attack we will stay with our
tactic<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.119> have<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.270> short<00:01:20.659> chain<00:01:20.929> of<00:01:21.049> command

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
tactic to have a short chain of command

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.440 
tactic to have a short chain of command
although<00:01:22.039> you<00:01:22.100> could<00:01:22.429> combine<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.060> time<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
although you could combine and time the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.529 
although you could combine and time the
actions<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.929> course<00:01:24.670> but<00:01:25.670> right<00:01:25.880> now<00:01:25.939> it<00:01:26.390> is

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
actions of course but right now it is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.240 
actions of course but right now it is
easier<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.020> directly<00:01:27.619> engage<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.220> enemy

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
easier to directly engage the enemy

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.490 
easier to directly engage the enemy
because<00:01:28.850> our<00:01:29.030> mercs<00:01:29.390> are<00:01:29.569> already<00:01:29.929> stronger

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
because our mercs are already stronger

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.859 
because our mercs are already stronger

it first we have to move our mercs
closer<00:02:28.639> to<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> nearest<00:02:29.209> enemies<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.930> make

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
closer to the nearest enemies and make

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.440 
closer to the nearest enemies and make
sure<00:02:30.650> they<00:02:30.829> have<00:02:30.859> a<00:02:30.980> good<00:02:31.040> firing<00:02:31.639> range

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.370 

I<00:02:38.650> hear<00:02:39.650> you

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:03:01.289 

nails<00:02:43.070> out

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:10.420 

the<00:03:02.299> sound<00:03:02.569> bad<00:03:03.439> sound<00:03:04.930> OOP<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:08.319> understood<00:03:09.430> now

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
the sound bad sound OOP I understood now

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.940 
the sound bad sound OOP I understood now
hopefully<00:03:10.999> nails<00:03:11.540> has<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.959> right<00:03:12.139> range<00:03:12.469> to

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
hopefully nails has the right range to

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.559 
hopefully nails has the right range to
throw<00:03:13.189> a<00:03:13.219> grenade<00:03:13.430> at<00:03:13.639> the<00:03:13.849> two<00:03:14.030> enemies<00:03:14.389> in
