and then you start it and finally you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.710 
and then you start it and finally you
can<00:02:13.230> set<00:02:13.470> up<00:02:13.610> now<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> know<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.240> meant<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.600> a

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
the handbrake which is a little bit

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.990 
the handbrake which is a little bit
