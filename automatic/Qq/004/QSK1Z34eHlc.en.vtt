 Hello everyone and welcome to the relaxation area 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.150
 today she is given a little trick to parents over my parents 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.780
 so the children of a center aerated the business and coll we will say besides 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.619
 I discovered on the internet a very interesting site which by small 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.839
 labels that presents itself as sausages 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.630
 who are counted at college counts 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.590
 when you take them in hand they are just small labels in 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.380
 plastic that does not stick at all 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.660
 a group of workers affix the name the first name of the child as well as a small 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.300
 that a sign for when he can not yet read as philippe recognize 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.580
 his business 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.670
 and if the best time you can also they put 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.840
 a phone number 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 these labels are provided with a small sheet of parchment paper 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.219
 you will have to apply 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.020
 the label on the garment that you did not ask 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.879
 small sheet of parchment paper 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.949
 and you know what and everything 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.930
 with a very hot iron 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.220
 san martin 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.120
 we know it so 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.460
 here I am here so a vehicle on which I go to position 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 my teammate 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.770
 which is here 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.840
 on which I will put 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.990
 parchment paper 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.190
 I want everyone 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.190
 and geof 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.180
 once accepted 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.520
 I will flow 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.160
 very gently the parchment paper by what can happen that it stays stuck 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.310
 a little more 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.149
 and that's this effect now you have the name your child's first name in 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.190
 his clothes 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.700
 as well as the phone number before your phone number in 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.180
 your child's clothes can be very important 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.670
 because if you want a balloon cleared by someone else in France to metz 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.270
 and caen 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.260
 he would always have your phone number on him 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.700
 so anyone who finds it not support you must say that your 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.480
 child 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.860
 very easy to use and very practical these iron-on labels 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.780
 can also be applied by dads who will no longer have excused you 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.900
 can also put them on the back however pay attention to the garment 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.900
 which are a bit fragile and do not support the heat very well 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.999
 at the risk of having your label stuck to your iron 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.159
 I tell you very soon in the es16 expenses
