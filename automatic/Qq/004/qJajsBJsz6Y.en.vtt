00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.470
 management company 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.600

 greeting are very important to integrate 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.490
 and still crash while waiting for the rest of the team 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.159
 in the morning the role of the works supervisor is important because it is he who 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.159
 gives the instructions of the objectives of the day 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.239
 diverse origins of employees 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.239
 some jokes 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:35.719
 the meal is always a pleasant moment to spend with colleagues 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.059
 in a warm atmosphere just like the nap that follows frequently 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.419
 it's time to meet around a table in a canteen 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.659
 in an Alsatian inn to track regional specialties 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.919
 the restart is a bit difficult but it is also the role of the leader 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.919
 to motivate his team until the end of the day 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.719

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.899
 on arrival the debriefing takes place with the work supervisor in front of a 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.899
 coffee there too often in a relaxed atmosphere 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:51.510
 but it may be that peat changes to the query but it's not 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:52.339
 possible 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.609
 at least the tensions are transient and a compromise is found 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.309
 Ali and think his Christmas meal 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:04.139
 there are other extra like karting the bulimic smell of smoke or 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.439
