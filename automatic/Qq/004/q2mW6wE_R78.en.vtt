00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.819 
think most men if they do lose to a
woman<00:02:57.359> I<00:02:57.450> think<00:02:57.660> they<00:02:58.079> have<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> little<00:02:58.500> bit<00:02:58.709> of

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
woman I think they have a little bit of

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.349 
woman I think they have a little bit of
embarrassment<00:02:59.130> about<00:02:59.609> that<00:02:59.819> but<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.209> this

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
embarrassment about that but not this

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.199

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.240 
one you know she beats them it's
understandable<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.139> they<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.560> shot<00:03:04.889> against

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
understandable that they do shot against
