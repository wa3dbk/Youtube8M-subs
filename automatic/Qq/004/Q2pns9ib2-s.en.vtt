00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 at sports when I am always newer 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.640
 Muscular make you the following times 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.680
 scenario in front of you for three months 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.389
 on a lonely island and just smell 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.219
 to do a single exercise 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.389
 Of course, you want to be with this single one 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.670
 the maximum out of your body 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.379
 bring it out so that you can do it again afterwards 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.330
 Being in good shape could be as good as possible 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.410
 little of your form loses and exactly 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.080
 of course is the question at the point 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.760
 which exercise is angular in the training plan 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.869
 so the most important one can not report there 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.070
 Of course you argue one 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.810
 will say bank press because the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.369
 Muscles the main disco 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.380
 Muscles are the other will be his 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.700
 biceps cologne because that's still in the club 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.090
 more important is a thick biceps like that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.920
 tap 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.870
 but honestly I think that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.149
 most important exercise this is there 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.440
 Cross with the cross lifting that is me everyone 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.360
 confirm gave me both the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.399
 lower body participation as well 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.899
 upper body involvement and compared 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.610
 with the other basic exercises to 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.469
 Example with the bench press where it is 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.300
 good as no lower body as good as 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.910
 there is no participation and also participation 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.590
 the spots where it is as good as or only one 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.510
 very minimal upper body involvement 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.969
 The cross is easy 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.920
 different for both the legs and for 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.539
 the upper body is basically hull 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 Exercise what just the fuselage muscles 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.530
 strengthens but even beyond 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.880
 goes and even for the poor 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.880
 even if it is an isometric one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.290
 static load is quite 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 acceptable growth law is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.590
 if we just do it the whole way 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 Analyze the motion sequence I have 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.770
 Unfortunately, today only a jeanshose on and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.270
 therefore not much weight 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.310
 Take else can go my pants 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.750
 Stop it before it's over 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.090
 Of course, that when lifting 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.979
 both the two participation as well 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 The upper body involvement never 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.090
 seen completely independently of each other 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.460
 should be but ideally 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.659
 one attacks the other with I 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.640
 Show you the time in which I in the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.590
 squat and go back quite a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.790
 handle ready for me is pleasant 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.649
 Of course, I'm oriented to that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.079
 mark as you can see from 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.970
 The handle wide, I go in here 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.890
 a bit wider than the stand is in 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.630
 the stand is about hip-width or in 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.579
 about shoulder width hip width we enter 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.210
 a bit tighter and moves me now 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.579
 upright 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.770
 I prefer the trade according to the 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.240
 shone long from the moment I got in 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.219
 about the height happen 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.259
 I also realize clearly I am directing myself 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.689
 intuitively already on and about this 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.030
 in terms of percentage of what 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.590
 here I have the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.510
 corresponding participation 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.670
 the shoulder muscles of the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.410
 Back muscles and of course 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.140
 during the entire movement sequence is 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.489
 The most important thing is the arm muscles 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.500
 that at the cross, we understand that 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.849
 the upper body participation of the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.290
 lower body participation so the 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.720
 leg work and upper body work 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.430
 never independent of each other 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.930
 It should be considered 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.970
 of course so that first of all 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.680
 grasp power makes you limp that means that 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.299
 against the hands on there are the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.879
 possibility to choose the cross handle 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.709
 So to grab that you once the 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.970
 and once attacked 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.769
 Of course that's a good one 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.989
 possibility to be easy on natural 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.329
 way to get out a bit more but 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.200
 I advise you anyway put this 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.910
 to help 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.319
 I help you to use this fabric 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.329
 you like to talk about this video 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.040
 again my train help I like 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.299
 do not take them at the first one 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.769
 sentence and then from the third or 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.400
 fourth set if the hands are easy 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.799
 rise up 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.660
 he bridges the concept of strength and strengthens 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.879
 At the same time, that's exactly what it is 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.230
 So do not trick it where use 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.459
 I just a hook and then the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.170
 grip force no longer involved 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.819
 So you have no hand involvement 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.950
 had more but the hand forces 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.170
 Strengthen the fingers Strengthen the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.370
 but overall action muscles strengthen 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.840
 support anyway 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.639
 That's a wonderful possibility 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.079
 just then at the cross-raise over 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.859
 maybe the fourth fifth sentence 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.060
 to get more out of it 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.459
 or even in this area 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.130
 the one currently due to the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.420
 hand power not yet to stand that 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.760
 The lower back is the legs 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.109
 could be more but the hands are the 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.489
 The first ones are tired because of that 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.260
 important evolves you are there 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.299
 never try this one 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.190
 Exercises just at this exercise that 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.989
 maximum to get out of it and you 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.669
 will see with the cross on the 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.230
 lonely island after three months have 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.239
 you kept a lot of its shape 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.579
 because both the legs and the 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.019
 upper body is very intense demand 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.849
 each one of a formal heavy project 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.410
 It will make you realize how he feels about himself 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.579
 Next day leads and I think so 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.959
 feeling just awesome 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.090
 All right, see you next 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.090
 Many greetings from your simon
