00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
night I think I would would determine a

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.070 
night I think I would would determine a
lot<00:03:03.910> about<00:03:04.030> where<00:03:04.270> we'd<00:03:04.450> be<00:03:04.480> ranked<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.050> I

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
lot about where we'd be ranked and I

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.440 
lot about where we'd be ranked and I
think<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.440> way<00:03:05.790> alabama<00:03:06.790> played<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.270> game

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
think the way alabama played that game

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.180 
think the way alabama played that game
and<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:08.110> way<00:03:08.140> they<00:03:08.410> were<00:03:08.470> able<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.740> win<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.070> by

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
and the way they were able to win it by

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.470 
and the way they were able to win it by
pretty<00:03:09.430> good<00:03:09.610> margin<00:03:09.760> i<00:03:10.000> thought<00:03:10.210> we'd<00:03:10.330> be

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
pretty good margin i thought we'd be

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.960
