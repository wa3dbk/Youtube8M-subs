00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.759
 in belly tv we have had the opportunity to analyze the new model 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.719
 of the radeon hd 3850 graphics card one of the most attractive cards and 

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.109
 powerful of the moment in relation quality-price with an approximate cost 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.139
 that are around 160 euros on average depending on the model and the amount of 

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:33.139
 memory that includes 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.550
 specifically the model analyzed the radeon hd 3850 from the pin jaguar manufacturer 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.510
 equipped with a memory of 512 megabytes that for three years but also 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.320
 can be acquired with 256 megabytes of memory being a card that counts 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.940
 with a graphic chip manufactured by a 55-nanometer process that offers 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.479
 Support to know how to move four points 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.250
 which is compatible with the new direct and 15 pointed one that microsoft 

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:10.249
 added in the windows service pack 1 view 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.410
 the management of the card works a frequency of 668 megahertz and the 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.430
 memory one with 6 gigahertz also allows the connection of two monitors 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.560
 simultaneous 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.780
 Integra jaguar support for high video decoding 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.350
 definition what allows us to play videos and blu-ray movies 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.350
 with a lower load for our processor 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.539
 likewise the cooling of the card is excellent at the same time that very silent 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.499
 and of course as in the whole 3800 range 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.469
 you can connect up to four cards in series through the technology that 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:49.690
 we will go from here 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.009
 always clear 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.009
 that our motherboard allows it 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.360
 Once the card is connected to our team, it is time to make our 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.060
 first tests in the 3d mark 0 6 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.849
 which were made in a week and I owe the 64-bit cor 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.639
 and they gave us a score above 7,300 points much higher than 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.569
 the score obtained by a much lower low end as is the 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.249
 radeon x 1600 pro which of the same pc only got thousand 700 points also in 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:35.700
 All the sizes of the 3850 series did not fall below the 25 prizes 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.700
 second 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.949
 for its part of a computer with a much faster processor and intel 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:54.999
 pentium dual core the score of the radeon hd 3850 on the third of March 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:59.729
 reaching surprising figures that were around more than 9 thousand 100 points 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.280
 and how not to release it cards nothing better than to put it also to test with 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.939
 the video game craigslist one of the most demanding titles in the market 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.099
 where we could verify the true technical potential of it 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.559
 being able to play the game with total fluency 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.689
 even after putting all the requirements of the video configuration 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.369
 practically to the maximum 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.369
 an authentic dream come true for any garden 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:48.129
 In conclusion, it is a very competitive graphic card at the same time as 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.479
 quickly economic of the currently available range 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.809
 medium-high here 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:58.409
 being a very good alternative to which his great rival the 8800 series gtt 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.229
 envy 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:03.119
 Positioning today among the most recommended for the user 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.590
 thanks mainly to its low consumption and noise level as well as its great 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.650
 performance guaranteeing us to be able to play all the current titles more 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.530
 pointers with the highest possible graphic quality
