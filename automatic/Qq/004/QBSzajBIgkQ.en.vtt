00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.430
 hyland riptide available for 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.440
 Playstation3 Xbox 360 and PC in 2011 a 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.630
 shuddering trailer captivated millions 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.670
 of people around the world it 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.770
 it was nothing more nor less than the trailer 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.570
 debut of dead island a game that we 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.910
 placed again in the middle of a 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.939
 zombie apocalypse of which hardly 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.919
 we could escape after so shocking 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.560
 start both the specialized press 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.300
 like the fans of video games 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.550
 they would place their expectations very high 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.770
 the vast majority had the illusion 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.110
 that this title became a 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.329
 deep and even emotional experience 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.719
 as very few of the genre had achieved 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.489
 Offer the release date 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.530
 finally it came disillusioning over 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.960
 a conforming player experienced what 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.219
 that really offered the project back 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.600
 there was hope of having 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.699
 implemented a plot that 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.859
 will truly captivate us because the 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.750
 story was not too much of a sight 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.059
 in countless horror films of 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.640
 low budget however the mixture 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.040
 of rpg aspects with low sunsets 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 and first person shooter was enough 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.119
 to win the predilection of several 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.579
 the second chapter shows that the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.950
 survivors of the paradisiac island of 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.720
 vanoy should still fear for their lives the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.970
 carrier on which they landed after 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.979
 be rescued has been reached by the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.140
 tragedy as crew members 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.049
 they have suddenly started to develop 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.360
 in bloodthirsty zombies 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.789
 a furious storm turns them into 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.490
 little less than shipwrecked but now in 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.860
 the peculiar honeycomb island there is what 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
 protagonists did not expect is that this 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.209
 region has been infected by the strange 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.799
 pandemic from vanoy question 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.869
 that will make them act again in 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.240
 set to survive because of evil 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.920
 climate that plagues the region great amount 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.649
 of the environment is flooded and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.780
 devastated by forcing them to explore good 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.670
 part of the surroundings using 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.630
 boots or boats that are at 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.459
 hand 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.409
 this situation changes the way in which 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.630
 that we progress in the game with respect 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.549
 to its predecessor increasing the feeling 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.769
 of suspense and forcing us to create 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.420
 specific strategies to travel 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.610
 the channels that flow through the ground 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.010
 It is usually very dangerous to do it 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.750
 quickly since we produce too much 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.560
 noise warning towards enemies 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.330
 close 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.520
 who can attack us suddenly 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.800
 from the depths and even 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.020
 some new creatures are capable of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.480
 dump our boat trying to avoid 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.280
 our escape the same four 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.920
 major survivors of the first 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.540
 version star riptide only that in 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.209
 this time a new one has been added 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.130
 character named john morgan john is 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.170
 specialist in hand-to-hand combat 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.530
 so his attacks at close range 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.930
 they are devastating their strength is such that of 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.540
 a single kick is able to throw by 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.610
 the air to almost any zombie is not 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.380
 for being spoilsport but we think that 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.030
 his skills break a bit the 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.250
 balance of the game by placing him 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.069
 noticeably about the rest of the rest 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.870
 individuals a great detail on the part of 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.549
 deep silver is the possibility of 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.830
 import our character from the 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.630
 first version with just select 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.489
 this option at the beginning we take the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.500
 control of our previous protagonist 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.510
 with the same level and skills with the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.549
 that we finished earlier for 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.709
 some this might seem worrisome 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.569
 because in theory it would be too easy 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.820
 go through the initial hours of play 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.850
 fortunately it is not so serious since it is 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.460
 compensated with enemies more 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.570
 awaiting our arrival 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.670
 unfortunately again the scale of the 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.890
 project has played against it 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.870
 several box and programming problems 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.090
 they show up once we play 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.560
 detail or we walk the stage here 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.300
 we observe failures that range from 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.640
 characters that go through objects 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.200
 supposedly solid up weapons or 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.140
 accessories impossible to recover 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.020
 because they fell mysteriously in 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.000
 an almost inaccessible area is 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.770
 true that the errors are not so serious 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.690
 like those of the previous delivery not 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.250
 However, they continue to show that the idea 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.380
 main game would have been executed 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.360
 in better way in hardware the 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.830
 next generation visually the 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.050
 game looks better than the launch 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.330
 initial despite this we still do not 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.790
 inconsistencies in textures and elements 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.100
 that integrate the environment as before 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.230
 best way to enjoy the apocalyptic 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.540
 day is in the company of others 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.030
 players in this aspect we notice a 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.070
 clear improvement with less problems for 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.350
 find a group to play with 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.630
 and without so many momentary disconnections 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.640
 the 'on line' service analyze in time 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.740
 real the status of each participant 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.820
 to balance the difficulty so 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.220
 we can join 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.200
 departure of our friends no matter 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.260
 how advanced their progress 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.270
 riptide main campaign is better at 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.640
 many aspects to the original just that 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.560
 this will surely not be enough for 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.750
 redeem it in the eyes of those who do not 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.790
 they enjoyed dyland the gameplay 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.920
 offered by this saga is not easy 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.930
 please all public except once 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.110
 all the errors that are taken into account are taken into account 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.270
 sprout spontaneously notwithstanding 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.520
 fans of titles like borderlands of 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.620
 all blacks 3 will probably enjoy 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.480
 what we find in this sequel to 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.610
 same way we recommend it widely 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.590
 for those who like to share 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.690
 experiences with friends or strangers 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.640
 forming their own anecdotes of 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.640
 survival to the cta with be zombie
