at<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> decent<00:02:25.300> size<00:02:25.660> look<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.230> going<00:02:26.350> to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
at a decent size look like it's going to

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.160 
at a decent size look like it's going to
be<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> medium-sized<00:02:27.310> map<00:02:28.150> instead<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.990> like<00:02:29.140> a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
be a medium-sized map instead of like a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.050 
be a medium-sized map instead of like a
large<00:02:29.590> conquest<00:02:30.340> maps<00:02:30.610> they're<00:02:30.850> gonna<00:02:30.940> be

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
probably like conquest small look at

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.870 
probably like conquest small look at
we're<00:02:33.910> going<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.090> be<00:02:34.240> battling<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.460> our<00:02:36.460> urban

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.199 
this game but one thing i was thinking
also<00:03:20.100> true<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.400> game<00:03:21.610> isn't<00:03:21.850> gonna<00:03:22.030> be

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
also true that this game isn't gonna be

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.320 
also true that this game isn't gonna be
large<00:03:22.480> as<00:03:22.890> battlefield<00:03:23.890> 4<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.790> probably<00:03:25.209> gonna

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
large as battlefield 4 it probably gonna

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.540 
large as battlefield 4 it probably gonna
be<00:03:25.570> like<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.050> bad<00:03:26.410> company<00:03:26.950> game<00:03:27.160> because<00:03:27.340> bad

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
be like a bad company game because bad

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.400 
be like a bad company game because bad
company<00:03:27.910> was<00:03:28.060> like<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.300> real<00:03:28.600> large<00:03:28.840> game<00:03:29.170> it

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
company was like a real large game it

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.680 
company was like a real large game it
didn't<00:03:29.860> really<00:03:30.010> have<00:03:30.280> big<00:03:30.610> maps<00:03:30.880> besides<00:03:31.540> I'm

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
didn't really have big maps besides I'm

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.690 
didn't really have big maps besides I'm
the<00:03:31.780> DLC<00:03:32.260> maps<00:03:32.500> they<00:03:32.680> really<00:03:32.980> some<00:03:33.190> really

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
the DLC maps they really some really

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.460 
the DLC maps they really some really
huge<00:03:33.970> maps<00:03:34.360> on<00:03:35.190> with<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> DLC<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:38.170> didn't

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
huge maps on with a DLC and it didn't

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.870 
huge maps on with a DLC and it didn't
make<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.890> didn't<00:03:39.130> really<00:03:39.310> care<00:03:39.459> for<00:03:39.670> those

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
make it I didn't really care for those

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.270 
make it I didn't really care for those
big<00:03:40.090> mess<00:03:40.300> I<00:03:40.450> just<00:03:40.630> like<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.019> vanilla<00:03:41.590> maps<00:03:41.890> it

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
big mess I just like the vanilla maps it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.640 
big mess I just like the vanilla maps it
was<00:03:42.430> at<00:03:42.550> a<00:03:42.580> good<00:03:42.850> size<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:44.080> so<00:03:44.200> I<00:03:44.230> think<00:03:44.350> the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
was at a good size and so I think the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.100 
was at a good size and so I think the
map<00:03:44.890> size<00:03:45.160> is<00:03:45.370> gonna<00:03:45.550> be<00:03:45.760> about<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.390> from<00:03:46.900> Bad

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
map size is gonna be about that from Bad

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.680 
map size is gonna be about that from Bad
Company<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.640> hope<00:03:48.940> they<00:03:49.090> pull<00:03:49.330> off<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
Company and I hope they pull off the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.199 
Company and I hope they pull off the
police<00:03:50.049> team<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.799> see<00:03:51.459> a<00:03:51.489> lot<00:03:51.640> of<00:03:51.790> people
