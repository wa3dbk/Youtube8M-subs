and lower blade on your hedge clipper so

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.729 
and lower blade on your hedge clipper so
they're<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.489> line<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.969> each<00:00:51.000> other<00:00:51.739> we're

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
they're in line with each other we're

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.410 
they're in line with each other we're
dealing<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.219> sharp<00:00:53.609> blades<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.300> I'm

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
dealing with a sharp blades because I'm

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.639

going to go ahead and put on some good
gloves<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.640> protect<00:00:57.000> my<00:00:57.120> hands<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.750> align

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
gloves to protect my hands as we align

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.060 
gloves to protect my hands as we align
these<00:00:58.199> blades<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> sharpening<00:00:59.550> I

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
these blades and do the sharpening I

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.500 
these blades and do the sharpening I
found<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> easiest<00:01:02.550> way<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> align<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
found the easiest way to align the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.100 
found the easiest way to align the
blades<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:05.460> start<00:01:05.729> by<00:01:05.880> hand<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.960> I'll

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
blades is to start by hand and I'll

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.889 
blades is to start by hand and I'll
simply<00:01:07.590> press<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.550> two<00:01:08.759> blades<00:01:09.030> together<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
simply press the two blades together and

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.840 
simply press the two blades together and
I<00:01:10.440> can<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.770> them<00:01:10.860> pretty<00:01:11.130> close<00:01:11.429> to<00:01:11.640> being

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I can get them pretty close to being

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.449 
I can get them pretty close to being
right<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.240> alignment<00:01:12.690> that<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:13.160> to<00:01:14.160> get<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:14.459 
right in alignment that way to get that

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:17.449 
right in alignment that way to get that
fine<00:01:14.910> a<00:01:14.940> little<00:01:15.179> bit<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.539> alignment<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.649> I<00:01:17.250> take

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:17.459 
fine a little bit of alignment if I take

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:19.880 
fine a little bit of alignment if I take
in<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.940> handle<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.390> an<00:01:18.509> old<00:01:18.630> screwdriver<00:01:19.020> put

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
in the handle of an old screwdriver put

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.359 
in the handle of an old screwdriver put
it<00:01:19.979> between<00:01:20.099> the<00:01:20.459> blades<00:01:20.789> and<00:01:21.090> uses<00:01:21.569> a<00:01:21.599> pry<00:01:21.990> bar

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
it between the blades and uses a pry bar

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.770 
it between the blades and uses a pry bar
the<00:01:23.369> handle<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.910> screwdriver<00:01:24.149> will<00:01:24.599> keep

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the handle on the screwdriver will keep

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.410 
the handle on the screwdriver will keep
me<00:01:24.899> from<00:01:25.020> damaging<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.649> blades<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.420> they'll

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
me from damaging the blades and they'll

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.059 
me from damaging the blades and they'll
move<00:01:27.599> the<00:01:27.660> blade<00:01:28.050> just<00:01:28.410> that<00:01:28.590> fine<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> little

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
move the blade just that fine a little

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.839 
move the blade just that fine a little
bit<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> distance<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:30.690> align<00:01:30.959> them<00:01:31.140> perfectly

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.059 

with<00:01:35.849> the<00:01:35.970> blades<00:01:36.270> aligned<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.709> see<00:01:37.950> on

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
with the blades aligned you can see on

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.400 
with the blades aligned you can see on
each<00:01:38.220> blade<00:01:38.780> there's<00:01:39.780> three<00:01:40.259> different

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
each blade there's three different

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.880 
each blade there's three different
surfaces<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.459> need<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> sharpen<00:01:41.970> here<00:01:42.890> here

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
surfaces we need to sharpen here here

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.570 
surfaces we need to sharpen here here
and<00:01:44.390> here<00:01:45.440> because<00:01:46.440> it's<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.009> double<00:01:47.340> sided

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
and here because it's a double sided

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.130 
and here because it's a double sided
blade<00:01:48.770> we<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> same<00:01:50.429> surfaces<00:01:51.179> on<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
blade we have the same surfaces on the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.229 
blade we have the same surfaces on the
back<00:01:52.319> so<00:01:53.039> there's<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.280> total<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.700> six<00:01:53.759> surfaces

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:54.239 
back so there's a total of six surfaces

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.949 
back so there's a total of six surfaces
that<00:01:54.690> need<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.959> sharpened<00:01:55.410> per<00:01:55.979> tooth

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
that need to be sharpened per tooth

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.150 
that need to be sharpened per tooth
we'll<00:01:57.959> start<00:01:58.229> by<00:01:58.379> showing<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.890> how<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
we'll start by showing you how to

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.600 
we'll start by showing you how to
sharpen<00:01:59.520> with<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.879> mill<00:02:00.239> file<00:02:01.099> to<00:02:02.099> use<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> mill

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
sharpen with a mill file to use the mill

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.800 
sharpen with a mill file to use the mill
file<00:02:02.910> I<00:02:03.179> simply<00:02:04.640> align<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.819> file<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.539> same

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
file I simply align the file at the same

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.779 
file I simply align the file at the same
angle<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.379> already<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.830> ground<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.340> tooth

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
angle as already is ground on that tooth

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.210 
angle as already is ground on that tooth
and<00:02:09.259> then<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.500> take<00:02:10.679> strokes<00:02:13.220> maintaining

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and then just take strokes maintaining

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.440 
and then just take strokes maintaining
that<00:02:14.370> angle<00:02:14.730> until<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.680> tooth<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.189> Charles

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
that angle until this tooth is Charles

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.309 
that angle until this tooth is Charles
once<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.629> get<00:02:19.810> one<00:02:19.840> surface<00:02:20.290> completed<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:22.319> can

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
once I get one surface completed I can

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:33.210 
once I get one surface completed I can
simply<00:02:23.829> move<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> next<00:02:24.519> surface<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:32.220> so

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
simply move to the next surface and so

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.420 
simply move to the next surface and so
on<00:02:33.400> all<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.819> way<00:02:33.849> around<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:35.920> will<00:02:36.159> turn

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
on all the way around then I will turn

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.860 
on all the way around then I will turn
the<00:02:37.180> head<00:02:37.390> clipper<00:02:37.780> over<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:39.420> do<00:02:40.420> those<00:02:40.569> same

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
the head clipper over and do those same

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:49.410 
the head clipper over and do those same
three<00:02:41.200> surfaces<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.239> backside<00:02:48.420> method

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
three surfaces on the backside method

protection<00:03:02.370> we're<00:03:03.370> going<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:03.730> begin<00:03:04.060> by

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
protection we're going to begin by

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.809 
protection we're going to begin by
clamping<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.349> bar<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.859> hedge<00:03:06.010> clipper<00:03:06.430> to

clamping the bar of the hedge clipper to
my<00:03:06.970> bank<00:03:07.439> just<00:03:08.439> so<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.650> doesn't<00:03:08.889> move<00:03:08.950> around

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
my bank just so it doesn't move around

my bank just so it doesn't move around
while<00:03:09.519> we're<00:03:09.700> grinding<00:03:12.930> okay<00:03:13.930> with<00:03:14.079> that

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
while we're grinding okay with that

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.759 
while we're grinding okay with that
secured<00:03:14.709> we<00:03:14.980> can<00:03:15.159> begin<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.430> grind<00:03:16.109> again<00:03:17.109> the

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
secured we can begin to grind again the

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.129 
secured we can begin to grind again the
same<00:03:18.040> surfaces<00:03:18.639> will<00:03:18.760> need<00:03:18.909> to<00:03:19.000> be<00:03:19.120> ground<00:03:19.389> but

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
same surfaces will need to be ground but

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.539 
same surfaces will need to be ground but
now<00:03:20.290> we're<00:03:20.470> going<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.620> use<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.769> grinder<00:03:21.189> instead

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
now we're going to use a grinder instead

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.229 
now we're going to use a grinder instead
of<00:03:21.639> a<00:03:21.700> file

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
of a file

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.000 
of a file
I<00:03:22.269> guess<00:03:22.959> need<00:03:23.139> to<00:03:23.199> be<00:03:23.319> careful<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.709> maintain

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
I guess need to be careful to maintain

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.780 
I guess need to be careful to maintain
that<00:03:24.459> same<00:03:24.790> angle<00:03:25.209> while<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:25.930> grind<00:03:26.379> and<00:03:26.790> again

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
that same angle while I grind and again

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.420 
that same angle while I grind and again
the<00:03:28.780> grinder<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.799> going<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.040> work<00:03:30.190> much<00:03:30.370> faster

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
the grinder is going to work much faster

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.699 
the grinder is going to work much faster
than<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.180> file<00:03:31.419> so<00:03:31.810> be<00:03:31.930> careful<00:03:32.290> not<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.560> take

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
than the file so be careful not to take

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:50.850 
than the file so be careful not to take
too<00:03:32.739> much<00:03:32.980> off<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.699> tooth

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.930 

when<00:03:51.820> justice<00:03:52.300> before<00:03:53.340> will<00:03:54.340> turn<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.760> bar

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
when justice before will turn the bar

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:03.410 
when justice before will turn the bar
over<00:03:58.440> and<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:01.150> can<00:04:01.330> grind<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.720> opposite<00:04:02.200> side

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
over and I can grind the opposite side

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.300 
over and I can grind the opposite side
