00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.610 
sure was diagnosed two years ago and she
possibly<00:00:36.340> about<00:00:36.970> three<00:00:37.210> months<00:00:37.360> ago<00:00:37.540> so<00:00:38.440> after

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
possibly about three months ago so after

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.729 
possibly about three months ago so after
that<00:00:38.890> I<00:00:39.100> I<00:00:39.840> decided<00:00:40.840> that<00:00:40.989> I<00:00:41.110> wanted<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.560> do

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.700 
that I I decided that I wanted to do
something<00:00:42.160> so<00:00:42.760> my<00:00:43.120> idea<00:00:43.239> is<00:00:43.540> about<00:00:44.020> stopping

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
something so my idea is about stopping

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.100 
something so my idea is about stopping
cyber<00:00:45.040> bullying<00:00:45.580> kids<00:00:45.820> on<00:00:46.090> internets<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:46.750> think

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
cyber bullying kids on internets I think

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.080 
cyber bullying kids on internets I think
that's<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.380> really<00:00:47.410> great<00:00:47.920> tissue<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.610> we

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
that's a really great tissue and we

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.700 
that's a really great tissue and we
really<00:00:49.480> need<00:00:49.630> to<00:00:49.780> solve<00:00:50.020> it<00:00:50.200> people<00:00:50.620> have

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
really need to solve it people have

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.590 
really need to solve it people have
focused<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.130> lot<00:00:51.310> on<00:00:51.370> giving<00:00:52.120> people<00:00:52.390> loans

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
focused a lot on giving people loans

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.480 
focused a lot on giving people loans
giving<00:00:53.050> loans<00:00:53.200> to<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.410> poor<00:00:53.710> that's<00:00:54.220> not<00:00:54.460> the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
giving loans to the poor that's not the

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.180 
giving loans to the poor that's not the
panacea<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:55.270> that<00:00:56.260> be<00:00:56.350> that<00:00:56.710> people<00:00:57.010> should

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
panacea that that be that people should

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.710 
panacea that that be that people should
be<00:00:57.280> looking<00:00:57.520> for<00:00:57.700> I<00:00:57.880> think<00:00:58.330> it<00:00:58.390> needs<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.630> be

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
be looking for I think it needs to be

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.200 
be looking for I think it needs to be
combined<00:00:59.110> with<00:00:59.230> good<00:00:59.620> saving<00:01:00.220> services<00:01:00.700> at

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
combined with good saving services at

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.910 
combined with good saving services at
the<00:01:01.300> part<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.720> world<00:01:01.900> that<00:01:02.080> I<00:01:02.110> come<00:01:02.470> from<00:01:02.710> a

the local markets and this bring forward
new<00:01:24.490> good<00:01:25.120> ideas<00:01:25.570> that<00:01:26.200> further<00:01:26.979> on<00:01:27.220> can

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
new good ideas that further on can

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.460 
new good ideas that further on can
empower<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.510> societies<00:01:29.080> for<00:01:29.320> better

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
empower the societies for better

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.640 
empower the societies for better
solution<00:01:29.979> for<00:01:30.130> itself<00:01:31.050> so<00:01:32.050> I<00:01:32.140> thought<00:01:32.409> of<00:01:32.560> a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
solution for itself so I thought of a

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.890 
solution for itself so I thought of a
platform<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:33.340> service<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.150> fight<00:01:34.390> for<00:01:34.720> the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
platform a service to fight for the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.830 
platform a service to fight for the
right<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:36.310> talk<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.550> lot<00:01:36.670> about<00:01:36.820> women<00:01:37.420> rights

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
right we talk a lot about women rights

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.289 
right we talk a lot about women rights
and<00:01:38.229> gender<00:01:38.440> equality<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.580> there<00:01:39.760> are<00:01:39.909> a<00:01:39.940> lot

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
and gender equality and there are a lot

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.960 
and gender equality and there are a lot
of<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:41.290> know<00:01:41.409> activities<00:01:41.799> going<00:01:42.370> on<00:01:42.670> with<00:01:42.940> a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
of you know activities going on with a

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.330 
of you know activities going on with a
lot<00:01:43.180> of<00:01:43.210> organization<00:01:43.960> involved<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.650> but

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
lot of organization involved in it but

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.430 
lot of organization involved in it but
the<00:01:45.460> problem<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.030> we<00:01:46.450> are<00:01:46.540> not<00:01:46.720> just<00:01:46.990> coming<00:01:47.350> up

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
the problem is we are not just coming up

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.530 
the problem is we are not just coming up
with<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.860> technological<00:01:48.640> solution<00:01:48.850> to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
with a technological solution to

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.080 
with a technological solution to
actually<00:01:50.140> make<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:51.040> clear<00:01:51.310> back<00:01:51.640> up<00:01:51.880> a

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
actually make a clear back up a

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.940 
actually make a clear back up a
technological<00:01:52.960> evidence<00:01:53.409> of<00:01:53.590> what<00:01:53.770> actually

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
technological evidence of what actually

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.340 
technological evidence of what actually
happening<00:01:54.610> for<00:01:55.210> example<00:01:55.659> you<00:01:55.810> can<00:01:55.960> press<00:01:56.170> on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
happening for example you can press on

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.440 
happening for example you can press on
your<00:01:56.590> hash<00:01:56.799> button<00:01:57.190> three<00:01:57.400> times<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.909> your

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
your hash button three times and your

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.270 
your hash button three times and your
location<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:59.080> detected<00:01:59.680> and<00:01:59.799> the<00:01:59.860> operator

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
location is detected and the operator

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.870 
location is detected and the operator
gets<00:02:00.610> your<00:02:00.790> location<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.299> all<00:02:01.540> you

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
gets your location and all you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.420 
gets your location and all you
so<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.630> think<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.500> women<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:04.009> the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
so I think the women of the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.130 
so I think the women of the
underdeveloped<00:02:04.880> part<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.630> world<00:02:05.840> just

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
underdeveloped part of the world just

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.499 
underdeveloped part of the world just
needs<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.500> come<00:02:06.680> out<00:02:06.829> of<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.159> box<00:02:07.369> for<00:02:08.209> which

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
needs to come out of the box for which

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.749 
needs to come out of the box for which
we<00:02:08.720> needed<00:02:09.020> clear<00:02:09.229> evidence<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:10.429> show<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
we needed clear evidence to show the

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.280 
we needed clear evidence to show the
rest<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.239> world<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.510> we<00:02:11.720> are<00:02:11.810> not<00:02:11.900> weak

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
rest of the world that we are not weak

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.470 
rest of the world that we are not weak
and<00:02:12.530> this<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:12.980> not<00:02:13.099> our<00:02:13.280> fault<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.030> are<00:02:14.120> just<00:02:14.330> a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
particular I think have an important

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.150 
particular I think have an important
role<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.690> play<00:02:23.930> in<00:02:24.260> making<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.950> world<00:02:25.099> a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
role to play in making the world a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.800 
role to play in making the world a
better<00:02:25.190> place<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.910> that's<00:02:26.180> because<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
better place and that's because the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.870 
better place and that's because the
network<00:02:26.989> itself<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:28.069> infrastructure<00:02:28.760> for

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
network itself is the infrastructure for

network itself is the infrastructure for
development<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.900> these<00:02:30.110> countries<00:02:30.640> well<00:02:31.640> we

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
development in these countries well we

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.759 
development in these countries well we
saw<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.300> people<00:02:32.959> living<00:02:33.319> in<00:02:33.410> developing

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
saw that people living in developing

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.309 
saw that people living in developing
countries<00:02:34.090> didn't<00:02:35.090> have<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.569> lot<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.840> money<00:02:36.140> and

countries didn't have a lot of money and

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.770 
countries didn't have a lot of money and
that's<00:02:36.500> not<00:02:36.680> anything<00:02:37.280> new<00:02:37.489> but<00:02:38.299> what<00:02:38.660> we

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
that's not anything new but what we

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.259 
that's not anything new but what we
realized<00:02:39.200> was<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.519> people<00:02:40.700> have<00:02:41.000> very

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
realized was that the people have very

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.539 
realized was that the people have very
little<00:02:41.480> money<00:02:41.750> also<00:02:42.200> have<00:02:42.470> very<00:02:42.709> few<00:02:43.010> ways<00:02:43.250> of

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
little money also have very few ways of

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.640 
little money also have very few ways of
saving<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.330> little<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.720> they<00:02:44.840> have<00:02:45.080> which

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
saving the little that they have which

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.650 
saving the little that they have which
makes<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.010> problem<00:02:46.220> even<00:02:46.489> worse<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:47.569> we

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
makes the problem even worse so we

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.360 
makes the problem even worse so we
decided<00:02:48.049> we<00:02:48.319> have<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.590> find<00:02:48.799> a<00:02:48.890> way<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.099> at

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
decided we have to find a way to at

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.670 
decided we have to find a way to at
least<00:02:49.519> help<00:02:49.970> them<00:02:50.299> ration<00:02:50.959> out<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.380> little

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
least help them ration out the little

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.030 
least help them ration out the little
that<00:02:51.830> they<00:02:51.980> make<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.239> created<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.750> mobile<00:02:54.079> as

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
that they make so we created a mobile as

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.370 
that they make so we created a mobile as
