00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello everyone with you fishing line and today we 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.649
 let's talk about fishing 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.679
 as you probably already know in our game 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.420
 there was a first major update 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.929
 not just four new territories 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.770
 but also the emergence of a new fish craft 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.410
 catching 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.660
 in order to start doing it 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.519
 interesting craft you will need in 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.550
 Basically, all as in real life it 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.650
 fishing rod and bait 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.260
 however now we he cooked us 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.390
 interesting gift is free 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.940
 the opportunity to practice fishing 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.360
 each player comes in the mail 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.030
 special fishing rod this street is valid 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.940
 30 minutes it is available to all players. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.629
 starting at level 20 it will be 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 take place 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.690
 up until April 10 a little later in this 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.760
 Iâ€™ll tell you about this video 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.489
 fishing rod you need to get with her 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.039
 Now I will tell you about fishing in general 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 beds back to where from 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.850
 principle and started again you 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.119
 you will need a fishing rod to make it 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.790
 will have to self using 4 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.790
 elements hook fishing line rod and reel 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.799
 and so early the process is considered quite 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.729
 laborious although it takes in principle not 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.830
 a lot of time 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.020
 fishing rod has a limited period 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.979
 actions that is it is impossible to craft a fishing pole 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.200
 and forget about her 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.630
 after a while just disappear 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.770
 naturally fishing rods are different and let's say 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.049
 so by your skill 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.329
 more advanced booths will serve 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.150
 longer and allows you to apply more 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.680
 advanced types of lures when fishing rod you 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.110
 already be ready to have to think 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 bait non-standard bait this 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.630
 term and which is common 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.299
 small fish 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.570
 but to catch a bigger fish you 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.369
 will need prikormka and of course 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.229
 lovely 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.260
 bait can be harvested by yourself when 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.490
 harvesting 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.310
 in particular cereals and again 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.760
 to get the fish you need 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.650
 about 25 seconds each throw 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.230
 fishing rods will spend one more 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.050
 worm and five work points so you 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.840
 You have to first stock up on bait 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.210
 maximum and secondly accumulate work points 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.100
 if you want probach a little longer but 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.260
 because the most interesting thing of course 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.290
 catch a hefty fish 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.470
 and to catch her we need a whole 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.630
 fishing ship to be equipped 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.760
 special equipment called 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.710
 echo sounder such a ship will have 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.200
 really fork to get 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.590
 the recipe for its construction in Mirage 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.960
 but then as always the construction materials a 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.120
 before this build up but in principle 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.190
 all that was done when building your 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.340
 harmonica soon on the channel 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.990
 There will be a detailed guide about fishing this 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.630
 still a review 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.370
 well now let's go back to fishing 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.920
 which is happening with us now 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.830
 bait screen does not need lune 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.070
 a 30 minutes rollback cast your 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.370
 and at sea and you can only get two 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.690
 things are either a green little chest with 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.630
 fishing trinkets 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.220
 or blue little chest then when opening 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.810
 these chests you can get 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.780
 certain rewards 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.820
 and don't forget to take the quest and mirage 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.160
 with these quests you can too 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.080
 get good prizes because you 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.870
 gets special fishing tokens 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.090
 when you open sudachkov she is the same tone you 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.580
 can buy either a special pet 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.530
 a bug or a special jewelry for 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.400
 fisherman who gives principle also 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.019
 simple stats 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.540
 and so you can get green 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.150
 chest either fish or stone 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.689
 wandering mineral lexer and fishing 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
 tokens 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.340
 but the blue chest is very interesting to 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.159
 Unfortunately, I only got with him 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.170

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.689
