and you're able to just see

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.750 
and you're able to just see
because<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.920> took<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.130> little<00:04:41.250> while<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.550> make

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
because it took a little while to make

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.970 
because it took a little while to make
this<00:04:41.940> work<00:04:42.810> all<00:04:43.080> right
