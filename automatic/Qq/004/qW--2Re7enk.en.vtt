00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:03.509
 there was a time when those who needed boards 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.050
 took an ax and a show to chop wood 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.420
 now it is enough to eat and on the nearest 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.829
 lumber warehouse 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.599
 if you are a skilled carpenter or just 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.049
 lovers do their own hands 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 next story 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.489
 the process begins with purple UAH 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.909
 turn them into building 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.909
 wood is not that hard 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.159
 First, the logs for 20 minutes immersed in water 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.749
 it removes the dirt where the boxes are distinguished 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:36.749
 to make it easier to take it off 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.280
 logs are passed through ankara where 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.940
 handheld car with six rotors 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.570
 knives removing caruso logs for 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 ten seconds 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.320
 not sharpened workshop 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 periodically inspect and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.120
 sharpen the blade drank who requested vojta 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.630
 measles-cleared logs 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.630
 if necessary zuber level 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.860
 two work at a sawmill 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.450
 production lines first over 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.300
 thick logs pass through five 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.310
 years beat and machine 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.310
 operator correcting with a laser 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.229
 the position of each note on before 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.290
 saw it 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.840
 and the average reception is usually obtained from 7 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 8 boards 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:24.659
 Further 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.090
 this is so thinner films arrive at 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.639
 another permutation 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.479
 which translates the board with each of 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.709
 the parties and then directs what 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.709
 left further 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.909
 boards received on the first 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.159
 production line saw and 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.279
 once again on the procurement of a certain 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:50.279
 size 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.269
 January Nasa second production 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.890
 lines come across yes on the machine equipped with 8 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.879
 adjustable circular saws 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.199
 who can divide them into boards 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.199
 at different sizes 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.439
 boards from both production 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.699
 lines falls on machines that 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.699
 align spark bright remove defects 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.769
 then sorting machine automatically 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.400
 distributing the boards across the drive in 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.400
 depending on size 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.180
 from each storage board gets into 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.379
 machine folding them readers who 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.379
 get into the oven to dry 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.050
 about how the sort is made and 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.050
 boards are sent to the lumber warehouse 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.159
 or to the store and do it yourself 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.009
 make sure they are marked 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.259
