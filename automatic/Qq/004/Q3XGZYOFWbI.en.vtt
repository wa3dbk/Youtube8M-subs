00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
now and I have the tach hooked up and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.709 
now and I have the tach hooked up and
it's<00:00:14.490> cold<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.030> cranked<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.450> so

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.710 
it's cold I just cranked it up so
temperature<00:00:16.560> gauge<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.770> still<00:00:17.100> showing<00:00:17.310> gold

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
temperature gauge is still showing gold

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.990 
temperature gauge is still showing gold
but<00:00:18.720> I've<00:00:18.869> put<00:00:19.140> about<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.680> thousand<00:00:20.460> miles<00:00:20.670> on

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
but I've put about a thousand miles on

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.720 
but I've put about a thousand miles on
it<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:22.080> been<00:00:22.170> doing<00:00:22.470> great<00:00:22.740> I'm<00:00:23.640> happy

I<00:00:25.970> mounted<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.199> pcs<00:00:28.199> controller<00:00:29.300> underneath

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
I mounted the pcs controller underneath

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
I mounted the pcs controller underneath
the<00:00:31.230> dash<00:00:31.439> here

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.970 

right<00:00:35.880> back<00:00:36.090> here

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.100 

it<00:00:39.399> fits<00:00:39.640> nicely<00:00:39.910> here<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:40.570> stays<00:00:40.809> out<00:00:40.989> of<00:00:41.020> the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
it fits nicely here and stays out of the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.460 
it fits nicely here and stays out of the
way<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.239> wires<00:00:43.420> are<00:00:43.780> tucked<00:00:43.960> up<00:00:44.230> and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
way all the wires are tucked up and

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.950 
way all the wires are tucked up and
can't<00:00:44.710> really<00:00:44.800> see<00:00:45.040> anything

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.760 

might<00:00:48.559> be<00:00:48.680> loud<00:00:48.829> I'm<00:00:49.040> actually<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:50.170> bit<00:00:51.170> running

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:24.480 

completed

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.109 

pressure<00:01:25.270> regulator<00:01:25.870> I<00:01:26.140> have<00:01:26.799> poured<00:01:27.580> I've

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
pressure regulator I have poured I've

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.200 
pressure regulator I have poured I've
got<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.390> factory<00:01:29.020> for<00:01:29.350> pump<00:01:29.619> running<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.210> or

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
got the factory for pump running it or

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.350 
got the factory for pump running it or
acting<00:01:31.690> as<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.840> lift<00:01:32.110> pump<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.119> decide<00:01:34.330> to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
acting as a lift pump and I decide to

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.670 
acting as a lift pump and I decide to
put<00:01:34.540> up<00:01:34.659> fuel<00:01:34.810> pressure<00:01:35.020> regulator<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.560> I've

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
put up fuel pressure regulator and I've

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.649 
put up fuel pressure regulator and I've
got<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:35.920> kick<00:01:36.070> down<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.340> 17<00:01:36.760> psi<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:37.240> mean<00:01:37.479> it'll

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
got to kick down to 17 psi I mean it'll

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.810 
got to kick down to 17 psi I mean it'll
go<00:01:37.780> it'll<00:01:38.020> go<00:01:38.229> all<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.440> way<00:01:38.500> up<00:01:38.619> to<00:01:38.800> 80<00:01:39.130> psi<00:01:39.369> Q

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
go it'll go all the way up to 80 psi Q

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.740 
go it'll go all the way up to 80 psi Q
one<00:01:39.940> or<00:01:40.060> two<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:41.700> anyways<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.909> factory<00:01:43.300> fuel

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
one or two so anyways the factory fuel

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.290 
one or two so anyways the factory fuel
pump<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.200> going<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.280> plenty<00:01:45.850> for<00:01:46.420> this<00:01:46.570> engine

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
pump is going to plenty for this engine

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.120 
pump is going to plenty for this engine
we've<00:01:49.300> seen<00:01:49.479> how<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.690> 7.3<00:01:50.530> call<00:01:50.770> for<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:50.979> lot

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
we've seen how the 7.3 call for a lot

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.240 
we've seen how the 7.3 call for a lot
more<00:01:51.340> fuel<00:01:51.580> but<00:01:51.990> anyways<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.560> stays<00:01:53.830> at<00:01:54.009> 20

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
more fuel but anyways so it stays at 20

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.690 
more fuel but anyways so it stays at 20
psi<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:55.330> engine<00:01:55.570> lights<00:01:55.750> on<00:01:55.960> just<00:01:56.170> because

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
psi the engine lights on just because

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.279 
psi the engine lights on just because
obviously<00:01:57.700> it's<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.270> different<00:01:58.300> engine<00:01:58.810> that's

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
obviously it's a different engine that's

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.830 
obviously it's a different engine that's
on<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.500> truck<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:01.030> throttle<00:02:01.390> pedal<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.720> all

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
on the truck the throttle pedal is all

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.660 
on the truck the throttle pedal is all
fly-by-wire<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:03.130> it's<00:02:03.640> working<00:02:03.850> properly

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.180 

got<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.420> ran<00:02:11.960> through<00:02:12.200> my<00:02:12.290> 5-inch<00:02:12.770> exhaust

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
got it ran through my 5-inch exhaust

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.830 
got it ran through my 5-inch exhaust
it's<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.670> straight<00:02:13.910> pipe<00:02:14.120> right<00:02:14.360> now<00:02:14.540> which

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
it's a straight pipe right now which

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.720 
it's a straight pipe right now which
kind<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.590> sucks<00:02:15.830> because<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.430> loud
