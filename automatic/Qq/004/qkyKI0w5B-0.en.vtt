basically<00:02:41.150> sulfate<00:02:41.600> free<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.020> they<00:02:42.230> don't

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
basically sulfate free so they don't

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.630 
basically sulfate free so they don't
have<00:02:42.470> harsh<00:02:42.650> chemicals<00:02:43.100> inside<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:43.610> i

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
have harsh chemicals inside it so i

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.320 
have harsh chemicals inside it so i
really<00:02:43.910> like<00:02:44.090> cover<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.840> x<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.140> lot<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.820> I'm

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330
