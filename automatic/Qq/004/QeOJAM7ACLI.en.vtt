00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
much better and take it out of here so

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.160 
much better and take it out of here so
here's<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.710> lens<00:01:32.240> it's<00:01:33.240> actually<00:01:33.720> pretty

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
here's the lens it's actually pretty

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.450 
here's the lens it's actually pretty
interesting<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.890> kind<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.430> from

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
interesting you can kind of see it from

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.060 
interesting you can kind of see it from
that<00:01:35.700> angle<00:01:35.880> there's<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.329> two<00:01:36.540> lenses<00:01:37.070> one

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that angle there's like two lenses one

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.190 
that angle there's like two lenses one
for<00:01:38.310> each<00:01:38.400> eye<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.720> separation

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
for each eye you can see the separation

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.450 
for each eye you can see the separation
right<00:01:40.500> there<00:01:42.649> it<00:01:43.649> doesn't<00:01:43.950> say<00:01:44.100> which<00:01:44.250> way

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
right there it doesn't say which way

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.060 
right there it doesn't say which way
this<00:01:44.640> goes<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.540> side<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.290> can<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.860> see

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
this goes one side you can actually see

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
this goes one side you can actually see
how<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.610> got<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> little<00:01:48.299> bit<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> lip

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
how it's like got a little bit of a lip

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.130 
how it's like got a little bit of a lip
the<00:01:49.110> other<00:01:49.229> side<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.619> completely<00:01:49.740> flat<00:01:51.140> I'm

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the other side is completely flat I'm

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
the other side is completely flat I'm
not<00:01:52.380> sure<00:01:52.560> what<00:01:52.770> side<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> put<00:01:53.310> down<00:01:53.490> there

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
not sure what side to put down there

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.370 
not sure what side to put down there
when<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> look<00:01:54.329> through<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:56.689> they<00:01:57.689> both<00:01:57.930> seem<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
when I look through it they both seem to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.370 
when I look through it they both seem to
be<00:01:59.899> to<00:02:00.899> work<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.259> same<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.640> put<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
be to work the same so I just put the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.380 
be to work the same so I just put the
decide<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> lip<00:02:04.890> facing<00:02:05.460> down<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
decide with the lip facing down so that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.719 
decide with the lip facing down so that
this<00:02:06.600> way<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> totally<00:02:07.950> smooth<00:02:08.250> surface

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
this way I have a totally smooth surface

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.699 
this way I have a totally smooth surface
that<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.119> wipe

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.550 
nasty and don't have to worry about crud
getting<00:02:14.420> stuck<00:02:14.689> in<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:14.989> lip

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
getting stuck in that lip

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.390 
getting stuck in that lip
so<00:02:17.079> anyways<00:02:18.079> on<00:02:18.409> these<00:02:18.590> helmets<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.220> have

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
so anyways on these helmets you have

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.300 
so anyways on these helmets you have
this<00:02:19.610> clip<00:02:20.030> right<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:20.769> you<00:02:21.769> can<00:02:21.950> see<00:02:22.189> it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
this clip right here you can see it

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.869 
this clip right here you can see it
which<00:02:22.970> holds<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.569> in<00:02:24.049> your<00:02:24.349> lens<00:02:24.560> not<00:02:25.519> this

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
which holds in in your lens not this

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.300 
which holds in in your lens not this
lens<00:02:26.180> but<00:02:26.420> holds<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:26.900> your<00:02:26.930> your<00:02:27.409> actual<00:02:27.620> lens

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
lens but holds in your your actual lens

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.199 
lens but holds in your your actual lens
for<00:02:28.579> your<00:02:28.670> helmet<00:02:28.970> your<00:02:29.120> your<00:02:32.680> automatic<00:02:33.680> lens

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
for your helmet your your automatic lens

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.039 
for your helmet your your automatic lens
darkening<00:02:35.209> lens<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:38.359> just<00:02:38.599> pushes

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
darkening lens so and it just pushes

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.750 
darkening lens so and it just pushes
down<00:02:39.379> and<00:02:39.650> clips<00:02:39.890> underneath<00:02:40.340> these<00:02:40.519> two

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
down and clips underneath these two

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.539 
down and clips underneath these two
clips<00:02:41.120> but<00:02:41.840> see<00:02:42.109> how<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.379> has<00:02:42.530> these<00:02:42.769> tabs<00:02:43.129> here

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
clips but see how it has these tabs here

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.349 
clips but see how it has these tabs here
here<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.030> here<00:02:44.299> I<00:02:45.760> figured<00:02:46.760> those<00:02:47.060> would<00:02:47.239> be

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
here and here I figured those would be

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.420 
here and here I figured those would be
perfect<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.930> hold<00:02:48.109> down<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.500> lens<00:02:48.799> with<00:02:49.400> a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
perfect to hold down this lens with a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.599 
perfect to hold down this lens with a
little<00:02:49.730> bit<00:02:49.879> of<00:02:50.000> extra<00:02:50.389> pressure<00:02:50.889> so<00:02:51.889> let<00:02:52.519> me

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
little bit of extra pressure so let me

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.599 
little bit of extra pressure so let me
put<00:02:52.819> that<00:02:52.849> in<00:02:53.180> there<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.450> show<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:53.629> how<00:02:53.900> that

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
put that in there and show you how that

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.479 
put that in there and show you how that
how<00:02:55.609> that<00:02:55.639> works<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.799> set<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.159> in<00:02:58.280> there

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
how that works so I just set it in there

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.390 
how that works so I just set it in there
like<00:02:58.670> that<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:02.470> I'm<00:03:03.470> gonna<00:03:03.590> try<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:03.829> Center<00:03:04.280> it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
like that and I'm gonna try to Center it

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.490 
like that and I'm gonna try to Center it
a<00:03:04.459> little<00:03:04.700> bit<00:03:08.590> grab<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.829> wire<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.609> clip<00:03:10.909> and
