00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.970
 composition here, what are you going to do? 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.150
 I'll take this composition and I'll put 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.430
 it inside another composition to 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.200
 I'll create a new one here. 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.930

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.240
 composition within another obviously 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.160
 when rendering I will render 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.230
 It is about what has the effect 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.180

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.630
 You have to put makeup inside. 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.490
 another composition for you will 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.970
 to save on the issue of organizing 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.930
 Law is good, well here's the cardio aip 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.660
 I take the law and forgiveness oprah the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.340
 object that has there for this perfect 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.090
 or the composition at home here in 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.550
 question 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.140
 and there is the following strong sun you give 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.830
 a little foot on which eggs and move forward 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.570
 Nice already gives you a really cool resource. 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.330
 a lot of ball show 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.300
 if so, you can configure 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.130
 example the transition up to 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.350
 transition, you can play a little 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.220
 more to mess around on the scene more 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.070
 you can determine how many lines and 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.810
 How many columns do you want, for example, I 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.440
 I want here, for example, lines 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.150
 I'm going to put 20 lines here 20 minutes ago 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.340
 20 lines ne 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.770
 in this case haiti now I want 20 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.730
 columns put here also 20 columns 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.500
 also in the full of objects and read 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.620
 exaggerated and I will put a little lower 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.910
 I'll put here maybe three 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:37.680
 here I am going to put a 50 already there is 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.960
 more summarized there is that you do not create 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.630
 this or the taste of his client in case he 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.640
 want a specific menu he thinks 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.910
 more beautiful love another option anyway 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.210
 Are you going to hit those here too? 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.130
 edit they are all animava weiss tem 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.830
 the opposition of camera for example here is 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.790
 the camera position looks nice to me 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.710
 Can I change the optimal ball imagine you? 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.750
 animate this camera 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.400
 there will be someone here an example I'll get 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.520
 back to 10 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.430
 the camera will not even retake that position 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:16.140
 When I got here, she's going to come back. 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:19.350
 for 0 o'clock there's already my cameras 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.150
 in lively or very cool very nice 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.220
 It's also a tip of this 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.790
 Shame you're out has other options. 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.740
 Camera also has z - camera on and 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.100
 good here and if you want to change here 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.980
 lighting but this card has a 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.910
 shorter lighting influence more 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.220
 clear 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.830
 Are you going to see beauty? 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.020

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.690
