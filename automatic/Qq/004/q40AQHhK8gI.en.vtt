00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.099
 good we're all here for 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.349
 present a new range of products from 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.300
 the company modelito racing after 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.160
 have started with ultimate racing that 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.259
 would be the part of supplements later 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.380
 we made nitro looks initially 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.760
 ultimate fuel and then the brand was made 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.890
 by circuit of tires that like 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.900
 you know three years ago we started with a 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.610
 great success this year in Argentina with the 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.040
 world championship achieved by 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.720
 robert dance and now well a little to 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.040
 do the entire product circle of 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.900
 competition radio control 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.550
 we have started a new project in the 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.260
 which we had always liked 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.629
 about company that the motors issue we 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.390
 has liked and is the ultimate brand in 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.949
 jeans this mark then good as well 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.559
 it says it's a brand of engines we have 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.829
 started in our category more 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.409
 specialized that this SUV 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.720
 and then we went to find a product 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.520
 as we would like to always have 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.380
 had when we were modelers 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.579
 for the manufacture of these engines 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.850
 we have used a brand like 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.649
 Navarre and of proven solvency and 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.640
 manufacturing quality I think it 's the 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.920
 main problem to the engines 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.360
 currently that is that an engine can 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.829
 work very well that of the official pilot 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.530
 but the important thing is the production 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.600
 after and here I really believe that what 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.850
 we have gotten that we said 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.770
 We are stories from Navarre if 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.119
 we have started from the engines that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.990
 we thought that the best 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.420
 for us the engine may 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.369
 I believe that the best at a stable level 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.220
 easy to carbure operation 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.390
 elasticity are the long run and by 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.010
 plus 4 and 5 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.350
 taking a little bit the best of each 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.390
 engine we have made two engines two 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.950
 engines that would be a 5 of transfers that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.700
 would be the ultimate engine m 5 tunnel and 18 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.789
 transfers ultimate m 8 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.979
 these two engines start from the base 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.049
 Navarrese yes and we have done 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.849
 some modifications among them the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.619
 main we would say that it would be the cylinder head 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.140
 the cylinder head is a cylinder head 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.239
 oversized starting from the design 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.760
 of the strings that speak the whole btt 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.370
 like the nice one would be the butts of the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.440
 latest generation of high engines 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.080
 competition where as a main novelty 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.599
 they have that the butt is put on top of the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 poster to improve your refrigeration the 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.890
 problem we will always see these 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.450
 butts that being open at the top 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.670
 and is the lowest when measuring the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.860
 temperature there are many people who have 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.590
 many problems to get a 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.200
 temperature fix that with this cylinder head 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.610
 higher and with this hole more closed 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.090
 when we put the zero of 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.140
 temperature gives us the exact temperature 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.299
 yes, it is true that a person who 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.040
 be very experienced in the off-road 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.450
 will not have any problem in knowing why 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.799
 The model is fine but there are 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.720
 many people are skimming where the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.160
 thermometer gives us an idea very 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.260
 approximate is going the right way 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.310
 these are the main 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.800
 characteristics and then also very 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.290
 important in the engines internally 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.690
 apart from being a 5 transfer 15 frets 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.400
 is a basic engine of the off-road no 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.319
 I think there is no brand of 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.030
 of 18 off-road engines that do not 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.280
 I have a 5 transfer because I put a 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.120
 engine that had a commitment and have 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.829
 power down up consumption 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.599
 ease elasticity to calculate this 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.010
 would be the 5 transfer and then there is another 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.480
 version that is the 8 transfer that is a 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.650
 much more powerful engine so that the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.180
 people who like to enhance a touch 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.530
 different to the engines that always 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.210
 must in the range a high engine 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.340
 power and a more standard motor 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.020
 these equipment engines in a very thing 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.280
 important that is the tunnel crankshaft 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.320
 crankshaft tourÃ© means that the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.780
 last year to the worker who works 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.510
 hand that gives more performance better 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.830
 benefits better consumption and is one of 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.180
 the key plicas that drive the engines 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.790
 of high-end Navarre and so that we 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.730
 let's make an idea now a tunnel 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.930
 would be a motor type a btt or a nice 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.969
 top of the range 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.950
 I believe that this is one of the parties 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.470
 keys to see the dimension of 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.880
 project where is it aimed 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.230
 for us an engine is so 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.110
 important the engine like all 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.730
 supplements that these have 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.620
 complements is what we always 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.209
 ultimate ratico work but a good 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.549
 clutch to make a good air filter 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.959
 a good escape all that is what 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.440
 complements the whole issue of 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.360
 engines 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.280
 that's where ultimate comes in and we've 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.930
 done this park is a combo pack in 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.389
 which comes 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.110
 the motor on the one hand to fix first 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:37.020
 the presentation where we would have motor 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.940
 with clutch and hood exhaust filter 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.730
 air with oiled foam and 2 ventures 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.680
 the engine as you can see comes with the 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.259
 clutch mounted 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.479
 and the bell calibrated the bell with the 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.310
 fair game almost like a ready to run 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.389
 but of competition to ride it 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.800
 directly in the car that we 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.500
 We forget all the problems 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.550
 this comes with an escape 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.320
 master fix 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.260
 means that it is online with the 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.910
 springs and everything and the ultimate filter 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.380
 that is true is tiny in the 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.910
 annoying filter that is always 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.160
 bothering with the body and tubes 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.990
 that do not go down and all that and the 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.440
 as oiled ones that an oiled the 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.610
 we have put in this way why 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.200
 because if we mount it directly on 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.940
 the filter would have a problem that he 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.620
 makes it is the one below then what 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.420
 we count like this and everyone before 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.920
 use it is very important to press it 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.200
 so that the oil goes through again 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.880
 everywhere do it because it's going to 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.590
 the filter remains some part and the other 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.590
 it's going to be dry and that's a danger 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.220
 and nothing and a little the goal of that that 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.660
 people buy the product and do not 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.430
 have to worry about what clutch 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.190
 mount and what filter and what I need 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.440
 we give all the parquet that this pack then 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.150
 is what has been used in the high 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.010
 competitions the care of the brand 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.490
 are using and the truth is that it has 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.490
 given very good result 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.749
 is of a proven quality and we believe 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.610
 what can be interesting 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:00.129
 the goal to put it to work 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.959
 modeler help him and have the 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:04.629
 same possible problems I hope that what 

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:08.399
 Enjoy and have a great time 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.399
 hours with this engine thank you very much
