00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
was a good stress test for the animation

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.389 
was a good stress test for the animation
system<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.470> his<00:01:25.710> proportions<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.369> very

changes<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.979> tilted<00:01:35.429> spine<00:01:36.149> of<00:01:36.810> course

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
changes more of a tilted spine of course

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.600 
changes more of a tilted spine of course
later<00:01:37.289> I'll<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:37.740> some<00:01:38.130> real<00:01:38.310> wolf

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
later I'll make some real wolf

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.370 
later I'll make some real wolf
animations<00:01:39.179> but<00:01:39.539> for<00:01:39.750> now<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:39.990> pretty<00:01:40.170> cool

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
animations but for now it's pretty cool

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.050 
animations but for now it's pretty cool
that<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.710> rabbit<00:01:40.979> animations<00:01:41.460> work<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:41.910> him

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that the rabbit animations work with him

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.880 
that the rabbit animations work with him
even<00:01:42.600> though<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> foot<00:01:43.170> contacts<00:01:43.740> aren't

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
even though the foot contacts aren't

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.010 
even though the foot contacts aren't
quite<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.310> yet<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.450> Wolves<00:01:45.630> are<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> lot

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
quite right yet so the Wolves are a lot

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.109 
quite right yet so the Wolves are a lot
stronger<00:01:46.289> than<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> rabbits<00:01:47.070> they're<00:01:47.910> few

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.370 
feet taller and hundreds of pounds
heavier<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.390> I'm<00:01:51.509> gonna<00:01:51.659> change<00:01:51.960> its<00:01:52.110> script

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
heavier so I'm gonna change its script

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.930 
heavier so I'm gonna change its script
