information on the back it's all wrapped
up<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.660> take<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> wrapping

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
up right now so I can take that wrapping

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.700 
up right now so I can take that wrapping
off<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.739> yet<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.760> got<00:01:00.350> information<00:01:01.350> on

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
off just yet but it's got information on

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590 
off just yet but it's got information on
it<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.949> got<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> single<00:01:02.879> hand<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.210> flushing

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
it I got the single hand and flushing

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.380 
it I got the single hand and flushing
tool<00:01:04.309> it's<00:01:05.309> not<00:01:05.430> very<00:01:05.489> sharp<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.119> I'm<00:01:06.210> probably

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
tool it's not very sharp so I'm probably

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.719 
tool it's not very sharp so I'm probably
going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.130> coons<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:08.549> least

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
going to have to on the coons at least

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
going to have to on the coons at least
and<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> cones<00:01:09.990> getting<00:01:10.380> stuff<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.740> us

and all the cones getting stuff for us

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
and all the cones getting stuff for us
and<00:01:11.100> them<00:01:11.220> kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> mine<00:01:12.090> showing<00:01:12.420> me<00:01:12.510> how<00:01:12.659> he
