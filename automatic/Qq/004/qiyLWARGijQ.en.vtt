Golden<00:02:51.370> Sun<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.700> too<00:02:51.910> big<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.269> series<00:02:52.600> and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
Golden Sun is too big of a series and

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.330 
Golden Sun is too big of a series and
I'm<00:02:52.810> not<00:02:52.959> sure<00:02:53.170> he'd<00:02:53.319> be<00:02:53.350> first<00:02:53.769> priority<00:02:54.250> when

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
I'm not sure he'd be first priority when

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.479 
I'm not sure he'd be first priority when
it<00:02:54.400> comes<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.819> making<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.209> roster<00:02:56.370> there<00:02:57.370> were

I'm<00:03:18.519> not<00:03:18.640> sure<00:03:18.700> how<00:03:19.060> much<00:03:19.239> different<00:03:19.600> she

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
I'm not sure how much different she

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.840 
I'm not sure how much different she
would<00:03:19.989> be<00:03:20.170> from<00:03:20.470> Diddy<00:03:20.680> Kong<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.190> mean<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.670> only

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
would be from Diddy Kong I mean the only

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.520 
would be from Diddy Kong I mean the only
differences<00:03:22.299> are<00:03:22.359> her<00:03:22.600> hair<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.140> her

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
differences are her hair and her

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.680 
differences are her hair and her
bubblegum<00:03:24.130> pop<00:03:24.400> guns<00:03:24.730> instead<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.209> peanuts

other<00:03:26.680> than<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.040> Diddy<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.670> Dixie<00:03:28.060> have

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
other than that Diddy and Dixie have

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.330 
other than that Diddy and Dixie have
almost<00:03:28.630> an<00:03:28.870> identical<00:03:29.019> build<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.190> they'd

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
almost an identical build so they'd

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.920 
almost an identical build so they'd
probably<00:03:30.549> have<00:03:30.760> really<00:03:31.209> similar<00:03:31.600> attacks

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
probably have really similar attacks

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.170 
probably have really similar attacks
regardless<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:33.220> did<00:03:33.459> really<00:03:33.670> like<00:03:33.940> her<00:03:34.090> in
