00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
my up a little or else it what they

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.900 
my up a little or else it what they
would<00:03:54.320> have<00:03:54.350> been<00:03:54.470> much<00:03:54.590> super<00:03:55.040> super<00:03:55.340> long<00:03:55.580> so

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
would have been much super super long so

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.530 
would have been much super super long so
I<00:03:56.420> just<00:03:56.720> was<00:03:57.170> I<00:03:57.760> brought<00:03:58.760> mine<00:03:58.970> up<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.300> little

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
I just was I brought mine up a little

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.300 
I just was I brought mine up a little
bit<00:03:59.660> so<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.050> would<00:04:00.200> give<00:04:00.320> it<00:04:00.410> more<00:04:00.440> point<00:04:01.040> legs

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
bit so it would give it more point legs

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.210 
bit so it would give it more point legs
and<00:04:01.580> then<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.330> just<00:04:02.510> paired<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.930> with<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.320> jean

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
and then I just paired it with this jean

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.199 
and then I just paired it with this jean
jacket<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:06.260> hopefully<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:06.950> can<00:04:07.370> see<00:04:07.670> this<00:04:07.910> I

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
jacket so hopefully I can see this I

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:25.180 
jacket so hopefully I can see this I
thought<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:09.260> was<00:04:09.380> pretty<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.010> very<00:04:11.000> simple
