what that might look like here

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.880

defensively this year you can hold down

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.130 
defensively this year you can hold down
the<00:02:05.070> left<00:02:05.100> trigger<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.480> you<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.750> commit<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the left trigger and you can commit to

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.410 
the left trigger and you can commit to
one<00:02:07.530> side<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:08.100> run<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> ball<00:02:08.550> such<00:02:08.790> you<00:02:08.940> run
