00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
this way if it's going the other way

just<00:00:53.879> brush<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.570> opposite<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:56.010> it's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
just brush the opposite of what it's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.060 
just brush the opposite of what it's
used<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.940> that'll<00:00:57.270> help<00:00:57.390> break<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.989> up

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
be afraid to get in at the root because

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.510 
be afraid to get in at the root because
that's<00:01:19.350> what's<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:19.950> fluff<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.310 
that's what's going to really fluff it
up<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.270> then<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.600> let<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.869> fall<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
up and then you can let it fall to the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.770 
up and then you can let it fall to the
sides<00:01:22.650> again<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.759> you'll<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.330> gives

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
sides again but you'll see it just gives

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
sides again but you'll see it just gives
you<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.380> fullness<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.340> you're<00:01:26.729> missing

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.999 
you that fullness that you're missing
and<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.990> happen<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.619> said<00:01:28.860> from

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and that can happen like I said from

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.940 
and that can happen like I said from
wearing<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> over<00:01:29.640> time<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.329> from

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
wearing it over time or from

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.319 
wearing it over time or from
subconsciously<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.790> patting<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> down

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
subconsciously just patting it down

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.789 
subconsciously just patting it down
