00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.410
 the staff does not make the recipe too 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 delicious one sole with sauce one year 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.380
 super simple also to be done right 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.779
 with sweet or spicy paprika and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.119
 its option to hook up staying longer gives 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.430
 taste differentiated exactly by being 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.520
 spicy then we have with us 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.180
 we will put a 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.730
 solzinho in him passages in the flour 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.100
 white and grilled if you do not want to go 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.440
 there you can make is the oven without the flour and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.129
 already only if it is consistent 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.460
 There's milk cream, it's not the fresh one. 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.230
 great common milk how much fuller 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 for our mood we're going to do 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.710
 put our factory pretty people 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.739
 do also with paprika and stay there you 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.250
 find it easier to find 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.960
 Crocus is no longer so cool the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.600
 ideal would even be the 4 that is equal to us 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.760
 we have here already I have it ground 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.009
 always put little because it gives 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.409
 short enough to know not putting 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.380
 few reaching even a tone 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.439
 red remembering that our people 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.290
 It's off 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:31.229
 always stirring to it already dissolving and 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 we go to the most typical ingredient 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.100
 of that European region of Hungary 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.130
 victory that would be the potatoes 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.610
 correct law recipes in bafatÃ¡ the staff 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.790
 It should be expelled from the country and cut 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.729
 model if you can use the potato 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.500
 Asterix is cool because she is more 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.770
 consistent and ends up leaving more time 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.320
 in the oven takes more flavor to the applicable 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.830
 potato what we're going to do now 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:13.350
 yes we will connect the body of our morumbi 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:17.100
 with fire stirring constantly connected and where 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:21.350
 comes the jump our mood was easy already 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.350
 Loading ... 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.689
 You see the difference here that I already give. 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.000
 to where we put the purple coloration 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.920
 has dissolved our factory so 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.200
 saying this reddish tone of ours 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.140
 sauce a little more of the Papuda 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.239
 our own manufacturer 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.579
 and then I like to give a special touch 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.709
 in this world by putting a little bit of 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.959
 cream catupiry you can put a 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.420
 Parmesan and is at your discretion 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.420
 but I think it's cool our Catholic 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.739
 world here nothing but a distinctive flavor 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.760
 of a Brazilian in our sauce let's 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.280
 so to say our sole is already 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:13.549
 ready that we put him here in the 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:16.819
 case to lull and cover with our 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.819
 sauce 1 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.920
 and there is our filet of sole to the 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.350
 sauce a different sauce for the sauce 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.250
 our palate here Brazilian but it is a 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.140
 delicious 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.660
 everybody will love a plate and light 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.640
 with closed the potatoes the accompaniment 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.570
 delicious very good indeed 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.570
 I'm sure everyone
