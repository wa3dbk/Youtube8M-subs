00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.459
 to be small 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.459
 in nature it's a very relative notion 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.999
 we can be the youngest of a family of eight children 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.659
 where the giant of a family where larger specimens do not exceed 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.659
 a few centimeters 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.740
 we can be small and live 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.530
 but also the title and predators 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 this situation 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.940
 from this point of view one thing is common to all species these are 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 the beginnings in life 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.180
 we do not use the same word to designate the offspring of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.929
 rodents 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.929
 or that of a war 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.350
 when they have their little ones 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.539
 all animals face the same challenges make them grow 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.140
 to bring them more or less quickly to adulthood and autonomy 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.510
 during his apprenticeship 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.310
 this night we learned that we always have to go to the 3 most 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.230
 easy 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.900
 it is driven at this time by the heaviness of a young herbivore who had to 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 to put in its places there shortly 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.369
 this young oryx 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.240
 a few days
