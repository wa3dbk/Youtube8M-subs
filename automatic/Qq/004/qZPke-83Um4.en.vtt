00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.350
 to the sound of Latin rhythms and dance 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.630
 band pedro molina de coatepeque received 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.150

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.119
 in the parade of roses the first of 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.220
 January 2016 with a conference of 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.289
 press and a formal act the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.839
 authorities of the Ministry of Culture and 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.930
 sports as well as the band pedro 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.789
 molina and the roses tournament 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.530
 presented to the band composed of 300 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.530
 young people from four packages 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.690
 to tenango that have been prepared during 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.120
 more than a year to apply at the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.180
 Latin American and earn a place in the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.250
 parade of roses 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.230
 first of all we felt very 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.450
 happy and we thank you very much 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.150
 God because we are given this again 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.220
 second chance and we already live it a 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.620
 time in 2010 and it was such an experience 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.900
 unforgettable and this time with these 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.089
 new young people that we have right here 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.650
 opposite then we go with this dream another 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.930
 time to put on behalf of guatemala very 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.670
 high and right now we have been 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.869
 preparing very strong to be able to apply 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.720
 to the parade because we had to work 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.119
 for three years in a row in 2012 in 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.460
 2013 and until 2014 because every 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.479
 year an application is sent 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.190
 unfortunately in 2012 we do not apply 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.619
 for a few details that we needed 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.270
 in 2013 the same thing happened again and 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.180
 thank God in 2014 what 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.229
 we managed to apply everything that we 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.360
 it took a lot of spending on economics where 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.220
 most of the band they made raffles 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.110
 they made carwash food sales for 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.610
 get funds 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.650
 in that aspect because the news was something 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.320
 so shocking because we were 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.720
 counting 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.729
 At the end of the year we went with my 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 brother who is the other teacher of the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.150
 pedro molina band we were in the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.950
 scene of directors with all who 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.260
 they will participate on January 1, 2016 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.090
 in pasadena and there they were telling us 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.670
 our legal representative of the tournament 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.400
 that they did not decide which band to choose 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.429
 because as they only grab a band 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.130
 Latin and then there were two Latin bands 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.290
 there was the golden eagles of mexico and 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.730
 I was pedro molina from guatemala and it was 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.230
 a debate between them because they said 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.830
 good to which of the two we grab because 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.840
 only one can come and then the other 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.510
 day they met again to see it another 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.030
 time the videos and they did not decide that they are going 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.250
 to grab and then I decided to take a 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.930
 decision later and decided to take 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.370
 the two bands and that were us 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.770
 counting and when we listen 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.870
 that is a great emotion because 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.890
 now we are going two representatives of 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.540
 latin america to that famous saying 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.310
 we have a motto and today with 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.739
 courage bravery and faith everything can be 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.660
 achieve then I urged the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.820
 young people to keep fighting with with 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.620
 these dreams because remember that the 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.010
 music can take us to many 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.010
 borders 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.390
 Y 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.660
 to go back to pedro molina is the king and 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.580
 sixth your world unseen of pain and 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.220
 berger frame and to illuminate of barry 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.790
 of amber singular grinding by reid 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.350
 understand and know previous the 16th instaura 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.350
 guatemala work by ricardo molinari 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.350
 yard 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.590
 so to see the participation of the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.260
 band helps to expand the culture and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.690
 Guatemalan art in the world about 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.730
 all with an event seen by millions of 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.410
 people is also good 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.350
 opportunity for Guatemalans 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.000
 who reside in california may be 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.990
 close to your culture 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.990
