00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
this has gone from a market into a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.500 
this has gone from a market into a
festival<00:02:51.190> what<00:02:51.520> made<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.880> decide<00:02:52.000> on<00:02:52.360> the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
I think in most cases there's so many

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.250 
I think in most cases there's so many
markets<00:02:58.180> out<00:02:58.450> there<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.900> people<00:02:59.020> always
