00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.150
 good evening welcome to 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.370
 press conference after the game against the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.830
 sc freiburg we would like to talk about 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.190
 Talk the game and give it traditional 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.690
 the guest trainer first the word mister 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:24.269
 Thank you are good in the game 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:28.500
 had come to playfully good 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:33.329
 then have had a 1 0 lead and have 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 then too many tackles lost phase 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.860
 I have the first half 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.739
 highly motivated and a lot of pressure 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.910
 with it the spectator and did not have there 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.030
 the rest and back out then what then 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.460
 that the second half is too many 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.129
 player did not have on the place though 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.320
 physically at the moment in the constitution 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.430
 are 90 or 95 minutes to go through 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.680
 was just too for the players to their 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.229
 There was not enough space 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.040
 regulated training week behind 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.939
 have and then we have one or two 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.040
 others had a little luck 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.390
 nevertheless , it was also a letter 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.240
 so that the long balls pressure enormously 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.979
 sparked and we had only 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 advance but overall you want 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.830
 of course better games for the game 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.140
 then keep it open and the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.630
 possibilities this would have given if 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.259
 would have been fresher 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.619
 to use the counter but it was today 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.130
 not possible and that's why for us 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.250
 then okay that is 1 1 has gone out 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.350
 a gift 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.710
 there will be no good 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.509
 starting in the game the first one 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.399
 minutes we have a bit 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.259
 noticed that this is about a lot 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.790
 we finally want to get three points 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.450
 and if you have another eleven meters 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.509
 against the war's early timeframe 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.489
 that is a dangerous situation 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.020
 but rather not 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.720
 the boys of werder bremen not the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.099
 guys who are probably working hard when 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.620
 she did not like that again 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.690
 has and has led a game is very 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.700
 very good fight and was very 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.260
 Intensive a lot of body use was there 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.680
 and you just felt 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.430
 they wanted to win the game no matter how 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.769
 and franco made a very nice goal 11 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.200
 very very important for us then of course 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.310
 also to take a second break 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.910
 half- time I find again 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.879
 Took a little bit but for us everyone was 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.319
 clearly one point is not enough and the 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.980
 last 20 minutes was a bit was 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.739
 while playing 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.930
 On the one hand we really have everything 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.430
 thrown forward and on the other hand 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.750
 Of course, they were waiting for the counter and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.790
 post office shot had you 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.750
 Maybe you're standing with empty ones 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.970
 hands at 18 7 shots and so 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.400
 soon finally there was from the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.290
 offside 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.310
 therefore been sitting here are where 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.680
 both teams draw 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.909
 Christie was not satisfied 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.260
 I'm happy with the draw 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.900
 Of course he is not satisfied with it 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.489
 not easily find the tie 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.340
 that we have a lot of opportunities too 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.500
 have had a lot of pressure and from 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.940
 since it is very annoying that is again 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.230
 Again , there is only one point to ask 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.230
 to the coaches to the game 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:39.030
 I see that is not the case yet 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.849
 henri vogt will be happy to hear from you 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.310
 know why you have during the week 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.480
 this with the three points so much 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.010
 they have thought that would be the topic of discussion 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.860
 Do the team well when the pressure 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.590
 is built stronger in this way 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.629
 I connect only one interview 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.519
 given that was under par or here 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.080
 I believe a second but there 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.659
 I have been asked what the goal is and 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.489
 I think that was funny arrived 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.409
 when i'm coaching from dara bremen from 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.150
 play in our situation said 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.400
 I have a point and look something 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.480
 as it does not come out for me was 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.159
 it no alternative 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.599
 no matter who it is at all 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.640
 not about friborg no matter which 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.479
 opponent in the situation in home game 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.130
 I spend three points as a target 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.830
 I think the team already has that 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.970
 More expected than signal and where I am 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.440
 the crew had to say the same thing 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.490
 for the team it was clear that me 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.490
 Want to win is logical 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.060
 More questions to play then thank you 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.650
 me for the attention and wishes 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.430
 in sc freiburg good home travel 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.430
 Thank you
