one of those settings - but but honestly
it's<00:04:25.800> like<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:26.250> is<00:04:26.430> one<00:04:26.580> thing<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.729> kills

me about all these systems if I'm in
Reverse<00:04:31.820> why<00:04:32.820> does<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.330> matter<00:04:33.720> if<00:04:34.200> there's<00:04:34.680> a

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
Reverse why does it matter if there's a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.610 
Reverse why does it matter if there's a
parking<00:04:35.250> curb<00:04:35.610> in<00:04:35.880> front<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.630> car<00:04:36.900> I'm<00:04:37.169> in

so<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.440> think<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:44.040> shouldn't<00:04:44.460> be<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:45.479> know<00:04:45.570> if

smooth and quick BMW cleans this has a

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.780 
smooth and quick BMW cleans this has a
zero<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:53.150> 60<00:05:53.570> of<00:05:53.780> just<00:05:54.050> under<00:05:54.320> seven<00:05:55.100> seconds

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.030 
zero to 60 of just under seven seconds
that<00:05:55.910> I<00:05:56.000> could<00:05:56.150> believe<00:05:56.360> that<00:05:56.600> I<00:05:56.630> mean<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:57.110> on

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
that I could believe that I mean that on

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.640 
that I could believe that I mean that on
a<00:05:58.100> standstill<00:05:58.790> this<00:05:59.270> engine<00:05:59.720> has<00:05:59.900> so<00:06:00.410> much

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
a standstill this engine has so much

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.250 
a standstill this engine has so much
torque<00:06:01.040> off<00:06:01.250> the<00:06:01.280> line<00:06:01.690> but<00:06:02.690> honestly<00:06:03.110> on<00:06:03.230> the

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
torque off the line but honestly on the

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:10.030 
torque off the line but honestly on the
freeway<00:06:04.300> it's<00:06:05.350> quick<00:06:06.350> I<00:06:06.770> guess<00:06:08.980> but<00:06:09.980> that

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
freeway it's quick I guess but that

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.890 
freeway it's quick I guess but that
probably<00:06:10.490> won't<00:06:10.850> be<00:06:10.970> a<00:06:11.030> problem<00:06:11.510> for<00:06:11.690> most

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
probably won't be a problem for most

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.560 
probably won't be a problem for most
buyers<00:06:12.260> and<00:06:12.700> honestly<00:06:13.700> at<00:06:13.880> quick<00:06:14.120> zero<00:06:14.450> to

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
buyers and honestly at quick zero to

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.900 
buyers and honestly at quick zero to
sixty<00:06:14.930> is<00:06:15.110> not<00:06:15.770> a<00:06:15.800> reason<00:06:16.220> somebody<00:06:16.490> would<00:06:16.640> get

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
sixty is not a reason somebody would get

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.390 
sixty is not a reason somebody would get
a<00:06:16.970> diesel<00:06:17.480> it<00:06:17.660> is<00:06:18.110> a<00:06:18.140> diesel<00:06:18.350> so<00:06:18.680> it<00:06:18.890> does<00:06:19.130> get

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
a diesel it is a diesel so it does get

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.600 
a diesel it is a diesel so it does get
pretty<00:06:19.610> good<00:06:20.090> gas<00:06:20.330> mileage<00:06:20.650> 31<00:06:21.650> miles<00:06:22.280> to<00:06:22.520> the

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
pretty good gas mileage 31 miles to the

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.760 
pretty good gas mileage 31 miles to the
gallon<00:06:22.760> on<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.510> highway<00:06:23.570> alone<00:06:24.230> which<00:06:24.740> is

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
gallon on the highway alone which is

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.700 
gallon on the highway alone which is
pretty<00:06:25.280> darn<00:06:25.670> good<00:06:26.170> although<00:06:27.170> the<00:06:27.290> price<00:06:27.500> of

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
pretty darn good although the price of

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.130 
pretty darn good although the price of
diesel<00:06:27.890> these<00:06:28.250> days<00:06:28.490> is<00:06:28.760> typically<00:06:29.720> higher

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
diesel these days is typically higher

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.280 
diesel these days is typically higher
than<00:06:30.170> that<00:06:30.590> of<00:06:30.650> regular<00:06:31.280> gas<00:06:31.790> so<00:06:32.600> you're<00:06:33.080> not

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
than that of regular gas so you're not

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.710 
than that of regular gas so you're not
really<00:06:33.590> saving<00:06:33.950> money<00:06:34.510> but<00:06:35.510> then<00:06:35.630> again

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
really saving money but then again

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.050 
really saving money but then again
anybody<00:06:36.140> who<00:06:36.380> buys<00:06:36.560> a<00:06:37.270> $60,000<00:06:38.530> BMW<00:06:39.530> is

anybody who buys a $60,000 BMW is

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.150 
anybody who buys a $60,000 BMW is
probably<00:06:41.060> not<00:06:41.390> too<00:06:41.750> concerned<00:06:42.290> with<00:06:42.440> saving

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160
