00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi guys and compass and welcome to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.049
 another new video of how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.050
 jetpack title in big cars 5 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.330
 stealing the jetpack from the military base ok 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.040
 and this was something that I wanted to bring the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.650
 today but first of all if 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.900
 we could reach the amount of 300 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.640
 likes in a work would be perfect and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.710
 brutal and he would appear a lot of 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.869
 same way let's start with this 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.599
 video that I had planned and is mega 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.660
 epic ok recently the famous creator 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.489
 of julian mods and has created this mode the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 which allows us practically 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.390
 have this so first of all 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.559
 let's do it and remember that if you 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.690
 they want to download I'll leave them 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.489
 right in the description and for 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.350
 install them pretty easy and if not what 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.700
 they know how to install also there comes a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.219
 installation guide 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.410
 a little small but the same way we are going to 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.329
 start as you see it here nothing else you 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.969
 I give here I open the menu of the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.559
 jetpack and with this I open it ok and with that 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.690
 I practically have it already 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.940
 I already have it activated and we can notice that 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 if we go to what the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.080
 part of the radar we can notice that here 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.510
 this does not come out although it 's like a mission 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.810
 apart and let's start the so 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.460
 nothing we are going to give him and the truth that this 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.590
 it's something that I had a craving 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 incredible to play so let's see 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.310
 How are we doing? In fact I see that it is going 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.870
 to be a bit difficult this to steal 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.700
 the jetpack so first of all 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.800
 let's take out the menu mode and I'm going to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.020
 put a few armitage in fact 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.270
 I'm in god mode so we do not lose 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.010
 time and let's go what we go like that 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.560
 that we will quickly give you here 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.230
 the weapons that if I'm not wrong it 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 they find around here and so can 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.740
 notice that the climate changes a little 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.870
 to be very solid so here already 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.250
 I have all the weapons and let's see 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.860
 ok well I'm going to stay here with my 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.410
 ak-47 and now we are going to address the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.300
 military base to be able to appreciate this 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.979
 beauty that very much of the players 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.840
 I know they were waiting for a lot 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.250
 in fact I love it very much 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.320
 jetpack more than anything when he had his 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.180
 appearance in the great effect san andreas 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.400
 and it was I think that the best means of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.120
 transportation since you could go by 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.190
 floor 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.260
 you could not crash and many more things like that 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.750
 that we are going to enter right here and I 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.479
 by god good center between the way more 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 effective let's give it to see I see that it 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.410
 find right in this part indeed 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.870
 I see that it was not right around here but I say 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.850
 let's go here and I see that here 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.560
 just find the jetpack in fact not 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.180
 I want the game to caress me 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.120
 that with all this I do not know what is going to happen 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.220
 so ok I see that it is just 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.350
 here ok well I see that it starts as a 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.570
 common mission 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.980
 ok how it starts as a common mission 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.380
 and current so what are we going to do 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.270
 will be put us right in this area and 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.070
 Now what I'll have to do will be 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.260
 practically take all this off so 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.880
 let's take off the stars so that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.550
 they are not looking for us, let's give them here 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.110
 to the player and we're going to take the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.120
 stars so let's give it here 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.070
 I do not want stars, ok, they've taken me away 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.990
 all the stars and there as they see it 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.970
 find the player with the jetpack like this 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.500
 Let's kill him quickly right 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.720
 I see that it is somewhat difficult in fact some 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.430
 day I 'll do it well in fact because it's worth 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.080
 quite worth it here as they see it already 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.790
 we killed the jetpack guy and now 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.680
 I want your jetpack or great and I have the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.320
 jetpack either much this can not be 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.750
 it does not seem can not be I have the jetta 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.740
 I have the jetpack or by God this is what 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.600
 more epic 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.280
 or I saw that it goes out in that good way 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.590
 As you see, kids already find me here 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.570
 with the super jetpack and the truth that 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.190
 it's quite worth it in fact or that 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.050
 I saw how it is used and I saw how it is used 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.850
 but I see that it will cost me some 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.650
 I actually work if it costs me something 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.300
 work what we are going to do will be 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.730
 take them off so let's give it here 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.640
 let's give it ok is that I do not know how to handle it 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.620
 very good is what I fuck something ok already I 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.750
 I find here driving it and the truth 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.850
 which is a unique experience indeed if 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.740
 I'm not wrong with the jetpack I can use 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.780
 at the same time weapons or what great is 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.540
 this seriously I think it would be the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.460
 better vehicle and I do not know how you can go 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.800
 a faster way ok 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.930
 I've seen the controls a little bit and I see 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.270
 which is not at all difficult, in fact I see 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.190
 which is quite easy and how they see it if 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.660
 I oppress that what happens is that 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.180
 deactivates so let's try to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.610
 suppress the space key because with the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.100
 space is how we light it not with the 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.990
 chip we do that we raise it and also 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.930
 I also sprint and we love the truth 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.730
 is pretty well created with this low 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.070
 and I do not know, I think it's something that they should 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.690
 to put in the game as it would give you a 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.280
 unique experience indeed i feel like 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.320
 to teleport me somewhere and 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.600
 to be able to appreciate it a little better but 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.550
 as they see it, the mold is perfect 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.500
 me until now of all the mods that 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.240
 have taken out I think this is the best 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.430
 of all together with the tsunami 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.810
 or if it is not the best because I think that 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.250
 it would be one of the best since it has 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.169
 damaged a unique experience to the game 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.639
 so guys as they see it is the way 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.169
 of the jet pack the truth that is brutal 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.300
 in fact you may notice that it is a version 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.789
 improved since with it we can shoot 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.610
 since what the character is doing is not 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.190
 in fact, tell me if you want 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.169
 I made them a video and practically 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.360
 stealing the jetpack but to perfection 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.099
 they make us use the say mode or nothing 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.990
 for this because of the style because as 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.580
 come to me I've really loved what 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.889
 best of all this is that it 's pretty 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.630
 easy to control and it's also pretty 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.819
 easy to get it seems to me that if 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.409
 someone else takes that person from you 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.449
 You can fly and you can make your own 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.190
 but since they see it, it 's something that 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.690
 Now I see something spectacular 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.490
 although it also costs a little bit of 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.680
 work to control it since the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.180
 controls are a bit complicated but 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.699
 as you see it is something that is extremely 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.729
 brutal if I'm not wrong with the key 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.470
 in ojotas of salts and you turn off like that 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.509
 let's see let's see I want to see what 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.680
 I can do if I go to a vehicle like this 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.970
 what to see here are the 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.430
 vehicles in fact I see that I can 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.229
 increase the speed a lot and we're going 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.630
 to try to take away what ok we're going to 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.050
 activate it ok look is what I love 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.090
 may l 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.849
 and put it and they do not make me any kind of 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.919
 hurt to see I want to go right over here ok 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.409
 well I see that I can go at the speed of 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.550
 the street but I can also 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.220
 transport me pretty fast indeed 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.699
 they say that with a key of this if I do not 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.669
 mistaken 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.990
 with this was not or was with this no no what 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.060
 I know but there is a key with which 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.580
 you can do sprint and it goes perfectly 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.110
 because look here I have the mod of this and 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.210
 the truth that it looks somewhat ugly but as 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.009
 they see it 's a brutal way the truth I 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.319
 I think it's one of the best and I think 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.849
 it's going to be very good and nothing else was 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.919
 thing to expect that some 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.560
 little things more not as they see it is one of the 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.659
 first mods has taken out has been created 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.219
 by the creator of Moscow lille lyon lips 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.780
 that for me I think it would be the best 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.690
 motorcycle maker so as you see it 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.219
 all a very different video than what 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.659
 that we are used to and here as 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.949
 come and we find the jetpack 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.960
 so I hope they like this one 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.219
