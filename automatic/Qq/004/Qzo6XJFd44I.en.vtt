00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.750
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.110
 that you have beautiful anyway I'm fine 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.640
 nickel 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.650
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.020
 new information video on gta 5 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.270
 online about the dlc of robberies 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.400
 so just now we had a new 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.930
 very interesting leak so in the 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.660
 trailer robberies remember you have 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.460
 could see a vehicle this one the square 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.989
 a kourouma a vehicle that looks 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.180
 to be armored which will surely be very 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.500
 appreciated during robberies in all 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.660
 case during the chases or 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.430
 others like that but a lot of 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.809
 people wondered the blow is 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.609
 what would there be a version of this 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.559
 vehicle for the free mode we 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.850
 could put in our garage and 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.320
 well with the picture I'm going to you 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.949
 show so who will be available in the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.949
 description 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.679
 I think the answer is it him 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.059
 can see a roma carenco that does not have 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.429
 the air of a joke is in free mode 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.809
 with a civilian inside that what 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.460
 suggests that this photo is not a 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.110
 fake actually is that she was 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.180
 available on forums 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.140
 rockstar she did remove it's for 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.970
 that too that I only wanted me 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.260
 in the description so you in 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.540
 comments do not hesitate to tell us 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.010
 what do you think of this picture so 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.420
 if you think it's a fake or not 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.250
 I do not think it's me 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.270
 really very similar to the one we 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.040
 could see in the trailer 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.390
 after that is not official as I 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.369
 wanted to say auxerre has not said anything yet 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.259
 on it but if it would be a fake 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.789
 why would he have removed 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.189
 forums on which they were posted 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.619
 so after for my personal opinion I think 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.750
 really that this picture is real we 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.520
 karine will really kourouma mode 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.539
 civil society let's say for free mode and 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.880
 it will be really fun 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.229
 we will not spit on novelties and 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.000
 so then afterwards as this 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.469
 video was still pretty fast 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.820
 I will show you, therefore, 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.390
 other confirmation for the bank 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.100
 termites 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.509
 we had talked about the modders had them 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.219
 found in source codes 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.439
 rockstar we had talked too we had 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.390
 seen so devices from the pictures of 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.799
 leak that was out where we could the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.210
 see and look in the pictures that 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.350
 appeared yesterday so it's 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.119
 people have not been seeing them 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.740
 frankly go see his videos ago 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.719
 really a lot of information that 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.460
 went out yesterday and there so look on 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.520
 this image we can see the robbers 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.840
 who places a termite bomb on them on 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.830
 the bars of the safe to be able to 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.510
 go inside 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.300
 so it's confirmed it was a good 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.530
 termite bomb so the thermite who who 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.090
 actually gnawing the metal to be able to 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.250
 then broke the door more easily 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.260
 simply returned to the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.580
 bank to see the rob and go back 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.750
 quietly 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.920
 and here we are at the end of 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.330
 this video that was still pretty 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.980
 short but interesting enough 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.930
 a good big novelty anyway 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.160
 which is really fun do not hesitate 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.050
 to tell us in comment what you 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.710
 think of all that so if you too that 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.360
 makes you happy 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.860
 do not hesitate at the same time 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.570
 dropped a little thumb purpose to show if 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.130
