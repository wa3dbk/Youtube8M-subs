00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and glue the square in so it's not just

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.639 
and glue the square in so it's not just
a<00:00:59.730> little<00:00:59.879> bit<00:00:59.969> back<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.870> check<00:01:01.109> our<00:01:01.289> square

lockable<00:02:02.130> front<00:02:02.520> door<00:02:02.759> that's<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.570> strong<00:02:03.990> as

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
lockable front door that's as strong as

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.960 
lockable front door that's as strong as
a<00:02:05.369> home<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:06.119> drywall<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.780> stick<00:02:07.020> built<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
a home with drywall and stick built and

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.170 
a home with drywall and stick built and
a<00:02:09.379> and<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.860> if<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.190> stays<00:02:11.430> warm

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
a and this if it stays warm

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.259 
a and this if it stays warm
with<00:02:13.099> with<00:02:14.099> any<00:02:14.280> type<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.549> bedding<00:02:14.849> becomes

the<00:02:15.420> clean<00:02:15.629> bedroom<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> clean

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
the clean bedroom and then the clean

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.179 
the clean bedroom and then the clean
bathroom<00:02:17.819> will<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.930> relies<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.829> separate

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
bathroom will that relies on a separate

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.160 
bathroom will that relies on a separate
water<00:02:20.370> sanitation<00:02:20.879> hygiene<00:02:21.269> project<00:02:21.959> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
water sanitation hygiene project that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.750 
water sanitation hygiene project that
would<00:02:22.290> integrate<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.219> a<00:02:23.250> module

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
would integrate with this as a module

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.270 
would integrate with this as a module
and<00:02:23.969> then<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.140> might<00:02:25.349> be<00:02:25.560> able<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.799> create<00:02:26.010> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
and then we might be able to create the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.920 
and then we might be able to create the
wiki<00:02:26.549> speed<00:02:26.790> micro<00:02:27.120> house<00:02:27.299> at<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.659> hundred
