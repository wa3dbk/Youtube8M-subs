it's constantly fast-paced because of

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.490 
it's constantly fast-paced because of
the<00:03:14.849> grunt<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.329> it<00:03:15.450> can<00:03:15.659> replenish<00:03:15.959> people

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
the grunt and it can replenish people

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.990 
the grunt and it can replenish people
and<00:03:16.709> stuff<00:03:16.859> like<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.069> from<00:03:17.400> what<00:03:17.609> they<00:03:17.760> could

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
and stuff like that from what they could

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.909 
and stuff like that from what they could
from<00:03:18.120> what<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.299> found<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.870> absolutely<00:03:19.079> loved<00:03:19.799> it

xbox controller bit actually is but it's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.399 
xbox controller bit actually is but it's
because<00:04:06.180> they've<00:04:06.329> done<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.139> it's<00:04:07.290> like

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
because they've done it so it's like

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.379 
because they've done it so it's like
more<00:04:07.590> center<00:04:07.949> of<00:04:08.040> gravity<00:04:08.430> sort<00:04:08.639> of<00:04:08.699> weight<00:04:08.879> it

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
more center of gravity sort of weight it

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.699

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
I use the pesos for controller and I

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.759 
I use the pesos for controller and I
didn't<00:04:15.449> like<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.049> think<00:04:16.380> it's<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.590> big

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.229 
didn't like it that I think it's a big
thing<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:17.039> PlayStation<00:04:17.759> have<00:04:17.880> always<00:04:18.090> had

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
thing that PlayStation have always had

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.560 
thing that PlayStation have always had
is<00:04:18.479> their<00:04:18.659> control<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.259> Spooks<00:04:19.709> like<00:04:20.669> I<00:04:20.849> i<00:04:20.970> I'd

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
is their control of Spooks like I i I'd

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.209 
is their control of Spooks like I i I'd
publishing<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.289> put<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:22.560> much<00:04:22.650> emphasis<00:04:23.070> on

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
publishing to put so much emphasis on

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.730

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
but I just don't like it doesn't feel

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.809 
but I just don't like it doesn't feel
nice<00:04:25.840> in<00:04:26.139> your<00:04:26.199> hands<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.770> it's<00:04:27.340> like<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> t-rex
