was<00:01:23.119> made<00:01:23.509> a<00:01:23.539> dedicated<00:01:24.259> ship<00:01:24.649> that<00:01:24.860> ship

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
was made a dedicated ship that ship

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.990 
was made a dedicated ship that ship
would<00:01:26.119> only<00:01:26.390> play<00:01:26.869> pong<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.820> build

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
would only play pong and to build

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.550 
would only play pong and to build
another<00:01:29.210> game<00:01:29.509> we<00:01:29.930> had<00:01:30.050> to<00:01:30.140> build<00:01:30.320> a<00:01:30.380> whole<00:01:30.410> new

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
another game we had to build a whole new

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.740 
another game we had to build a whole new
chip<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.280> every<00:01:31.789> time<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.060> build<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.330> chip<00:01:32.600> it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
chip and every time you build a chip it

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.050 
chip and every time you build a chip it
took<00:01:32.869> about<00:01:32.990> nine<00:01:33.470> months<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.399> engineering

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
took about nine months of engineering

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.930 
took about nine months of engineering
effort<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.050> we<00:01:36.619> had<00:01:36.830> our<00:01:36.860> research<00:01:37.430> group<00:01:37.670> up

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
effort so we had our research group up

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.389 
effort so we had our research group up
in<00:01:38.060> Grass<00:01:38.330> Valley<00:01:38.500> create<00:01:39.500> in<00:01:39.710> three<00:01:40.039> months

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
in Grass Valley create in three months

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.230 
in Grass Valley create in three months
the<00:01:40.610> prototype<00:01:41.090> for<00:01:41.570> what<00:01:42.410> became<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:43.700> VCS

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
the prototype for what became the VCS

the prototype for what became the VCS
the<00:01:45.200> VCS<00:01:45.679> was<00:01:46.039> renamed<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.700> Atari<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.390> 600<00:01:48.140> and

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
the VCS was renamed the Atari to 600 and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.710 
the VCS was renamed the Atari to 600 and
