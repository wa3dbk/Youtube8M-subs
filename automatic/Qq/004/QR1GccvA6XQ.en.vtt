hi everyone this is geramicc85

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
what i have here is a windscreen wiper

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.700
it is a bosch aerotwin AR530S

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.000
as you can see here, the wiping rubber is worn off

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.090
I'm gonna be replacing it today

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.430
I don't wanna throw this whole thing out
and buy new ones

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.000
that's why I bought just the rubber refill kit

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
after looking online on how to get these caps off

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.500
some people use pliers to do that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.000
but then you actually scratch the surface of the wiper blades

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.510
and it is going to start rosting because it is made out of metal

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.800
i found out a nicer and easier way to take out the old rubber

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.300
and put a new one in and I just wanted to
demonstrate that to you real quick

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.500
it might be usefull to you

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.000
these caps on both ends they're keeping the
metal blades that are holding the rubber together

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.200
so you would have to squeeze those two metal blades together to get off this cap

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.650
since that is not easy

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.299
if the rubber is still in between it we just
gonna take the rubber out first

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.740
we do that by pushing it
backwards a little bit

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.070
then you can see that there is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.720
a small hole, we just gonna pull out the
rubber

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.689
from there. then it comes out and then you just keep pulling

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.000
once started you can just pull it
out all the way

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.500
since the old rubber is damaged anyway

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.000
it doesn't matter if it breaks like now

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.969
and that's it, the old rubber is all off

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.100
now you can see the two metal blades on
the side

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.420
that are holding the rubber usually

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.800
now there's enough space between it to
press them together

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.310
and take off the cap just like that

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.000
you don't need any tools or
screwdrivers to do that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.500
the cap on the other side you can
just leave on

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.000
here's the new rubber that i bought

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.500
i bought it online and it cost me 5 bucks

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.700
thats a lot cheaper then buying new windscreen wipers

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.750
and what we do is we take them apart

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.260
i am taking the new rubber now and I'm
putting it between the two

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.420
metal blades and im inserting it

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.239
all the way through, you can

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.500
keep the two metal blades aside by it
using your fingernail

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.099
then it's easy to push in the new rubber

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.900
i am pulling it back just a little bit

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.000
and then cutting it off with scissors

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.940
there's one more thing to do

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.940
we're gonna put the cap back on and
that's it

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.980
