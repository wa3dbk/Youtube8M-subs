00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.180 

all<00:00:00.930> right<00:00:01.140> so<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.560> trying<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.800> figure<00:00:01.979> out

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
all right so I'm trying to figure out

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.679 
all right so I'm trying to figure out
how<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.429> hook<00:00:02.730> up<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.060> torque<00:00:03.330> converter

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
how to hook up this torque converter

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.700 
how to hook up this torque converter
here<00:00:07.099> so<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.250> sprocket<00:00:08.730> for<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.030> chain<00:00:09.710> is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
here so the sprocket for the chain is

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.209 
here so the sprocket for the chain is
down<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.309> there<00:00:12.049> hopefully<00:00:13.049> that's<00:00:13.500> correct

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
down in there hopefully that's correct

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.439 
down in there hopefully that's correct
I've<00:00:15.059> got<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.540> big<00:00:15.780> nut<00:00:15.990> here<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:18.150> only

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
I've got this big nut here the only

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.580 
I've got this big nut here the only
thing<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:18.900> side

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
thing on this side

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.650 
thing on this side
I<00:00:21.740> think<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.490> snap<00:00:23.850> ring<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.539> that

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
I think it's just a snap ring can that

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.730 
I think it's just a snap ring can that
possibly<00:00:24.840> be<00:00:25.350> correct<00:00:27.260> and<00:00:28.260> then<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> this

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
possibly be correct and then on this

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.650 
possibly be correct and then on this
part<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.130> connects<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> drive<00:00:29.849> shaft<00:00:29.880> it

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
part that connects to the drive shaft it

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.940 
part that connects to the drive shaft it
looks<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.050> little<00:00:31.140> strange<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> I've<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.800> this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
looks a little strange so I've got this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.580 
looks a little strange so I've got this
part<00:00:39.500> there's<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> nut<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.070> anything<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:42.590> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
part there's the nut so anything on and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.520 
part there's the nut so anything on and
I<00:00:44.450> presume<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:47.629> this<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.840> has<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.170> line<00:00:49.350> up

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
I presume that this one has to line up

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.000 
I presume that this one has to line up
with<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:53.420> but<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:54.600> makes<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.010> what

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
with this one but what makes it what

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.350 
with this one but what makes it what
makes<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.370> line<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:56.969> something

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
makes it line up is there something

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
makes it line up is there something
supposed<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.930> spacer<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.440> how<00:00:58.949> does<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
supposed to be a spacer here how does it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.270 
supposed to be a spacer here how does it
line<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.940> don't<00:01:00.030> understand<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.780> part<00:01:01.280> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
line up I don't understand that part and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.009 
line up I don't understand that part and
I<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.609> brass<00:01:02.910> ring<00:01:03.270> which<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.600> presume

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I have this brass ring which I presume

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:18.680 
I have this brass ring which I presume
it's<00:01:04.830> over<00:01:05.100> there

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.960 

and<00:01:19.690> this<00:01:20.020> doesn't<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:21.010> has<00:01:21.160> quite<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.460> bit<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.670> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and this doesn't it has quite a bit of a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.390 
and this doesn't it has quite a bit of a
bit<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.720> doesn't<00:01:25.960> go<00:01:26.020> on<00:01:26.050> all<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.470> way<00:01:26.500> so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
bit of it doesn't go on all the way so

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.960 
bit of it doesn't go on all the way so
that<00:01:27.550> makes<00:01:27.820> me<00:01:28.000> wonder<00:01:29.370> I'm<00:01:30.370> presuming<00:01:30.760> that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
that makes me wonder I'm presuming that

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.760 
that makes me wonder I'm presuming that
this<00:01:31.240> goes<00:01:31.510> on<00:01:31.720> this<00:01:31.900> way<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:34.410> guess<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:35.440> can

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
this goes on this way I guess it can

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.630 
this goes on this way I guess it can
move<00:01:35.950> back<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.460> forth<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:39.070> open<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.460> close

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
move back and forth to open and close

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.270 
move back and forth to open and close
but<00:01:39.910> I<00:01:40.000> don't<00:01:40.180> know<00:01:40.240> what<00:01:40.390> makes<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.750> move<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
but I don't know what makes it move and

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.330 
but I don't know what makes it move and
then<00:01:42.430> this<00:01:42.610> I<00:01:43.000> think<00:01:43.300> goes<00:01:43.630> on<00:01:47.160> there<00:01:48.160> like

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
then this I think goes on there like

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.800 
then this I think goes on there like
that<00:01:48.580> more<00:01:49.090> or<00:01:49.180> less<00:01:50.730> it<00:01:51.730> all<00:01:51.910> seems<00:01:52.240> like<00:01:52.390> it

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
that more or less it all seems like it

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.200 
that more or less it all seems like it
doesn't<00:01:52.990> quite<00:01:53.460> something's<00:01:54.460> not<00:01:54.670> right

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
doesn't quite something's not right

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.440 
doesn't quite something's not right
I<00:01:55.240> suspect<00:01:56.550> maybe<00:01:57.550> one<00:01:57.790> of<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:58.090> smart

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
I suspect maybe one of you smart

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.270 
I suspect maybe one of you smart
internet<00:01:58.960> people<00:01:59.260> can<00:01:59.440> tell<00:01:59.890> me<00:02:00.010> what<00:02:00.160> I'm

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
internet people can tell me what I'm

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.580 
internet people can tell me what I'm
doing<00:02:00.310> wrong
