00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.760 
show the animation for reloading which
is<00:01:39.299> pretty<00:01:39.450> cool<00:01:39.659> another<00:01:40.259> thing<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> notice

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
is pretty cool another thing to notice

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.450 
is pretty cool another thing to notice
is<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:42.479> victim<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.950> yeah<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> range

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
is all my first victim so yeah the range

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.550 
is all my first victim so yeah the range
is<00:01:44.610> fairly<00:01:44.790> good<00:01:45.119> I'm<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.229> me<00:01:46.380> doing

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
is fairly good I'm you can see me doing

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.429 
is fairly good I'm you can see me doing
an<00:01:46.740> animation<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:48.630> fire<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> weapon

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
an animation here if I fire the weapon

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
an animation here if I fire the weapon
and<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:50.280> doing<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.579> animation<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.270> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and it's doing the animation I do a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.630 
and it's doing the animation I do a
barrel<00:01:51.689> roll<00:01:51.950> it's<00:01:52.950> actually<00:01:53.310> going<00:01:53.490> to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
barrel roll it's actually going to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
barrel roll it's actually going to
really<00:01:53.880> start<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> animation<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.560> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
really start the animation so you know I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.170 
really start the animation so you know I
thought<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> could<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.369> clever<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.759> kind<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
thought I could be clever and kind of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.719 
thought I could be clever and kind of
role<00:01:57.689> while<00:01:57.990> I'm<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.500> reload<00:01:58.979> turns<00:01:59.610> out

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
role while I'm in it to reload turns out

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.819 
role while I'm in it to reload turns out
you<00:01:59.850> can't<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.780> yeah<00:02:01.409> let's<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:01.770> how

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
you can't do that so yeah let's see how

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.780 
you can't do that so yeah let's see how
far<00:02:02.009> away<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.340> guy<00:02:02.490> i<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.700> go<00:02:02.820> 0<00:02:03.619> nope<00:02:04.729> it's<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
far away this guy i can go 0 nope it's a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.940 
far away this guy i can go 0 nope it's a
really<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.570> consistent<00:02:07.259> weapon<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.680> mean<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
really like consistent weapon I mean the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.290 
really like consistent weapon I mean the
reload<00:02:08.310> time<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> little<00:02:09.060> bit<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
reload time was a little bit of a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.350 
reload time was a little bit of a
nightmare<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.440> um<00:02:10.619> yeah<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.670> pretty<00:02:12.150> good

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
nightmare but um yeah it's pretty good

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.110 
nightmare but um yeah it's pretty good
so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
so

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.690 
so
oh<00:02:13.150> yeah<00:02:13.720> show<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.440> RPG<00:02:15.099> i<00:02:15.129> will<00:02:15.430> be<00:02:15.549> showing

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
oh yeah show the RPG i will be showing

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.970 
oh yeah show the RPG i will be showing
it<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.090> at<00:02:16.299> night<00:02:16.599> time<00:02:16.870> but<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:17.769> so<00:02:17.920> you

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
it to you at night time but just so you

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.410 
it to you at night time but just so you
know<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:19.420> does<00:02:19.690> blow<00:02:19.870> up<00:02:20.049> vehicles<00:02:22.470> sometimes

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
know it does blow up vehicles sometimes

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
know it does blow up vehicles sometimes
it's<00:02:25.420> really<00:02:25.629> quite<00:02:26.110> temperamental

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
it's really quite temperamental

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.649 
it's really quite temperamental
sometimes<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.580> blows<00:02:27.640> up<00:02:27.849> vehicle<00:02:28.209> sometimes

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
sometimes it blows up vehicle sometimes

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.380 
sometimes it blows up vehicle sometimes
it<00:02:28.810> doesn't<00:02:29.200> see<00:02:29.769> if<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:29.980> can<00:02:30.099> look<00:02:30.310> there<00:02:31.090> we<00:02:31.269> go

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
it doesn't see if I can look there we go

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.530 
it doesn't see if I can look there we go
so<00:02:31.780> blow<00:02:32.049> up<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.319> cop<00:02:32.500> car<00:02:33.209> doesn't<00:02:34.209> always

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
so blow up the cop car doesn't always

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.050 
so blow up the cop car doesn't always
blow<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:35.049> everything<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:36.099> think<00:02:36.579> it<00:02:36.670> depends<00:02:36.909> on

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
blow up everything I think it depends on

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.880 
blow up everything I think it depends on
the<00:02:37.150> angle<00:02:37.299> you<00:02:37.599> shoot<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.930> as<00:02:38.019> well<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.709> just

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
the angle you shoot it as well it just

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.649 
the angle you shoot it as well it just
leaves<00:02:39.099> like<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.370> flame<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.000> then<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.239> think<00:02:40.569> it

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
leaves like a flame and then I think it

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.280 
leaves like a flame and then I think it
blows<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.959> up<00:02:41.049> so<00:02:41.290> yeah<00:02:42.690> all<00:02:43.690> right<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.959> think

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
blows it up so yeah all right I think

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.770 
blows it up so yeah all right I think
well<00:02:44.379> I<00:02:44.409> need<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.709> do<00:02:44.799> is<00:02:45.030> switch<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.299> nighttime

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
well I need to do is switch to nighttime

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.050 
well I need to do is switch to nighttime
