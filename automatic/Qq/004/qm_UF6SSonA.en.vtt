we record all the road killed snakes we

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.970 
we record all the road killed snakes we
find<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.940> all<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.150> live<00:03:37.540> snakes<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:38.440> find<00:03:38.680> so

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
here's a small road killed brown snake

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.370 
here's a small road killed brown snake
so<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.900> got<00:03:43.900> record<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.440> date<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:44.950> time

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
so I got record the date and the time

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.170 
so I got record the date and the time
species<00:03:47.380> it's<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.739> brown<00:03:47.889> snake<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.940> I've<00:03:51.940> got

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
species it's a brown snake and I've got

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.840 
species it's a brown snake and I've got
a<00:03:52.209> GPS<00:03:52.690> unit<00:03:52.720> here<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.530> can<00:03:53.650> record<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.489> so

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
a GPS unit here so I can record that so

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.690 
a GPS unit here so I can record that so
we<00:03:55.060> can<00:03:55.239> map<00:03:55.480> where<00:03:56.049> exactly<00:03:56.549> along<00:03:57.549> the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
we can map where exactly along the

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.819 
we can map where exactly along the
roadway<00:03:58.090> these<00:03:58.410> roadkill's<00:03:59.410> are<00:03:59.530> taking

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
roadway these roadkill's are taking

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.399 
roadway these roadkill's are taking
place<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:01.360> we<00:04:01.540> can<00:04:01.720> locate<00:04:01.870> where<00:04:02.290> the

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
place and we can locate where the

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.770 
place and we can locate where the
hotspots<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:03.189> activity<00:04:03.700> are

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
hotspots of activity are

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.920 
hotspots of activity are
and<00:04:05.780> just<00:04:06.740> so<00:04:06.890> we<00:04:07.040> don't<00:04:07.360> double<00:04:08.360> count<00:04:08.540> these

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
and just so we don't double count these

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.010 
and just so we don't double count these
guys<00:04:09.670> we<00:04:10.670> remove<00:04:11.120> them<00:04:11.300> from<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.630> road<00:04:11.780> so

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
guys we remove them from the road so

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.990 
guys we remove them from the road so
that<00:04:12.170> tomorrow<00:04:12.470> when<00:04:12.740> we<00:04:12.830> come<00:04:13.040> back<00:04:13.220> we're

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
that tomorrow when we come back we're

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.380 
that tomorrow when we come back we're
not<00:04:14.030> double<00:04:14.630> counting<00:04:14.960> the<00:04:15.050> same<00:04:15.260> snakes<00:04:16.390> so

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
this pavement retains heat from the day

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.580 
this pavement retains heat from the day
and<00:04:41.330> now<00:04:41.420> that<00:04:41.570> it's<00:04:41.690> cooling<00:04:42.050> off<00:04:42.170> at<00:04:42.380> night

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
and now that it's cooling off at night

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.560 
and now that it's cooling off at night
these<00:04:42.800> guys<00:04:43.070> get<00:04:43.880> onto<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.180> road<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.390> they

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
these guys get onto the road and they

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.840 
these guys get onto the road and they
just<00:04:44.750> want<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.050> bask<00:04:45.230> here<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.340> soak<00:04:46.730> up

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
just want to bask here and and soak up

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.720 
just want to bask here and and soak up
the<00:04:47.000> heat<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:47.540> that's<00:04:48.500> when<00:04:48.770> they<00:04:48.920> get<00:04:49.520> run

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
the heat so that's when they get run

00:04:49.730 --> 00:05:05.570 
the heat so that's when they get run
over

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.080 

it's<00:05:06.180> been<00:05:06.449> interesting<00:05:06.720> we've<00:05:07.050> seen<00:05:07.439> a<00:05:08.090> great

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
it's been interesting we've seen a great

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.390 
it's been interesting we've seen a great
reduction<00:05:09.569> in<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.080> numbers<00:05:10.379> of<00:05:10.409> turtles<00:05:11.250> and

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
reduction in the numbers of turtles and

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.119 
reduction in the numbers of turtles and
snakes<00:05:11.580> on<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.180> roads<00:05:12.389> it's<00:05:13.229> hard<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.650> compare

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:14.129 
snakes on the roads it's hard to compare

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:16.700 
snakes on the roads it's hard to compare
one<00:05:14.520> year<00:05:14.789> to<00:05:15.030> another<00:05:15.060> because<00:05:15.810> conditions

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
one year to another because conditions

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.330 
one year to another because conditions
can<00:05:16.949> vary<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:18.060> we<00:05:18.270> have<00:05:18.569> seen<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.409> probably

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
can vary but we have seen I probably

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.510 
can vary but we have seen I probably
between<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.669> 60<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.389> 90<00:05:21.599> percent<00:05:22.259> decrease<00:05:23.069> in

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
between a 60 and 90 percent decrease in

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.850 
between a 60 and 90 percent decrease in
the<00:05:23.580> number<00:05:23.969> of<00:05:24.270> reptiles<00:05:24.870> on<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.620> roads

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
the number of reptiles on the roads

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.679 
the number of reptiles on the roads
within<00:05:26.189> the<00:05:26.490> area<00:05:26.669> that<00:05:27.000> we've<00:05:27.180> built<00:05:27.449> the

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:27.689 
within the area that we've built the

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.920 
within the area that we've built the
barricade<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.759> so<00:05:29.759> it's<00:05:29.939> really<00:05:30.180> exciting<00:05:30.419> we

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
barricade I so it's really exciting we

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.619 
barricade I so it's really exciting we
know<00:05:31.139> from<00:05:31.590> our<00:05:31.919> volunteers<00:05:32.909> we<00:05:33.300> know<00:05:33.419> for<00:05:33.569> the

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
know from our volunteers we know for the

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:35.629 
know from our volunteers we know for the
park<00:05:33.870> staff<00:05:34.139> and<00:05:34.439> from<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.680> monitoring<00:05:35.250> that

park staff and from the monitoring that
the<00:05:35.759> Land<00:05:35.969> Trust<00:05:36.180> is<00:05:36.360> dough<00:05:36.509> itself<00:05:36.569> that<00:05:37.560> it's

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
the Land Trust is dough itself that it's

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.129 
the Land Trust is dough itself that it's
making<00:05:37.919> a<00:05:38.219> big<00:05:38.490> difference<00:05:38.729> and<00:05:39.240> of<00:05:39.960> course

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
making a big difference and of course

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.290 
making a big difference and of course
the<00:05:40.319> other<00:05:40.469> thing<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:40.979> it<00:05:41.550> gets<00:05:41.969> people

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
the other thing is it gets people

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.559 
the other thing is it gets people
talking<00:05:42.509> about<00:05:42.930> what<00:05:43.469> we're<00:05:43.650> doing<00:05:43.710> and<00:05:44.240> so<00:05:45.240> if

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
talking about what we're doing and so if

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.540 
talking about what we're doing and so if
people<00:05:46.139> are<00:05:46.349> in<00:05:46.469> the<00:05:46.560> habit<00:05:46.740> when<00:05:47.099> they<00:05:47.190> visit

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
people are in the habit when they visit

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.740 
people are in the habit when they visit
the<00:05:47.580> park<00:05:47.969> I<00:05:48.620> being<00:05:49.620> extra<00:05:49.919> watchful<00:05:50.159> for
