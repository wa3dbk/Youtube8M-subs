00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.870
 let's calculate the integral of de xis 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.700
 game d esquadra 25 the first thing that one 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.670
 think when you see this integral is 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.400
 use this formula the formula 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.710
 relative to the Neperian logarithm 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.449
 for this you have to have the derivative 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.449
 of the denominator in the numerator 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.570
 or almost in case it's almost me 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.029
 missing only mean constant 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.310
 because as we know the constants 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.200
 can enter and exit the integral 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.360
 when they are multiplying 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.760
 what you can not do is when something 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.850
 We constantly varies the x no 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.940
 can be taken out or put inside 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.100
 the integral gladly our case 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.430
 what is the derivative of the denominator the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.240
 derived from the denominator x4 plus 25 its 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.540
 2x derivatives 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.810
 I need 2x in the numerator but what 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.450
 it happens that I can put the 2 but what 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.260
 I do with the X as I put it could 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.900
 put X and 1 match for X to 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.240
 the 2 would put a half a half with the 2 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.050
 a game of kiss with x would be canceled 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.300
 is cancelled 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.700
 up there perfect in a medium I could 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.530
 take out that bothers me however 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.540
 the 1 match that also bothers me 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.880
 can not get it out 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.830
 what that means is that none 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.950
 in the ways I can get the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.050
 derived within the integral that what 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.000
 what it means is that the formula that I have 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.000
 tried to apply is not the right one 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.710
 Searching between integral formulas 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.620
 we see that there is also one of a 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.110
 fraction there is one with a root in the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.180
 denominator here we do not have roots that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.330
 it does not matter but there is one that is this 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.330
 here 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.230
 we try to apply this first thing in the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.810
 denominator I need a 1 after and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.420
 we will look for this square 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.970
 to have a 1 here in the denominator 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.690
 we have a 25 loose 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.090
 what we are going to do is divide by 25 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.630
 the denominator but of course if you divide by 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.410
 25 the denominator you will also have to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.920
 divide by 25 the numerator or what is 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.470
 the same multiply by 1 game 25 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.690
 this 1 game 25 the first for the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.400
 we take out the numbers can come out 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.989
 without problems of the integral 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.970
 and now here 25 match 25 one plus x 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.500
 25 split square applied to the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.030
 commutative property to change the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.060
 order 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.000
 as a tactic of the sum I have the 1 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.820
 now I need a square here 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.740
 but here I have a square of a 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.190
 numerator of a fraction and I need that 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.090
 this is a square I want that to be 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.569
 a square 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.560
 how can I express what we have 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.560
 there as a square 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.780
 that I have to put in here to 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.730
 get x 4 match of 25 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.530
 as a square of a fraction is the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.300
 square of the party numerator 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.940
 square the denominator would have to 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.319
 put in the numerator an x raised to 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.990
 square is x equator that is what 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.290
 I have here below to lele for 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.459
 square get 25 clearly would have 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.459
 what to put a 5 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.710
 we copied the 1 game 25 that we drag 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.870
 all the time 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.350
 now I have the denominator as desire 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.540
 1 plus a square 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.730
 let's note that to apply the formula 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.050
 that which is squared above has 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.050
 to be the derivative 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.230
 which is the derivative of that which is 4 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.750
 what is the derivative of x match 5 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:16.570
 the derivative of x match 5x split 5 lo 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:18.519
 same with 5ยบ xx and the derivative a 5th xx 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.599
 is a fifth by the derivative of x that is 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.340
 one 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.340
 denominator we copy it equally 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.330
 now up I need a fifth what 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.670
 we put on the face 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.800
 I keep that of x this one 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.540
 but of course as a post by a fifth 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.150
 the face I have to compensate 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.800
 I put 5 because 5 for a fifth is 1 and 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.800
 this is as if I had not put anything 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.980
 and now for the derivative is this what 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.040
 I need 5, I have 5, I got it 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.480
 outside the 5 it comes out multiplying me 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.880
 would be 1 match 25 x 5 and now 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.480
 inside I would be a fifth of x that 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.590
 is the derivative of what is inside the 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:14.050
 square 1 + x fifth squared 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:16.690
 we repeat 11 more t squared this to the 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.550
 square the derivative of t of x fifths 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.650
 a fifth that we have it we can apply 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:26.139
 the formula but before 1 game 25 for 5 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.020
 would be 5 match 25 which is a fifth 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.520
 the formula was applied here the t is what 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.940
 is squared in the derivative 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.740
 is up this would be tangent arc of 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.340
 what is squared by x 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.669
 fifth 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.669
 plus 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.539
 and from here you can not do anything else 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.979
 this would then be the result of the 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.979
 integral
