00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello in touch elder xiv in this 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.320
 video tutorial i would like to tell you about 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.480
 Such a program is a very good program 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.430
 if for example you forgot your password to enter 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.760
 the computer we do as follows 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:26.189
 then Iâ€™ll show you the type 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.160
 password I put this program so 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.149
 lay out under the video lessons this image 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.110
 program download and burn to a disc at 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:42.149
 I have this CD-R drive already written in 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.480
 computer importance write it down so 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.620
 shows write will not I think 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.620
 you can do it 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.629
 the program works with all 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.699
 windows xp operating systems 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:08.149
 windows 7 7 of 8 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:10.340
 personally tested experimenting means 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:16.119
 We will see me sometimes water will 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:21.880
 here is such a mutation wrong password yes 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.880
 all types forgot before rebooting 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:39.800
 we go in bios still fingers and went in yet 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:44.810
 if so here I went to the bios key 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.400
 del and choose sit 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.130
 this program can be recorded on 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.610
 USB flash drive anywhere 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.440
 disk 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.210
 it is advisable to write sit on because 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.210
 that some drives just do not read 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 9 no ruler old computers 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:36.010
 I went to download 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:39.500
 what is not the key to press the download went 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.230
 Now I will show that there is a video when instead 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.239
 sometimes union was type 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.870
 we have not forgotten something just for you 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:54.129
 we show a very convenient father's program 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.129
 write to disk via ultraiso or 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.129
 fair 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.460
 such a boot program 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.810
 works with absolutely everyone 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.810
 operating systems 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.440
 recently windows 8 tested without problems 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.540
 sometimes drops 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.270
 like that is up to with bras that is now 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:31.709
 it will load for any your ask 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:35.340
 for example there edinichku any there 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:40.650
 sometimes ask now this kind of me 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.739
 for example the password there is 1986 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.620
 I'll just put it there now 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.500
 one and all 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.810
 Anyone can put it and will be entering 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.730
 our computer and then it will be possible 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.250
 control panel change so here it is 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:02.040
 the program is called it by skype so 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.590
 times from windows passe and reset 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:14.720
 choose Russian language nothing with them 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:14.720
 push further further so so so 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.859
 what does it mean that we choose here in 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.859
 principle 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.800
 Well, in principle, choose your name 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.840
 computer if the name you do not know you can 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.770
 with everyone 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.560
 to experiment will no longer have 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.479
 I am exactly an example I have that is 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.020
 just see your computer name 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.690

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:52.690
 yes, under my unit, I click on 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:58.720
 do not change anything here and put for example 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.199
 yedinichku press the reset push with 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:07.139
 wife 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:07.139
 we press the safe and all we press the exit 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.120
 drive principle i can already pull out 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.250
 here the computer restarts 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.770
 drives removed 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.740
 disappear I enter which I invented 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.390

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.640
 or rather who asked this program 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:58.640
 I press enter as you see my 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.530

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.330
 I came up with this program she Unit 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.330
 You can plow out three twos and 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.340
 now as we see yes we went 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.280
 and now in the panel go to the panel 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:20.090
 control you can now come in after giving 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:29.770

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.960
 that i don't need 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.920
 current password requires i.e. one 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.270
