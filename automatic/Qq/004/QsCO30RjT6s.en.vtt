00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
constant basis I was around a 3 and I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.509 
constant basis I was around a 3 and I
get<00:02:57.090> spiked<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.900> got<00:02:58.139> spikes<00:02:58.440> yesterday<00:02:59.190> up<00:02:59.340> to

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.210 
get spiked I got spikes yesterday up to
about<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> level<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.269> 9<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.380> think<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.950> don't

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
about a level of 9 and I think I don't
