hook<00:00:30.860> exposed

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950 

basically<00:00:35.440> just<00:00:35.560> hold<00:00:36.100> my<00:00:36.390> head<00:00:37.390> here<00:00:37.780> and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
basically just hold my head here and

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.590 
basically just hold my head here and
just<00:00:38.220> take<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:39.430> hook<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:39.850> put<00:00:40.270> it<00:00:40.390> in<00:00:40.510> the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
just take the hook and put it in the

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.790 
just take the hook and put it in the
center<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.080> grub<00:00:41.820> push<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:43.000> about<00:00:43.800> halfway

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
center of the grub push it about halfway

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.650 
center of the grub push it about halfway
to<00:00:45.160> maybe<00:00:45.580> a<00:00:45.640> little<00:00:45.760> over<00:00:45.970> halfway<00:00:46.210> down<00:00:46.510> the

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
to maybe a little over halfway down the

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.110 
to maybe a little over halfway down the
grub<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:47.590> then<00:00:47.860> just<00:00:48.070> push<00:00:48.340> it<00:00:48.490> up<00:00:48.640> on<00:00:48.910> the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
grub and then just push it up on the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.099 
grub and then just push it up on the
head<00:00:49.840> itself<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
head itself and

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.369 
head itself and
and<00:00:52.350> there<00:00:52.620> did<00:00:53.809> get<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.839> little<00:00:55.079> straighter

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and there did get a little straighter

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.210 
and there did get a little straighter
out<00:00:55.649> here

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.280 

basically<00:00:58.910> just<00:00:59.000> regroup<00:00:59.720> like<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.140> would

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
basically just regroup like that would

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.440 
basically just regroup like that would
put<00:01:00.440> expose<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.370> you<00:01:01.489> can<00:01:01.640> swim<00:01:02.060> that<00:01:02.270> through

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
put expose and you can swim that through

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.860 
put expose and you can swim that through
the<00:01:02.510> water

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
the water

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.830 
the water
now<00:01:03.559> with<00:01:03.710> this<00:01:03.800> regular<00:01:04.250> slider<00:01:05.000> head<00:01:05.360> been

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
now with this regular slider head been

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.260 
now with this regular slider head been
flat<00:01:06.260> like<00:01:06.470> that<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.430> always<00:01:07.670> runs<00:01:08.000> real

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
flat like that it's always runs real

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.870 
flat like that it's always runs real
true<00:01:08.630> in<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.960> water<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.950> doesn't<00:01:10.340> roll<00:01:10.520> with

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
true in the water it doesn't roll with

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.609 
true in the water it doesn't roll with
you<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.360> always<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.930> hook<00:01:12.080> is<00:01:12.229> always

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
you and always the hook is always

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.370 
you and always the hook is always
upright<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.490> being<00:01:14.090> flat<00:01:14.420> -<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:14.900> also<00:01:15.050> has<00:01:15.350> a

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
upright and being flat - that also has a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.930 
upright and being flat - that also has a
little<00:01:15.740> slower<00:01:15.979> fall<00:01:16.340> through<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.729> water

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
little slower fall through the water

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.749 
little slower fall through the water
which<00:01:17.210> sometimes<00:01:17.840> triggers<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.380> fish<00:01:18.759> but

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
which sometimes triggers the fish but

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.810 
which sometimes triggers the fish but
why<00:01:20.450> don't<00:01:20.509> you<00:01:20.720> show<00:01:20.930> me<00:01:21.590> how<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:21.890> read<00:01:22.190> you

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
and biology head to 1/16 ounces the size

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.690 
and biology head to 1/16 ounces the size
that<00:01:28.910> I<00:01:29.000> love<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.420> use<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.259> what<00:01:30.470> I<00:01:30.500> do<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:31.550> I'll

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.100 
the hook is straight up and I take the
slider<00:01:36.649> grub<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.300> if<00:01:38.300> you'll<00:01:38.479> notice<00:01:38.570> on<00:01:38.990> the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.670 
short side of that paddle tightening
I'll<00:01:43.310> turn<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.820> short<00:01:44.149> side<00:01:44.420> which<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:44.990> with

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
I'll turn the short side which is with

I'll turn the short side which is with
most<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.580> paddle<00:01:46.940> away<00:01:47.149> from<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.539> hook

most of the paddle away from the hook
turn<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.680> short<00:01:48.920> side<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.550> I'll<00:01:50.149> put<00:01:50.360> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
turn the short side and I'll put that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.749 
turn the short side and I'll put that
right<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.840> center<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:51.410> and<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.070> like<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.369> put

right the center of it and I like to put
it<00:01:52.850> on<00:01:52.970> there<00:01:53.149> until<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.509> starts<00:01:53.810> curling

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
it on there until it starts curling

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.100 
it on there until it starts curling
around<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.770> hook<00:01:54.950> just<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.340> little<00:01:55.580> bit<00:01:56.110> then

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
around the hook just a little bit then

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.900 
around the hook just a little bit then
I'll<00:01:57.229> bring<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.679> up<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.039> then<00:01:58.399> just<00:01:58.580> push<00:01:58.759> it

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
I'll bring it up and then just push it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.880 
I'll bring it up and then just push it
right<00:01:58.940> up<00:01:59.240> on<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.509> barb<00:01:59.780> of<00:01:59.899> that<00:02:00.050> jig<00:02:00.320> head

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.990 

there<00:02:03.890> you<00:02:04.009> have<00:02:04.189> it

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
there you have it

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.090 
there you have it
just<00:02:05.150> like<00:02:05.330> so<00:02:05.810> we<00:02:05.990> swim<00:02:06.380> -<00:02:06.590> well<00:02:06.800> that's<00:02:07.040> very

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
just like so we swim - well that's very

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.529 
just like so we swim - well that's very
swim<00:02:07.490> through<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.760> water<00:02:07.790> now<00:02:08.179> once<00:02:08.390> again

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
swim through the water now once again

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.950 
swim through the water now once again
that's<00:02:08.810> not<00:02:09.020> weightless<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:10.250> for<00:02:11.240> fishing

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
that's not weightless but for fishing

ways of fishing but this technique works
for<00:02:36.680> me<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.070> I<00:02:37.160> know<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.400> weedless<00:02:37.760> technique

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
for me and I know the weedless technique

both<00:02:43.070> ways<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.610> know<00:02:43.810> open<00:02:44.810> water<00:02:45.020> I'll

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
both ways you know open water I'll

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.470 
both ways you know open water I'll
switch<00:02:45.470> one<00:02:45.770> open<00:02:46.220> hook<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.880> swimming<00:02:47.239> along

switch one open hook and swimming along
but<00:02:48.170> if<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.380> get<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.920> place<00:02:49.160> where<00:02:49.340> I've<00:02:49.430> got

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
but if I get the place where I've got

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.790 
but if I get the place where I've got
some<00:02:49.880> structure<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.600> can<00:02:50.720> actually<00:02:50.959> see<00:02:51.440> or<00:02:51.680> be

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
some structure I can actually see or be

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.430 
some structure I can actually see or be
on<00:02:51.920> top<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.190> I'll<00:02:52.940> switch<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.300> my<00:02:53.480> weedless<00:02:54.260> and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
on top of I'll switch to my weedless and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:03.670 
on top of I'll switch to my weedless and
maybe<00:02:54.590> use<00:02:54.830> it

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680
