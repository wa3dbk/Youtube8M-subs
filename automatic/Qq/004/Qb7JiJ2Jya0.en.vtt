00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.360
 well today we are going to change the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.210
 touch of a generic 7-inch tablet 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.320
 inches a Chinese tablet this 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.790
 configuration comes in different brands 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 touch me to run the tablets 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.320
 AragÃ³n to operate some tablets 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.199
 that they have in this part 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.300
 they come with the name of samsung and it comes 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.670
 for different tablet references 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.280
 in smart pc all are the same tablet 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.250
 then let's start first 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.820
 let's verify that the screen 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.200
 if it works well 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.200
 why we pay 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.600
 uncover the tablet 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.880
 Y 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.220
 to work comfortably is better 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.480
 remove the speaker 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.820
 and place it on the screen 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.240
 we disconnect to car data bus from the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.240
 tablet 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.540
 and ready 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.890
 we follow him 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.640
 and we use a heat gun 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.860
 we put it in a voltage of 600 is the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.369
 first level there are some people that 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.400
 they use the heat if you do not take 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.850
 directly and this is a bit dangerous 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.060
 because they can damage the can damage the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.920
 screen then you just have to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 apply heat 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.060
 on the black border 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.520
 do not leave it on a single point because 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.050
 can this can cause the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.320
 frame and the tablet 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.060
 or it can also cause the screen 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.250
 it hurt us 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.770
 the glue that comes then is not a 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.260
 very strong adhesive then it's not like 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.380
 a tablet brand a samsung tablet 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.190
 again he says he comes with enough 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.190
 Elegant 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.410
 we raise an eyelash 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.300
 and not to damage the screen 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.470
 we only use a card that does not 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.240
 it's going to scratch 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.240
 the screen of the tablet 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.800
 now we use a piece of them 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.680
 you can find it in our 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.640
 website as a touch tablet for 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.640
 Chinese tablet 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.370
 it's 7-inch touch right the same 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.060
 connector 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.060
 ready 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.080
 we remove the tapes this comes with 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.210
 some come with some stickers if not 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.350
 comes with the stickers we use 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.350
 sitting phase 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.360
 although the adhesive that these bring 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.069
 tablets is 3m is much better than the one 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.069
 let's find in the tape where are you going 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.780
 ready since our tablet is with its 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.780
 new touch 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.780
 connect 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.670
 we turn on the tablet again 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.000
 these tablets because they are a little bit 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.639
 slow on the ignition in the system 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.550
 operative but as they realize it is 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.400
 something very fast we have available 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.540
