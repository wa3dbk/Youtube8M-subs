00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.630
 I want to thank you for that 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.880
 Over 4,000 loyal subscribers of yours 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.629
 for my youtube channel 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.269
 that's awesome cool and that would have been great 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.910
 I never thought when I back then 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:41.780
 in october 2012 started with it 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.900
 and that motivates me new ones as well 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.269
 to make videos so I'm still on 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.870

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.390
 the next topic is lord of the rings and 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.650
 Although I often asked if you 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.229
 I do not even something for the Lord 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.690
 can make rings 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.390
 because I have so far always said yes 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.530
 no time and whatever i wanted 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.030
 tell you in any case that I am one 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.880
 great fan of lord of the rings 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:22.760
 these are the three books here 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.700
 the two towers and the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.300
 repeating the king of course I 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.790
 all read already relatively early 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.610

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.510

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:48.830
 the cool gollum in it 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:52.070
 and then I did have it though 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.490
 sometime when the movie came out here 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.740
 these figures collected like atlas verlag 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.840
 or something and how do I have that 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.180
 missed then unsubscribe 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.380
 they are already relatively dusty 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.780

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.039
 I relatively much of that come here 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.629
 is now first the community of 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.629
 around our photo 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:33.540
 the american standard of the gray at that time 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:34.970
 still strings was agony with the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.600
 hew 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.800
 Of course, Legolas has the l giving 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.880
 somehow promote his second hand 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.630
 why I do not have it anymore 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.800
 probably sucked in and 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:54.570
 those are pretty cool model that is 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:03:02.330
 then may the white we believe I can 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:04.320
 Engaging in Helms Klamm's battle 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.590
 I definitely have the cool one here 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:14.400
 models have also, among other things 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:21.450
 roman player here then the ring 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:23.670
 ghosts untouched and brits and still 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.040
 various ochs here among others the one 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.209
 Battle Scene 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:35.610
 I think he is shooting under construction 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:36.840
 I shoot somewhere to just the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.920
 case I have a whole new figures 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.180
 I have a lot more 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.850
 I do not show them all now 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.690
 what i am doing i still came 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.540
 not because that herdering tabletop 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.820
 to try to play 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.170
 and yes I have been asked many times already 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.930
 if I do not have any video anymore 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.040
 At the moment I can not do it because 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.130
 i just do not have the time i have 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.480
 after that the rings still super cool 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:06.239
 and that's why I recommend you now 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.770
 It can only be cool with the lord of the 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.870
 rings table top game and probably 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.200
 also the hobbit theme topspiel deal 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.680
 and it is htl the channel 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.190
 youtube 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.820
 that is the hobbit table top league 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.150
 that is from so the channel is from the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.040
 goalie 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.620
 from the team and daniel and many 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.450
 other friends created by those 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.550
 So the videos of those produced 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.610
 and there it is completely around the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.070
 hobby the lord of the rings the table top 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.700
 play and we do a lot 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.230
 make game reports 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.080
 they put the army before the individual 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.680
 peoples and inform so also about the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.500

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.910
 infos when new tournaments are and so on 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.170

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.790

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.940
 So it may be that I have games 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.670

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.540

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.890
