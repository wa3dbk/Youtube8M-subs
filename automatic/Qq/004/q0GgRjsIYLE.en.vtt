00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
gonna look like eventually that's the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.830 
gonna look like eventually that's the
test<00:01:54.479> tube<00:01:54.630> itself<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.759> see<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> back<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
test tube itself and see in the back you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.179 
test tube itself and see in the back you
got<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> big<00:01:58.229> test<00:01:58.409> tube<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.950> there's<00:01:59.070> just

like<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> weird<00:02:00.119> alien<00:02:00.509> embryo<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
like a weird alien embryo in there and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.649 
like a weird alien embryo in there and
here<00:02:02.399> are<00:02:02.520> some<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.700> some<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> different
