the<00:00:01.140> pipe<00:00:01.319> takeoff<00:00:01.740> tab<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.280> where<00:00:02.429> we<00:00:02.580> enter

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
the pipe takeoff tab is where we enter

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.640 
the pipe takeoff tab is where we enter
in<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.060> length<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.540> pipe<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.200> number<00:00:04.500> of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650

drawing number and floor in this

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.080 
drawing number and floor in this
estimate<00:00:10.469> but<00:00:11.309> they<00:00:11.400> can<00:00:11.580> be<00:00:11.670> named<00:00:11.880> whatever

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
estimate but they can be named whatever

you<00:00:12.330> need<00:00:12.830> for<00:00:13.830> example<00:00:14.340> if<00:00:14.519> you're<00:00:14.670> doing<00:00:14.700> an

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
you need for example if you're doing an

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.019 
you need for example if you're doing an
isometric<00:00:15.660> takeoff<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.410> may<00:00:17.070> name<00:00:17.250> them<00:00:17.490> ISO

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
isometric takeoff you may name them ISO

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.260 
isometric takeoff you may name them ISO
and<00:00:18.300> line<00:00:18.480> number<00:00:18.949> basically<00:00:19.949> these<00:00:20.760> columns

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
and line number basically these columns

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.910 
and line number basically these columns
allow<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.720> keep<00:00:21.900> track<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.410> your<00:00:22.529> takeoff

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
allow you to keep track of your takeoff

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.370 
allow you to keep track of your takeoff
and<00:00:23.250> when<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.240> get<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> reports<00:00:24.960> section

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and when we get to the reports section

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500 
and when we get to the reports section
of<00:00:25.470> Mike<00:00:25.710> you'll<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.609> able<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.910> run<00:00:27.029> reports

based<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:28.019> these<00:00:28.109> columns<00:00:28.670> we<00:00:29.670> could<00:00:29.880> for

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
based on these columns we could for

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.179 
based on these columns we could for
example<00:00:30.119> print<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> bill<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> material<00:00:32.070> by

enter<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.910> system<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> pipe<00:00:39.809> size

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
enter in the system and the pipe size

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.520 
enter in the system and the pipe size
and<00:00:40.410> we'll<00:00:41.280> leave<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> thickness<00:00:41.969> blank

and we'll leave the thickness blank

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
and we'll leave the thickness blank
because<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.829> set<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> thickness<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.640> already

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.130 
many to cover in this demo so I'll talk
about<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.500> most<00:04:10.650> common<00:04:10.800> ones<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.930> Bill<00:04:13.110> of

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
about the most common ones the Bill of

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.560 
about the most common ones the Bill of
material<00:04:13.680> report<00:04:14.070> prints<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.850> list<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.269> all<00:04:15.420> of

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
material report prints a list of all of

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.810 
material report prints a list of all of
the<00:04:15.690> materials<00:04:16.200> required<00:04:16.680> in<00:04:17.040> this<00:04:17.250> estimate

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
the materials required in this estimate

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.570 
the materials required in this estimate
and<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.290> option<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.680> subtotal<00:04:20.459> it

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
and you have the option to subtotal it

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.690 
and you have the option to subtotal it
by<00:04:21.180> various<00:04:21.570> items<00:04:21.989> for<00:04:22.740> example<00:04:22.770> if<00:04:23.520> I

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
by various items for example if I

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.420 
by various items for example if I
selected<00:04:24.180> sub<00:04:24.450> area<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.990> would<00:04:25.770> get<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.070> bill<00:04:26.310> of

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
selected sub area I would get a bill of

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.260 
selected sub area I would get a bill of
material<00:04:27.000> for

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
material for

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.260 
material for
floor<00:04:27.660> in<00:04:27.810> this<00:04:27.930> estimate<00:04:28.500> or<00:04:29.310> select<00:04:29.729> system

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
floor in this estimate or select system

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.770 
floor in this estimate or select system
for<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.840> bill<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.169> material<00:04:31.650> for<00:04:31.770> each<00:04:31.830> system

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
for a bill of material for each system

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.570 
for a bill of material for each system
this<00:04:33.780> can<00:04:33.990> be<00:04:34.110> very<00:04:34.289> useful<00:04:34.349> if<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.340> need<00:04:35.520> to

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
this can be very useful if you need to

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.689 
this can be very useful if you need to
stage<00:04:35.879> out<00:04:36.120> materials<00:04:36.659> to<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.960> jobsite<00:04:37.699> I'll

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
stage out materials to the jobsite I'll

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.420 
stage out materials to the jobsite I'll
leave<00:04:38.970> them<00:04:39.150> set<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.509> no<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:40.440> generate<00:04:40.949> a<00:04:40.979> total

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
leave them set to no to generate a total

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.710 
leave them set to no to generate a total
bill<00:04:41.699> of<00:04:41.819> material<00:04:42.330> for<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.629> estimate<00:04:44.720> the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
bill of material for the estimate the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.899 
bill of material for the estimate the

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
unit price report gives you the sell

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.659 
unit price report gives you the sell
price<00:04:48.210> for<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.930> foot<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.289> pipe<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:50.430> sell

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669
