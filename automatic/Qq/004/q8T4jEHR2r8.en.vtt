we'll just run the exe file and of

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.270 
we'll just run the exe file and of
course<00:02:26.900> we<00:02:27.319> want<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.530> browse<00:02:27.830> for<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
course we want to browse for the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.820 
course we want to browse for the
firmware<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.599> always<00:02:30.230> say<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.500> save

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830

everything to the desktop of course ok

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.140 
everything to the desktop of course ok
so<00:02:39.590> once<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:40.040> recognized<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:40.819> can<00:02:41.000> move

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
so once it's recognized it we can move

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.580 
so once it's recognized it we can move
on<00:02:44.739> ok<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.280> will<00:02:46.700> change<00:02:47.440> depending<00:02:48.440> on

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
on ok and this will change depending on
