what do you remember or know about the

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.560

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
naked female teacher swimming scene it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.660 
naked female teacher swimming scene it
was<00:02:01.750> something<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.049> was<00:02:02.229> added<00:02:02.439> later<00:02:03.159> it

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
was something that was added later it

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.370 
was something that was added later it
wasn't<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.119> original<00:02:04.149> script<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:04.930> had

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
wasn't in the original script that I had

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.420 
wasn't in the original script that I had
written<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.770> think<00:02:05.799> it<00:02:06.040> was<00:02:06.159> something<00:02:06.399> that

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
written I think it was something that

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.660 
written I think it was something that
added<00:02:06.909> that<00:02:07.030> John<00:02:07.390> added<00:02:07.780> kind<00:02:08.019> of<00:02:08.670> through

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
added that John added kind of through

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.539 
added that John added kind of through
pressure<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.569> make<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.739> film<00:02:12.040> sort<00:02:12.459> of

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
pressure to make the the film sort of

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.479 
pressure to make the the film sort of
more<00:02:13.329> I<00:02:13.599> guess<00:02:13.870> exciting<00:02:14.409> because<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.919> think<00:02:15.040> I

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
more I guess exciting because I think I

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.129 
more I guess exciting because I think I
think<00:02:15.969> the<00:02:16.329> studio<00:02:16.659> was<00:02:16.809> a<00:02:16.840> little<00:02:17.049> bit

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:17.139 
think the studio was a little bit

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.860 
think the studio was a little bit
nervous<00:02:17.319> about<00:02:17.529> having

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
nervous about having

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.720 
nervous about having
thing<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.200> was<00:02:20.349> in<00:02:20.590> one<00:02:20.830> location<00:02:21.190> almost

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
thing that was in one location almost

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.800 
thing that was in one location almost
like<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:21.879> play<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:23.440> hadn't<00:02:23.799> really<00:02:23.980> been<00:02:24.010> done

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
like a play it hadn't really been done

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.780 
like a play it hadn't really been done
so<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.840> think<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.830> was<00:02:26.980> kind<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.370> added

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
so I think that that was kind of added

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.479 
so I think that that was kind of added
later<00:02:28.060> for<00:02:28.750> pressure<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.769> know<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.250> kind<00:02:30.459> of

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
later for pressure you know to kind of

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.430 
later for pressure you know to kind of
make<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.670> more<00:02:30.790> alluring<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:31.629> it<00:02:31.930> didn't<00:02:32.200> it

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
make it more alluring and it didn't it

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.600 
make it more alluring and it didn't it
just<00:02:32.620> didn't<00:02:32.830> really<00:02:33.010> fit<00:02:33.220> what<00:02:33.459> do<00:02:33.549> you

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
just didn't really fit what do you

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.830 
just didn't really fit what do you
think's<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.849> more<00:02:34.000> seminal<00:02:34.390> symbol<00:02:34.690> from<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
think's the more seminal symbol from the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.030 
think's the more seminal symbol from the
film<00:02:35.140> if<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.290> were<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.440> sum<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.620> up<00:02:35.739> in<00:02:35.890> one

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
film if you were to sum it up in one

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.259 
film if you were to sum it up in one
hand<00:02:36.310> gesture<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.879> it<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.420> or<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.620> this

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
hand gesture is it this or is it this

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.270 
hand gesture is it this or is it this
