00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.930
 hello this is a tutorial to see how 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.050
 we can modify the animated gif and 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.950
 insert letters inside voucher I have a 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.660
 kit that is this where a child comes out what 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.460
 good that a tree is finished and we are going to 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.280
 put in the middle of the animation the 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.620
 facebook word vale 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.860
 Well we have it then what we do 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:32.390
 we take the gif and take it to the program 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:35.360
 adobe photoshop cs 6 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.790
 we can not modify and here we have it 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.250
 if you look here below, all the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.980
 animations is worth but what are we going to do 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.649
 is to put the word face vale and for that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.510
 we go to the last frame and here in 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.910
 the layers we go to the top of the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.880
 top 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:56.800
 well then once this is done we are going to 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:01.140
 go to the left where is the tea of 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.140
 text and let's put it here the text 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.750
 ok we move it a little bit down here 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.360
 example this area 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.520
 what is the problem that if you look at the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.810
 white is confused with the tree and does not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.360
 see well we are going to put 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.390
 an edge how do we do this as very 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:29.050
 easy we go to the text layer that has 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:32.320
 created a right merge button 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.620
 we click the line and if you notice us 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.370
 it comes out here the stroke in black can be 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.380
 Modify 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.460
 here the color of the stroke but the moment 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.860
 we will leave as is ok 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.590
 so we already have here the good that is 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.780
 see very well what is the problem that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.270
 if you look at another frame, it does not 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 you see well already it looks blank then what 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.009
 we are going to take this option 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 that we have the edges that looks very 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.409
 well here if you notice trace effects 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.070
 we give the right button 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.660
 copy layer style 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.030
 ok and we will select 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.080
 down here among all the little ones 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.480
 frames the first 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.480
 and maculas to pose 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.170
 here again in face right button 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.540
 paste layer style 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.920
 well and so you notice we have 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.920
 in all layers 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.990
 a fake 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.360
 what's going to happen that we want 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.040
 the word appears in the middle with which 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.010
 we will choose the frame that iniesta 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.379
 play still 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.379
 here it has not fallen we are going to overtake 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.170
 and this is where it starts to fall 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.170
 and that 's when the tree sinks 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.650
 here and here already dry 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.230
 here this music 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.790
 then it was and it will appear from the 22 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:11.510
 with which we select is from 21 to 1 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.840
 if you notice you are selected from 21 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.750
 to 1 and we go here to the right where 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.750
 put fail and press on the button to see 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.800
 If we look 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.860
 now he will appear in 2021 nothing and in 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.690
 22 and going to be happy as 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.430
 we look for everything to be right here 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.530
 down we have the timeline you 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.410
 we give to play 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.280
 and you notice us and it's running and just 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.150
 if it falls and the sign appears as 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.560
 we want come on this we have it 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.680
 to keep it as we do 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.610
 save file for web I'm very 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.160
 important 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.100
 and here we will see the animation is 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.430
 very important to have it 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.430
 and of course adaptable 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.430
 diffusion 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.319
 transparency marked without a screen 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.209
 transparency and interlaced this is 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.049
 fundamental has to be in adaptable 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.670
 Transparency transparency marked without a frame 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:26.170
 of transparency and interlaced marking 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.920
 turn that baby also everything and you 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.920
 let's save 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:35.129
 and here we are going to put 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.160
 10 2 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:39.860
 save 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.510
 and we have to have it saved so 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:47.940
 let's go here let's see in 32 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.850
 and if you notice is the child face 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.680
 just what we wanted good 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.270
 well this is the tutorial as you see it is 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.880
 very simple I hope that I have 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.630
 liked 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.630
 and see you
