like<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.170> three<00:00:13.410> main<00:00:13.620> issues<00:00:14.040> are

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
like this and the three main issues are

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.720 
like this and the three main issues are
very<00:00:14.700> simple<00:00:15.030> first<00:00:15.660> off<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.410> ratings<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.550> not

very simple first off the ratings do not

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.000 
very simple first off the ratings do not
translate<00:00:18.359> into<00:00:18.720> on-field<00:00:19.350> performance

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
translate into on-field performance

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.420 
translate into on-field performance
second<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.880> all<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> players<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.840> no

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
concept of procedural awareness they

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.439 
concept of procedural awareness they
don't<00:00:26.279> know<00:00:26.430> where<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.180> field

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and finally there isn't enough

have been a touchdown pass to Shaun

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.209 
have been a touchdown pass to Shaun
right<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.899> again<00:01:00.989> because<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> game<00:01:01.890> lacks

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
right but again because the game lacks

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.250 
right but again because the game lacks
procedural<00:01:02.850> awareness<00:01:03.300> because<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> game

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
procedural awareness because the game

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
procedural awareness because the game
lacks<00:01:04.530> enough<00:01:04.769> animations<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:06.150> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
lacks enough animations and because that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.050 
lacks enough animations and because that
awareness<00:01:06.600> rating<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.680> has<00:01:07.920> no<00:01:08.280> impact<00:01:08.790> on
