00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.970 

when<00:00:01.530> you're<00:00:01.650> practicing<00:00:01.939> for<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.389> piece

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:03.980 
when you're practicing for a piece

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.280 
when you're practicing for a piece
whether<00:00:04.980> it's<00:00:05.130> for<00:00:05.700> your<00:00:05.940> own<00:00:06.150> practice<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:07.259> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
whether it's for your own practice for a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.860 
whether it's for your own practice for a
solo<00:00:07.620> piece<00:00:07.919> or<00:00:08.189> for<00:00:08.460> an<00:00:08.550> orchestra<00:00:08.870> chances

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
solo piece or for an orchestra chances

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.209 
solo piece or for an orchestra chances
are<00:00:10.019> you're<00:00:10.200> going<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.440> encounter<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.950> lot<00:00:11.040> of

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
are you're going to encounter a lot of

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.959 
are you're going to encounter a lot of
difficult<00:00:11.820> sections<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:13.610> they<00:00:14.610> might<00:00:14.820> be

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
difficult sections and they might be

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.330 
difficult sections and they might be
fast<00:00:15.240> sections<00:00:15.690> or<00:00:15.839> slow<00:00:16.139> sections<00:00:16.619> but

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
fast sections or slow sections but

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.090 
fast sections or slow sections but
basically<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:18.180> order<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.600> master<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.109> part

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
basically in order to master the part

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.109 
basically in order to master the part
you<00:00:20.699> would<00:00:20.820> play<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.300> slow<00:00:21.990> at<00:00:22.199> first<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.119> then

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
you would play it slow at first and then

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.849 
you would play it slow at first and then
you'll<00:00:24.420> be<00:00:24.480> able<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> pick<00:00:24.960> up<00:00:24.990> speed<00:00:25.500> once

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you'll be able to pick up speed once

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.189 
you'll be able to pick up speed once
you've<00:00:26.160> mastered<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.760> fingerings<00:00:27.240> so

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
you've mastered the fingerings so

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.169 
you've mastered the fingerings so
basically<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.859> would<00:00:29.099> play<00:00:29.789> through<00:00:30.060> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
basically I would play through this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.069 
basically I would play through this
section<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.430> then<00:00:32.450> there's<00:00:33.450> also<00:00:33.660> different

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
section and then there's also different

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.440 
section and then there's also different
ways<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.829> make<00:00:35.160> sure<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:36.210> learn<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
ways to make sure that you learn the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.590 
ways to make sure that you learn the
piece<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.500> an<00:00:38.250> example<00:00:38.969> I'm<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
piece so as an example I'm just going to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.650 
piece so as an example I'm just going to
play<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:40.079> F<00:00:40.230> scale

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.900 

and<00:00:49.660> another<00:00:50.620> practice<00:00:51.070> technique<00:00:51.579> would<00:00:51.850> be

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
and another practice technique would be

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.020 
and another practice technique would be
to<00:00:52.500> tongue<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.710> passage<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.550> then<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.760> slur

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
to tongue the passage and then a slur

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.450 
to tongue the passage and then a slur
the<00:00:55.059> passage

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.280 

[Music]

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.800 

and<00:01:10.430> then<00:01:11.430> also<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.110> would<00:01:13.340> use<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> metronome<00:01:14.909> so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and then also I would use a metronome so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.710 
and then also I would use a metronome so
you<00:01:16.290> would<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:17.009> able<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.450> electronically<00:01:18.450> be

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
you would be able to electronically be

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.109 
you would be able to electronically be
able<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> tell<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:20.009> speed<00:01:20.460> you're<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
able to tell what speed you're at and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.510 
able to tell what speed you're at and
what<00:01:21.330> speed<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> need<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> work<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.520> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
what speed you need to work up to so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.240 
what speed you need to work up to so
that's<00:01:23.940> one<00:01:24.210> way<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> play<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.320> slow<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.950> then

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that's one way to play it slow and then

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.300 
that's one way to play it slow and then
be<00:01:26.549> able<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.789> work<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.140> desired<00:01:28.770> tempo

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
be able to work up to the desired tempo

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.810 
be able to work up to the desired tempo
and<00:01:29.580> then<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.530> last<00:01:31.740> thing<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.280> say<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and then the last thing I would say is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.789 
and then the last thing I would say is
if<00:01:33.600> you're<00:01:33.810> trying<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.140> learn<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> difficult

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
if you're trying to learn a difficult

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.190 
if you're trying to learn a difficult
part<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.939> play<00:01:36.149> it<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.360> different<00:01:36.479> phrases

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
part is to play it in different phrases

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.469 
part is to play it in different phrases
and<00:01:37.789> to<00:01:38.789> change<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.259> articulation<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.940> if

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
and to change up the articulation so if

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.600 
and to change up the articulation so if
you're<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.929> doing<00:01:43.319> an<00:01:43.619> F<00:01:43.770> scale<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.460> could

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you're just doing an F scale you could

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.029 
you're just doing an F scale you could
play<00:01:44.909> maybe<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.810> first<00:01:46.049> four<00:01:46.409> notes<00:01:46.679> as<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
play maybe the first four notes as a

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.190 
play maybe the first four notes as a
phrase<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.909> second<00:01:48.270> four<00:01:48.450> notes<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> phrase

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
phrase the second four notes is a phrase

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.699 
phrase the second four notes is a phrase
or<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.369> could<00:01:50.610> slur<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.390> first<00:01:51.780> four<00:01:52.080> tongue

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
or you could slur the first four tongue

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.120 
or you could slur the first four tongue
the<00:01:52.950> first<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.610> last<00:01:53.850> four<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.920> that's<00:01:55.920> just

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the first the last four and that's just

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:05.030 
the first the last four and that's just
another<00:01:56.450> practice<00:01:57.450> technique

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.190 

[Music]

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.360 

so<00:02:12.200> that's<00:02:12.410> just<00:02:12.710> different<00:02:13.010> ways<00:02:13.160> to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
so that's just different ways to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.000 
so that's just different ways to
practice<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.150> change<00:02:14.900> things<00:02:15.230> up<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.770> be<00:02:15.920> able

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
practice and change things up to be able

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.990 
practice and change things up to be able
to<00:02:16.190> master<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:17.210> section<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.780> piece
