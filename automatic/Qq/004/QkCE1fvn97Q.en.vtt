the iPad according to Samsung well
absolutely<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.269> mean<00:02:38.330> from<00:02:38.630> my<00:02:38.720> standpoint

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
absolutely I mean from my standpoint

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.930 
absolutely I mean from my standpoint
because<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> note<00:02:39.890> device<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.519> really

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
little guy it's pressure sensitive and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.920 
little guy it's pressure sensitive and
it<00:02:45.830> allows<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.370> really<00:02:47.269> precisely
