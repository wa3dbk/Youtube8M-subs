 [Music] 

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.060
 most people tend to lend 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.710
 attention to the trapezius muscles 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.080
 after having worked in the 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.240
 shoulders but really to increase your 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.250
 trapezoids you have to isolate the area from 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.680
 muscle with a variety of exercises 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.230
 who work for you in all three parts of 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.210
 upper and lower middle muscle to 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.249
 Next I will show you how we can 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.310
 work these three parts of the muscle 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:27.589
 said and with what exercises I expect them 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.369
 serve this information and practice the 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.369
 exercises 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.720
 we start with the top of the 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.240
 These trapezoids are developed through 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.850
 lifting the shoulders and this is the 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.910
 ideal exercise for this safe part 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.740
 you already know shrink with bar what 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.620
 what you do is lift your shoulders up 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.420
 where you can and slowly lower them what 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.070
 you can also do fast just a tip 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.990
 what do I give you since I work it 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.540
 slowly and I think you win more 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.150
 congestion the second exercise are the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.310
 pulleys on the pulley to the east face 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.070
 exercise works you mostly the average 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.970
 of the trapeze I work it to four 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.740
 series of 15 repetitions or even 20 and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.850
 It is highly recommended friends 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.729
 [Music] 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.710
 the third and last zone of the trapeze is 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.170
 the lower one and I also bring you a 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.140
 exercise for this part and they are the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.140
 shrugs with dumbbells on one hand 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:39.820
 [Music] 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.360
 here I will show you how is the exercise 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.240
 well no no no change is only 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.329
 a hand I only have those weights like that 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.490
 do not worry do not see the weight 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.040
 I'm just showing you how this is going 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.199
 exercise 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.199
 [Music] 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.470
 and you wonder what it's for 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.960
 exactly this this serves to achieve 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.310
 a greater contraction and you have to remember 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.770
 that any of these exercises 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.230
 would be ideal for the construction of 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.090
 your trapezoids only that each one of you 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.290
 work more areas where you 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.290
 I spoke earlier 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.780
 finally the tip that I give you at the time 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.930
 that you perform these exercises is 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.690
 complete the entire range of movement 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.370
 slowly down and up 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.680
 this so that it can break very well the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.510
 muscle fibers of the trapeze after 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.519
 of this remember to bring a good 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.670
 feed to rebuild and 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.250
 feed the muscle and with this they would be 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.640
 building good trapezoids 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.640
