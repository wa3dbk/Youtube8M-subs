student on our side in the lesson so

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.359 
student on our side in the lesson so
with<00:00:25.960> three<00:00:26.080> times<00:00:26.349> a<00:00:26.470> big<00:00:26.679> time<00:00:26.859> think<00:00:27.189> of<00:00:27.279> a

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
student now when do we use pre time the

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.510 
student now when do we use pre time the
big<00:00:39.730> time<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:39.969> why<00:00:40.829> well<00:00:41.829> when<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.100> students

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
big time and why well when the students

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.819 
big time and why well when the students
motivation<00:00:43.180> may<00:00:43.359> flag<00:00:43.719> that's<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.410> time<00:00:44.620> to

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
motivation may flag that's the time to

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.279 
motivation may flag that's the time to
bring<00:00:45.070> in<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.579> change<00:00:46.239> that's<00:00:46.629> a<00:00:46.690> perfect<00:00:47.109> time

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
bring in a change that's a perfect time

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.139 
bring in a change that's a perfect time
to<00:00:47.320> bring<00:00:47.590> in<00:00:47.769> a<00:00:47.829> pre<00:00:48.039> time<00:00:48.219> too<00:00:48.430> big<00:00:48.609> time<00:00:48.850> book

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
to bring in a pre time too big time book

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.189 
to bring in a pre time too big time book
of<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.989> students<00:00:50.440> particularly<00:00:50.980> interest

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
of the students particularly interest

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.250 
of the students particularly interest
also<00:00:53.199> as<00:00:53.679> teachers<00:00:54.429> so<00:00:54.699> often<00:00:55.120> we<00:00:55.269> derive<00:00:56.019> the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
also as teachers so often we derive the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.169 
also as teachers so often we derive the
students<00:00:56.710> up<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:56.980> level<00:00:57.309> into<00:00:57.519> increasing

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
students up the level into increasing

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.869 
students up the level into increasing
difficulty<00:00:58.899> will<00:00:59.620> often<00:00:59.980> what's<00:01:00.190> needed<00:01:00.609> more

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
difficulty will often what's needed more

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.240 
difficulty will often what's needed more
than<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.210> more<00:01:01.359> difficult<00:01:01.690> pieces<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.829> the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
than the more difficult pieces is the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.310 
than the more difficult pieces is the
opportunity<00:01:03.910> for<00:01:04.089> students<00:01:04.480> to<00:01:04.510> play<00:01:04.840> many

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
opportunity for students to play many

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.310 
opportunity for students to play many
many<00:01:05.650> notes<00:01:05.950> many<00:01:06.520> many<00:01:06.790> pieces<00:01:07.120> and<00:01:07.750> it's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
many notes many many pieces and it's

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.290 
many notes many many pieces and it's
particularly<00:01:08.860> rewarding<00:01:09.100> when<00:01:09.910> those<00:01:10.090> are

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
particularly rewarding when those are

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.120 
particularly rewarding when those are
familiar<00:01:10.750> pieces<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.470> that's<00:01:11.590> our<00:01:11.800> pre<00:01:11.950> time

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
familiar pieces and that's our pre time

00:01:12.130 --> 00:02:06.430 
familiar pieces and that's our pre time
too<00:01:12.310> big<00:01:12.460> time<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:12.850> about

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.500 

I<00:02:06.470> am<00:02:06.890> really<00:02:07.160> really<00:02:07.280> pleased<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.240> just

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
I am really really pleased it just

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.110 
I am really really pleased it just
sounds<00:02:08.900> beautiful

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
sounds beautiful

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.640 
sounds beautiful
another<00:02:11.120> reason<00:02:11.330> why<00:02:11.600> pre<00:02:11.840> time<00:02:12.050> -<00:02:12.230> big<00:02:12.410> time

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
another reason why pre time - big time

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.100 
another reason why pre time - big time
is<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.010> important<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.820> that<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.360> brings<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.960> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
is so important is that it brings in the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.460 
is so important is that it brings in the
social<00:02:15.620> element<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:16.220> music<00:02:16.990> music<00:02:17.990> making<00:02:18.170> is

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
social element of music music making is

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.590 
social element of music music making is
indeed<00:02:18.830> social<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.700> students<00:02:20.150> want<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.450> have

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
indeed social the students want to have

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.480 
indeed social the students want to have
that<00:02:20.810> pride<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.590> playing<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:22.040> front<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.340> their
