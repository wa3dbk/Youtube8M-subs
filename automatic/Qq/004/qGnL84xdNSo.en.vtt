 hello friends welcome to coca joke a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.120
 program that is like a wine with soda 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.310
 a botched experiment but that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.680
 cool start with some images 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.510
 unpublished for many reasons because today 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.699
 It's hard to see students crying out 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.039
 a teacher, let alone see a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.550
 teacher organizing this charanga in his 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.080
 last day of class before retirement 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.940
 endearing images and sir this man 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.210
 has a lot to celebrate especially 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.640
 to retire at age 60 to step 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.270
 what are you doing if you're not justin bieber toca 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.230
 work until losing the piÃ±ata in color 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.090
 blue come but we follow this group of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.739
 people who look like they're taken from a coral 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.160
 gospel or a lottery draw 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.930
 they are part of a curious experiment 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.199
 attention to prove the effectiveness of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.050
 brakes of a tank if so one of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.160
 two or they are successful or this ends up as 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.710
 Bowling 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.880
 We are good, we are not good 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.880
 cruel endings 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.520
 you remember what you did when you had 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.860
 two years old not true 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.900
 or maybe and what else does the important thing is 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.550
 to visualize the images of this child 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
 of only two years that is all a crack 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.470
 telesco like has many tables never 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.780
 rather an example of providing 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.510
 in diapers that makes us think that if you 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.180
 you raise mode now mode now then that 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.340
 but but mold now well we change 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.900
 Now underwear since the brain 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.060
 of some humans has little 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.280
 smart let's move the brown to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.680
 the garments pay attention to this 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.260
 bra that only undoes when 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.810
 detects that there is true love that 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.370
 nice truth do not ask me for the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.890
 system or if true love exists 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.320
 or things of those that I'm just the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.470
 messenger and I have stayed in only 10 of 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.480
 the 50 shades of gray if the practice of 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.210
 fake orgasms was widespread now 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.650
 arrives at another to pretend love to see 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.610
 two breasts 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.610
 I have done it 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.349
 let's now learn lessons from 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.360
 our friends the animals that they 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.090
 yes they know what it is to be happy with 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.730
 very little for example with a cube 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.730
 and outside problems to play 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.730
 and from the cat to the dog because the dog 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.500
 can be very close to man and everything 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.780
 that you want but if you want to put 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.210
 a name that you do not like you do 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.120
 know and you can try several 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.020
 times he does not get off the car 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.020
 for what 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 yes 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:09.790
 there is a chain of houses and soap 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.790
 so that no 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.810
 and we ended up with a game of pool 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.930
 Special attention to what this 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.940
 man with his balls is worth you out 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.569
 giggles the jousts I know that this is a 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.790
 serious mainstream program 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.099
 well how was I paying attention to the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.719
 risky moves you're going to see and it's 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.999
 that in the end friends sports more 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.769
 Minors need new formulas 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:39.319
 to get notoriety 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.060
 judge yourselves and above all not 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.670
 ask your partner to climb 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.540
 on the table to practice running 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.629
 the risk of losing the balls little joke 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.629
