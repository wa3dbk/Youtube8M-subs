00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
of course a numpad then add all the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.390 
of course a numpad then add all the
symbols<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.480> whatever<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.860> I'm<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.220> gonna

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
show you basically it's just the same

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.080 
show you basically it's just the same
code<00:02:22.160> for<00:02:22.460> all<00:02:22.550> numbers<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.060> letters<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:25.190> also

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
code for all numbers and letters so also

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:39.700 
code for all numbers and letters so also
add<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.960> space<00:02:27.410> bar<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:38.750> course<00:02:39.200> all<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
add a space bar and of course all the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.610 
add a space bar and of course all the
letters<00:02:40.070> which<00:02:40.640> I'm<00:02:41.240> not<00:02:41.960> going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.290> do

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
letters which I'm not going to do

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.730 
letters which I'm not going to do
because<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.690> repetition<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.650> it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
because it's just repetition and it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.199 
because it's just repetition and it
would<00:02:45.860> get<00:02:46.040> very<00:02:46.100> boring<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:48.430> just<00:02:49.430> take<00:02:49.850> your

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
would get very boring so just take your

00:02:50.209 --> 00:03:00.340 
would get very boring so just take your
textbox<00:02:53.080> make<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.230> multi-line<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.990> during

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
textbox make it multi-line and during

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.760 
textbox make it multi-line and during
across<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.770> bottom<00:03:00.920> your<00:03:01.220> screen<00:03:02.290> then<00:03:03.290> in

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
across the bottom your screen then in

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.630 
across the bottom your screen then in
the<00:03:03.920> properties<00:03:04.459> over<00:03:04.640> here<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:07.310> go<00:03:07.490> ahead

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
the properties over here you go ahead

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.160 
the properties over here you go ahead
and<00:03:08.150> add<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.420> scroll<00:03:09.140> bar<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.670> vertical<00:03:14.170> so

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
and add a scroll bar that is vertical so

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.780 
and add a scroll bar that is vertical so
now<00:03:15.350> here's<00:03:15.950> what<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.220> looks<00:03:16.370> like

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
now here's what it looks like

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.880 
now here's what it looks like
of<00:03:17.239> course<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.660> would<00:03:17.780> have<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.260> letters<00:03:18.590> and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
of course it would have the letters and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.880 
of course it would have the letters and
whatever<00:03:19.100> layout<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.300> numbers<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.019> symbols

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
whatever layout of numbers and symbols

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.750 
whatever layout of numbers and symbols
you'd<00:03:22.280> want

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
you'd want

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.550 
you'd want
now<00:03:23.269> here's<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.810> code<00:03:23.989> you're<00:03:24.200> going<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.410> use

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
now here's the code you're going to use

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.930 
now here's the code you're going to use
for<00:03:24.769> basically<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.370> whole<00:03:25.550> thing<00:03:27.940> textbox

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
for basically the whole thing textbox

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.660 
for basically the whole thing textbox
one<00:03:30.130> dot<00:03:31.130> text<00:03:32.709> equals<00:03:34.450> in<00:03:35.450> front<00:03:35.780> sees

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
one dot text equals in front sees

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.600 
one dot text equals in front sees
textbox<00:03:37.780> one<00:03:38.780> dot<00:03:39.230> text<00:03:40.450> plus<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.610> then

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
textbox one dot text plus and then

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.080 
textbox one dot text plus and then
whatever<00:03:43.880> you<00:03:44.180> want<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.540> add<00:03:44.690> in<00:03:45.320> quotes<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:46.549> we

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
whatever you want to add in quotes so we

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.420 
whatever you want to add in quotes so we
use<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.480> number<00:03:47.750> one<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.769> we're<00:03:48.920> gonna<00:03:49.070> have

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
use the number one so we're gonna have

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.410 
use the number one so we're gonna have
one<00:03:49.640> in<00:03:49.790> there<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.840> this<00:03:50.959> is<00:03:51.110> our<00:03:51.260> code<00:03:51.500> and

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
one in there so this is our code and

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.810 
one in there so this is our code and
then<00:03:53.950> with<00:03:54.950> you<00:03:55.100> that<00:03:55.280> for<00:03:55.459> all<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.670> numbers

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
then with you that for all the numbers

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:15.420 
then with you that for all the numbers
for<00:03:56.330> tab<00:03:56.920> just<00:03:57.920> do<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.250> same<00:03:58.459> code

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.539 

and<00:04:16.989> add<00:04:17.989> some<00:04:18.080> spaces<00:04:18.890> or<00:04:19.010> just<00:04:19.250> press<00:04:19.430> the

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
and add some spaces or just press the

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.420 
and add some spaces or just press the
tab<00:04:19.760> key<00:04:19.989> then<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.049> space<00:04:21.620> would<00:04:21.890> be<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.190> same

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
tab key then the space would be the same

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:30.550 
tab key then the space would be the same
thing<00:04:22.730> as<00:04:23.950> these<00:04:25.180> except<00:04:26.180> just<00:04:29.140> with<00:04:30.140> one

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
thing as these except just with one

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:42.360 
thing as these except just with one
space<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:38.320> after<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.410> finish<00:04:40.480> with<00:04:41.480> Aziza

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
space and so after you finish with Aziza

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.810 
space and so after you finish with Aziza
one<00:04:43.930> there's<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:45.020> tab<00:04:45.380> there's<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.430> space

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
one there's a tab there's a space

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.610 
one there's a tab there's a space
between<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.360> ones<00:04:47.540> and<00:04:48.290> then<00:04:48.410> there's

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
between the ones and then there's

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.810 
between the ones and then there's
nothing<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:51.490> then<00:04:52.490> for<00:04:53.450> any<00:04:53.840> letters<00:04:54.820> or

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
nothing and then for any letters or

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.800 
nothing and then for any letters or
whatever<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.270> want

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
whatever you want

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.880 
whatever you want
it<00:04:57.410> would<00:04:57.620> look<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.920> same<00:04:58.090> just<00:04:59.090> go<00:04:59.300> on<00:05:00.140> to<00:05:00.860> the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
it would look the same just go on to the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.710 
it would look the same just go on to the
buttons<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:02.060> type<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.870> same<00:05:03.230> code<00:05:04.420> just<00:05:05.420> make

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
buttons and type the same code just make

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.970 
buttons and type the same code just make
sure<00:05:06.020> it's<00:05:07.010> whatever<00:05:07.850> you<00:05:08.060> want<00:05:08.920> inside<00:05:09.920> the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
sure it's whatever you want inside the

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.820 
sure it's whatever you want inside the
quotes<00:05:10.400> that's<00:05:11.330> all<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.870> have<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.140> do<00:05:12.380> for<00:05:12.710> the

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
quotes that's all you have to do for the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.700 
quotes that's all you have to do for the
whole<00:05:13.040> text<00:05:13.430> box<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:14.510> if<00:05:14.960> you<00:05:15.050> want<00:05:15.260> capital

whole text box and if you want capital
letters<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.190> can<00:05:16.370> just<00:05:16.990> make<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.170> button

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
letters you can just make the button

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.190 
letters you can just make the button
smaller<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.040> have<00:05:19.160> capital<00:05:19.730> or<00:05:20.390> you<00:05:20.780> can<00:05:20.930> add

a new form and have them there just make

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.780 
a new form and have them there just make
the<00:05:25.490> whole<00:05:25.520> thing<00:05:25.700> bigger<00:05:26.180> it's<00:05:27.140> up<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.590> you

exactly how you want to do it but this
is<00:05:30.919> just<00:05:31.190> basically<00:05:31.640> the<00:05:31.940> code<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:32.950> how<00:05:33.950> are

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
is just basically the code and how are

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.500 
is just basically the code and how are
you<00:05:34.130> gonna<00:05:34.340> make<00:05:34.550> your<00:05:34.760> own<00:05:34.940> on-screen

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
you gonna make your own on-screen

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.130 
you gonna make your own on-screen
keyboard<00:05:35.930> so<00:05:36.590> that's<00:05:37.040> how<00:05:37.190> you<00:05:37.250> do<00:05:37.460> it<00:05:37.610> and

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
keyboard so that's how you do it and

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.730 
keyboard so that's how you do it and
I'll<00:05:39.140> see<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:39.530> on<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.860> next<00:05:40.190> tutorial
