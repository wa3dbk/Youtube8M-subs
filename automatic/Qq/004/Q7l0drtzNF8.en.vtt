weaker for a couple or few days well

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.870

then<00:01:43.170> when<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.380> hit<00:01:43.560> chest<00:01:43.860> again<00:01:44.220> Monday

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
then when you hit chest again Monday

then when you hit chest again Monday
shoulders<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:45.909> triceps<00:01:46.210> are<00:01:46.780> probably<00:01:47.380> not

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
shoulders and triceps are probably not

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.510 
shoulders and triceps are probably not
fully<00:01:48.690> recuperated<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:51.340> could

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
fully recuperated and that could

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.210 
fully recuperated and that could
compromise<00:01:51.820> your<00:01:52.360> chest<00:01:52.869> workshop<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:53.890> what

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
compromise your chest workshop so what

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.640 
compromise your chest workshop so what
you<00:01:54.369> need<00:01:54.550> is<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.820> more<00:01:55.180> even<00:01:55.650> recuperation

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
you need is a more even recuperation

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.160 
you need is a more even recuperation
between<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.820> you've<00:01:57.970> got<00:01:58.000> five<00:01:58.420> days<00:01:58.720> between

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
between so you've got five days between

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.830 
between so you've got five days between
chest<00:01:59.970> shoulders<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.030> tri's<00:02:01.300> but<00:02:01.570> then<00:02:01.690> only

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
chest shoulders and tri's but then only

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.219 
chest shoulders and tri's but then only
two<00:02:02.670> after<00:02:03.670> shoulders<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.450> tri's<00:02:04.690> before

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
two after shoulders and tri's before

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.749 
two after shoulders and tri's before
chest<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:05.800> again<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.310> could<00:02:06.430> compromise

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
chest so again that could compromise

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.380 
chest so again that could compromise
your<00:02:07.800> your<00:02:08.800> ability<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.250> push<00:02:09.550> basically<00:02:10.149> on

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
your your ability to push basically on

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.729 
your your ability to push basically on
