stalkers as this blink is just now fully

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.550 
stalkers as this blink is just now fully
researched<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:20.539> here<00:00:20.990> comes<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:21.230> job<00:00:21.410> right

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
now the blink stalkers tried run for

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.490 
now the blink stalkers tried run for
like<00:00:23.029> I<00:00:23.150> said<00:00:23.300> this<00:00:23.390> is<00:00:23.449> a<00:00:23.630> small<00:00:23.929> choke<00:00:24.260> to<00:00:24.380> get

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
like I said this is a small choke to get

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.200 
like I said this is a small choke to get
inside<00:00:24.830> and<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:25.490> it<00:00:25.609> does<00:00:25.789> take<00:00:25.970> quite<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.179> while

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
inside and so it does take quite a while

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.029 
inside and so it does take quite a while
there<00:00:26.420> is<00:00:26.570> no<00:00:26.810> overseer<00:00:27.380> here<00:00:27.560> right<00:00:27.679> now<00:00:27.830> and

there is no overseer here right now and

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.589 
there is no overseer here right now and

about deep sweat it has now flushed I
guess<00:03:03.490> is<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.760> what<00:03:03.970> that's<00:03:04.150> what<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.390> would

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
guess is that what that's what I would

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.449 
guess is that what that's what I would
call<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.050> it<00:03:05.350> does<00:03:05.560> look<00:03:05.830> go<00:03:06.040> like<00:03:06.310> do

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
call it and it does look go like do

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.860 
call it and it does look go like do

there<00:04:03.820> is<00:04:03.940> virtually<00:04:04.209> nothing<00:04:04.810> left<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:06.010> think

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
there is virtually nothing left I think

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.920 
there is virtually nothing left I think
that<00:04:06.370> he<00:04:06.610> may<00:04:06.790> act<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.150> able<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.360> hold<00:04:07.570> us<00:04:07.810> up

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
that he may act to be able to hold us up

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.479 
that he may act to be able to hold us up
we<00:04:08.170> could<00:04:08.320> look<00:04:08.470> at<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.739> army<00:04:09.010> size<00:04:09.220> tab

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
we could look at the army size tab
