00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
everything and we have a new take down

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.310 
everything and we have a new take down
opponents<00:00:38.070> basically<00:00:39.059> using<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> cloud<00:00:39.660> it's

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
opponents basically using the cloud it's

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.860 
opponents basically using the cloud it's
it's<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.820> AI<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.660> more

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it's not really like AI it's it's more

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.690 
it's not really like AI it's it's more
similar<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> let's<00:00:43.500> say<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.920> big<00:00:44.219> data<00:00:44.460> or

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
similar to let's say like big data or

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.610 
similar to let's say like big data or
search<00:00:45.030> we've<00:00:45.870> got<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.200> data<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.590> can

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
search we've got all this data we can

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
search we've got all this data we can
put<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> cloud<00:00:47.250> crunch<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.239> then

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
put in the cloud crunch on it and then

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.110 
put in the cloud crunch on it and then
bring<00:00:49.140> down<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.500> profiles<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.640> make<00:00:50.850> an

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
bring down these profiles then make an

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.290 
bring down these profiles then make an
AI<00:00:51.449> kind<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.440> maybe<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.489> an<00:00:53.610> opponent<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.210> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
AI kind of maybe it's an opponent and it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.760 
AI kind of maybe it's an opponent and it
drives<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.840> friends<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.590> really

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
drives like your friends so it's really

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.229 
drives like your friends so it's really
a<00:00:55.860> blurring<00:00:56.070> lines<00:00:56.190> between<00:00:56.520> multiplayer<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
a blurring lines between multiplayer and

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.330 
a blurring lines between multiplayer and
singleplayer<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.530> computer<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> still

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
singleplayer so the computer is still

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
singleplayer so the computer is still
learning<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.000> observing<00:01:00.660> how<00:01:00.870> other<00:01:01.260> people

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
learning and observing how other people

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
learning and observing how other people
are<00:01:01.649> driving<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.579> improving<00:01:02.910> itself<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
are driving and then improving itself is

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.080 
are driving and then improving itself is
that<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:04.019> exactly<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.580> creates<00:01:05.970> an

that right exactly and it creates an

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.359 
that right exactly and it creates an

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
makes it learns which it doesn't so we

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.710 
makes it learns which it doesn't so we
have<00:01:31.979> difficulty<00:01:32.549> settings<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.600> those

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
of Drive Atari you're racing against so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.569 
of Drive Atari you're racing against so

if you sent to the highest difficulty

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.410 
if you sent to the highest difficulty
you'll<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> racing<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.689> absolute<00:01:40.680> best

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420

off<00:01:52.380> more<00:01:52.619> frequently<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.479> know

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
off more frequently and so you know

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
off more frequently and so you know
there's<00:01:55.140> how<00:01:55.439> your<00:01:55.649> friends<00:01:55.950> drive<00:01:56.189> because

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
there's how your friends drive because

there's how your friends drive because

your friends come in friends and family

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.569 
your friends come in friends and family
are<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.259> your<00:01:58.469> race<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.399> they're

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
are in your race with you and they're

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
are in your race with you and they're
represented<00:02:00.090> very<00:02:00.240> accurately<00:02:00.659> or<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.259> can

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
represented very accurately or you can

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.560 
represented very accurately or you can
change<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> difficulty<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:02.909> crank

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
change the difficulty in you know crank

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.910 
change the difficulty in you know crank
it<00:02:03.719> way<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:04.409> you're<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> be

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it way up and then you're going to be

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
it way up and then you're going to be
racing<00:02:05.280> against<00:02:05.490> some<00:02:06.030> honestly<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> fastest

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
racing against some honestly the fastest

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.150 
racing against some honestly the fastest
people<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.590> world

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
people in the world

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.710 
people in the world
so<00:02:09.160> if<00:02:09.520> we<00:02:09.580> sought<00:02:09.730> to<00:02:09.850> get<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.180> get<00:02:10.300> step<00:02:10.510> back

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
so if we sought to get to get step back

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.350 
so if we sought to get to get step back
maybe<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.530> people<00:02:11.650> who<00:02:11.770> haven't<00:02:12.490> played<00:02:12.880> many

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
maybe the people who haven't played many

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.960 
maybe the people who haven't played many
wasting<00:02:13.840> games<00:02:14.070> don't<00:02:15.070> see<00:02:15.220> there's<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.490> whole

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
wasting games don't see there's a whole

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.040 
wasting games don't see there's a whole
range<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.540> choose<00:02:16.570> from

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
range to choose from

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.930 
range to choose from
how<00:02:17.320> does<00:02:17.620> foster<00:02:17.860> distinguish<00:02:18.550> itself<00:02:18.820> from

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
how does foster distinguish itself from

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.300 
how does foster distinguish itself from
like<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.990> upcoming<00:02:20.350> drive<00:02:20.590> Club<00:02:20.890> or<00:02:21.130> Gran

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
like the upcoming drive Club or Gran

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.130 
like the upcoming drive Club or Gran
Turismo<00:02:21.580> or<00:02:22.030> maybe<00:02:22.270> something<00:02:22.660> like<00:02:22.780> burnout

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
Turismo or maybe something like burnout

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.560 
Turismo or maybe something like burnout
how<00:02:23.800> should<00:02:24.400> someone<00:02:24.580> choose<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.300> what<00:02:25.390> sort

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
how should someone choose and what sort

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.880 
how should someone choose and what sort
of<00:02:25.600> person<00:02:25.930> should<00:02:26.080> choose<00:02:26.290> for<00:02:26.320> self<00:02:26.740> as

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
of person should choose for self as

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.710 
of person should choose for self as
their<00:02:27.130> racing<00:02:27.490> game<00:02:27.670> well<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.420> know<00:02:28.510> that's

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
their racing game well you know that's

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.300 
their racing game well you know that's
really<00:02:28.930> been<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.200> philosophy<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.680> forces<00:02:30.130> to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
really been the philosophy of forces to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.610 
really been the philosophy of forces to
appeal<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.000> many<00:02:31.090> people<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.810> we've<00:02:32.440> done

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
appeal to so many people and we've done

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.590 
appeal to so many people and we've done
that<00:02:32.680> by<00:02:32.890> not<00:02:33.220> compromising<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.090> our<00:02:34.180> physics

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
that by not compromising in our physics

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600 
that by not compromising in our physics
I<00:02:34.810> think<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.320> lot<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.560> games<00:02:35.710> kind<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.040> choose<00:02:36.310> to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
I think a lot of games kind of choose to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.390 
I think a lot of games kind of choose to
say<00:02:36.820> we<00:02:37.060> are<00:02:37.210> Sam<00:02:37.540> or<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:37.780> are<00:02:37.900> arcade<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.680> to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
say we are Sam or we are arcade and to

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
say we are Sam or we are arcade and to
me<00:02:39.520> as<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.850> designer<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.420> find<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.850> too<00:02:42.850> easy<00:02:43.090> so

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
me as a designer I find that too easy so

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.930 
me as a designer I find that too easy so
we've<00:02:44.410> done<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.740> built<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.220> no<00:02:45.700> compromise

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
we've done is built a no compromise

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.850 
we've done is built a no compromise
physics<00:02:46.630> engine<00:02:46.990> in<00:02:47.080> fact<00:02:47.470> we're<00:02:47.650> doing

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
physics engine in fact we're doing

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.410 
physics engine in fact we're doing
things<00:02:48.070> now<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.430> our<00:02:48.460> physics<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.090> were<00:02:49.240> not

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
things now in our physics that were not

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.210 
things now in our physics that were not
they<00:02:50.050> weren't<00:02:50.320> possible<00:02:50.560> on<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.040> last

start<00:03:05.830> with<00:03:05.920> that<00:03:05.980> simulation<00:03:06.550> engine<00:03:06.880> which

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
start with that simulation engine which

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.450 
start with that simulation engine which
could<00:03:07.540> be<00:03:07.630> incredibly<00:03:08.050> hard<00:03:08.290> but<00:03:08.920> then<00:03:09.100> we<00:03:09.310> add

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
could be incredibly hard but then we add

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.040 
could be incredibly hard but then we add
all<00:03:09.610> these<00:03:09.760> assists<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.510> what<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.810> allows

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
all these assists and what that allows

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.930 
all these assists and what that allows
us<00:03:11.080> for<00:03:11.380> little<00:03:12.070> kids<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.340> play<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.730> for

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
us for little kids to play it for

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.670 
us for little kids to play it for
friends<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.570> play<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.350> means<00:03:14.440> we've

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
friends to play it and it means we've

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.930 
friends to play it and it means we've
got<00:03:14.830> an<00:03:14.920> audience<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.370> people<00:03:15.490> that<00:03:15.700> is

creators to come up the next big idea we

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.850 
creators to come up the next big idea we
focused<00:03:55.660> most<00:03:55.900> our<00:03:56.080> energy<00:03:56.380> on<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.620> cloud

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
focused most our energy on the cloud

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.130 
focused most our energy on the cloud
because<00:03:57.610> for<00:03:57.850> me<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.240> ability<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.600> offload

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
because for me the ability to offload

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.089 
because for me the ability to offload
physics<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.709> upload<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:00.850> know

day one and we supposed to mention the
new<00:04:18.829> controller

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
new controller

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.510 
new controller
I<00:04:21.109> was<00:04:21.590> trying<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:21.889> this<00:04:21.979> now<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.400> they're

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
I was trying it this now and they're

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.159 
I was trying it this now and they're
sort<00:04:22.639> of<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.759> feedback<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.449> get<00:04:23.660> yeah

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
sort of the feedback you get yeah

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.210 
sort of the feedback you get yeah
by<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.349> trick<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.770> was<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.949> presume<00:04:25.190> that

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
by the trick it was I presume that

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.950 
by the trick it was I presume that
something<00:04:25.639> that<00:04:25.729> you<00:04:25.789> take<00:04:26.360> me<00:04:26.509> Vantage<00:04:26.810> of

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
something that you take me Vantage of

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.150 
something that you take me Vantage of
yeah<00:04:27.289> we're<00:04:27.440> actually<00:04:27.590> one<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.979> first

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
yeah we're actually one of the first

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.800 
yeah we're actually one of the first
teams<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.400> prototype<00:04:28.940> that<00:04:29.150> that's<00:04:29.419> that's<00:04:29.720> a

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
teams to prototype that that's that's a

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.080 
teams to prototype that that's that's a
big<00:04:29.960> part<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.500> who<00:04:31.009> we<00:04:31.039> are<00:04:31.280> at<00:04:31.430> turn<00:04:31.610> 10<00:04:31.880> we

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
big part of who we are at turn 10 we

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.700 
big part of who we are at turn 10 we
really<00:04:32.630> like<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.840> prototype<00:04:33.259> these<00:04:33.500> new

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
really like to prototype these new

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.219 
really like to prototype these new
technologies<00:04:34.340> so<00:04:35.000> yeah<00:04:35.419> we<00:04:35.630> are<00:04:35.660> able<00:04:36.110> to

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
technologies so yeah we are able to

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.110 
technologies so yeah we are able to
simulate<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.949> way<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.220> tires<00:04:37.490> break<00:04:37.849> loose

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
simulate the way the tires break loose

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.300 
simulate the way the tires break loose
under<00:04:38.539> acceleration<00:04:38.870> on<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.710> accelerator

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
under acceleration on the accelerator

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.129 
under acceleration on the accelerator
trigger<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.820> then<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.449> can<00:04:41.599> feel<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.990> ABS

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
trigger and then you can feel the ABS

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.469 
trigger and then you can feel the ABS
pulsing<00:04:42.889> or<00:04:43.130> if<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.370> have<00:04:43.490> no<00:04:43.639> ABS<00:04:44.000> on<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.330> can

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
pulsing or if you have no ABS on you can

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.060 
pulsing or if you have no ABS on you can
feel<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.840> tires<00:04:45.080> locking<00:04:45.380> up<00:04:45.680> in<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.889> brake

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
feel the tires locking up in the brake

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.620 
feel the tires locking up in the brake
trigger<00:04:46.310> it's<00:04:46.820> really<00:04:47.060> cool<00:04:47.240> it<00:04:47.360> gives<00:04:47.509> you<00:04:47.599> a

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
trigger it's really cool it gives you a

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.870 
trigger it's really cool it gives you a
very<00:04:47.900> kind<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.560> three-dimensional<00:04:48.889> feeling

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
very kind of three-dimensional feeling

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.129 
very kind of three-dimensional feeling
of<00:04:50.030> feedback<00:04:50.389> because<00:04:50.539> we<00:04:50.660> also<00:04:50.900> have<00:04:51.020> the

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
of feedback because we also have the

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.140 
of feedback because we also have the
chassis<00:04:51.500> rumble<00:04:52.039> in<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.370> actual<00:04:52.729> controller

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
chassis rumble in the actual controller

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.730 
chassis rumble in the actual controller
so<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:53.810> have<00:04:53.990> knowing<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.320> rumble<00:04:54.620> in<00:04:54.650> the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
so you have knowing the rumble in the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.140 
so you have knowing the rumble in the
triggers<00:04:55.070> for<00:04:55.099> the<00:04:55.340> rumble<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.699> the<00:04:55.820> actual

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
triggers for the rumble in the actual

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.029 
triggers for the rumble in the actual
controller<00:04:56.449> itself<00:04:56.750> so<00:04:57.680> do<00:04:57.740> you<00:04:57.800> think<00:04:57.919> that's

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
controller itself so do you think that's

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.070 
controller itself so do you think that's
gonna<00:04:58.130> be<00:04:58.310> get<00:04:59.240> people<00:04:59.479> back<00:04:59.599> to<00:04:59.660> playing<00:04:59.960> with

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
gonna be get people back to playing with

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.659 
gonna be get people back to playing with
the<00:05:00.139> controller<00:05:00.500> maybe<00:05:00.860> if<00:05:01.130> they<00:05:01.220> favor<00:05:01.490> the

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
the controller maybe if they favor the

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.700 
the controller maybe if they favor the
wheel<00:05:01.880> or<00:05:02.270> they<00:05:02.599> played<00:05:02.900> with<00:05:03.080> Kinect<00:05:03.410> is<00:05:03.590> that

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
wheel or they played with Kinect is that

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.980 
wheel or they played with Kinect is that
going<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:03.949> be<00:05:04.039> at<00:05:04.400> all<00:05:04.580> for<00:05:04.820> them<00:05:04.940> you<00:05:05.419> know<00:05:05.509> the

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
going to be at all for them you know the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.189 
going to be at all for them you know the
truth<00:05:06.229> is<00:05:07.360> what<00:05:08.360> I<00:05:08.389> found<00:05:08.659> is<00:05:08.840> we<00:05:08.960> have<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.110> very

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
truth is what I found is we have a very

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.710 
truth is what I found is we have a very
diverse<00:05:09.560> group<00:05:09.800> of<00:05:10.009> people<00:05:10.159> and<00:05:10.520> I'm<00:05:11.509> not

diverse group of people and I'm not
trying<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.080> turn<00:05:12.289> controller<00:05:12.740> people<00:05:13.070> into

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
trying to turn controller people into

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.649 
trying to turn controller people into
wheel<00:05:13.550> people<00:05:13.880> and<00:05:13.970> I'm<00:05:14.030> gonna<00:05:14.180> try<00:05:14.419> and<00:05:14.449> turn
