00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
had a piece that broke on it and it was

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.880 
had a piece that broke on it and it was
keeping<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.409> from<00:01:35.420> resetting<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> cartridge

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
keeping it from resetting the cartridge

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.100 
keeping it from resetting the cartridge
let<00:01:37.890> me<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.290> believe<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.890> was

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
let me see here and I believe it was

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
let me see here and I believe it was
let's<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:45.560> initializing<00:01:46.560> whatever<00:01:46.979> here

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
let's see initializing whatever here

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.300 
let's see initializing whatever here
look<00:01:48.119> inside<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.570> -<00:01:48.720> everything's<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.380> but

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
look inside here - everything's here but

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
look inside here - everything's here but
I<00:01:50.340> believe<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> was<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> carriage<00:01:51.509> piece<00:01:51.869> here

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
I believe it was the carriage piece here

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
I believe it was the carriage piece here
that<00:01:52.290> had<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:53.009> crack<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.820> something

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
that had a little crack in or something
