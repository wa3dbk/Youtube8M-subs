 such beads 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.189
 we need black polymer clay 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.010
 and green 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:29.689

 slightly moisten the stamp and press 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.720
 him in plastic 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.869
 take a small round mold and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.280
 cut the core then cut 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.280
 big round shape 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.100
 remove excess plastic with a blade 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.100
 disconnecting the finished 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.729
 get out in the subject 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.440
 Next, take a jar and on top of the jar 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.880
 we put plastic 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.880
 lightly press the edges 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.410
 then we pass the golden mecca 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.410
 protruding parts of the ornament 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.180
 and bake everything at the temperature specified 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.990
 on your polymer 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.920
 bake on a jar further detach 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.920
 jar circles 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.050
 we will need 6 black circles and 4 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.050
 green 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.380
 then you need to polish the edges well 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.350
 circles and gloss varnish 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.630
 only protruding parts where we are 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.550
 put mecca 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.480
 then super glue with start tips 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.640
 cord 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.430
 cord we need about 2 meters 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.920
 fold it in half leave 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.459
 about 10 centimeters and tying 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.459
 nodule 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.200
 then we pass one cord through 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.610
 workpiece and then pass 2 cords 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.610
 through the bead 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.079
 we pass the lower cord through the holes in 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.079
 the middle 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.210
 this way we have one cord 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.920
 on top of another family 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.920
 at the end we tie a knot 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.900
 then pass 2 cords to the next 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.189
 bead 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.480
 promoted to the end and also doing 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.480
 end knot 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.920
 then take another billet and 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.920
 pass inside 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.950
 then pass 2 cords into one again 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.610
 bead 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.610
 put forward to the end 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.900
 and we pull out one cord from the other side 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.490
 also get one cord on top of another 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.710
 bottom of the end do nodule 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:28.240
 Then again we kill 2 cords in a bead and 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.240
 so collect all bursa 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.849
 then pass 2 cords in the ring 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.669
 and at the end we make a bundle up to 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.669
 about 2 millimeter beads 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.340
 then do another knot between 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.229
 a knot of the previous one and a bead just 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.229
 where we left 2 millimeters 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.169
 cut the cord insert about one 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.169
 one and a half millimeter 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.530
 use a lighter to light a little 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.270
 tips and presses them the same 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.060
 doing on the other side 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.350
 only here we still open the ring and 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.350
 stringing the lock 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.289
 Here such beads I have turned out if 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.110
