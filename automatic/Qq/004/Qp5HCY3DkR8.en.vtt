00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.160
 Do you see that? 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.570
 msi micro star international kg m 2 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.309
 next to me is the dirk and he will 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.100
 tell something about the new mainboards 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.160
 the still partially secret are exactly 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.260
 So now for the first mainboards too 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.690
 in the gaming area for the coming 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.670
 chipset from intel so internets next 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.260
 generation will take a while 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.140
 until it comes out we show now the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.420
 first models of the gaming series called 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.149
 xxx stands for the chip division 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.540
 will come gaming five later 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.880
 gaming three different variants 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.860
 the same orientation are characterized thereby 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.470
 the boards are of course one 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.630
 few new special teams we offer 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.790
 as msi we are well known for that 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.579
 The gaming mainboards have a few features 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.250
 to show the other one not so we have 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.840
 have, for example, the new children with 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.790
 so integrated on the boards 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.500
 bring an improved and above all 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.270
 hire in prioritized data traffic 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.729
 is guaranteed if I can 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.320
 So I configure it individually 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.659
 on the other side we have now 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.330
 sold out in the second generation 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.369
 are 600 ohm amplifiers for the audio 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.860
 Output for headphones or external 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.790
 loudspeakers are also part of the sound 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.799
 vices are always two 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.780
 that's basically an improved one 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.220
 version of the anglers what we have so far 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.890
 had included 3d surround sound 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.900
 So that's the guaranteed principle 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.670
 on the one hand in good 2 and have 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.820
 on the other hand , though I do 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.430
 in the team, for example, war games 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.630
 That's what I mean with my colleagues 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.490
 my teammates too 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.300
 can communicate without being disturbed too 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.010
 be surrounded by the ambient noise 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.670
 very important feature of this board 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.380
 all ports have two slots 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.680
 this is a very small one here 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.760
 hole reminds me of msa 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.310
 but a little smaller if you are 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.490
 it is here to look at it rather rich 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.970
 standard ems of course, of course, too 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.050
 on the side technology is based on 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.880
 the 2 is rich 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.890
 express that means on pci 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.320
 express accesses the pizza 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.900
 express lanes and so has one 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.150
 much higher performance is 10 gig 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.950
 here the measure in relation to six 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.660
 goes from sata 3 thus already a 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.640
 Huge jump what we can expect there 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.980
 So it will be as soon as the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.660
 chip set and the new processors then 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.370
 there will be maps on the market too 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.770
 give it in there 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.210
 can in different capacities 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.580
 so that accordingly a 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.800
 pretty high performance for the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.120
 Retrieval of an operating system can 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.520
 of course then on the map also mine 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.620
 install games and have a giant 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.810
 performance then a fat one 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.150
 hard disk then I have all around 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.980
 you can be happy there already 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.340
 somehow a timely betrayed when 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.340
 to be it 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.370
 i would say mid co2 so you can 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.879
 be it ever orientate everything 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.879
 clearly best thanks 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.739
 but what was exciting at msi am 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.900
 found 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.459
 dirk what are the great yes that's it 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.080
 power max now less for gaming 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.000
 of course also suitable for gaming though 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.650
 mainly for overclocker for people 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.870
 I need the full performance 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.200
 again with the new chip set 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.910
 for the new cpu generation for the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.989
 upgrade from intel what we have now in q2 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.700
 can expect 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.590
 of course we have all the features 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.769
 The gaming boards also have plus 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.400
 additionally additional converters more 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.290
 phases more power to those days last of 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.640
 We are allowed to bring out the system 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.299
 be curious what he still gets everything 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.379
 the whole then in beautiful yellow-black 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.940
 We can always do that for everyone 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.340
 If you ever go out look here 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.470
 the m power series with and power max m 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.920
 power and also the ixs power the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.680
 absolute high end board want from z 780 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.919
 that would be the first one 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.120
 representative of the successor generation and 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.370
 then in the winter shelf also with cooling 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.669
 and all the bells and whistles so now 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.810
 very early sample because so missing synonymous 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.120
 complete cooler 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.980
 even the airports are missing here in front 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.919
 we want to betray you too much 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.139
 still a lot of time until we are ready 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.500
 number to give a first insight already 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.630
 firmly 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.340
 due to the yellow boards said it 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.050
 Of course we also have yellow graphics cards 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.070
 now have lightning here in front of us 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.660
 and hawk series 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.760
 and there are two very special ones 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.860
 cards namely the gtx 280 te lightning 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.680
 and the 20th 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.750
 yes that's when we are here now 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.790
 first look at the upper product, the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.740
 gtx 780 de lightning 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.430
 this is a model that we in principle 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.330
 only quasi least once 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.180
 semi-professional overclocker to 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.860
 Provision is therefore so in Europe 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.470
 not available in free trade 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.390
 So a very special card is 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.740
 Relatively expensive that in the market too 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.410
 bring we decided that 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.010
 really only for professionals too 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.210
 put 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:07.750
 very different from the whole new map 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.470
 our newest model that is 992 iks 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.050
 lightning has a cooling effect 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.570
 upgrade will experience a little 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.750
 change in comparison with the 87 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.520
 lightning it's a heatpipe less 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.760
 as there is more room for a decent 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.600
 air flow intern so we here 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.479
 really though it's a tuned high end 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.180
 map is that we are here at fallout 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.729
 maximum 70 degrees come and that is one 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.280
 enormous power it would be so then 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.660
 the level I am with a standard 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.120
 gtx 750 reaches the reference map 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.920
 So we are despite high performance 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.530
 already a completely different level of 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:54.930
 Cooling and are already first good 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.830
 reference overclocking results in the network 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.120
 to observe 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.230
 and there will certainly be more 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.270
 they also come in the free market 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:05.160
 available costs 599 is our mvp so 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.260
 who mean for people seriously 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.800
 and with his card, too 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.550
 want to achieve some good results 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.320
 which is also already in our 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.690
 thank you for that 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.560
 So they had a base clock of 1080 so one 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:23.190
 book of 1080 now that's correct 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.500
 that's the fastest way 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.180
 of course there with all two 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.220
 cool yes I have two bios here 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.570
 versions with it but so every 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.000
 lots of possibilities as long as I am 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.470
 I know a lot about that 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.200
 you want to reach what your 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.200
 test corner best thanks
