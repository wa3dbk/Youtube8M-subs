the d 301 we want here is the d700

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.780 
the d 301 we want here is the d700
update<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:09.049> 1.04<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.830> point<00:01:11.130> zero<00:01:11.189> three

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
update a 1.04 be one point zero three

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.920 
update a 1.04 be one point zero three
and<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.930> last<00:01:13.080> update<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.740> did<00:01:14.010> was<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:15.030> one

point zero three and B one point zero

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.260 
point zero three and B one point zero
two<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> obviously<00:01:19.979> they've<00:01:20.159> both<00:01:20.400> gone<00:01:21.060> up

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
two so obviously they've both gone up

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.740 
two so obviously they've both gone up
one<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.490> click<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.150> you've<00:01:24.390> got<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.659> the

information there tells you everything

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.450 
information there tells you everything
it<00:01:26.610> does<00:01:27.020> all<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.229> says<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it does all it says on here is that it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.230 
it does all it says on here is that it
the<00:01:30.060> new<00:01:30.840> firmware<00:01:31.290> supports<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.280> new<00:01:32.490> nickel

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the new firmware supports the new nickel

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.160 
the new firmware supports the new nickel
800<00:01:33.810> millimeter<00:01:34.229> lens<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.540> that's<00:01:36.990> all

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
800 millimeter lens so if that's all

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.679 
800 millimeter lens so if that's all
they've<00:01:37.320> added<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:39.420> really

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
they've added then that's not really

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.140 
they've added then that's not really
going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.960> apply<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> many<00:01:40.619> people<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:42.030> it's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
going to apply to many people but it's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.760 
going to apply to many people but it's
always<00:01:42.329> worth<00:01:42.450> doing<00:01:42.930> firmware<00:01:43.439> updates

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
always worth doing firmware updates

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.330 
always worth doing firmware updates
anywhere<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.549> keep<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.939> updated<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
anywhere just to keep it updated and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.230 
anywhere just to keep it updated and
even<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> doesn't<00:01:47.670> really<00:01:47.820> add<00:01:47.909> anything

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
even if it doesn't really add anything

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.780

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
then puts a new folder called d7 in the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.940 
then puts a new folder called d7 in the
update<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:09.400> then<00:03:09.819> that<00:03:10.060> contains<00:03:10.629> a<00:03:10.959> bin<00:03:11.590> file

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
update and then that contains a bin file

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.399

now<00:03:12.909> what<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.209> need<00:03:13.359> to<00:03:13.480> do<00:03:13.659> is<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.170> need<00:03:14.290> to

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
now what you need to do is you need to

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.339 
now what you need to do is you need to
copy<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.920> bin<00:03:15.159> file<00:03:15.489> on<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.510> compact<00:03:17.109> flash

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
copy this bin file on to a compact flash

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.009 
copy this bin file on to a compact flash
card<00:03:18.060> it's<00:03:19.060> best<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.419> make<00:03:19.569> sure<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.930> the

card is fully formatted and empty

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.809 
card is fully formatted and empty
because<00:03:22.569> then<00:03:22.720> it'll<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:22.959> easier<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.829> find<00:03:24.579> it

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
because then it'll be easier to find it

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.119 
because then it'll be easier to find it
once<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.209> get<00:03:25.329> it<00:03:25.419> back<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.750> camera<00:03:26.129> so

copy that to a compact flash card and

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.490 
copy that to a compact flash card and
then<00:03:30.519> we'll<00:03:30.760> go<00:03:30.879> back<00:03:30.910> over<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.810> camera<00:03:32.230> to

just leave that to go on with it and
come<00:04:17.260> back<00:04:17.440> when<00:04:17.709> it's<00:04:17.859> finished<00:04:19.949> ok<00:04:20.949> we're<00:04:21.190> on

the<00:04:21.370> last<00:04:21.549> bar<00:04:21.880> now<00:04:22.180> hopefully<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.780> shouldn't

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
the last bar now hopefully it shouldn't

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.670 
the last bar now hopefully it shouldn't
be<00:04:23.260> too<00:04:23.409> much<00:04:23.560> longer<00:04:23.800> there<00:04:24.219> it<00:04:24.310> goes

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.809 

hopefully<00:04:27.680> at<00:04:27.830> any<00:04:28.069> second

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
hopefully at any second

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.969 
hopefully at any second
there<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.300> goes<00:04:29.449> okay<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.349> what's<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.650> update

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
there it goes okay so what's the update

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.230 
there it goes okay so what's the update
is<00:04:31.159> complete<00:04:31.280> turn<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> camera<00:04:32.720> off<00:04:33.849> and<00:04:34.849> they

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
is complete turn the camera off and they

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.640 
is complete turn the camera off and they
can<00:04:35.300> actually<00:04:35.569> recommend<00:04:36.110> that<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.289> leave<00:04:36.500> it

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
can actually recommend that you leave it

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.020 
can actually recommend that you leave it
switched<00:04:36.919> off<00:04:37.129> for<00:04:37.159> a<00:04:37.370> little<00:04:37.490> while<00:04:37.639> I<00:04:37.970> think

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
switched off for a little while I think

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.409 
switched off for a little while I think
they<00:04:38.300> said<00:04:38.539> something<00:04:38.780> like<00:04:38.990> 10<00:04:39.259> seconds<00:04:39.889> and

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
they said something like 10 seconds and

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.790 
they said something like 10 seconds and
but<00:04:41.419> I'll<00:04:41.509> just<00:04:41.539> I'll<00:04:42.020> leave<00:04:42.259> it<00:04:42.379> off<00:04:42.470> for<00:04:42.500> a

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
but I'll just I'll leave it off for a

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.899 
but I'll just I'll leave it off for a
couple<00:04:43.129> more<00:04:43.849> than<00:04:44.060> naps<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.539> make<00:04:44.690> sure<00:04:44.900> and

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909
