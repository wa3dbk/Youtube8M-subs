00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
the song I had the feeling that there

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.729 
the song I had the feeling that there
were<00:03:42.180> two<00:03:42.420> people<00:03:42.810> singing<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.109> song<00:03:43.380> because

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
were two people singing the song because

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.020 
were two people singing the song because
of<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.889> way<00:03:44.100> she<00:03:44.280> portrayed<00:03:44.700> at<00:03:44.880> two

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
of the way she portrayed at two

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.030 
of the way she portrayed at two
different<00:03:45.389> Cadence's<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.530> changes<00:03:46.920> in

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
different Cadence's and the changes in

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.379 
different Cadence's and the changes in
the<00:03:47.130> musical<00:03:47.519> arrangements<00:03:48.120> helped<00:03:48.299> to

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
the musical arrangements helped to

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.330 
the musical arrangements helped to
emphasize<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.440> think<00:03:49.799> my<00:03:49.889> favorite<00:03:50.280> part

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
emphasize this I think my favorite part

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.949 
emphasize this I think my favorite part
of<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.670> song<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:50.910> when<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.329> real<00:03:51.540> game<00:03:51.810> has

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
of the song is when the real game has

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.780 
of the song is when the real game has
tries<00:03:52.139> to<00:03:52.290> push<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.769> minecart<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.549> caves

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
tries to push the minecart in the caves

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.180 
tries to push the minecart in the caves

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
not only can you see the desperation in

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.800 
not only can you see the desperation in
her<00:03:56.220> actions<00:03:56.760> but<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.000> can<00:03:57.120> hear<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.599> in<00:03:57.690> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
her actions but you can hear it in the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.870 
her actions but you can hear it in the
way<00:03:57.930> she<00:03:57.959> sings<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:59.190> little<00:03:59.639> bit<00:03:59.849> of

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
way she sings and that little bit of

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.849 
way she sings and that little bit of
extra<00:04:00.269> conviction<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.989> what<00:04:01.139> made<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.620> song
