00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
inspiration for building comes from a

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.279 
inspiration for building comes from a
lot<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.409> different<00:01:41.590> places<00:01:41.920> but<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.659> mean<00:01:44.200> it's

always used cannon you know I'm pretty

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.920 
always used cannon you know I'm pretty
much<00:02:36.550> anything<00:02:36.879> that<00:02:37.090> I've<00:02:37.330> done<00:02:37.360> if<00:02:37.720> they<00:02:37.810> had

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
much anything that I've done if they had

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.050 
much anything that I've done if they had
to<00:02:38.019> do<00:02:38.140> with<00:02:38.290> filtering<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.950> motor<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
to do with filtering a motor the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.910 
to do with filtering a motor the
filtering<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.540> intake<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.110> was<00:02:41.260> using<00:02:41.440> cannon

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
filtering the intake I was using cannon

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.220 
filtering the intake I was using cannon
I<00:02:42.489> mean<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.180> when<00:02:43.540> we<00:02:43.629> like<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.080> air

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
I mean we when we like to do it air

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.920 
I mean we when we like to do it air
cleaner<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.069> k-9<00:02:45.430> was<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:46.360> know<00:02:46.480> kind<00:02:46.840> of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
cleaner the k-9 was you know kind of

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.800 
cleaner the k-9 was you know kind of
like<00:02:47.110> our<00:02:47.730> basis<00:02:48.730> for<00:02:48.970> what<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.659> how<00:02:49.750> we

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
like our basis for what and how we

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.170 
like our basis for what and how we
designed<00:02:50.319> our<00:02:50.470> product<00:02:50.890> around<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.819> filter

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
designed our product around the filter

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.199 
designed our product around the filter
you<00:02:52.360> know<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:53.459> mean<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.580> can't<00:02:54.909> you<00:02:55.060> just

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
you know I mean I you can't you just

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.059 
you know I mean I you can't you just
can't<00:02:55.420> give<00:02:55.569> better<00:02:55.780> filtration<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.680> does<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
can't give better filtration it does the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.490 
can't give better filtration it does the
job<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.550> increases<00:02:57.909> performance<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.660> lasts

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
job and increases performance it lasts

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.150 
job and increases performance it lasts
you<00:02:59.560> can<00:02:59.770> wash<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.010> you

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
you can wash it you

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.430 
you can wash it you
it's<00:03:01.370> it's<00:03:02.240> in<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.840> long<00:03:03.020> run<00:03:03.290> it's

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
it's it's in the long run it's

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.710 
it's it's in the long run it's
economically<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.760> economically<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.570> right

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
economically it's economically the right

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.020 
economically it's economically the right
decision<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.950> products<00:03:07.310> that<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.550> sell<00:03:07.760> with

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
decision the products that we sell with

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.560 
decision the products that we sell with
K&amp;N<00:03:08.540> filters<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.830> think<00:03:10.700> what<00:03:10.910> we've<00:03:11.090> done<00:03:11.360> with

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
K&amp;N filters I think what we've done with

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.150 
K&amp;N filters I think what we've done with
that<00:03:11.750> product<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.260> kind<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.530> saw<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.100> the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
that product is kind of saw in the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.320 
that product is kind of saw in the
marketplace<00:03:13.610> there<00:03:13.790> was<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> bit<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.240> an

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
marketplace there was a bit of an

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.180 
marketplace there was a bit of an
opening<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.900> for<00:03:15.080> us<00:03:15.200> we<00:03:15.620> wanted<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.010> offer

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
opening and for us we wanted to offer

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.000 
opening and for us we wanted to offer
something<00:03:16.550> that<00:03:16.820> was<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:16.970> higher<00:03:17.240> price<00:03:17.510> point

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
something that was a higher price point

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.530 
something that was a higher price point
in<00:03:19.010> something<00:03:19.430> that<00:03:19.520> wasn't<00:03:19.730> available<00:03:19.910> yet

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
in something that wasn't available yet

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.990 
in something that wasn't available yet
and<00:03:20.840> we<00:03:21.740> kind<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.070> opened<00:03:22.460> up<00:03:22.550> like<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.790> new

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
and we kind of opened up like a new

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.490 
and we kind of opened up like a new
market<00:03:23.390> segment<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.960> higher<00:03:24.170> price<00:03:24.470> point

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
market segment a higher price point

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.920 
market segment a higher price point
segment<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.310> know<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.760> it's<00:03:26.120> easy<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.780> do

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
segment you know and it's easy to do

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.810 
segment you know and it's easy to do
that<00:03:26.960> when<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.320> have<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:28.430> best-performing

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
that when you have the best-performing

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.110 
that when you have the best-performing
filter<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.660> market<00:03:30.020> and<00:03:30.950> then<00:03:31.310> our<00:03:31.790> design

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
filter in the market and then our design

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.630 
filter in the market and then our design
wrapped<00:03:32.570> around<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.190> got<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.550> high

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
wrapped around that so you got the high

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.910 
wrapped around that so you got the high
performance<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.420> got<00:03:35.740> something<00:03:36.740> that's

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
performance you got something that's
