00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.950
 and arrangement adapted to the needs 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.930
 become 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.050
 recommended for pressure-sensitive products 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.849
 Packing in protective atmosphere 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.560

 a visor in the lid brings 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.660
 transparency in the work process 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.940
 Optionally, the control can be connected to a 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.260
 external arm above the vacuum chamber 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.720
 be assembled custom-made are 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.560
