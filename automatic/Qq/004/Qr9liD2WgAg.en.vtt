00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
Annie Annie trivia not unsure be an each

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.460 
Annie Annie trivia not unsure be an each
of<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> few<00:01:42.479> other<00:01:42.689> stars<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.290> there

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
of it and a few other stars in there

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.130 
of it and a few other stars in there
like<00:01:43.710> Bertrand<00:01:44.220> frimpong<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.869> was<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
like Bertrand frimpong as it was in it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.730 
like Bertrand frimpong as it was in it
last<00:01:46.290> year<00:01:46.670> karkar<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.850> well<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.740> everyone

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
last year karkar as well and everyone

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.219 
last year karkar as well and everyone
else<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.610> hopefully<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.030> team<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:51.899> change

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
else so hopefully this team will change

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.620 
else so hopefully this team will change
over<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.920> coming<00:01:53.100> weeks<00:01:53.220> maybe<00:01:54.210> months<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
over the coming weeks maybe months it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.780 
over the coming weeks maybe months it
depends<00:01:54.930> how<00:01:54.960> long<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.259> systematic<00:01:55.790> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
depends how long the systematic and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.889 
depends how long the systematic and
hopefully<00:01:57.180> you'll<00:01:57.360> understand<00:01:57.719> what's<00:01:57.840> going
