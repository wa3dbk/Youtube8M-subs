 Hello, good people, how are you? 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.119
 here we are in another gameplay and design 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.060
 Thank you very much everyone for participating in 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.189
 the questions and answers that I already 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.079
 I get on my nerves and well let's 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.360
 start with the first question of this 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.699
 week and my third says how I started 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.110
 upload good videos I started uploading videos 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.180
 as many of you know by the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.040
 mere fact that there were other people who 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.199
 was dedicated to upload videos that tried 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.309
 help advice the opinions and 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.500
 logically it occurred to me the idea 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.030
 to try and logically I have tried and 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.829
 here they are good here we are many 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.510
 times all for the support by the way 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.400
 roberto muÃ±oz because you like the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.699
 videogames those of things also you 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.100
 I like them good I like videogames 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.390
 because every time I play you transmit a 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.600
 different thing there are times that the mind of 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.670
 rather strange sensations and especially 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.500
 the fact of how well you spend it to the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.970
 time to play with them not then by 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.040
 that is one of the reasons for not 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.229
 we are facing video games and from 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.860
 cars and I like the truth 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 like car 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.950
 not so much as for example I like the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.690
 shooter or platform games the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.100
 adventure is to say that in those of cars and 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.160
 motorcycles and that kind of things do not go 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.140
 so much the kisses for example that is 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.730
 soccer but in general they do not raise 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.340
 all of cars I tell you also that 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.979
 is painful playing with cars well this one 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.750
 wr Hard nougat that made you start in 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.070
 youtube and what has been the moment thing 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.290
 what did you like most about being here 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.479
 good is what made me start in 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.370
 youtube one of the things that made me 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.530
 start at it was the fact of seeing 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.540
 people like said before and that these people 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.070
 that he gave to others and especially good 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540
 that they did not and it's something that 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.950
 you really do it because you like it 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.590
 you know that this time that I like 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.960
 then the second question what else I 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.330
 he liked it is the fact of the people who 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.680
 do you know in the support that the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.940
 functions that is done is that in the end 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.950
 part of your dreams can be made 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.360
 reality in order and especially the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.100
 moments that happens is that also agents 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.899
 that you know and especially the moment that 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.750
 happens with all of us is something that is 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.400
 Amazing unique and difficult to explain but 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.620
 I mostly spend it quite a lot 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.269
 I thank everyone for that opportunity 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.620
 in this world because things are 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.690
 very difficult 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:28.409
 everything well that I like logically 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.090
 good 899 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:35.040
 if you liked this we would like to have 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.959
 walker because there are three not played what 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.849
 I've seen and from what I've seen is a 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.440
 I play totally from them 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.629
 creators that in favor of veterans 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.549
 remember I remember remembering that is 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.200
 pretty good that I do not have to try it and 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.860
 I when I buy most insurance 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.860
 they 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.410
 what is your first console the first 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.569
 videogame the question is interesting my 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.849
 first console was the ps one that is 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:05.459
 like the slim now in playstation 3 but 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:07.500
 the small version of full and that game 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.329
 it was the first one that will cut remembered 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.030
 I do not play his songs but Swedish 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.150
 banks fixed on your same friend the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.150
 Fox 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.190
 bugs tartan hercules the typical what 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.840
 that he usually plays when he and another 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.930
 question to login some 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.850
 projects from here to every 2030 good in 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.830
 2013 you eat so many things 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.600
 that will see to see what happens and I tell you 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.030
 I will tell you later these 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.230
 projects I plan to know but about 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.410
 I would like everything very much in the aspect 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.570
 is to put a lot into the channel and especially 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.950
 do something different not something that you call 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.110
 attention and that what actually happens 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.910
 to belong more to teachers is what 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.740
 that then it has time not to be so little 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.660
 detail because that already consumes time 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.240
 leave thinking because each video clear 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.780
 that I go up everything is thinking no no no 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.709
 directly or blood sheave 96 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.540
 what is your favorite ps3 game and judged 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.120
 the president is the one who has played the most 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.130
 been the resident evil 5 why because 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.470
 he is a player who transmits so many 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.750
 So many things and you spend so much 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.010
 well that is that he will not feel like playing 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.690
 it was played by a local guy last 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.890
 keep playing him is amazing and what 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.030
 I say that I have not proven that I tried it 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.440
 because to my taste is that the game that 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.530
 more I liked pressure 3 the 55 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.740
 logically Aaron Day 17 will end in 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.360
 he died for when he parts with his good the 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.850
 of the games with success you already know that 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.680
 lately I have very little time for 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.320
 record to mount the videos for all 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.600
 and logically a quiet that you will have 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.100
 to a game with subscribers of the most 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.360
 soon possible I will try to upload some 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.340
 have ever climbed some way 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.810
 tailors in white lathe because I have not 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.670
 had neither time to play much and 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.200
 I put it in game I'm in to give you a 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.360
 little bit of entertaining and I tell you 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.450
 very little game to play and well then 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.980
 nothing I hope you liked the 3-3 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.390
 put this week in this 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.460
 video game the next week be of 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.590
 staff the safest and nothing much 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.060
 all the x favorites and they give me question 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.770
 if you want in 2.0 that we continue doing 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.040
 nothing this last 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.040
 goodbye
