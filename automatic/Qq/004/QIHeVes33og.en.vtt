00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that often so you know I always just

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
that often so you know I always just
looked<00:01:56.730> at<00:01:56.880> everything<00:01:57.720> as<00:01:58.110> an<00:01:58.560> opportunity

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
looked at everything as an opportunity

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.000

rather<00:01:59.310> than<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.610> challenge<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.800> that's<00:02:01.800> that's

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
rather than a challenge so that's that's

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.500 
rather than a challenge so that's that's
that's<00:02:02.310> allowing<00:02:02.640> me<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> stay<00:02:02.940> positive<00:02:03.180> and
