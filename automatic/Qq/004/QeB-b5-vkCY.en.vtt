00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:11.130
 Speak there, youtube crew, it's okay. 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.000
 welcome to another video and people 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.040
 all right 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.529
 Good, we have a video here a little bit today. 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.050
 different is right is not a gameplay 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.930
 even because we are here in the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.330
 black ops two, I do not remember 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.699
 which one will not vote by posting videos as 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.099
 Frequent month, it's not going to compete. 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.320
 So let's say with the people who are 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.020
 doing black ops 2 and even politics 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.880
 bringing one of the videos a little 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.059
 with content that we do not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.390
 see a lot there for youtube certain people 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.219
 Well , today's subject would be like 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.940
 improve the cooling of your 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.550
 computer 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.879
 I'll explain a little bit how you 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.579
 puts our cullers started well cullers 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.460
 on your computer is it cooling it? 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.160
 best step having better performance 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.199
 certainly good I think that is the basis of everything 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.979
 you have to understand the following that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.979
 every hot user it rises and all air 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.869
 cold it then usually descends to part 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.570
 underneath your cabinet will be the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.570
 colder and the top will be the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.280
 hottest part of getting this hit 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.939
 Of course people can go to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.009
 base 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.080
 so the goalkeeper who will stay 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.290
 underneath it will pull the air in 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.110
 of the cabinet and the priest who will be in 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.150
 it will remove the hot air from the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.579
 inside the case and this will already give 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.259
 big difference for your computer 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.740
 It's okay, we make a good difference. 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.470
 a few degrees maybe if you do not change the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.899
 temperature will be giving an environment 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.920
 best for your parts to work right 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.259
 Nice people if you have a dvd burner 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.970
 and cd player all those things 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:57.560
 I advise you to leave it in the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.930
 middle bays because so or better 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.060
 depending if you have cooler on top 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.219
 You look good on top. 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.619
 it's not because of that the heat is going to hit 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.229
 come back and stay there 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.660
 on top and the club can withdraw 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.490
 You do not have a jump up 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.240
 I advise you to put more down 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.370
 because there the air will disperse more by 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.770
 inside a cabinet and then you can 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.090
 remove it or even probably the air 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.180
 cold that you are going to try 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.910
 removing it then has the right environment 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.100
 to have a little careful not okay 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.470
 leaving the pieces too close together 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.700
 is not who is leaving hd reader 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.590
 dvd very close because the reader it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.170
 very hot as well as hd 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.360
 so you have to leave it a little 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.820
 Other not to have trouble, people. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.410
 good we also have video cards that 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.930
 in my opinion are one of the most 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.450
 important of our computers and 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.430
 many of the video cards they 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.230
 has no cure for ars 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.630
 in them they are more always only has one 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.790
 sink something like this is 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.670
 interesting for this type of board is 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 that your motherboard leaves it below me 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.410
 I think all motherboards leave the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.660
 video card below the bottom of the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.300
 processor and in most offices 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.850
 have an air outlet an air inlet 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.230
 directly on the video card then these 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.870
 cases are very interesting, you are 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.140
 putting a cooler to vote for the cold air 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.890
 in there for cooling your plate 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.170
 of video 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.060
 obviously she does not have a jump I 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.750
 I went through this situation is for you 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.720
 They have a sense with the cooler off the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.350
 my video card reached 90 95 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.770
 degrees 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.360
 the cooler on it was not more than 60 is 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.040
 Interestingly, you 're doing this. 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.780
 The test may be that you do not see a 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.780
 result as great as it 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.060
 me but I think it will help you right 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.100
 Good people I think it was basically 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.800
 about video cards now let's go 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.880
 the processors that just like the board 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.060
 video is a very important part of 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.010
 of our good processor computers 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.570
 as we know he already has a club one 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.459
 that usually come from 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.310
 factory with him only in my 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.709
 opinion these spoons are very weak 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.680
 they do not realize that they are leaving their 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.420
 processor is well cooled when it comes to 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.730
 render a video my processor 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.919
 usually reaches 60 sixty-five 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.560
 degrees and this is something that sometimes 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.479
 I do not know why it's kinda worried, right? 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.410
 can be about what being and things 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.210
 like this 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.970
 So I advise you that you have a 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.390
 processor good at 5 and 7 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.670
 even the amd buldozer any model 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.240
 that is an obviously good model that 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.880
 no one is not so easy to clean 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.580
 they have is that the processor but 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.250
 which is a good processor I advise 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.980
 Are you changing your cooler for more than 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.490
 the original coming from intel and amd be 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.170
 Good, I advise, you're trading. 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.670
 of course if you live there at the north pole 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.080
 You will not be going through this. 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.540
 Maybe you'll have to be putting a 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.050
 Cooler to heat up your processor 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.640
 even because all the parts they have to 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.710
 working at a certain temperature 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:13.620
 just as our body is 36 degrees 36 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.480
 degrees below 40 degrees it does not 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.460
 works well above that also not 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.220
 then it would be basically this analogy 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.370
 so if you have a good processor I 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.890
 I advise you to spend 1 100 150 reais 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.390
 having a cooler nec will give you a 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.820
 greater security 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.310
 the cooler actor for you who does not know and 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.850
 healing right below right 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.190
 it is moved to water it is kind of a species 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.770
 radiators and how they have the most 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.610
 of the series of people with him help 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.080
 enough 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.330
 you can be using it on your board 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.970
 video or other places now I 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.880
 I 'm not sure if it's just in the processor 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.310
 Okay, so I think that's what I 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.740
 Wanted is bringing and people in my 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.169
 opinion I think it's very important you 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.230
 have some more courses from your 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.419
 computer to have one or two at a minimum 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.910
 of course if you live in a region that 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.240
 Do not be too hot, you do not have to have it. 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.150
 so much so, but it's still good to have you 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.490
 to keep your pieces between 30 and 35 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.280
 degrees at most is that you will be 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.800
 getting a much better result and is 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.550
 chance of being caught will be well 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.620
 smaller 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.210
 It's okay, people. I hope you 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.050
 I liked this video, I'm staying 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.610
 around here 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.500
 and remembering that if you liked this 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.880
 video leave your like since your 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.980
 Favorite is helping me in the 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.060
 disclosure certain people and I wanted to ask 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.860
 for you too 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.760
 we are reaching our goal that 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.430
 It's 15 light is right. 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.710
 You would be helping a lot and now 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.450
 with the black options I will decrease one 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.610
 the channel posts are all right 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.590
 I do not vote to stop liking but I go 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.260
 post two videos a week instead 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.090
 three as he had been doing even more or 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.590
 less the beginning of December I will do 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.510
 so you're right 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.980
 then I hope you have enjoyed 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.780
 remembering that if you are new to the channel 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.910
 click below what is on 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.950
 signing up and noting that my 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.870
 twitter is here in the video description tá 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.190
 Some people, then, thank you for that. 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.800
 Your attention, I hope you have 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.130
 liked and until the next video 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.130
 went
