00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
of both the front of house monitor mix

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.590 
of both the front of house monitor mix
and<00:00:22.560> whatever<00:00:23.160> your<00:00:23.490> voice<00:00:23.970> live<00:00:24.150> touch<00:00:24.180> or

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.029 
touch to is doing plus you want a third
F<00:00:27.390> X<00:00:27.570> 150<00:00:28.050> that's<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> carry<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> mono

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
F X 150 that's going to carry a mono

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.609 
F X 150 that's going to carry a mono
sound<00:00:29.340> version<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.150> those<00:00:30.810> stereo<00:00:31.260> signals

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
sound version of those stereo signals

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.870 
sound version of those stereo signals
you're<00:00:31.769> hearing<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.460> send<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you're hearing that you can send out to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880 
you're hearing that you can send out to
somewhere<00:00:33.510> outside<00:00:33.690> up<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> crowd<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:34.800> as

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
somewhere outside up to the crowd or as

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.600 
somewhere outside up to the crowd or as
a<00:00:34.920> different<00:00:35.280> monitor

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a different monitor

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.760 
a different monitor
so<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.540> think<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.110> best<00:00:37.260> way<00:00:37.440> you're<00:00:37.530> gonna<00:00:37.620> be

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
so I think the best way you're gonna be

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.020 
so I think the best way you're gonna be
able<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.980> achieve<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.520> actually<00:00:38.879> just

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
able to achieve this is actually just

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.270 
able to achieve this is actually just
through<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.239> little<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:39.840> wacky<00:00:40.739> wiring

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
through a little bit more wacky wiring

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
through a little bit more wacky wiring
than<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.730> through<00:00:42.030> using<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.450> mono<00:00:42.660> outs

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
than it is through using the mono outs

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
than it is through using the mono outs
of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.500> FX<00:00:43.770> 150<00:00:44.340> s<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.850> don't<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.210> an

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
of the FX 150 s we don't have an

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.209 
of the FX 150 s we don't have an
opportunity<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.960> send<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.260> stereo<00:00:46.620> signal<00:00:46.860> back

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
opportunity to send a stereo signal back

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.310 
opportunity to send a stereo signal back
out<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.550> any<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> XFX<00:00:48.420> 150<00:00:48.870> s<00:00:48.930> even<00:00:49.170> though

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
out of any of the XFX 150 s even though

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
out of any of the XFX 150 s even though
they<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.620> take<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.399> auxiliary<00:00:50.730> signal<00:00:51.239> in

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
they can take in the auxiliary signal in

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.420 
they can take in the auxiliary signal in
stereo<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.620> you're<00:00:52.890> gonna<00:00:52.980> want<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> make<00:00:53.370> sure

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
stereo so you're gonna want to make sure

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.189 
stereo so you're gonna want to make sure
that<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that you you do it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.049

kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.680> some<00:00:55.800> cabling<00:00:56.160> stuff<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.520> let

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
kind of with some cabling stuff so let

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.150 
kind of with some cabling stuff so let
me<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.270> make<00:00:57.329> sure<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.570> got<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:58.160> you

what<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> would<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.170> run<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> XLR<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:46.340> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
what I would do is run the XLR out to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.539 
what I would do is run the XLR out to
channel<00:01:47.729> 1<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.390> first<00:01:48.420> FX<00:01:49.259> 150<00:01:49.740> run<00:01:50.490> a

channel 1 of the second FX 150 put both

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.270 
channel 1 of the second FX 150 put both
of<00:01:57.840> these<00:01:58.200> units<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:59.100> channel<00:01:59.520> 1<00:01:59.549> mode<00:02:01.280> ok

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
of these units into channel 1 mode ok

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.770 
of these units into channel 1 mode ok
now<00:02:02.459> what<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:02.729> gonna<00:02:03.030> do<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.659> going

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
now what that's gonna do is it's going

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
now what that's gonna do is it's going
to<00:02:03.840> allow<00:02:03.959> you<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.259> only<00:02:04.799> send<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
to allow you to only send out of the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.850 
to allow you to only send out of the
output<00:02:05.880> what's<00:02:06.600> coming<00:02:07.080> in<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.350> channel<00:02:07.679> 1<00:02:07.830> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
output what's coming in to channel 1 and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.109 
output what's coming in to channel 1 and
that's<00:02:08.130> gonna<00:02:08.250> be<00:02:08.429> key<00:02:08.609> for<00:02:08.789> getting<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that's gonna be key for getting the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.690 
that's gonna be key for getting the
stuff<00:02:09.329> to<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.509> next<00:02:09.899> FX<00:02:10.259> 150<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.489> will

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
stuff to the next FX 150 so that will

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.789 
stuff to the next FX 150 so that will
allow<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.269> hear<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.870> Ziller<00:02:13.079> e<00:02:13.200> inputs<00:02:13.590> on

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
allow you to hear of Ziller e inputs on

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:14.990 
allow you to hear of Ziller e inputs on
these<00:02:13.980> ones<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.430> won't<00:02:14.579> send<00:02:14.790> them<00:02:14.880> back

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
these ones but it won't send them back

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000 
these ones but it won't send them back
up<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.269> outputs<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.709> would<00:02:16.799> do

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
up the outputs so then what I would do

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.080 
up the outputs so then what I would do
is<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.370> where<00:02:17.549> you<00:02:17.579> gonna<00:02:17.670> need<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.940> little

is this is where you gonna need a little

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.120 
is this is where you gonna need a little
bit<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.269> splitting<00:02:18.650> you're<00:02:19.650> gonna<00:02:19.739> want<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.070> go

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
bit of splitting you're gonna want to go

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.849 
bit of splitting you're gonna want to go
from<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.400> headphone<00:02:20.850> output<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.440> TCH

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
from the headphone output of the the TCH

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.890 
from the headphone output of the the TCH
unit<00:02:23.250> you're<00:02:23.730> gonna<00:02:23.910> want<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.239> split<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.510> twice

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
unit you're gonna want to split it twice

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.030 
unit you're gonna want to split it twice
so<00:02:24.930> you're<00:02:25.230> gonna<00:02:25.320> want<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.620> get<00:02:25.680> an<00:02:25.829> initial

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
so you're gonna want to get an initial

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.280 
so you're gonna want to get an initial
stereo<00:02:26.579> splitter<00:02:26.940> okay<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.660> from<00:02:28.260> that

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
stereo splitter okay and from that

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.440 
stereo splitter okay and from that
stereo<00:02:28.829> splitter<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.370> want<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.640> use<00:02:29.790> two<00:02:30.150> more

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
stereo splitter you want to use two more

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.849 
stereo splitter you want to use two more
stereo<00:02:30.930> cable<00:02:31.109> as<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.380> split<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.769> again

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
stereo cable as one split it again

stereo cable as one split it again
basically<00:02:32.489> split<00:02:32.730> twice<00:02:33.000> on<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.870> second

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
basically split twice on the second

basically split twice on the second
split<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.829> splits<00:02:34.950> into<00:02:35.190> two

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
coming in which is going to be a channel

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.320 
coming in which is going to be a channel
1<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.100> channel<00:03:41.250> 2<00:03:41.520> so<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.880> can<00:03:42.030> some<00:03:42.210> of<00:03:42.240> those

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
1 and channel 2 so you can some of those

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.610 
1 and channel 2 so you can some of those
together<00:03:42.630> yourself<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:43.200> make<00:03:43.350> sure<00:03:43.470> they're

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
together yourself just make sure they're

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.840 
together yourself just make sure they're
the<00:03:43.680> right<00:03:43.710> levels<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.340> you're<00:03:44.700> going<00:03:44.820> to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
the right levels and you're going to

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.310 
the right levels and you're going to
have<00:03:45.000> your<00:03:45.120> aux<00:03:45.300> input<00:03:45.720> coming<00:03:45.990> in<00:03:46.080> which<00:03:46.200> is

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
have your aux input coming in which is

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.920 
have your aux input coming in which is
going<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.530> automatically<00:03:47.070> sum<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.540> input

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
going to automatically sum the the input

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.050 
going to automatically sum the the input
from<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.260> TCH<00:03:49.680> unit<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.550> where<00:03:50.880> you're

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
from the TCH unit so where you're

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.760 
from the TCH unit so where you're
sitting<00:03:51.450> you're<00:03:51.780> gonna<00:03:51.900> have<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> stereo<00:03:52.500> mix

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
sitting you're gonna have a stereo mix

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.740 
sitting you're gonna have a stereo mix
of<00:03:52.980> your<00:03:53.280> front-of-house<00:03:53.700> mix<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.210> your<00:03:54.450> your

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
of your front-of-house mix and your your

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.570 
of your front-of-house mix and your your
TC<00:03:55.140> Helicon<00:03:55.260> unit<00:03:55.860> that's<00:03:56.010> coming<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.430> and

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
TC Helicon unit that's coming in and

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.280 
TC Helicon unit that's coming in and
you're<00:03:57.150> going<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.330> be<00:03:57.420> able<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.630> send<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:57.960> mix

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
you're going to be able to send that mix

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.530 
you're going to be able to send that mix
along<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.890> your<00:03:59.070> your<00:03:59.310> mono<00:03:59.550> third<00:03:59.970> device<00:04:00.300> I

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
along to your your mono third device I

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.970 
along to your your mono third device I
think<00:04:01.200> that's<00:04:01.350> what<00:04:01.500> you're<00:04:01.590> getting<00:04:01.740> at

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
think that's what you're getting at

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.770 
think that's what you're getting at
that's<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.730> way<00:04:02.850> I<00:04:02.880> would<00:04:03.270> do<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.690> a

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
that's the way I would do it it's a

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.360 
that's the way I would do it it's a
little<00:04:03.990> bit<00:04:04.110> more<00:04:04.260> complex<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.920> cabling

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
little bit more complex on the cabling

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.100 
little bit more complex on the cabling
setup<00:04:05.730> especially<00:04:05.910> getting<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.600> that

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
setup especially getting that that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.020 
setup especially getting that that
double<00:04:07.560> sort<00:04:07.770> of<00:04:07.860> stereo<00:04:08.220> split<00:04:08.640> coming<00:04:08.940> out

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
double sort of stereo split coming out

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.300 
double sort of stereo split coming out
of<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.210> headphone<00:04:09.570> output<00:04:10.010> but<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.040> think

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
of the headphone output but I think

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.070 
of the headphone output but I think
that's<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.580> easiest<00:04:11.850> way<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.120> go<00:04:12.360> considering

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
that's the easiest way to go considering

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.810 
that's the easiest way to go considering
that<00:04:13.170> we<00:04:13.290> can't<00:04:13.560> bring<00:04:13.800> anything<00:04:14.040> into<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.520> FX

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
that we can't bring anything into the FX

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.789 
that we can't bring anything into the FX
150<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.450> stereo<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:15.990> also<00:04:16.230> send<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.560> out<00:04:16.680> in

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
150 and stereo and also send it out in

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.560 
150 and stereo and also send it out in
stereo<00:04:17.070> we<00:04:17.190> have<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.430> turn<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.000> mono<00:04:18.270> so<00:04:18.510> I'm

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
stereo we have to turn to mono so I'm

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.380 
stereo we have to turn to mono so I'm
trying<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.870> get<00:04:19.380> over<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.770> little<00:04:19.950> hump<00:04:20.390> let

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
trying to get over that little hump let

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.850 
trying to get over that little hump let
me<00:04:21.480> know<00:04:21.600> if<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.080> hits<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.470> mark<00:04:22.650> for

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
me know if that that hits the mark for

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.020 
me know if that that hits the mark for
you<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.010> think<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.340> would<00:04:23.490> work

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
you I think that would work

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.780 
you I think that would work
alright<00:04:24.360> take<00:04:24.600> care
