Rachel and I have been experimenting
with<00:00:14.940> dyes<00:00:15.300> we've<00:00:16.260> been<00:00:16.440> inspired<00:00:16.740> by<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
archaeology when you explore things it's

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.090 
archaeology when you explore things it's
on<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> past<00:00:39.000> sometimes<00:00:39.899> little<00:00:40.590> fragments

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
on the past sometimes little fragments

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.299 
on the past sometimes little fragments
of<00:00:41.220> textiles<00:00:41.880> to<00:00:42.030> find<00:00:42.239> even<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
of textiles to find even way back to the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.660 
of textiles to find even way back to the
IMA<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.000> before<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> Romans<00:00:45.809> came<00:00:46.579> at<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
IMA so before the Romans came at the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.700 
IMA so before the Romans came at the
moment<00:00:48.149> they're<00:00:48.449> exploring<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.289> Saxon

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
moment they're exploring the Saxon

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.630 
moment they're exploring the Saxon
period<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.210> we've<00:00:51.480> got<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:52.309> range<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
period and here we've got a range of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.569 
period and here we've got a range of
colors<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.179> are<00:00:54.719> based<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.800> little

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
colors that are based on little

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.689 
colors that are based on little
fragments<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.300> fabric<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:59.190> been<00:00:59.370> found

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
fragments of fabric but have been found

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.799 
fragments of fabric but have been found
on<00:01:00.089> our<00:01:00.480> project

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
on our project

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.990 
on our project
so<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:03.039> usual<00:01:03.280> ones<00:01:03.820> that<00:01:04.180> turn<00:01:04.449> up<00:01:04.780> are<00:01:06.000> from

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
so the usual ones that turn up are from

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.560 
so the usual ones that turn up are from
matter<00:01:07.270> which<00:01:08.049> use<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.950> route<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:10.299> the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
matter which use the route that's the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.980 
matter which use the route that's the
Reds<00:01:11.009> weld<00:01:12.009> which<00:01:12.880> use<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.270> top<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.690> plant

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
Reds weld which use the top of the plant

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.160 
Reds weld which use the top of the plant
and<00:01:14.549> Road<00:01:15.549> where<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.150> use<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.570> leaf<00:01:16.810> from<00:01:17.110> the

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and Road where you use the leaf from the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.240 
and Road where you use the leaf from the
first<00:01:17.530> year<00:01:18.750> sometimes<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:20.020> can<00:01:20.170> over<00:01:20.590> die<00:01:20.770> so

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
first year sometimes you can over die so

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.790 
first year sometimes you can over die so
we've<00:01:21.460> got<00:01:21.700> greens<00:01:22.570> here<00:01:23.080> which<00:01:23.560> are<00:01:23.770> a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
we've got greens here which are a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.020 
we've got greens here which are a
combination<00:01:24.159> of<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.640> world<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:26.110> world

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
combination of the world and the world

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.149 
combination of the world and the world
these<00:01:28.030> very<00:01:28.420> bright<00:01:28.780> colors<00:01:29.290> are<00:01:29.649> actually

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
these very bright colors are actually

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.570 
these very bright colors are actually
achieved<00:01:30.520> by<00:01:30.790> using<00:01:31.149> mordant's<00:01:32.049> a<00:01:32.580> mordant

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
achieved by using mordant's a mordant

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.160 
achieved by using mordant's a mordant
means<00:01:33.910> some<00:01:34.509> sort<00:01:34.539> of<00:01:35.310> probably<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> mineral

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
means some sort of probably a mineral

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.370 
means some sort of probably a mineral
something<00:01:38.170> like<00:01:38.350> Allen<00:01:38.860> from<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.970> ground

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
something like Allen from the ground

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.080 
something like Allen from the ground
which<00:01:41.380> will<00:01:41.649> help<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.280> make<00:01:42.460> four<00:01:42.729> colors

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
which will help to make four colors

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.669 
which will help to make four colors
brighter<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:43.929> last<00:01:44.649> longer<00:01:46.530> we've<00:01:47.530> got

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
brighter and last longer we've got

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.960 
brighter and last longer we've got
another<00:01:47.979> sample<00:01:48.640> here<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.210> other<00:01:49.929> types<00:01:50.470> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
another sample here of other types of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.910 
another sample here of other types of
dyes<00:01:51.970> which<00:01:52.420> are<00:01:52.569> made<00:01:52.780> from<00:01:53.020> some<00:01:53.679> of<00:01:53.800> them

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
dyes which are made from some of them

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.510 
dyes which are made from some of them
are<00:01:54.039> from<00:01:54.190> box<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.630> at<00:01:56.050> this<00:01:56.319> end<00:01:56.649> we've<00:01:57.009> got<00:01:57.039> a

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
are from box so at this end we've got a

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.320 
are from box so at this end we've got a
altar<00:01:58.119> buckthorn<00:01:59.399> that's<00:02:00.399> been<00:02:00.670> changed<00:02:01.149> with

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
altar buckthorn that's been changed with

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.169 
altar buckthorn that's been changed with
iron<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:02.500> can<00:02:02.679> use<00:02:02.890> iron<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.550> actually<00:02:03.850> change

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
iron you can use iron to actually change

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.889 
iron you can use iron to actually change
the<00:02:04.509> color

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
the color

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.090 
the color
this<00:02:05.710> one's<00:02:05.950> birch<00:02:06.219> bark<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.860> one's

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
this one's birch bark and this one's

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.729 
this one's birch bark and this one's
wall<00:02:09.340> match<00:02:09.549> this<00:02:09.850> greeny<00:02:10.720> colour<00:02:10.869> here<00:02:11.560> is

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
wall match this greeny colour here is

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.590 
wall match this greeny colour here is
the<00:02:12.730> birch<00:02:13.030> has<00:02:13.720> been<00:02:14.049> modified<00:02:14.880> with<00:02:15.880> iron

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
the birch has been modified with iron

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.800 
the birch has been modified with iron
and<00:02:17.049> it's<00:02:17.380> turned<00:02:17.650> out<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.010> greeny<00:02:18.340> colour

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and it's turned out to the greeny colour

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.810 
and it's turned out to the greeny colour
and<00:02:19.810> sometimes<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.560> can<00:02:20.709> use<00:02:20.860> wild<00:02:21.310> plants

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
and sometimes you can use wild plants

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.350 
and sometimes you can use wild plants
from<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:23.290> fields<00:02:23.829> so<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:24.700> one<00:02:24.970> here<00:02:25.209> this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
from the fields so this one here this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.630 
from the fields so this one here this
group<00:02:25.660> here<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.049> yarrow<00:02:26.410> which<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.400> very

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
group here is yarrow which is very

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.110 
group here is yarrow which is very
common<00:02:28.150> plant<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.810> grows<00:02:28.989> on<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.829> Downs<00:02:30.120> so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
common plant that grows on the Downs so

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.910 
common plant that grows on the Downs so
it<00:02:31.269> makes<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.690> yellow<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.260> again<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.650> turns

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
it makes the yellow and again it turns

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.090 
it makes the yellow and again it turns
green<00:02:33.190> if<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.549> use<00:02:33.850> iron<00:02:34.359> in<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:36.010> this

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
green if you use iron in it and this

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.479 
green if you use iron in it and this
one's<00:02:36.340> called<00:02:36.519> dyers<00:02:36.760> green<00:02:37.150> lead<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.370> perhaps
