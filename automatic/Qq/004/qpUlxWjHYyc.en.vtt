00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.640 

I<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:18.430> we<00:00:18.550> see<00:00:18.730> a<00:00:18.760> trend<00:00:19.090> not<00:00:20.080> just<00:00:20.349> in<00:00:20.500> this

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
I think we see a trend not just in this

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.670 
I think we see a trend not just in this
country<00:00:21.070> really<00:00:21.340> around<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.119> world<00:00:22.680> where

churches<00:00:24.310> are<00:00:24.640> now<00:00:25.890> de-emphasizing<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:26.919> role

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
churches are now de-emphasizing the role

important<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:42.129> understand<00:00:42.699> prophecy<00:00:43.300> you

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
important to understand prophecy you

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.660 
important to understand prophecy you
really<00:00:44.110> can't<00:00:44.440> understand<00:00:45.010> it<00:00:45.129> so<00:00:45.280> what's<00:00:45.489> the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
really can't understand it so what's the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.660 
really can't understand it so what's the
point<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:46.059> studying<00:00:46.269> it<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.890> my<00:00:48.100> response<00:00:48.550> to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
point of studying it and my response to

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.240 
point of studying it and my response to
that<00:00:48.850> is<00:00:49.390> we<00:00:49.899> would<00:00:50.079> not<00:00:50.289> even<00:00:50.530> know<00:00:50.890> who<00:00:51.070> our

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
that is we would not even know who our

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.900 
that is we would not even know who our
Messiah<00:00:51.699> is<00:00:52.030> if<00:00:52.539> we<00:00:53.020> didn't<00:00:53.590> study<00:00:53.910> prophecy

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
Messiah is if we didn't study prophecy

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.959 
Messiah is if we didn't study prophecy
you<00:00:55.420> know<00:00:55.510> many<00:00:55.719> people<00:00:55.780> missed<00:00:56.609> the<00:00:57.609> Messiah

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
you know many people missed the Messiah

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.880 
you know many people missed the Messiah
when<00:00:58.210> he<00:00:58.270> came<00:00:58.570> that's<00:00:59.050> really<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.590> story

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
when he came that's really the story

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.069 
when he came that's really the story
that's<00:01:00.309> told<00:01:00.430> in<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.910> Gospels<00:01:01.420> over<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:01.899> over

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
that's told in the Gospels over and over

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.590 
that's told in the Gospels over and over
again<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.980> know<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:03.129> had<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:04.000> religious

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
again you know you had the the religious

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.710 
again you know you had the the religious
people<00:01:05.520> the<00:01:06.520> Pharisees<00:01:07.149> and<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.450> Sadducees

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
people the Pharisees and the Sadducees

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.180 
people the Pharisees and the Sadducees
who<00:01:08.080> didn't<00:01:08.740> understand<00:01:09.580> who<00:01:10.390> Jesus<00:01:11.229> was<00:01:11.259> when

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
who didn't understand who Jesus was when

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.490 
who didn't understand who Jesus was when
he<00:01:12.310> came<00:01:12.550> and<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.479> feared<00:01:13.840> that<00:01:14.080> when<00:01:14.229> he<00:01:14.320> comes

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
he came and I feared that when he comes

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.960 
he came and I feared that when he comes
the<00:01:14.619> second<00:01:15.100> time<00:01:15.130> they're<00:01:15.460> gonna<00:01:15.610> be<00:01:15.789> many

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
the second time they're gonna be many

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.700 
the second time they're gonna be many
people<00:01:16.179> in<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.570> church<00:01:16.840> who<00:01:17.229> don't<00:01:17.500> recognize

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
people in the church who don't recognize

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.790 
people in the church who don't recognize
who<00:01:18.520> Jesus<00:01:18.550> is<00:01:19.179> that's<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.929> real<00:01:20.110> problem<00:01:20.380> and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
who Jesus is that's a real problem and

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.919 
who Jesus is that's a real problem and
that's<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.340> very<00:01:21.550> good<00:01:21.910> reason<00:01:22.330> for<00:01:22.360> us<00:01:22.569> to<00:01:22.630> be

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
that's a very good reason for us to be

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.219 
that's a very good reason for us to be
studying<00:01:23.470> prophecy<00:01:24.009> so<00:01:24.970> we<00:01:25.240> know<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.899> general

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
studying prophecy so we know the general

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.740 
studying prophecy so we know the general
time<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:27.160> he's<00:01:27.340> coming<00:01:27.789> and<00:01:27.910> what<00:01:28.569> he's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
time that he's coming and what he's

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.389 
time that he's coming and what he's
going<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.110> do<00:01:29.470> because<00:01:29.709> he's<00:01:30.009> gonna<00:01:30.160> be<00:01:30.250> a

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
going to do because he's gonna be a

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.969 
going to do because he's gonna be a
different<00:01:30.729> kind<00:01:31.239> of<00:01:31.569> Messiah<00:01:31.989> he's<00:01:32.410> told<00:01:32.709> us

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
different kind of Messiah he's told us

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.279 
different kind of Messiah he's told us
this<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.399> gonna<00:01:33.520> be<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.759> different<00:01:34.239> face<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:34.810> I

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
this is gonna be a different face and I

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.900 
this is gonna be a different face and I
think<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.619> lot<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.800> people<00:01:36.190> who<00:01:36.610> don't

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
think a lot of people who don't

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.270 
think a lot of people who don't
understand<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.929> prophecies<00:01:38.500> for<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.860> Second

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
understand the prophecies for the Second

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.100 
understand the prophecies for the Second
Coming<00:01:39.459> are<00:01:39.729> going<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:40.000> be<00:01:40.149> lost<00:01:41.789> so<00:01:42.840> yes<00:01:43.840> I

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
Coming are going to be lost so yes I

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.389 
Coming are going to be lost so yes I
believe<00:01:44.170> there's<00:01:44.619> a<00:01:44.709> problem<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.280> church

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
believe there's a problem in the church

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.760 
believe there's a problem in the church
today<00:01:45.819> there's<00:01:46.450> a<00:01:46.509> problem<00:01:46.750> there's<00:01:47.259> lots<00:01:47.619> of

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
today there's a problem there's lots of

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.919 
today there's a problem there's lots of
problems<00:01:48.220> but<00:01:48.880> one<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.360> problems<00:01:49.750> is

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
problems but one of the problems is

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.279 
problems but one of the problems is
indeed<00:01:50.319> this<00:01:50.619> kind<00:01:51.580> of<00:01:51.959> attitude<00:01:52.959> toward

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
indeed this kind of attitude toward

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.070 
indeed this kind of attitude toward
prophecy<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:54.039> is<00:01:54.190> just<00:01:54.550> not<00:01:54.849> very<00:01:55.080> important

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
prophecy that is just not very important

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:06.730 
prophecy that is just not very important
and<00:01:56.380> we've<00:01:56.739> got<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:56.979> overcome<00:01:57.099> that

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.799
