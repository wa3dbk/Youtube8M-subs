they<00:00:28.140> both<00:00:28.349> aren't<00:00:28.650> too<00:00:28.949> different<00:00:29.490> from<00:00:29.580> each

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
they both aren't too different from each

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.700 
they both aren't too different from each
other<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.240> I'll<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.660> comparing<00:00:31.320> them<00:00:31.500> with

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
other so I'll be comparing them with

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770 
other so I'll be comparing them with
everything<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.790> mind<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.480> several

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
everything in mind we have several

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
everything in mind we have several
categories<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.920> let's<00:00:35.190> jump<00:00:35.550> right<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:36.000> first

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
categories so let's jump right in first

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.660 
categories so let's jump right in first
up<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> height<00:00:37.380> great<00:00:38.160> white<00:00:38.370> has<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
up is the height great white has a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.880 
up is the height great white has a
height<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.210> hundred<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.780> ten<00:00:40.050> feet<00:00:40.079> while

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
height of a hundred and ten feet while

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.580 
height of a hundred and ten feet while
grizzly<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.460> only<00:00:41.670> 87<00:00:42.120> feet<00:00:42.809> tall<00:00:43.050> so

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
grizzly is only 87 feet tall so

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.350 
grizzly is only 87 feet tall so
naturally<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.250> gonna<00:00:44.399> give<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.850> one<00:00:44.910> two

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
naturally I'm gonna give this one two

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.049 
naturally I'm gonna give this one two
great<00:00:45.840> white<00:00:46.110> next<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.460> drop<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
great white next up is the drop this is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.479 
great white next up is the drop this is
how<00:00:48.180> good<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.750> drop<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.260> neither<00:00:49.890> drop<00:00:50.309> is

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
how good the drop is neither drop is

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.060 
how good the drop is neither drop is
really<00:00:50.879> steep<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.600> great<00:00:52.199> whites<00:00:52.410> drop<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
really steep and great whites drop is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.790 
really steep and great whites drop is
actually<00:00:53.430> bigger<00:00:53.760> than<00:00:53.910> Grizzlies<00:00:54.870> height<00:00:55.199> so

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
actually bigger than Grizzlies height so

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.500 
actually bigger than Grizzlies height so
that<00:00:55.829> does<00:00:56.219> say<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> little<00:00:56.940> something<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that does say a little something but I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.880 
that does say a little something but I
think<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> great<00:00:58.170> White's<00:00:58.410> dropped

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
think the great White's dropped

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.400 
think the great White's dropped
despite<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> height<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> better<00:01:00.539> drop<00:01:00.870> next

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
despite the height is a better drop next

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.470 
despite the height is a better drop next
up<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> speed<00:01:02.399> when<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:02.969> comes<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.390> this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
up is the speed when it comes to this

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.119 
up is the speed when it comes to this
category<00:01:03.719> both<00:01:04.140> coasters<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.890> earning

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
category both coasters will be earning

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.580 
category both coasters will be earning
one<00:01:05.519> point<00:01:05.880> grizzly<00:01:06.479> reaches<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.990> top<00:01:07.229> speed<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
one point grizzly reaches a top speed of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.490 
one point grizzly reaches a top speed of
51<00:01:08.400> miles<00:01:08.610> per<00:01:08.760> hour<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.210> great<00:01:09.930> white<00:01:10.170> has<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
51 miles per hour and great white has a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.250 
51 miles per hour and great white has a
speed<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.189> 50<00:01:11.790> miles<00:01:12.030> per<00:01:12.210> hour<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
speed of 50 miles per hour because the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.620 
speed of 50 miles per hour because the
difference<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.740> only<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:14.280> mile<00:01:14.610> per<00:01:14.640> hour<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
difference is only one mile per hour you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.749 
difference is only one mile per hour you
really<00:01:16.080> aren't<00:01:16.350> gonna<00:01:16.619> notice<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.130> during

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
really aren't gonna notice that during

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.580 
really aren't gonna notice that during
the<00:01:17.880> ride<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.900> don't<00:01:19.140> care<00:01:19.229> about

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the ride and I really don't care about

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.320 
the ride and I really don't care about
that<00:01:19.860> 1<00:01:20.159> mile<00:01:20.400> per<00:01:20.430> hour<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.909> far<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.210> I'm

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that 1 mile per hour as far as I'm

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.539 
that 1 mile per hour as far as I'm
concerned<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.110> speed<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.680> equal<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.369> these

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
concerned the speed is equal with these

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.190 
concerned the speed is equal with these
two<00:01:23.700> coasters<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.150> both<00:01:24.509> are<00:01:24.780> gonna<00:01:25.020> be

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
two coasters so both are gonna be

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.170 
two coasters so both are gonna be
earning<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.740> point<00:01:26.100> next<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
earning that point next up is the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.240 
earning that point next up is the
smoothness<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.049> gotta<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.350> honest<00:01:28.740> grizzly

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
smoothness and I gotta be honest grizzly

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730 
smoothness and I gotta be honest grizzly
is<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> little<00:01:29.850> rough<00:01:30.150> around<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.630> edges<00:01:30.780> some

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
is a little rough around the edges some

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.140 
is a little rough around the edges some
lights<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> Grizzly<00:01:32.640> are<00:01:32.820> gonna<00:01:32.939> be

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
lights on the Grizzly are gonna be

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.940 
lights on the Grizzly are gonna be
really<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.200> they're<00:01:34.380> gonna<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.619> pretty

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
really good and they're gonna be pretty

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.580 
really good and they're gonna be pretty
smooth<00:01:35.280> other<00:01:35.759> rides<00:01:36.240> though<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:37.049> kind<00:01:37.439> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
smooth other rides though can be kind of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.980 
smooth other rides though can be kind of
rough<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> experienced<00:01:39.150> great<00:01:39.509> white<00:01:39.720> I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
rough when I experienced great white I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
rough when I experienced great white I
found<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:41.009> bit<00:01:41.310> smoother<00:01:42.119> than

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
found it to be a bit smoother than

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.870 
found it to be a bit smoother than
grizzly<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.259> great<00:01:43.619> white<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:44.100> earn<00:01:44.340> another

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
grizzly so great white will earn another

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
grizzly so great white will earn another
point<00:01:45.240> next<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> intensity<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.009> by

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
point next up is the intensity and by

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.190 
point next up is the intensity and by
far<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.549> grizzly<00:01:48.180> wins<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.689> great

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
far the grizzly wins this one great

far the grizzly wins this one great
white<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:50.070> fun<00:01:50.520> coaster<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.390> wouldn't

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
white is just a fun coaster I wouldn't

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.380 
white is just a fun coaster I wouldn't
say<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.290> very<00:01:52.530> intense<00:01:53.189> grizzly<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
say it's very intense grizzly on the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
say it's very intense grizzly on the
other<00:01:54.540> hand<00:01:54.840> has<00:01:55.259> some<00:01:55.500> intense<00:01:55.950> moments<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
other hand has some intense moments it

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.450 
other hand has some intense moments it
is<00:01:57.210> surrounded<00:01:57.780> completely<00:01:57.810> by<00:01:58.649> trees<00:01:59.219> so

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
is surrounded completely by trees so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.730 
is surrounded completely by trees so
it's<00:01:59.610> really<00:02:00.060> secluded<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.960> grizzly<00:02:01.560> goes

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it's really secluded and grizzly goes

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's really secluded and grizzly goes
through<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.040> tunnel<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.210> intense

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
through a tunnel that's a really intense

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.260 
through a tunnel that's a really intense
moment<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.560> has<00:02:04.740> some<00:02:04.979> sudden<00:02:05.430> turns<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
moment it has some sudden turns and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.119 
moment it has some sudden turns and
drops<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.960> grizzly<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.680> earning<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
drops so grizzly will be earning that

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.550 
drops so grizzly will be earning that
point<00:02:08.429> next<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.360> duration<00:02:09.780> what's
