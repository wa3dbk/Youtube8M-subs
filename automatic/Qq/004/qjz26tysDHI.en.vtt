powder<00:04:53.439> is<00:04:53.770> one<00:04:54.039> of<00:04:54.129> those<00:04:54.250> things<00:04:54.550> where<00:04:54.729> I

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
powder is one of those things where I

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.869 
powder is one of those things where I
think<00:04:54.819> you<00:04:55.120> should<00:04:55.300> probably<00:04:56.729> probably<00:04:57.729> go

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:57.879 
think you should probably probably go

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.189 
think you should probably probably go
for<00:04:58.030> one<00:04:58.180> that's<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.419> little<00:04:58.539> bit<00:04:58.870> more

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
for one that's a little bit more

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.860 
for one that's a little bit more
expensive<00:04:59.680> but<00:05:00.009> only<00:05:00.250> because<00:05:00.669> I<00:05:00.729> think<00:05:00.879> the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
expensive but only because I think the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.689 
expensive but only because I think the
technology<00:05:02.199> nowadays<00:05:02.800> is<00:05:02.979> so<00:05:03.129> advanced<00:05:03.580> that

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
technology nowadays is so advanced that

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.119 
technology nowadays is so advanced that

you like scraping the Parnes trying any
product<00:05:12.190> out<00:05:12.310> um<00:05:12.580> I<00:05:13.360> think<00:05:13.830> they're<00:05:14.830> ones<00:05:15.039> just

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
product out um I think they're ones just

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.219 
product out um I think they're ones just
perfect<00:05:15.759> because<00:05:15.879> it<00:05:16.270> mattes<00:05:16.539> the<00:05:16.750> face<00:05:16.960> but

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
perfect because it mattes the face but

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.779 
perfect because it mattes the face but
it<00:05:17.319> reflects<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:18.009> light<00:05:18.159> a<00:05:18.430> little<00:05:18.699> bit

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
it reflects the light a little bit

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.700 
it reflects the light a little bit
better<00:05:18.940> it<00:05:19.060> doesn't<00:05:19.479> reflect<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:20.319> off<00:05:20.469> your

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
better it doesn't reflect it off your

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.399 
better it doesn't reflect it off your
wrinkles<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.430> all<00:05:21.729> that<00:05:22.120> nonsense<00:05:22.990> that

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
wrinkles and all that nonsense that

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.290 
wrinkles and all that nonsense that
people<00:05:23.680> say<00:05:23.860> but<00:05:23.919> it's<00:05:24.819> a<00:05:24.969> really<00:05:25.180> really

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
people say but it's a really really

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300 
people say but it's a really really
great<00:05:25.689> loose<00:05:26.169> powder<00:05:26.439> it's<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.770> wonderful

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
great loose powder it's a wonderful

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.559 
great loose powder it's a wonderful
loose<00:05:27.430> powder<00:05:27.639> so<00:05:27.819> I<00:05:27.849> think<00:05:27.939> perhaps<00:05:28.090> spend<00:05:28.509> a

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
loose powder so I think perhaps spend a

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.119 
loose powder so I think perhaps spend a
little<00:05:28.689> bit<00:05:28.840> more<00:05:29.110> on<00:05:29.259> your<00:05:29.289> base<00:05:29.529> makeup<00:05:29.830> and

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
little bit more on your base makeup and

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:35.670 
little bit more on your base makeup and
solve<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.849> rest<00:05:31.060> and<00:05:31.509> bronzers<00:05:32.729> I<00:05:34.680> probably

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
solve the rest and bronzers I probably

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.409 
solve the rest and bronzers I probably
would<00:05:35.919> say<00:05:36.099> spend<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.400> tiny<00:05:36.729> bit<00:05:36.969> more<00:05:37.000> on

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
would say spend a tiny bit more on

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.640 
would say spend a tiny bit more on
bronze<00:05:37.629> or<00:05:37.810> get<00:05:38.020> one<00:05:38.169> that's<00:05:38.289> really<00:05:38.500> really

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
bronze or get one that's really really

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.950 
bronze or get one that's really really
fantastic<00:05:39.400> because<00:05:39.789> a<00:05:39.969> lot<00:05:40.180> of<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.389> drugstore

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
fantastic because a lot of the drugstore

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.170 
fantastic because a lot of the drugstore
bronzers<00:05:41.349> are<00:05:41.500> really<00:05:41.800> orange<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.550> when

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
bronzers are really orange and when

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.629 
bronzers are really orange and when
people<00:05:43.449> have<00:05:43.810> a<00:05:43.870> tan<00:05:44.199> naturally<00:05:44.770> yeah<00:05:45.370> ain't

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
people have a tan naturally yeah ain't

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.269 
people have a tan naturally yeah ain't
you<00:05:46.000> don't<00:05:46.210> tan<00:05:46.509> orange<00:05:46.839> so<00:05:47.469> I<00:05:47.500> think<00:05:47.830> probably

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279 
you don't tan orange so I think probably

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.909 
you don't tan orange so I think probably
