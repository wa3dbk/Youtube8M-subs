00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all so today I you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.290
 make a short video to show you 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.490
 how to watch any video 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.110
 on your playstation 4 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.519
 so first of all since your 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.500
 browser in the lead he'll have to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.760
 download the plex media program 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.720
 server so you go on plex point tv 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.660
 then it'll just the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.820
 winds gives the aude and you select 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 computer you just have to 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.980
 download the version that corresponds to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.040
 your computer so a lot of models 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.290
 to support the same linux you the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.340
 download and you have more than 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.790
 wait for that it's looking for 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.579
 quietly and you install it well 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.160
 obviously so I'm going to stop it because 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.090
 that way I'm already going once 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.910
 installed you just have to launch 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.760
 so here I am under mac os so it's 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.199
 in water the plex icon you under windows if 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.379
 you are under windows it will be downstairs 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.910
 normally next to them so where 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.160
 you have access to your media library so 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.390
 laughed already organized saw myself that I 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.780
 already will therefore continue to you to do 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.040
 your small categories 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.229
 make your small settings you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.950
 can retrieve episodes info 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.689
 and filmed jackets so here 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.490
 now we will go on the ps4 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.470
 you launch your browser 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.619
 internet he'll have to enter the address 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.909
 ip from your computer 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.299
 so I advise you to put it fix 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.979
 makes me grab url and makes you very 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.130
 exactly like me except you 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.210
 change your IP address well and you 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.040
 add a sign and then you are 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.350
 like on your computer you have 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.600
 access the media library you select 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.329
 the series where the movie you take 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.759
 the episode you want and it stays 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.890
 more than click on the ir and that's it 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.280
 get started you're going to have your episode 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.560
 you can put it in full screen and 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 and here it goes, so to know that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.579
 avi files are not supported 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.790
 by the ps4 tried several times that 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.190
 does not work 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.890
 do not hesitate to put an ip address 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.610
 fixed without your computer that is going 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.870
 host your media files so 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.820
 it will pick you up on the internet 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.970
 simple enough to find with your box and 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.920
 to set a fixed ip address like 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.000
 that's actually if the ip address and fixed to 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.550
 every time you go on your 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.470
 console you access from the sign and 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.460
 how are you going to launch plex media server on 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.680
 your TV directly 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.600
 otherwise you will have to constantly check your 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.670
 ip address which is not girl who 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.180
 will sound the return so it's enough 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.500
 hassle 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.940
 so here's what else I spent I 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.380
 you said that the files had 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.530
 they are not supported it takes mkv of 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.040
 mp4 it went so do not hesitate to 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.020
 convert 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.570
 so that's no I'll put you a 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.220
 link to a forum the forum playstation 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.470
 if you ever have questions 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.209
 do not hesitate to ask them there and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.690
 here I tell you very soon 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.690
