00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello guys and welcome to another one 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.870
 video and how they saw it in the title 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.420
 color combination of our 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.639
 favorite character of the comics for 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.469
 some and for some not so much flash 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.299
 macintosh let's start with the video 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.730
 that today selects plasty that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.529
 in comments of past videos of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.090
 color scheme called me 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.560
 flash and that's why I bring you the flash and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.380
 that then the first thing we need 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 it is preferably an environment if you 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.670
 you want to do with a war with 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 any other car then do what I 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 I always grab the centor not because I 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.739
 very much like its architecture as a car 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.660
 then let's do it with the environment 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.010
 ok once you already have the vehicle with 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.809
 who are going to do it, we're going to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550
 direct the right half saints horita 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.469
 I'm going to tell you the colors that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.079
 we need to look better at 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.820
 flash style our vehicle that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.950
 then as you see here we already enter the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 saints custom and the first thing that I go to 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 select will be the paintings not 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.610
 Then I would say that it looks better and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.079
 let's see go to the part of refinishing 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.090
 that you enter we are going to give you here we are going 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 to go to main color and in color 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.650
 main as you will know the character of 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.000
 flash of yours that is a matte color or that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.690
 then let's put a matte color 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.430
 but no 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.830
 worry we are still going to put more 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.630
 things here as we see we have the color 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.550
 matte red but it's not going to stay that way 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.680
 alone but we 're going to select the 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.110
 red color and after here we're going to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.150
 go to metals ok here we are simply going to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070
 see it I say we're going to go to metal and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.250
 here we are simply going to see the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.840
 metallic without selecting any ok a 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.600
 once done that we will give it back and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.940
 we will have to go to the part of the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.890
 plates where what is doing the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.300
 lights or what's here as you see I have what 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.430
 what are the lights being then 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.960
 we simply change the lights and a 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.270
 once the lights have changed 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.640
 what they will have to do is return to the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.050
 part of the repainting so that our 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.690
 matte color that does not let us have 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.160
 pearly may have a pearl that 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.170
 then here we are going to give you clarified 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.850
 and as you see, he lets us put the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.590
 pearly that we want a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.900
 matte color that normally is 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.800
 impossible ok once done this because 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.510
 you will be as simple as here to choose the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.340
 color that I'm going to tell you now 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.560
 is the one that fits him ok the color that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.600
 left is the yellow race so 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.220
 let me select it and how do you see it already 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.900
 has the color of lucrecia in our 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.510
 flash character not because as you will know 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.459
 it is common 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.799
 but it's an orange like that hits him 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.689
 orange is an orange that hits between 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.030
 red and orange and this is the color that 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:25.000
 it fits better and it's a matte color it's not 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.200
 what mainly select it ok 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.700
 once you have the yellow of 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.489
 race we're just going to go to 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.110
 secondary color and here we're going to go to 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.840
 the part of mate because if not 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.159
 I would agree a lot ok not me that too 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.780
 you have the metal ones because as 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.230
 you know our character is a character 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.549
 electric so let me see the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.400
 yellows that best fit as you see 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.750
 the yellow melon looks pretty good 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.549
 and also the racing yellow does not 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.930
 as we previously put a face 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.940
 of yellow racing I 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.799
 I recommend that you use that same there is no way 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.599
 as they see it, our car already has 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.579
 more shape than it is flash then 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.049
 let's put it this ok now let's 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.400
 go to the part of the wheels that 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.650
 you know that there is more to your liking 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.569
 but I recommend some then 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 let me go to the part of here of wheels 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.920
 and have risks in wheels let's go 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.510
 to wheels and as you see here we have many 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.549
 arribos what's here we have some of 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.889
 luxury and in this how is a character 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.900
 electrical I usually use one that 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.060
 better not one that has more shape 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.530
 as an electric touch as I could 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.240
 be this because it has a form 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.040
 of thunder and I think it's pretty 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.630
 well as you can see there are many that you 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.730
 they are more but I already tell them of a 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.830
 time this more is much more to your 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.630
 not like you see, there are so many that 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.640
 look pretty good but those who 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.650
 I recommend using for this combination of 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.910
 colors are going to be the ones that had already 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.459
 given previously is not then 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.230
 let me select it here we have them and 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.480
 As you can see they look pretty good ok 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.040
 color in our car already has enough 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.170
 shape of what our character would be 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.880
 of flash and apart has the touch of 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.550
 pretty similar color ok then 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.989
 simply here we are going to leave and 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.700
 As you see, we already have what's going 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.560
 making the beach vehicle that I 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.209
 I think it's pretty good ok then 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.100
 you tell me in the comments of 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.019
 that another character has have or 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.820
 they want color combination and I 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.530
 I will simply see the one that he likes the most 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.090
 the people or the one who puts the most and that is the 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.739
 I'll do the next gay chapter 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.569
 then he liked today's video 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.459

 more people I see that there are works and without more 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.139
 I decide to say goodbye goodbye 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.520
 ah 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.730
 ah
