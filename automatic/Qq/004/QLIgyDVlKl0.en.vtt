00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
up it's one to one it's a bit difficult

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.899 
up it's one to one it's a bit difficult
and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.220> what<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> thought<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.670> were<00:01:41.790> gonna

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and then what I thought we were gonna

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.969 
and then what I thought we were gonna
score<00:01:42.299> there's<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.750> goal<00:01:42.930> line<00:01:43.170> clearance<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
score there's a goal line clearance and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.920 
score there's a goal line clearance and
in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> 80th<00:01:44.610> minute<00:01:44.640> look<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.509> his<00:01:45.600> first

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
in the 80th minute look at his first

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
in the 80th minute look at his first
shot<00:01:46.229> keeper<00:01:47.040> couldn't<00:01:47.369> keep<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.579> one<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.270> I

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
shot keeper couldn't keep that one out I

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.770 
shot keeper couldn't keep that one out I
think<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.890> lucky<00:01:50.310> got<00:01:51.180> his<00:01:51.360> hand<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
think it was a bit lucky got his hand to
