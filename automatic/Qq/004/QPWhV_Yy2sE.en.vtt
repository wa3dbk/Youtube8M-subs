00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.660
 so hello everyone today i will show you how 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.230
 do oh damn not there an hour how to do 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.670
 in short 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.270
 shooting gallery but itâ€™s not the world 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.270
 here 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.610
 for starters, I'll show you a cartoon like this 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.090
 It looks then here we say 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.110
 we take an iron ingot here we lower it 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.470
 here we give it this way 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.220
 it's all 10 no matter come back now 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.940
 take a bow and arrows 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.800
 here it is necessary to get here 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.449
 gets out of the fence zara sensor water 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.010
 back 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:54.690
 there are distance marks for example 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.690
 from here, we're trying to get there 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.570
 here did not get 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.570
 who did not get 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.080
 vodka fall 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.840
 Now taking what falls out 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.030
 I formed, and so here for example as 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.900
 through to make 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.400
 its stars are actually very simple we 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.259
 let's go here where we are still hiding everything 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.479
 mechanisms here only using rostov 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.200
 and the piston foot here and so all 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.830
 looks like that is you put off the slab but 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.830
 so lead 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.799
 but now I will show how to create at all 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.369
 you get 0 that is , we take any 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:47.510
 material 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:51.260
 stones here you can take a lamp about stone 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.980
 from the pressure plate repeater repeat 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.330
 only one boat is needed 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.220
 here 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.900
 Now I will put a small 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.240
 pause 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.240
 right now someone 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.250
 so here we have done so here 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.230
 such a blank and you can do it 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.950
 arbitrary sizes most importantly plant 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.650
 here we were like this 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.790
 oath for example such a stone set 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.900
 now very light really 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.180
 the mechanism is necessary i need those pistons 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.180
 so put the piston like this 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.900
 or not well, well, no, no, not so much 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.819
 well well 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.409
 and here and so yes that's because all the correctly 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.409
 now the piston here 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.990
 how will it be here 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.160
 and here we are to my here 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.470
 and boat 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.840
 Well, she 's going to bathe in general 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.470
 Now what we do need to take a 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.800
 roadstone 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.390
 here it is done in this way 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.390
 how now here 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.480
 So 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.700
 that's kinship that's how we spend 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.760
 this time it is ours here 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.629
 us 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.629
 it is like this 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.680
 housing with a small ladder 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.550
 that's how you can not do wrong 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.280
 that's easier 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.530
 out of the state piled in 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.190
 well , one more time 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.130
 and redstone 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.800
 Well, now we can check 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.340
 here I have not done anything yet 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.650
 such that it has not yet made an award 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.430
 blocks but this is so round 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.319
 Onizuka will look like look 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:08.010
 now take a bow Well onions 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.010
 arrows 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.090
 we shoot him 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.849
 Insi and here it does not work now I 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.489
 show you the work yourself look to 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.680
 open a vodka and so we take here 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.900
 when i if he press plate here 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.960
 the piston goes down exactly by unzipped 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.810
 dollar waxed like this principle but without 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.300
 the boats they know very quickly here appreciates 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.130
 adab nipples also works with the boat even 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.220
 you can not put under 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.400
 to make a one-time block this to us 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.930
 very few resources will be required at the very 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:50.030
 In fact, the pickle is only one repeater 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:50.030
 here we do it here so we take away 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.130
 we can always turn here repeater 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.040
 set and here is the block itself is mud 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.330
 you can give out any other block 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.450
 let's say birch but so put here 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.700
 and looks rude like this 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.460
 biomass 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.030
 he is now watching 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.390
 tags 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.390
 nuq 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.330
 here let's say it was cut off by tolmases 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.330
 gets you 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.430
 very lightweight mechanism 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.290
 all all while subscribe leave 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.770
 comments on youtube 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.770
 I will be very glad
