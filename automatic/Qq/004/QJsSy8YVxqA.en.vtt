00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
over well pretty impressed with the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.620 
over well pretty impressed with the
organization<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.979> I'd<00:01:17.490> see<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.939> link

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
organization and I'd see the link

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.510 
organization and I'd see the link
conditions<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.320> pretty<00:01:19.560> even<00:01:20.009> whether<00:01:20.400> it's

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
conditions are pretty even whether it's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
conditions are pretty even whether it's
the<00:01:20.729> shot<00:01:21.000> pattern<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.290> long<00:01:22.470> pattern

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the shot pattern or the long pattern

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.940 
the shot pattern or the long pattern
it's<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.700> outright<00:01:24.420> simple<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.920> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's not outright simple it is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.260 
it's not outright simple it is
challenging<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> same<00:01:27.750> time

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
challenging but at the same time

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.139 
challenging but at the same time
it's<00:01:29.840> not<00:01:30.079> impossible<00:01:30.560> as<00:01:31.009> well<00:01:31.219> as<00:01:31.909> you<00:01:32.030> can

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
it's not impossible as well as you can

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.050 
it's not impossible as well as you can
see<00:01:32.210> from<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.659> scores<00:01:32.929> on<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.109> show<00:01:33.320> was

really<00:01:35.060> quite<00:01:35.710> decent<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.310> long<00:01:37.490> oil

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
really quite decent and the long oil

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.179 
really quite decent and the long oil
doesn't<00:01:38.539> seem<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.960> be<00:01:39.079> as<00:01:39.320> high<00:01:39.590> scoring<00:01:39.950> but

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
doesn't seem to be as high scoring but

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.330

relatively high you can see them that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.080 
relatively high you can see them that
which<00:02:26.290> has<00:02:26.530> like<00:02:26.800> dip<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.250> fifth<00:02:27.459> game<00:02:27.700> we

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
which has like dip in the fifth game we

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.060 
which has like dip in the fifth game we
encounter<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.990> pair<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.500> lanes<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.950> were

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
encounter a pair of lanes that were

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.270 
encounter a pair of lanes that were
quite<00:02:30.610> different<00:02:31.030> from<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.270> rest<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:33.040> carry

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
quite different from the rest the carry

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.930 
quite different from the rest the carry
wasn't<00:02:33.700> as<00:02:33.790> good<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.900> had<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.790> make<00:02:36.790> do

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
wasn't as good so we had to just make do

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.210 
wasn't as good so we had to just make do
with<00:02:37.090> what<00:02:37.209> we<00:02:37.239> could<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.830> where<00:02:38.830> we<00:02:38.920> went<00:02:39.100> to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
with what we could and where we went to

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.790 
with what we could and where we went to
the<00:02:39.310> last<00:02:39.520> pair<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:40.000> was<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.480> small<00:02:41.170> open<00:02:41.440> up<00:02:41.560> and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the last pair it was a small open up and

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.550 
the last pair it was a small open up and
we<00:02:42.040> grab<00:02:42.970> hold<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.360> chance<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:44.230> shoot<00:02:44.410> as

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
we grab hold of the chance to shoot as

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.900 
we grab hold of the chance to shoot as
high<00:02:44.709> as<00:02:44.770> we<00:02:44.890> could<00:02:45.070> make<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.610> very<00:02:45.640> much

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
high as we could make you very much

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.170 
high as we could make you very much
