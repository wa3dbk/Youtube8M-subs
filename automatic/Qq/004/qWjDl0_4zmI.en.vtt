00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.990
 there are no good kids here torete in a 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.899
 new video today I come to bring you a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.910
 good video then about something about a 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.889
 topic that is having a lot of buzz in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.540
 twitter on youtube and good that I am 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.610
 seeing that many of the youtubers are 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.049
 growths a lot of criticism and I'm going to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.119
 give my opinion about this because the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.699
 true that I think it is necessary and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.619
 I'm also excited about let's say 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.269
 half opinion and it is more than anything the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 answer to this bottom line because 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.900
 it is ideal for what I want 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.070
 comment and it's because youtubers do not 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.960
 they raise call of duty more warfare I think that 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.110
 the truth, I support them in that we do not 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.610
 come up for the following reason ie 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.800
 I really like the call of duty vale 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.210
 it's a game that I find incredible in 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.490
 think that you are losing more and more 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.410
 from two thin as it is always 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.390
 saying down congost and with this 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.070
 output of more guard for which is a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.530
 little that I like a lot but I think that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.450
 leave to be desired and sometimes it 's a bit 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.970
 alternative is not to say it's a bit 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.380
 random the game and that really not 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.800
 you can have too much control of the map 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.980
 which is what I like the most 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.440
 but well that's a good thing 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.850
 may like more or less and others 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.119
 can you taste more good so good 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.240
 that's not an excuse but what I do think is that 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:18.080
 is important for a video game is that 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.930
 let's say in single quotes and 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.729
 I'm going to say because if not for example that 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.600
 you dedicate yourself to the competitive for example 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.729
 as I go to have the same really like 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.440
 be the game itself is not something that you 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.350
 matter is that the maps are good that 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.770
 the responses say that weapons are 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.929
 balanced and that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.479
 a little more the metal in is a bit 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.280
 good but you really do not need 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.320
 too much for the game to be good 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.450
 however for youtube what it does is 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.130
 more than anything is to play public then 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.020
 well then we go to the meaning of 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.469
 public the first sense not me 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.429
 It's good to me every time 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.679
 day 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.360
 It is more advanced and what it entails 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.039
 that everyone wants to get good 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.539
 departures this in modern warfare 3 no 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.280
 it happened a lot of people obviously wanted 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.929
 get good games but it's not like 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.850
 now it's not like now because now 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.799
 everything has progressed and the people and well 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.650
 is more involved let's say and there's 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.799
 so many inexperienced players by 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.319
 say it in some way however as 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.760
 this is reducing the only way to 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.160
 meeting them is becoming 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.660
 overflow busti I do not know how famous that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.459
 So much excitement has called and as you see in 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.769
 the game is six against one and 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.410
 this is the reason why many of 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.180
 youtubers do not upload games on 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.560
 problem is that you need a lot of time 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.299
 to get you a game then 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.269
 imagine a youtuber that goes up 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.530
 minecraft climbing the 5 gta that goes up more 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.300
 videos 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.450
 whatever it goes up in four 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.459
 video games and they have to be recording 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.590
 Well, in each four days every day or 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.000
 three videos or two million in general 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.740
 that you have to paste five hours in 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.750
 the call of duty bitter because 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.700
 really when you're playing for 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.720
 pull out a battery juas bitter and 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.510
 another person and in another game with injuries 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.819
 two hours to imagine to say that 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.800
 but you play two hours having fun 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.150
 it's the same thing is to say I for example 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.190
 when I'm going to play each tool for 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.959
 get me a DNA or things like these do not 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.519
 I have fun I do not have fun because it is not 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.120
 funny though in modern warfare 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.470
 3 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.330
 I played public and always good 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.739
 fun did not matter if I left with 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.180
 a good game or not then obviously 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.620
 there were games that there were many 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.090
 champions so good but that's something 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.730
 Average but three hours you fun 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.709
 in every two days warfare goes mostly 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.660
 of the works that you hit you hit you I do not know 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.760
 why I do not know if it's because of the people who 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.980
 is playing if it is for the game I do not know 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.230
 What I do know is that 80% of 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.000
 templates passes the following one that are 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.530
 very good opposites and that is a 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.750
 rare game and you can not get a 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.060
 good game with which it does not help in 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.599
 Youtube 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.330
 or else the enemies leave then 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.640
 imagine you have to be let's say 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.560
 counting all those things for 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.940
 get a good kick today that they give 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.739
 all those circumstances to get a 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.260
 good quality because you really do not 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.030
 have fun and if a youtube does not have fun 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.190
 can not express the fun to 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.260
 you mean me when I have fun 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.209
 in a game it shows and people are 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.890
 have fun with me when I do not have fun 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.980
 it's impossible for me to really get 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.480
 well you can not express for very 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.549
 well 1500 you can not express happiness 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.560
 when you are really sad that is in 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.200
 a video can not do that no 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.510
 you need to be motivated happy happy 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.520
 when you are in a bad mood and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.919
 you comment a game of the people of and you 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.229
 you see a bit so discouraged, it is that if 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.270
 it's not very easy then if a youtube 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.590
 what you need to do good youtube 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.500
 you write us the vast majority do not 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.450
 as well as others who are bio 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.530
 of people who say news that is by 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.389
 such as angel and Saras to do 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.919
 news and so on then really 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.930
 you do not have to be happy or there is 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.420
 or nothing has to explain things to you 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.000
 that there is the news and I think 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.800
 I think it's a great channel but it does not have 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.230
 that express that however for example 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.720
 I will give an example so close to me 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.830
 not the frank channel that is sometimes 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.050
 having criticisms that are not of 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.390
 character or diaz vas warfare and I think 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.190
 that he does it well that is to say if he does not 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.050
 have fun playing the call of duty all 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.460
 The days can not go up all 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.890
 the split days however when he 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.110
 have fun as a game goes up 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.360
 consumes a game in September and goes up 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.490
 a pin and it goes up having fun and 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.020
 well then destroying frank the 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.850
 What luck you have is that for a little bit 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.350
 play really is very good when 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.050
 one day all the herons 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.480
 also many say no that was good 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.490
 boys no longer compete so much the other 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.610
 day for example so that you can make a 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.470
 idea was when you guajes not with your 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.390
 account but with mine was we were 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.950
 here in streaming and we were also 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.560
 laughing for a while without more right we were 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.570
 everything was left and the language was fine 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.630
 so it really has a very high level 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.370
 very good but did not dare, not fun 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.410
 it can be four and a half hours playing 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.780
 to get a game out I know what 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.370
 I understand I would not play a game if I did not 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.880
 I'm having fun, I can not, I can not 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.220
 But if you feel like sleep 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.630
 it's perfect but you can not play something 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.460
 you can not criticize someone for leaving 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.470
 to play a game if you no longer have fun 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.020
 people say it's not because it has less 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.220
 it costs me no no that's why it's a 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.950
 person who has both his criteria 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.250
 really that you can upload whatever you want 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.110
 and they will see it then, if you raise it 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.610
 because he likes it but if he does not upload it 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.380
 it's because maybe it's not fun it would be 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.450
 playing here dutti is as simple as that 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.650
 I think you do not have to criticize that 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.270
 professional or what are you going to get is 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.220
 that people have never taken 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.890
 tinning or get to play it does not 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.320
 so good is my opinion 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.370
 then you have to respect every opinion of 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.080
 every person and the truth is that before 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.250
 he said he was just going to play every day and 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.930
 however now I am playing others 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.760
 games in which I'm not climbing 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.740
 youtube because you can see that I'm not 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.870
 climbing but nevertheless I have a fun 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.370
 lots and more than call of duty because 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.300
 I'm realizing that every day 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.350
 just fun sometimes is not a blip 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.419
 when you're trying to get a 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.430
 game for youtube not and because 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:56.070
 obviously when you know what I am, 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.020
 upload to youtube in general problem 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.330
 the hedge are split now that I'm 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.890
 going up league and added everything but as a rule 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.940
 general are games then if you 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.970
 you have to be aware of taking a 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.440
 game sometimes when you do not get through 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.720
 reason that is because there are times that no 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.880
 you have the same other days because it's going 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:16.529
 plus the connection for a thousand reasons or for 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.059
 thousand reasons then I think that 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.649
 and that really you have to do what 

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:21.659
 that you also like a youtube trace what 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:23.069
 I tell you I insist on that you need 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:25.259
 have fun so that people have fun 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:26.909
 with you if you do not have fun do not upload a 

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:29.489
 video we are not a video is my advice 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:32.399
 for at least for those who are 

00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:34.529
 starting or for those for whom 

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:36.359
 you have not really been around for a long time 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:37.229
 you can entertain anyone if not if you do not 

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:39.479
 enjoy this same 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:40.679
 nothing this leads to suffer I hope that you 

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:41.999
 like my opinion and that you leave me 

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:43.709
 your opinions for the comments 

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:45.179

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:47.759

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.719
