found it again a couple like a couple of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.109 
found it again a couple like a couple of
months<00:01:48.410> later<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:49.580> reasons<00:01:49.850> they<00:01:49.910> stopped

selling it was because I guess that they

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.639 
selling it was because I guess that they
