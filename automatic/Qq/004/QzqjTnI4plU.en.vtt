religion it's it is a scientific concept

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.330 
religion it's it is a scientific concept
it's<00:00:52.860> called<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> law<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.789> causality<00:00:54.390> like

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
it's called the law of causality like

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:03.609 
it's called the law of causality like
Newton's<00:00:56.960> laws<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:59.449> talking<00:01:00.449> about<00:01:02.239> reaction

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
Newton's laws are talking about reaction

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.950 
Newton's laws are talking about reaction
karma<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.650> simply<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> reaction<00:01:05.689> to<00:01:06.689> something

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
karma is simply a reaction to something

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.130 
karma is simply a reaction to something
that<00:01:08.150> has<00:01:09.150> already<00:01:09.330> taken<00:01:09.689> place<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.750> why<00:01:12.960> are

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that has already taken place so why are

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.950 
that has already taken place so why are
many<00:01:13.770> people<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.780> poor<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.700> answer<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.930> is

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
many people are poor the answer is it is

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.670 
many people are poor the answer is it is
karma<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.670> gamma<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.409> it's<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
karma what is gamma then it's not a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.149 
karma what is gamma then it's not a
metaphysical<00:01:23.130> concept<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.000> said<00:01:25.159> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
metaphysical concept as I said the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.100 
metaphysical concept as I said the
Buddha<00:01:26.340> himself<00:01:26.580> who<00:01:27.210> never<00:01:27.420> believed<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> God

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
Buddha himself who never believed in God

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.980 
Buddha himself who never believed in God
who<00:01:28.680> never<00:01:28.890> believed<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.430> soul<00:01:29.810> believed<00:01:30.810> in

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
who never believed in soul believed in

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.080 
who never believed in soul believed in
karma<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.619> then<00:01:31.770> define<00:01:32.490> karma<00:01:32.880> very

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
karma and then define karma very

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.660 
karma and then define karma very
beautifully<00:01:33.570> karma<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.590> only<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.220> thought

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
beautifully karma is just only a thought

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.560 
beautifully karma is just only a thought
process<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.590> will<00:01:37.640> carry<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.270> one

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
process that will carry on from one

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.770 
process that will carry on from one
birth<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.110> another<00:01:40.200> birth<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.829> another<00:01:40.920> birth

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
birth to another birth to another birth

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.550 
birth to another birth to another birth
so<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:44.840> paycheck-to-paycheck

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so this paycheck-to-paycheck

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.010 
so this paycheck-to-paycheck
is<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> karma<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:48.090> been<00:01:48.270> continuing

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
is a karma that you have been continuing

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.960 
is a karma that you have been continuing
for<00:01:49.049> many<00:01:49.290> lifetimes<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> very

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
for many lifetimes and it is a very

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.069 
for many lifetimes and it is a very
stubborn<00:01:51.299> Karma<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> meat<00:01:52.380> needs<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.829> be

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
stubborn Karma and it meat needs to be

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.230 
stubborn Karma and it meat needs to be
changed<00:01:55.079> or<00:01:55.250> transformed<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.090> do

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
changed or transformed and you can do

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.560 
changed or transformed and you can do
that<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> karma<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.700> a<00:02:00.000> philosophy<00:02:00.450> of

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
that so karma is not a philosophy of

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.969 
that so karma is not a philosophy of
fatalism<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:05.960> don't<00:02:06.960> believe<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.380> fact<00:02:07.619> ilysm

problem from the same kind of thinking

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.420 
problem from the same kind of thinking
that<00:02:36.360> created<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.830> very<00:02:38.040> important

change your karma you have to look at

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.960 
change your karma you have to look at
different<00:02:45.500> module<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.690> allow<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.080> to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
different module that can allow you to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.180 
different module that can allow you to
change<00:02:50.970> your<00:02:51.390> kernel<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:52.860> think

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
change your kernel so that you can think

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.340 
change your kernel so that you can think
out<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.580> box<00:02:53.610> now<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.180> are<00:02:54.510> unable<00:02:55.110> to

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
out of the box now you are unable to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.260 
out of the box now you are unable to
think<00:02:55.710> out<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.010> box<00:02:56.540> because<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.440> moment

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
think out of the box because the moment

that it is a science user trading on par

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.790 
that it is a science user trading on par
with<00:03:56.730> biology<00:03:57.630> or<00:03:57.810> computer<00:03:58.200> science<00:03:58.410> and

so<00:04:07.800> it's<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.070> science<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.570> can<00:04:09.810> tell<00:04:10.170> you

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
so it's a science so it can tell you

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.890 
so it's a science so it can tell you
when<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:13.380> will<00:04:13.530> have<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.860> money<00:04:14.390> where<00:04:15.390> you
