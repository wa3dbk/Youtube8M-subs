in in the one day rugby 10 is such a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.270 
in in the one day rugby 10 is such a
general<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.470> terms<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> way<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> team

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.569 
general in terms of the way the team
play<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.020> obviously<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> space<00:01:28.710> if

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
play but there is obviously the space if

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.940 
play but there is obviously the space if
you<00:01:29.700> tag<00:01:29.970> individuality<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.799> have

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
