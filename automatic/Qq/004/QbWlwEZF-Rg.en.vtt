00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.590
 Hello 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.030
 what came 35 and today we are 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.460
 found for a new video tutorial 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.290
 so this is a little stupid tutorial on 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.810
 how to optimize your texan montages 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.340
 because it's true that in texan we have 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.050
 often a dilemma is to succeed in 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.849
 hook the fish and at the same time have 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.330
 an entire lure and therefore optimize 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.280
 texan taint his ranks of theirs too 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.199
 anti snow that can be and at the same 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.470
 time facilitate the most important shoeing 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.090
 possible then quite stupidly the operation 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.580
 will actually consist of making a 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.010
 incision in them so that 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.350
 the tip is hidden in a slot 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.549
 you see there theirs he has a little bit 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.500
 anyway it's everywhere because of 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.610
 pike and we'll do it again on this 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.839
 kind of there 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.339
 if you are young I advise you to 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.080
 appeal to your parents because that 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.210
 requires a cutter or so 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.530
 what a soul that counts well and I have not 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.830
 want you to cut a finger by my 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.690
 fault 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.979
 so here we are going to remove this hook 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.159
 just stupidly as usual 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.229
 look at how is going to come the hook and in 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.430
 do we make an incision then I 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.630
 put them here for you see well to 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.540
 dishes like these one will make a 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.330
 incision a little bit before the tip of 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.890
 the hook is a little bit after 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.410
 the place where they come out flocks of 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.480
 way to have some margin so everything 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.500
 boat there is not much to do 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:40.190
 just do not have dinner you cut your 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.380
 their belongings in the middle this is then you 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.590
 mount your hook as usual 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.000
 texan prick you by the head for actually 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.250
 come out down there you bring your 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 texan hook like this so is there going 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.450
 must be careful to do well 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.610
 take out the hook in the slot that 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:05.150
 you created see this one so you 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.629
 sting down it must come out well 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.590
 right to the east so that's it 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.769
 so in the slot 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.819
 we are like this is so 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.709
 usually when there are no slots 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.569
 on their blades are very well 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.140
 position like that on the smell is 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.970
 so there is you stinging which makes it 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.650
 makes the shoeing a little harder 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.390
 but makes them feel a bit more 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.500
 grass either do not prick yourself and so there 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.720
 you have risks of approaching 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.760
 on the other hand the shoeing and optimized and 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.350
 so we with the slot we made we 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.260
 just actually to shoot a little bit 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:41.270
 the hook down the hook slips 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.650
 in their like this of course must not 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.030
 to make a crack too deep it's up to 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.300
 say that you have to make the end that you 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.040
 do in fact have to do it from between 3 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.959
 and 5 mm deep 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.510
 otherwise if you pierce their blades 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.770
 will stick to it more of course and so there me 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.349
 feel good lodge in this end two 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.610
 sailboats like these lapointe and 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.110
 concealed ie you can 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.660
 spend as many times as you want 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.400
 your finger will never catch you in 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.640
 revenge as soon as you will exercise a 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.849
 pressure on their lapointe va 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.770
 come out that's basically you're creating a 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.120
 chad planned for Texan fishing at 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.530
 base of a stupid oak what a classic 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.220
 unfair by making a small incision 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.020
 here is a little advice at the level of choice 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.200
 the Texan hook to advise you 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.790
 take texan hooks relatively 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.980
 adapted to the size of their vote of 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.420
 so that for example the belly 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.630
 of your chad do not come 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.370
 completely stuck at level 7 level 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.530
 of the boom of the hook because otherwise 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.209
 the fish will not have enough margin in 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.459
 done to support bring out the 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.400
 tip what makes a man are aix 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.230
 in course of course an egg or no it's 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.440
 having a margin actually between 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.000
 that's the wind of theirs 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.640
 Hooks lambres for the fish 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 can support and bring out the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.450
 point 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.250
 so that was a little tutorial video 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.260
 all stupid I hope it will serve you 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.660
 etc. little tips like that which 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.770
 can give you really simple to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.390
 share 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.770
 me and it makes me happy and good will 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.150
 find for other videos go 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.150
