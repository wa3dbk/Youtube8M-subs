00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Masha, tell me the truth! Have you been told today, that you look amazing!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yes, Yura. I’ve been told, and it was you! In fact, it’s a very simple, neat look.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You can go this way in the park, do the groceries and even in a date!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.900
And my favorite leather jacket that perfectly fits with this look, as usual.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.000
And the brightest point of this look will be the lashes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.500
Again?!

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.363
Yes, I will use the same mascara, but in a very special way!

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:32.000
Which way?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:40.425
I will apply it in several layers with different moves, in order to create mega volume, super structured lashes.

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:41.300
What it is going to be?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.000
This is going to be a bright spot in your look. All the rest makeup will be super natural.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And by the way if you make your lashes so mega volumed and bright, apply mascara in the first place.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Why, because you blink and smudge?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Of course, this way you’ll do your makeup much faster.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We’ll start as you’ve already understood from Colossal Go Extreme Leather Black.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.843
OK

00:01:03.843 --> 00:01:11.000
First, we apply mascara in one layer as usual. Wait a bit until it dries.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
How long is a bit?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.080
While you work on your first eye, another is getting dry. Look up.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.140
Now we apply a second layer of the mascara. Especially apply carefully on the root area.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.460
After that you have an impression that your eyes were underlined with a pencil.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.260
Third layer has to be applied in the most unusual way. And this is the main point in this makeup.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.960
Unusual way?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.600
We’ll apply it not with the brush itself as always, but with the tip of the brush.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.500
Isn’t this dangerous?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.580
This is not dangerous. So this way we work with every beam of lashes, making them super volume and mega structured.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I’m ready.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.300
Look down.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now we’ll do absolutely natural nude makeup.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.500
Instead of applying a foundation, we’ll use BB cream and apply it transparently with a brush.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.500
In this makeup we don’t need very graphic brows, they should look very natural.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.000
That is why I use medium brown shade of Brow Drama, this is a brow mascara.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.546
I know.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.000
Now I can say that this is a real street chic. Look.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.600
Wow, my eyes!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.130
This is cool and trendy!

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.000
This is very trendy!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Don’t forget to use every day Lipbalm Baby Lips.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.200
Oh I like it so much, it smells so good!

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.000
I think I’ve seen eyes like this in a New York Fashion Week.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You know, every year these eyes appear somewhere. This becomes a constant trend and it is really very up to date.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Most important, that this eye makeup will never make woman look old.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.600
Really? Awesome!
