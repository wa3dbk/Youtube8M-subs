plays at work good and the one thing
that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.400> talk<00:01:23.939> about<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.810> one

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that you talk about you know it's one

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.480 
that you talk about you know it's one
thing<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> spread<00:01:25.830> attack<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.369> then

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
thing to have a spread attack but then

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
thing to have a spread attack but then
you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:27.150> incorporate<00:01:27.420> maybe<00:01:27.990> elements<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you can incorporate maybe elements of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.960 
you can incorporate maybe elements of
the<00:01:28.680> running<00:01:28.920> shoot<00:01:29.100> maybe<00:01:29.280> elements<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the running shoot maybe elements of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.390 
the running shoot maybe elements of
other<00:01:30.540> pro<00:01:30.810> style<00:01:31.049> offenses<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.009> becomes

other pro style offenses it becomes

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.069 
other pro style offenses it becomes
something<00:01:32.579> that's<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:32.909> individual<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.600> UCLA

just talking about this morning one of

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
just talking about this morning one of
the<00:02:24.630> one<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.960> you<00:02:25.350> know<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:26.010> hope

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
anything you put in you know is on a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.610 
anything you put in you know is on a
curve<00:02:27.960> there's<00:02:28.230> always<00:02:28.380> gonna<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.560> that

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
curve there's always gonna be that

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.560 
curve there's always gonna be that
learning<00:02:29.010> curve<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.820> know<00:02:29.940> what<00:02:30.090> we<00:02:30.240> hope<00:02:30.420> as

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
learning curve you know what we hope as

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.530 
learning curve you know what we hope as
ours<00:02:30.750> grows<00:02:31.650> exponentially<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.510> you

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
ours grows exponentially and so that you

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.090 
ours grows exponentially and so that you
know<00:02:33.690> kind<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> flat<00:02:34.350> part<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.800> curve

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
know kind of the flat part of that curve

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.740 
know kind of the flat part of that curve
at<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.280> beginning<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.120> finding<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
at the beginning is just finding the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.420 
at the beginning is just finding the
guys<00:02:36.930> getting<00:02:37.560> him<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.860> right<00:02:38.010> spots

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.170 
putting a piece of the puzzle together
you<00:02:40.770> know<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:40.980> he<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> slot<00:02:41.460> is<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.820> running

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
you know is he a slot is you running

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.940 
you know is he a slot is you running
back<00:02:42.390> who's<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> outside<00:02:43.230> receivers<00:02:43.830> you're

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
back who's the outside receivers you're

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.850 
back who's the outside receivers you're
right<00:02:44.130> tackle<00:02:44.640> left<00:02:44.880> tackle<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.710> you're
