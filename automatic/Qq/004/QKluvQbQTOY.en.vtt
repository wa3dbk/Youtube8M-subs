 noise here is routine in a small 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.290
 center of province like that of pisa 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.600

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.840
 dealing with people and 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.990
 being able to communicate with people and then the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.140
 manual ability to fix things so much 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.520
