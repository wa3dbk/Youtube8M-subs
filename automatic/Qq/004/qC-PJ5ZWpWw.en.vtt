00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
records but they said that the VCR when

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.450 
records but they said that the VCR when
I<00:01:37.760> got<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.180> was<00:01:38.330> dead<00:01:39.100> right<00:01:40.100> at<00:01:40.190> home<00:01:40.340> I

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
I got it was dead right at home I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.850 
I got it was dead right at home I
plugged<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.360> everything<00:01:41.450> lit<00:01:41.840> up<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
plugged it in and everything lit up the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.620 
plugged it in and everything lit up the
only<00:01:42.980> thing<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.220> do<00:01:43.280> notice<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:44.210> does<00:01:44.390> shut

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
only thing I do notice that it does shut

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.540 
only thing I do notice that it does shut
itself<00:01:44.870> off<00:01:45.050> after<00:01:45.440> about<00:01:45.470> five<00:01:46.190> minutes<00:01:46.220> of

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
itself off after about five minutes of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.090 
itself off after about five minutes of
inactivity<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:48.160> that's<00:01:49.160> probably<00:01:49.520> just<00:01:49.700> a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
inactivity so that's probably just a

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.440 
inactivity so that's probably just a
just<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.190> feature<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.460> VCR<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.180> I'm<00:01:53.270> sure

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
just a feature of VCR and I'm sure

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.850 
just a feature of VCR and I'm sure
there's<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.750> way<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.900> disable<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.590> don't<00:01:54.740> have

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
there's a way to disable it I don't have

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.920 
there's a way to disable it I don't have
