00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that we need to protect our paintings so

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.649 
that we need to protect our paintings so
again<00:01:05.070> any<00:01:05.369> true<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.940> be<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> knife<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.540> can

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
again any true we can be a knife you can

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.640 
again any true we can be a knife you can
be<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.200> knife

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
be a knife

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.910 
be a knife
we<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.670> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:34.830 

voila<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:33.940> can<00:01:34.090> see<00:01:34.240> we<00:01:34.450> have<00:01:34.570> removed

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
voila as you can see we have removed

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.800 
voila as you can see we have removed
this<00:01:35.050> one<00:01:35.310> from<00:01:36.310> here<00:01:36.670> are<00:01:37.330> we<00:01:37.510> going<00:01:37.720> to

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
this one from here are we going to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.670 
this one from here are we going to
substitute<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.500> here<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.640> key<00:01:39.820> symmetry<00:01:40.390> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
substitute it here the key symmetry and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.890 
substitute it here the key symmetry and
this<00:01:41.680> one<00:01:42.040> right<00:01:42.520> here<00:01:43.120> in<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.330> middle<00:01:43.690> to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
this one right here in the middle to

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.600 
this one right here in the middle to
make<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.110> look<00:01:44.380> just<00:01:44.620> like<00:01:44.860> that<00:01:44.920> mm<00:01:46.920> okay<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:47.950> we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
make a look just like that mm okay so we

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.380 
make a look just like that mm okay so we
need<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.940> Center<00:01:49.480> to<00:01:49.780> find<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.170> center<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:52.180> the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
need to Center to find the center on the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.990 
need to Center to find the center on the
on<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.660> width<00:01:52.870> on<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.620> center<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.880> the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
on the width on the center and the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.940 
on the width on the center and the
height<00:01:55.180> we<00:01:56.020> can<00:01:56.170> tell<00:01:56.380> which<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.620> can<00:01:56.770> figure

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
height we can tell which I can figure

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.800 
height we can tell which I can figure
out<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.700> should<00:01:57.910> be<00:01:57.940> somewhere<00:01:58.300> around<00:01:58.360> here

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
out it should be somewhere around here

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.100 
out it should be somewhere around here
liquor<00:01:59.530> so<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.770> handle<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.870> should<00:02:01.990> be

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
liquor so the handle so it should be

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.180 
liquor so the handle so it should be
somewhere<00:02:02.410> here<00:02:02.470> but<00:02:02.830> we're<00:02:03.010> going<00:02:03.130> to

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
somewhere here but we're going to

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.360 
somewhere here but we're going to
measure<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.640> make<00:02:03.760> sure<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.380> we're<00:02:06.100> going<00:02:06.280> to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
measure to make sure so we're going to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.700 
measure to make sure so we're going to
measure<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:07.090> mixture<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.930> centered

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
measure the mixture is centered

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.120 
measure the mixture is centered
he<00:02:09.700> has<00:02:09.940> 46<00:02:10.899> inches<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:12.580> are<00:02:12.640> looking<00:02:12.940> for<00:02:14.130> 23

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
he has 46 inches we are looking for 23

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.330 
he has 46 inches we are looking for 23
and<00:02:16.320> now<00:02:17.320> we're<00:02:17.740> going<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.950> miss<00:02:18.190> her<00:02:18.900> height

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
and now we're going to miss her height

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.990 
and now we're going to miss her height
which<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:22.020> 20<00:02:23.020> inches<00:02:23.170> we're<00:02:23.650> looking<00:02:23.890> for<00:02:24.100> 10

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.030 

that<00:02:29.000> where<00:02:29.240> they<00:02:29.390> intersect<00:02:29.800> that's<00:02:30.800> it

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
that where they intersect that's it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.330 
that where they intersect that's it
middle<00:02:31.730> for<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.260> now<00:02:33.260> we<00:02:33.320> need<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.740> find<00:02:34.010> it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
middle for that now we need to find it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.040 
middle for that now we need to find it
a<00:02:34.370> horizontal<00:02:34.910> line<00:02:35.240> me<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.630> make<00:02:35.750> sure<00:02:35.870> it's

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
a horizontal line me to make sure it's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.590 
a horizontal line me to make sure it's
balanced<00:02:36.730> we<00:02:37.730> are<00:02:37.880> going<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.090> use<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.300> on<00:02:38.390> P

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
balanced we are going to use it on P

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.840 
balanced we are going to use it on P
level<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:40.040> make<00:02:40.220> sure<00:02:40.250> it's<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.670> right

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
level to make sure it's the right

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.840 
level to make sure it's the right
balance<00:02:41.920> we<00:02:42.920> want<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.160> make<00:02:43.280> loops<00:02:43.520> tray<00:02:43.790> as

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
balance we want to make loops tray as

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.050 
balance we want to make loops tray as
possible<00:02:47.770> okay<00:02:48.770> we<00:02:49.010> are<00:02:49.040> measuring<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.880> is

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
possible okay we are measuring this is

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.670 
possible okay we are measuring this is
nine<00:02:50.390> inches<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.830> center<00:02:52.370> would<00:02:52.610> be<00:02:53.680> four

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
nine inches so the center would be four

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.380 
nine inches so the center would be four
and<00:02:54.710> a<00:02:54.950> half<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.860> should<00:02:58.160> be<00:02:58.370> right<00:02:59.090> on
