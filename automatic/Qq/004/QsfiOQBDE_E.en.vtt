00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
from a you know sort of so let us know I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.399 
from a you know sort of so let us know I
guess<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.329> maybe<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:57.960> an<00:01:58.079> event<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
guess or maybe is do an event in the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.139 
guess or maybe is do an event in the
future<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.460> guys<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.700> about<00:02:00.000> this

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
future what do you guys think about this

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
future what do you guys think about this
again<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.990> short<00:02:01.290> ferry<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:01.950> not

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
again it's a very short ferry that's not

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.800 
again it's a very short ferry that's not
a<00:02:02.130> huge<00:02:02.460> amount<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.759> say<00:02:02.969> about<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.329> really<00:02:03.689> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
a huge amount to say about this really I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.209 
a huge amount to say about this really I
mean<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:04.500> other<00:02:04.530> possibilities<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
mean what other possibilities is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
mean what other possibilities is
happening<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.390> definitely<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
happening what I definitely think we a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.260 
happening what I definitely think we a
ruby<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.069> sapphire<00:02:08.099> remake<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.759> generation

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
ruby and sapphire remake this generation

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.690 
ruby and sapphire remake this generation
so<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.590> actual

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so the actual

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.790 
so the actual
being<00:02:12.000> an<00:02:12.120> event<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.690> might<00:02:13.230> not<00:02:13.349> happen<00:02:13.470> or

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
being an event in it might not happen or

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.759 
being an event in it might not happen or
maybe<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:15.420> can<00:02:15.569> only<00:02:15.780> open<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.200> power<00:02:16.379> plants

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
maybe you can only open the power plants

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.979 
maybe you can only open the power plants
once<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.280> transfer<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.849> big<00:02:18.060> one<00:02:18.269> from<00:02:18.690> the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
once you transfer a big one from the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.390 
once you transfer a big one from the
ruby<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.349> sapphire<00:02:19.379> earrings<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:20.040> was<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> x

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
ruby and sapphire earrings it was the x

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.210 
ruby and sapphire earrings it was the x
and<00:02:20.550> y<00:02:20.700> that's<00:02:21.330> also<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> possibility

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
and y that's also a possibility

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.140 
and y that's also a possibility
obviously<00:02:23.220> no<00:02:23.370> with<00:02:23.489> people<00:02:23.700> have<00:02:23.790> had<00:02:23.879> grout

obviously no with people have had grout
on<00:02:24.180> etc<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.590> x<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.040> y<00:02:26.129> already<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.940> you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
on etc of the x and y already but you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.640 
on etc of the x and y already but you
might<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:27.599> one<00:02:27.780> definitely<00:02:28.290> from
