00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.350 

so<00:00:01.680> let's<00:00:01.800> take<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.040> look<00:00:02.220> at<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.520> model<00:00:02.760> for

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
so let's take a look at this model for

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.190 
so let's take a look at this model for
female<00:00:04.190> reproductive<00:00:05.190> system<00:00:05.899> what<00:00:06.899> we<00:00:07.020> can

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
female reproductive system what we can

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.850 
female reproductive system what we can
see<00:00:07.470> from<00:00:08.370> external<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.059> internal<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.860> labia

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
see from external to internal is labia

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.060 
see from external to internal is labia
majora<00:00:12.830> labia<00:00:13.830> minora<00:00:14.750> then<00:00:15.750> vaginal<00:00:16.650> orifice

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
majora labia minora then vaginal orifice

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.410 
majora labia minora then vaginal orifice
and<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.880> vagina<00:00:20.570> here<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.930> cervix<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
and the vagina here is the cervix and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.689 
and the vagina here is the cervix and
then<00:00:24.420> past<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> cervix<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.830> uterus<00:00:26.310> so

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
then past the cervix is the uterus so

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.320 
then past the cervix is the uterus so
this<00:00:26.910> whole<00:00:27.119> structure<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.680> uterus

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
this whole structure here is the uterus

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.659 
this whole structure here is the uterus
the<00:00:30.330> rounded<00:00:30.960> tip<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.769> uterus<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the rounded tip of the uterus is the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.119 
the rounded tip of the uterus is the
fundus<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.680> here<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> body<00:00:39.350> anterior<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
fundus and here is the body anterior to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.100 
fundus and here is the body anterior to
the<00:00:41.250> vaginal<00:00:41.430> orifice<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> external

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the vaginal orifice is the external

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.650 
the vaginal orifice is the external
urethral<00:00:43.800> orifice<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.450> female

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
urethral orifice so this is female

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.540 
urethral orifice so this is female
urethra<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:48.000> urinary<00:00:48.510> bladder<00:00:48.660> and

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.420 

then<00:00:53.550> anterior<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.260> external<00:00:55.949> urethral

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
then anterior to the external urethral

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.180 
then anterior to the external urethral
orifice<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:57.390> red<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.020> blue<00:00:58.260> represents<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
orifice this red and blue represents the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:10.800 
orifice this red and blue represents the
vascular<00:00:59.730> ization<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:01.140> clitoris

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.609 

as<00:01:11.170> we<00:01:11.500> look<00:01:11.680> from<00:01:11.920> a<00:01:12.399> more<00:01:12.700> lateral<00:01:13.240> view<00:01:13.619> you

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
as we look from a more lateral view you

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.230 
as we look from a more lateral view you
can<00:01:14.770> see<00:01:14.979> an<00:01:15.100> ovary<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:18.310> thin<00:01:18.640> bray<00:01:18.909> of

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
can see an ovary and the thin bray of

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.130 
can see an ovary and the thin bray of
the<00:01:19.899> fallopian<00:01:20.229> tube<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:22.689> is<00:01:22.720> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
the fallopian tube here is the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.389 
the fallopian tube here is the
infundibulum<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.880> fallopian<00:01:25.119> tube<00:01:25.600> and

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
infundibulum of the fallopian tube and

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.370 
infundibulum of the fallopian tube and
then<00:01:27.399> here's<00:01:27.640> that<00:01:27.789> tube<00:01:28.090> coming<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:28.869> towards

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
then here's that tube coming in towards

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.719 
then here's that tube coming in towards
the<00:01:29.770> uterus<00:01:32.759> sweeping<00:01:33.759> out<00:01:33.909> from<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.360> uterus

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the uterus sweeping out from the uterus

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.969 
the uterus sweeping out from the uterus
connecting<00:01:36.729> all<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.560> pelvic

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
connecting all of this to the pelvic

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.029 
connecting all of this to the pelvic
cavity<00:01:39.009> is<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:40.030> broad<00:01:40.539> ligament<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:44.289> then

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
cavity is the broad ligament and then

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.630 
cavity is the broad ligament and then
here<00:01:45.490> represented<00:01:46.149> in<00:01:46.270> white<00:01:47.069> which<00:01:48.069> is<00:01:48.280> also

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
here represented in white which is also

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.010 
here represented in white which is also
here<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:50.080> round<00:01:50.560> ligament<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:54.640> look

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
here is the round ligament we look

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.980 
here is the round ligament we look
inside<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:57.549> green<00:01:57.939> structure<00:01:58.390> coming<00:01:58.810> down

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
inside this green structure coming down

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.460 
inside this green structure coming down
represents<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.799> ureter<00:02:00.340> which<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:02.259> going<00:02:02.409> to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
represents the ureter which is going to

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.359 
represents the ureter which is going to
come<00:02:02.709> down<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:05.170> urinary<00:02:05.560> bladder<00:02:05.679> so

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
come down to the urinary bladder so

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.039 
come down to the urinary bladder so
that's<00:02:06.549> how<00:02:06.670> urine<00:02:07.000> gets<00:02:07.179> from<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.509> kidney<00:02:07.869> to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
that's how urine gets from the kidney to

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:14.250 
that's how urine gets from the kidney to
the<00:02:08.080> bladder<00:02:10.080> we<00:02:11.080> can<00:02:11.260> also<00:02:11.470> see<00:02:12.870> common<00:02:13.870> iliac

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
the bladder we can also see common iliac

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.120 
the bladder we can also see common iliac
artery<00:02:15.690> with<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.840> branching<00:02:17.260> into<00:02:17.410> external

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
artery with it branching into external

artery with it branching into external
iliac<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.260> internal<00:02:20.260> iliac<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:22.410> then<00:02:23.410> we<00:02:23.530> can

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
iliac and internal iliac and then we can

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.319 
iliac and internal iliac and then we can
see<00:02:23.859> internal<00:02:24.459> iliac<00:02:25.140> branching<00:02:26.140> into

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
see internal iliac branching into

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.569 
see internal iliac branching into
superior<00:02:28.329> gluteal<00:02:28.870> artery<00:02:31.410> internal
