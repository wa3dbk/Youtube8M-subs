00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.350
 the project chosen by the president will be complicated and the construction is 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.659
 huge 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.049
 one hundred thousand square meters in the center of the capital 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.049
 surpasses by almost double the buildings that surround them 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.409
 It has the height of the town hall or the cathedral of Notre Dame 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.489
 It has four facades that the pedestrian can surround 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.769
 It is a monument in the city 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.729
 well yours with a clear that is a monument the center pompidou is a 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:32.769
 monument 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.989
 we always said the opposite but how can one become 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.869
 phone monument when a mass of that importance is built on the ground 

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:43.869
 physical volume and functional terrain 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.420
 my money in our opinion serve the square was as important as the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.060
 New York building 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.010
 bush we live in a city as dense as Paris we thought it was not 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.130
 necessary to occupy the entire land available to me to create a 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 well a spacious square and that finally 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.070
 signed 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.540
 creates the vacuum that makes the existence of the pompidou center 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.240
 possible 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.570
 yes maybe necessary 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.570
 thanks to the square the center belongs to the city 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.549
 formerly the pedestrian spaces in the center of the city 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.549
 they were largely synonymous with disorder 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.170
 the place the bail on the other hand sent an ideal vision of the city the one of 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.170
 reborn galiano 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.200
 like the one in the square of the week camp 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 I invited the pedestrian to approach the epicenter little by little 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.179
 the original project did not exist operation between the plaza of the building 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.729
 the great hall on the ground floor was an open space under pillars 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:40.619
 the reality of the Parisian climate caused the architects to close it inside the 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.089
 building 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:46.769
 until 1995 the real point of reference was the forum 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.429
 a large central hole 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:52.309
 a space destined to the great manifestations of the artists there 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.319
 installations to original creations 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.829
 the hole was covered 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.319
 but that it is an exhibition space 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.549
 in the lobby the movement of the city is prolonged 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.999
 art and everyday life following plants 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.469
 the piazza announces the building 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.469
 the hall is still the city 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.279
 the life of the city sneaks into the building 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:39.569
 It also extends through the facade 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.299
 the circulation areas of the west facade are not only the services 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.349
 of the building the technical solution to free interior spaces 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.640
 are the result of a whole reflection on the confrontation between monument 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.979
 and city 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:04:00.249
 the entire facade is a public place with its squares its streets a place to which 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:03.249
 can access without ticket and without control 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.209
 the grand escalator is an interior street that joins the free movement 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.049
 from pedestrians to the fifth floor in front of the big urban panorama the only 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.840
 place of paris that offers a similar show a show 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.840
 free and free 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.230
 il difficult dip of the difficult saying of the center that is beautiful 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:40.349
 i dudley would be better to say that he has the intelligent vision awake look and 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.349
 like those babies that do not stop moving and end with the patience of parents 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.650
 that they want to be photographed with him duffy 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.279
 my dream is that it is like this 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.899
 no the building is alive and one and after 20 years it shows 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.240
 surpassing by far the wildest illusions of its founders 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.120
 the center them with you receives every day more than 25 thousand visitors 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.760
 It is the most visited building in Paris far ahead of the Eiffel Tower 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.690
 victim of its success the building has been spent facing 2000 with two years of 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.270
 works 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.900
 will know how to preserve its double identity 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.639
 and it continued to be at the same time this monument that affirms the public power 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.479
 and this city within the city 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:40.259
 cozy
