00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello my dear side by heart 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.430
 welcome to my battlefield 3 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.429
 We had a look at the weapons today 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.370
 the m60 e4 more accurate and that is since 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.009
 manufactured in the USA in the 60s 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.089
 her model is german mg 42 das 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.039
 was by the Wehrmacht in the second 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.080
 world war already uses the usa in the world 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.529
 second world war is trying yours 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 to recreate money 42 and then to 76 52 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.250
 millimeter nato bullets rebuild the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.019
 but was not successful 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.060
 in the sixties they have it 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.460
 then made after the model of mg 42 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.079
 with slight changes as I said 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.230
 the m60 of 76 2 x 51 mm NATO projectiles 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.670
 the fire rate is 580 shot per 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.110
 minute 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 that's the fear of one 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.280
 Machine Gun Battlefield 3 The Fire 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.320
 Modes are like most 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.059
 machine guns clock fully automatic 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.070
 and since the ammo about munitions short 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.379
 is fed there are whole 100 shot 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.050
 or 200 employees magazine 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.420
 in the magazine in it the weirdness 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.949
 is still possible with 560 meters 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.549
 average and free switched 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.730
 the m60 will be for the provider 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.550
 200,000 points with the provider 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.230
 The child could make her very unique 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.910
 however, the plates can be left and 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.410
 right from the top maybe at 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.120
 disturb moving targets 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.780
 That's why I recommend the use of 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.970
 optics of recoil 61 4 is lower 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.530
 when at the pkp few beautiful passes lay 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.090
 but still pretty high though 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.840
 the lateral conclusion is hardly 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.610
 noticeable 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.440
 Therefore it is enough to shoot at the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.120
 Just pull mouse down hard 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.840
 at least up to about 50 meters 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.150
 that works reasonably well 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.150
 the damage corresponds to the dm 240 g and 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.950
 the pkp panic 34 damage points up 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.230
 eight meters and the falls to 60 meters 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.210
 and over on 22 damage points 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.490
 that means never more than five 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.040
 hits for a kill need evaluates 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.120
 short distance even three hits 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.950
 the muffler hides you 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.560
 shoot on the minimap but means 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.120
 for you that you enemies for a third 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.310
 as good as she has to touch and also with 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.020
 distance surcharge five hits needs 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.150
 which may not be so good because of the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.870
 low rate of fire that means on the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.479
 difference between life and death 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.230
 The loading time is around 72 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.110
 seconds 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.540
 that's why the m60 is rather less 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.090
 suitable for the approaching plants because 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.560
 It is very important to pay attention 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.240
 what right moment to reload 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.110
 is also quite difficult at 100 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.580
 shot magazine 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.040
 when he becomes you 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.560
 to load longer than 90 euro 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.880
 player or opponent and 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.650
 therefore, had to be well prepared 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.360
 best take a suitable second 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.050
 weapon with which he can handle well 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.050
 for such cases 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.450
 64 4 are similar to the game play 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.860
 pretty much the car technology just that 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.510
 They are on short distance because then still 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.950
 lower fire rate among low 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.670
 What does not help you so much 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.100
 suitable is 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.500
 In contrast, it was on middle class 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.270
 a lot better off because of the recoil 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.010
 it is easier to control you too 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.600
 except for a certain distance not so 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.760
 very dependent on the band as the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.230
 car business especially with the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.920
 muzzle fire does this always happen 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.200
 still very good 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.820
 because of the fire rate is finally I see 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.410
 but no suitable choice for the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.510
 use at the front 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.130
 also the switch is not a good choice 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.600
 because it's important to hurt as much as 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.360
 possible to press purely as on 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.459
 low rate of fire is why it is 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.230
 No matter hide the fire is back and forth 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.760
 it really important love you should 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.590
 you benefit by the shoot 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.300
 a good position and accuracy 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.700
 give bonus of report 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.800
 For example, there is a position for you 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.720
 or objects halfway to the sea 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.190
 could put up your report and 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.959
 the places where the action goes well in 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.550
 so many kills could have looked like that 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.050
 tap and if done correctly 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.880
 even help your team to win 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.070
 That's why we sit down and sit 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.480
 extras on a stationary roll with it 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.340
 the m60 e 4 1 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.110
 the holographic as it is 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.209
 far better for the 10 on medium 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.769
 distance as the child occur here 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.840
 especially at moving opponent will 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.340
 you some as a difference 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.030
 Remember if the temptation of your balls 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.010
 should come 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.080
 because word is an absolute must 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.150
 because he gives you excellent accuracy 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.010
 and stability gives at the low 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.690
 bike is very important with that because 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.190
 all shots should go to the goal 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.350
 with it the opponent as fast as possible 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.760
 lies and you will become the 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.049
 also do not hold down so much 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.090
 lose accuracy when we over 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.530
 a set up portfolio also very 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.810
 useful if he is in for example 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.370
 narrow corridors since we take ourselves 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.989
 this other magazine so you can 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.750
 effectively hold up positions 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.490
 from continuous fire to most of all 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.930
 in the case of courses quickly useful if he the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.090
 Attacks from the rich of shopping 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.400
 but could also have to hold off 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.380
 Use attackers if you might 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.510
 the defenders wanted to stop it 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.860
 to take a certain position for 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.340
 example could be distractions 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.650
 create 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.960
 and yes, by the high one after the other 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.610
 but time would have to fight strong pistol 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.560
 take away because in close combat necessarily on 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.900
 a second should confuse the m60 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.760
 It really is not well suited for that 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.150
 Here I recommend the 44er best 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.120
 notice 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.530
 or 18 to take with you I recommend 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.660
 take the talk down with you 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.250
 because it means , of course, it still comes 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.590
 no kind please always pay attention to that 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.150
 no sport talk did double things despite 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.830
 lower the opponents celebrate well under 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.600
 control if one or the other 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.550
 shot goes wrong 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.410
 the horrible 4 is one of the am 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.250
 best for medium distance appropriate 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.350
 machine guns 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.210
 their high damage the good accuracy 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.070
 you through the offers and the big 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.920
 Magazine make you the optimal weapon 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.510
 It is suitable for stationary use 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.010
 perfect for wrestling aisles 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.570
 also support the teams and the 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.060
 secure by and / or hold 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.650
 from positions or income newer 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.060
 low rate of fire will be yours at one 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.180
 surprising melee attacks 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:40.420
 problems still make this bread 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:42.750
 box-shaped machine gun makes 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.950
 to your opponents lapp riggers tost 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.560
 I hope you liked it in two 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.760
 weeks the weapon gang 291 unfortunately 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.200
 Not next week I'm there too 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.180
 when preparing the important work 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.260
 I hope you understand this writes 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.090
 like weapons was wished in the 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.430
 comments I write from now on everyone 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.500
 wish rtx the file and try the 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.280
 then work off so slowly skin pure 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.280
 and bye
