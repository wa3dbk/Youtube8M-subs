off just by swiping them like that you

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.779 
off just by swiping them like that you
have<00:00:23.789> data<00:00:24.029> usage<00:00:24.449> which<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.779> completing<00:00:25.260> you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
tells you how much app or how much data

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.150 
tells you how much app or how much data
the<00:00:54.000> app<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> using<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.230> foreground<00:00:55.649> this

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the app is using and the foreground this

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
the app is using and the foreground this
case<00:00:56.370> about<00:00:56.670> 90<00:00:57.000> megabytes<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
case about 90 megabytes in the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.150 
case about 90 megabytes in the
background<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> using<00:00:58.620> about<00:00:58.770> forty

background is using about forty

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
background is using about forty
megabytes<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.690> wanted<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.260> could

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
megabytes so if I wanted I could

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200 
megabytes so if I wanted I could
actually<00:01:01.590> disable<00:01:02.280> background<00:01:02.820> data<00:01:02.969> which

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
actually disable background data which

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.329 
actually disable background data which
means<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.439> app<00:01:04.619> won't<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.040> able<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> use

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
means that the app won't be able to use

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.810 
means that the app won't be able to use
data<00:01:05.640> unless<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.180> physically<00:01:06.720> open<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> myself
