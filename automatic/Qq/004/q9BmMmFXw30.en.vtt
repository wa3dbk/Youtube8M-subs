up<00:04:07.520> with<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.090> number<00:04:08.360> will<00:04:09.200> answer<00:04:09.410> that

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
up with that number will answer that

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:18.050 
up with that number will answer that
after<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.670> break

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.849 

changing<00:04:18.900> tires<00:04:19.139> out<00:04:19.380> here<00:04:19.650> could<00:04:19.799> be

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
changing tires out here could be

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.850 
changing tires out here could be
dangerous<00:04:20.370> but<00:04:21.120> with<00:04:21.269> these<00:04:21.359> tires<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.989> don't

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
dangerous but with these tires I don't

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.710 
dangerous but with these tires I don't
need<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.070> worry<00:04:27.290> Bridgestone<00:04:29.540> earlier<00:04:30.540> this

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
need to worry Bridgestone earlier this

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.540 
need to worry Bridgestone earlier this

we can if you want to get into the
approach<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.220> was<00:05:08.610> taken<00:05:08.669> it<00:05:09.150> was<00:05:09.180> merely

approach that was taken it was merely

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.040 
approach that was taken it was merely
following<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:11.040> procedure<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:12.360> is<00:05:12.660> that<00:05:12.900> the

following the procedure that is that the
EPA<00:05:13.200> shared<00:05:13.800> with<00:05:14.010> us<00:05:14.190> we<00:05:14.400> just<00:05:14.639> took<00:05:14.820> the

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
EPA shared with us we just took the

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.379 
EPA shared with us we just took the
procedure<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.690> followed<00:05:16.110> it<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:16.440> it<00:05:17.040> would

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
procedure and followed it and it would

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.480 
procedure and followed it and it would
go<00:05:18.389> in<00:05:18.510> and<00:05:18.660> say<00:05:18.840> how<00:05:19.260> much<00:05:19.470> of<00:05:19.770> your<00:05:19.919> time<00:05:19.979> in

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
go in and say how much of your time in

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.820 
go in and say how much of your time in
the<00:05:20.520> city<00:05:20.940> do<00:05:21.690> they<00:05:21.870> expect<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.560> you'll<00:05:22.710> be

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
the city do they expect that you'll be

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.440 
the city do they expect that you'll be
running<00:05:23.010> all<00:05:23.280> electric<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:24.030> then<00:05:24.150> what<00:05:24.330> is

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
running all electric and then what is

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.840 
running all electric and then what is
the<00:05:24.600> cost<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:25.020> energy<00:05:25.200> in<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:26.100> city<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.610> then

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
the cost of energy in the city and then

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.270 
the cost of energy in the city and then
how<00:05:27.060> much<00:05:27.210> of<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.539> time<00:05:27.570> on<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.140> highway<00:05:29.039> is

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
how much of the time on the highway is

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.159 
how much of the time on the highway is
all<00:05:29.460> electric<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:30.180> then<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:30.810> have<00:05:30.930> different

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
all electric and then you have different

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.469 
all electric and then you have different
amounts<00:05:31.380> electric<00:05:32.220> versus<00:05:32.610> running<00:05:33.030> off<00:05:33.240> of

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
amounts electric versus running off of

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.770 
amounts electric versus running off of
the<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.960> engine<00:05:34.410> generator<00:05:34.919> and<00:05:35.270> then<00:05:36.270> you

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
the the engine generator and then you

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.659 
the the engine generator and then you
run<00:05:37.350> those<00:05:37.560> two<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:37.950> you<00:05:38.010> get<00:05:38.130> your<00:05:38.280> city<00:05:38.520> and

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
run those two and you get your city and

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.210 
run those two and you get your city and
highway<00:05:38.850> numbers<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.650> also<00:05:40.830> have<00:05:41.039> to

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
highway numbers and you also have to

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.340 
highway numbers and you also have to
talk<00:05:41.520> about<00:05:41.700> you<00:05:42.120> know<00:05:42.240> how<00:05:42.720> many<00:05:42.930> kilowatt

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
talk about you know how many kilowatt

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.790 
talk about you know how many kilowatt
hours<00:05:43.650> you<00:05:43.770> use<00:05:43.979> etc<00:05:44.930> we<00:05:45.930> did<00:05:46.140> nothing<00:05:46.289> more

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
hours you use etc we did nothing more

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
interesting number and one would like to

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.409 
interesting number and one would like to
know<00:06:09.720> where<00:06:09.870> it<00:06:09.930> came<00:06:10.080> from<00:06:10.139> and<00:06:10.940> APA<00:06:11.940> has<00:06:12.180> been

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
know where it came from and APA has been

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.480 
know where it came from and APA has been
trying<00:06:12.720> very<00:06:12.960> hard<00:06:13.050> to<00:06:13.380> do<00:06:13.680> what<00:06:14.039> makes<00:06:14.310> the

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
trying very hard to do what makes the

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.010 
trying very hard to do what makes the
most<00:06:14.520> sense<00:06:14.820> in<00:06:15.180> other<00:06:15.330> words<00:06:15.510> follow<00:06:15.720> the

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
most sense in other words follow the

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.050 
most sense in other words follow the
physics<00:06:16.440> of<00:06:16.530> the<00:06:16.650> situation<00:06:17.310> and<00:06:17.490> put<00:06:17.850> that

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
physics of the situation and put that

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.029 
physics of the situation and put that
out<00:06:18.240> and<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:19.080> have<00:06:19.200> to<00:06:19.350> remember<00:06:19.650> the

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
out and you have to remember the

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.219 
out and you have to remember the
difficult<00:06:20.460> days<00:06:20.639> obviously<00:06:21.389> that's<00:06:22.110> the

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
difficult days obviously that's the

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.200 
difficult days obviously that's the
first<00:06:22.470> time<00:06:22.590> ever<00:06:22.979> and<00:06:23.310> it's<00:06:23.729> a<00:06:23.850> draft

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
first time ever and it's a draft

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.559 
first time ever and it's a draft
proposal<00:06:24.900> yeah

proposal yeah

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.299 
proposal yeah
expect<00:06:26.020> that<00:06:26.169> there<00:06:26.319> will<00:06:26.379> be<00:06:26.439> changes<00:06:27.009> in<00:06:27.069> it

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:27.309 
expect that there will be changes in it

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:30.269 
expect that there will be changes in it
over<00:06:27.490> time<00:06:27.849> but<00:06:28.719> in<00:06:29.050> general<00:06:29.379> we<00:06:29.649> wanted<00:06:30.129> to

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
over time but in general we wanted to

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.309 
over time but in general we wanted to
kind<00:06:30.849> of<00:06:30.909> give<00:06:31.089> you<00:06:31.210> a<00:06:31.270> benchmark<00:06:31.929> for<00:06:31.990> where

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 
kind of give you a benchmark for where

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.139 
kind of give you a benchmark for where
we<00:06:32.469> were<00:06:32.559> at<00:06:32.710> today<00:06:33.069> and<00:06:33.099> using<00:06:33.729> that<00:06:33.759> that's

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:34.149 
we were at today and using that that's

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:37.649 
we were at today and using that that's
why<00:06:34.330> we<00:06:34.479> we<00:06:34.749> shared<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.199> number<00:06:36.270> as<00:06:37.270> you<00:06:37.479> all

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
why we we shared the number as you all

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.149 
why we we shared the number as you all
know<00:06:37.689> sharing<00:06:38.349> that<00:06:38.469> number<00:06:38.740> kicked<00:06:38.949> off<00:06:39.129> a

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
know sharing that number kicked off a

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.269 
know sharing that number kicked off a
firestorm<00:06:39.849> of<00:06:40.360> controversy<00:06:40.599> over<00:06:41.259> the<00:06:41.649> fuel

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:42.279 
firestorm of controversy over the fuel

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:45.329 
firestorm of controversy over the fuel

the EPA will be refining that procedure
