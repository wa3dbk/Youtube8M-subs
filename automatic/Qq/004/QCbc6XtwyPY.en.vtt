00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860

the<00:03:14.980> best<00:03:15.160> thing<00:03:15.280> would<00:03:15.400> be<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:16.150> then

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
the best thing would be and then

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.360 
the best thing would be and then
circling<00:03:17.410> back<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.770> team<00:03:18.040> what<00:03:18.220> do<00:03:18.310> you

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
think that you add to this team and what

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.080 
think that you add to this team and what
is<00:03:20.380> going<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.620> be<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.950> hallmark<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.880> teeth

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
is going to be the hallmark of the teeth

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.870 
is going to be the hallmark of the teeth
I<00:03:22.750> think<00:03:23.320> like<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.740> had<00:03:23.800> someone<00:03:24.580> that's<00:03:24.820> like

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
I think like I had someone that's like

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.530 
I think like I had someone that's like
stretch<00:03:25.240> forward<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:26.070> play<00:03:27.070> precarious<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:28.120> I

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
stretch forward I play precarious I I

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.830 
stretch forward I play precarious I I
just

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
just

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.110 
just
my<00:03:30.590> team<00:03:30.769> is<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:31.040> best<00:03:31.069> opportunity<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.940> win

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
my team is the best opportunity to win

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.970 
my team is the best opportunity to win
so<00:03:32.450> like<00:03:32.629> that<00:03:32.900> means<00:03:33.080> make<00:03:33.260> an<00:03:33.410> extra<00:03:33.680> pass

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
so like that means make an extra pass

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.550 
so like that means make an extra pass
whatever<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:34.610> may<00:03:34.700> be<00:03:34.989> that's<00:03:35.989> what<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.319> want<00:03:36.500> to

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
whatever it may be that's what I want to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.500 
whatever it may be that's what I want to
