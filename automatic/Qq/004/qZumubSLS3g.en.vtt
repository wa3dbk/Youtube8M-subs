00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.150
 hi everyone is welcome on the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.630
 chain so I was visiting to start a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.759
 new kind of dedicated videos 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.050
 exclusively for the maintenance of my 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:37.440
 hair it's true that it's coming soon 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 six months in drawing 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.550
 in fact I decided to use only 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.400
 organic products and ideally in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.350
 my daughter's cosmetics 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:55.589
 but it's true that I do not go 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.809
 account that the age of cutting me with the 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.269
 federal nurse work that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.659
 reality i do not fear as well on 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.560
 hair as I say invalid 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.049
 I gave myself a personal challenge 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.170
 to devote a little more time 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.000
 hair care then just the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.770
 little story when I started in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.810
 December 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.960
 no but I had to be cut 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.320
 my hair here that I had a lot of 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.950
 broken 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.259
 by the way I was doing a lot of blow drying 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.899
 anyway my hair was exposed to 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.659
 a lot of heat and that's a nice game 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.420
 between them was not holding and so I stopped 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.200
 all this a little bit and so I 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.610
 noticed that the day 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.950
 hair without membrane in account 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.469
 do not understand my race and I did a 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:53.079
 blow-dry there is a project they bothered me 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.810
 did before the Lascaux hair 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.659
 like that he just went to do them 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.899
 straighteners and I noticed my choices 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.460
 have not hurt that's what gave me so 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.769
 the idea two consecrated for the six 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.590
 next days until December a little 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.959
 more talk today the stadium 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:20.170
 but I'll start with one 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:25.230
 check goes with your t-shirt and I take 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.670
 also I organized compared to Tuesday 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.079
 and I'm going to ask myself as and when 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.319
 measure evolutions if mach that works 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.910
 I know where not least because 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.850
 to have distorted it elsewhere 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.370
 Does cindy orain finish beauty in 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.820
 general but there it is eating a 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.640
 matter of applying what I know 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.710
 to apply what I know to my type of 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.580
 the one we talk about when we think about 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.470
 novela we transfer Indian women 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.080
 or so European women at 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.780
 that a fairly precise type of hair 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.250
 which is similar or comparable part 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.650
 afro hair 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.770
 so here I applied what I know 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:19.840
 and as you go, see if I have to 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:23.050
 tell you my program includes from 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.990
 boost my diet so 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.910
 tonight a lot more geared towards my 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.400
 goal so there for the match 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.940
 the cause also of maintenance and especially the 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.690
 keeping the lengths so I'll 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:42.010
 talk and so about my food origin 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:44.800
 of my habits of my liveside so the 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.290
 sport and other style habits of 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.150
 life that I would have thanks for me are 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.850
 favorable to the tip of the hair or 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.990
 less to make fire and then so the 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:59.130
 gestures of the daily gesture the week 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.250
 is essential for precisely to van den 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:49.920
 bossche 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:58.640
 so I see in my hair anymore or 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:58.640
 less yes I am strong a centimeter 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:10.530
 a centimeter so long hours 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:15.450
 knowing that normally there is a or 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:19.220
 two centimeters an inch a month 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.220
 in the video I mean 2 cm 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.030
 technically my goal is to 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.280
 redo my next shock announcement 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.050
 in three months which means that 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:40.259
 technically I must have taken 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:49.190
 6 cm 2 inches so my hair and in 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:54.919
 vain he should be here in three months 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:57.360
 it's May 16th, so August 16th 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.360
 in any case the week of August 16 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.830
 I will make a Czech one to see if 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.180
 actually I reach my 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:09.680
 objective which is the loire in 6 cm of 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.680
 boxing
