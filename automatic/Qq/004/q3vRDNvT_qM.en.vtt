little<00:02:42.080> momentum<00:02:42.320> going<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:43.340> these<00:02:43.460> last<00:02:43.780> last

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
little momentum going to these last last

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.330 
little momentum going to these last last
half<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.260> time<00:02:45.410> there's<00:02:45.770> no<00:02:45.920> telling<00:02:46.250> what

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
half of the time there's no telling what

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.250 
half of the time there's no telling what
you<00:02:46.400> have<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.670> happen<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.970> either<00:02:47.260> roads

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
you have to happen to either roads

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.080 
you have to happen to either roads
barrier<00:02:48.560> last<00:02:48.740> night<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.130> moved<00:02:49.340> up<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.790> think

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
barrier last night and moved up I think

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.290 
barrier last night and moved up I think
for<00:02:50.450> spots<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.020> average<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.210> there's<00:02:53.210> only

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
for spots in the average so there's only

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.180 
for spots in the average so there's only
two<00:02:53.420> teams<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:53.990> halfway<00:02:54.920> through<00:02:55.160> so

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.990 

it's<00:03:01.640> only<00:03:01.820> 15,000<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:03.050> guess<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:03.920> must<00:03:04.370> have<00:03:04.490> I

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
it's only 15,000 I guess it must have I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.550 
it's only 15,000 I guess it must have I
mean<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:05.630> it<00:03:05.720> wouldn't<00:03:05.930> surprise<00:03:06.050> what<00:03:06.440> I'm

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
mean but it wouldn't surprise what I'm

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.130 
mean but it wouldn't surprise what I'm
saying<00:03:06.770> we're<00:03:06.890> halfway<00:03:07.070> there<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.870> don't

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
saying we're halfway there and I don't

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.200 
saying we're halfway there and I don't
see<00:03:09.410> how<00:03:09.590> we<00:03:09.650> would<00:03:09.950> have<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.190> chance<00:03:10.550> to

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
see how we would have a chance to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.920 
see how we would have a chance to
possibly<00:03:11.390> win<00:03:11.920> 34th<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.130> average<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:14.090> God

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
possibly win 34th of the average and God

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.300 
possibly win 34th of the average and God
could<00:03:15.110> throw<00:03:15.320> some<00:03:15.560> fame<00:03:15.830> monies<00:03:16.160> are

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
could throw some fame monies are

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.100 
could throw some fame monies are
checking<00:03:16.910> their<00:03:17.150> third-place<00:03:17.630> checks<00:03:17.930> in

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
checking their third-place checks in

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.510 
checking their third-place checks in
there<00:03:18.260> looking<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.010> out<00:03:19.100> there<00:03:19.220> was<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> lot<00:03:19.490> of

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
there looking it out there was a lot of

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.679 
there looking it out there was a lot of
money<00:03:19.700> no<00:03:20.510> telling<00:03:20.810> what<00:03:20.930> else

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
money no telling what else

salvaging a carrot or forth an average

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.429 
salvaging a carrot or forth an average
would<00:03:25.129> be<00:03:25.250> awesome<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:26.540> start<00:03:26.810> we<00:03:26.930> had<00:03:27.110> that
