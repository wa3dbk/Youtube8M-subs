does stay closed as you can see some of
the<00:02:21.580> cheaper<00:02:22.090> nights<00:02:22.300> with<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> little<00:02:22.990> bit<00:02:23.110> of

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
the cheaper nights with a little bit of

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.930 
the cheaper nights with a little bit of
up<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.560> down<00:02:23.680> motion<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.190> can<00:02:24.430> usually<00:02:24.640> get

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
up and down motion I can usually get

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.430 
up and down motion I can usually get
them<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.120> open<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.480> little<00:02:25.600> bit<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.960> that<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
them to open a little bit like that and

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.780 
them to open a little bit like that and
you<00:02:26.590> really<00:02:26.860> don't<00:02:27.040> want<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.310> knife<00:02:27.490> like<00:02:27.730> this

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
you really don't want a knife like this

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.520 
you really don't want a knife like this
floating<00:02:28.690> around<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:28.990> your<00:02:29.050> pocket<00:02:29.440> because

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
floating around in your pocket because

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.560 
floating around in your pocket because
once<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.890> reach<00:02:30.070> inside<00:02:30.550> you're<00:02:31.480> probably

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
once you reach inside you're probably

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.420 
once you reach inside you're probably
gonna<00:02:31.780> cut<00:02:32.050> yourself<00:02:32.470> also<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:34.030> note<00:02:34.270> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
gonna cut yourself also on that note the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.570 
gonna cut yourself also on that note the
blade<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:37.770> fairly<00:02:38.770> sharp

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
blade is fairly sharp

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.920 
blade is fairly sharp
you<00:02:39.820> could<00:02:40.000> probably<00:02:40.120> sharpen<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> little

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
you could probably sharpen it a little

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.450 
you could probably sharpen it a little
bit<00:02:41.080> more<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.590> does<00:02:41.770> have<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.070> good<00:02:42.220> enough

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
bit more but it does have a good enough

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.300 
bit more but it does have a good enough
eight<00:02:42.700> edge<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:46.110> pretty<00:02:47.110> much<00:02:47.290> help<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.680> for

an everyday carry knife again you can

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.060 
an everyday carry knife again you can
sharpen<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.290> little<00:02:53.470> bit<00:02:53.560> more<00:02:53.740> if<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:53.890> so

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
sharpen it a little bit more if you so

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.580 
sharpen it a little bit more if you so
choose<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:55.600> be<00:02:55.720> advised<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.500> know

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.270 
choose just be advised that you know
it's<00:02:56.770> not<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.070> sharpest<00:02:57.490> from<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.700> factory<00:02:58.180> I

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
it's not the sharpest from the factory I

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.280 
it's not the sharpest from the factory I
really<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.640> design<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.150> knife<00:03:01.330> it's

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
really like the design of the knife it's

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.080 
really like the design of the knife it's
really<00:03:02.560> simple<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.980> carry<00:03:03.250> with<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.730> pocket

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
really simple to carry with the pocket

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.990 
really simple to carry with the pocket
clip<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:05.050> handle<00:03:05.530> right<00:03:06.250> here<00:03:06.610> it's<00:03:06.850> that

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
clip the handle right here it's that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.470 
clip the handle right here it's that
glass<00:03:07.270> filled<00:03:07.660> nylon<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.670> it's<00:03:09.670> pretty<00:03:10.120> slip

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
glass filled nylon and it's pretty slip

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.850 
glass filled nylon and it's pretty slip
resistant<00:03:11.020> which<00:03:11.260> i<00:03:11.380> think<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:11.710> really

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
resistant which i think is really

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.190 
resistant which i think is really
important<00:03:12.370> for<00:03:12.550> these<00:03:12.700> knives<00:03:13.080> because<00:03:14.080> of

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
important for these knives because of

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.480 
important for these knives because of
the<00:03:14.290> fact<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:15.150> there's<00:03:16.150> really<00:03:16.360> not<00:03:16.630> much<00:03:16.900> of

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
the fact that there's really not much of

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.800 
the fact that there's really not much of
a<00:03:18.490> guard<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:19.000> can<00:03:19.150> see<00:03:19.300> there's<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.540> little<00:03:19.690> bit

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
a guard you can see there's a little bit

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.360 
a guard you can see there's a little bit
of<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.050> pseudo<00:03:20.290> guard<00:03:20.680> right<00:03:20.920> there<00:03:21.100> but<00:03:21.250> there

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
of a pseudo guard right there but there

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.940 
of a pseudo guard right there but there
really<00:03:21.520> isn't<00:03:21.760> much<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.240> guard<00:03:22.860> when<00:03:23.860> it

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
really isn't much of a guard when it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.470 
really isn't much of a guard when it
comes<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.250> these<00:03:24.400> knives<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.090> don't<00:03:25.300> want

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
a super wet handle because you don't

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.000
