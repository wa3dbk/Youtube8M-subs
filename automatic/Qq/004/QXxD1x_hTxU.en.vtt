 Hello everyone, Anton and today I 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.670
 tell you how to build a fence fence 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.679
 This is a very useful thing that will help. 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.969
 you protect yourself from other players on 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.920
 server if you play online lego 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.789
 protect your property from any 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.960
 encroachment 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.880
 zombie creeper and so on why up 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.320
 the fact that you can not jump over the fence 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.070
 i.e. fucking block 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.980
 You can beat it here please 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.210
 fence jump absolutely no way 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.790
 turn out and so how to build a fence 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.780
 for this you need a workbench set 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.899
 so go to the workbench and select the shelf 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.399
 that is all you need is a stick of the board and 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.180
 Workbench and so choose the shelves 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.690
 we put them in such a sequence 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 that is, we have two lower rows 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.629
 fact and get the fence ready now for 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.930
 we need a wicket fence 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.189
 because otherwise how are we going in for 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.520
 we will need wickets boards so we set 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.759
 shelves in that order ie from two 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.110
 the sides are two and the boards between them are ready 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.680
 the gate turned out great and now I tell you 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.330
 I will demonstrate how it is actually 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.740
 fence system 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.210
 works and so we put the fence works 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.420
 right and right 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.310
 mouse we put the block where we want to spend 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.899
 fence and it is automatically extended 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.120
 here we are closed to pass we can not 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.870
 because 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.210
 passion to which i spoke through this 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.900
 God can't get through so 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.760
 make a gate 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.450
 just demolish one fence and put here 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.430
 carriage right click and all now 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.970
 right-click plan we open 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.280
 wicket 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.140
 we leave and right I close everything that's all 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.440
