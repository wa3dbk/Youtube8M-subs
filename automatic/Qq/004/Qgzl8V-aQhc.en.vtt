00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.349 

that's<00:00:15.949> why<00:00:16.129> if<00:00:16.460> we<00:00:16.640> could<00:00:16.789> see<00:00:16.970> all<00:00:17.119> 9

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
that's why if we could see all 9

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.540 
that's why if we could see all 9
consoles<00:00:17.960> and<00:00:18.410> we<00:00:18.560> could<00:00:18.710> take<00:00:18.890> away<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.279> cell

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
consoles and we could take away the cell

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.050 
consoles and we could take away the cell
by<00:00:19.759> using<00:00:20.029> the<00:00:20.630> xbox<00:00:21.019> 360<00:00:21.589> architecture<00:00:22.339> so<00:00:22.970> if

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
by using the xbox 360 architecture so if

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.790 
by using the xbox 360 architecture so if
y'all<00:00:23.240> have<00:00:23.390> a<00:00:23.419> sensuous<00:00:23.900> video<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:24.470> link<00:00:24.619> to

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
y'all have a sensuous video the link to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.779 
y'all have a sensuous video the link to
it<00:00:24.890> would<00:00:25.099> be<00:00:25.220> down<00:00:25.400> below<00:00:25.519> in<00:00:25.699> the

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
it would be down below in the

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.150 
it would be down below in the
description<00:00:26.210> but<00:00:26.359> basically<00:00:26.839> it's<00:00:27.199> 11

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
description but basically it's 11

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.369 
description but basically it's 11
minutes<00:00:28.550> of<00:00:28.699> not<00:00:29.060> a<00:00:29.269> single<00:00:30.159> rebuttal<00:00:32.140> now<00:00:33.140> his

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
minutes of not a single rebuttal now his

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.260 
minutes of not a single rebuttal now his
main<00:00:33.680> thing<00:00:34.129> and<00:00:34.460> pretty<00:00:34.670> much<00:00:34.730> his<00:00:34.940> only

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
main thing and pretty much his only

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.420 
main thing and pretty much his only
point<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:35.570> try<00:00:35.719> to<00:00:35.780> make<00:00:36.050> Dom<00:00:36.649> to<00:00:37.190> try<00:00:37.370> to

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
point you try to make Dom to try to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.889 
point you try to make Dom to try to
invalidate<00:00:37.789> my<00:00:38.030> chart<00:00:38.420> was<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:38.719> have<00:00:38.809> to

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
invalidate my chart was that have to

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.720 
invalidate my chart was that have to
compare<00:00:39.230> it<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:39.559> 360's<00:00:40.250> of<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:40.460> ps3

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
compare it to the 360's of the ps3

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.549 
compare it to the 360's of the ps3
because<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.329> cell<00:00:41.539> architecture<00:00:41.870> things<00:00:42.410> are

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
because the cell architecture things are

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.470 
because the cell architecture things are
hard<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.800> compare<00:00:43.160> so<00:00:43.820> here<00:00:44.000> you<00:00:44.090> go<00:00:44.120> truth

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
hard to compare so here you go truth

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.920 
hard to compare so here you go truth
here<00:00:44.899> is<00:00:45.079> a<00:00:45.199> chart<00:00:45.469> comparing<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.550> 360<00:00:47.359> to<00:00:47.840> the

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
here is a chart comparing the 360 to the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.799 
here is a chart comparing the 360 to the
ps4<00:00:48.230> sleep<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.010> what<00:00:49.489> do<00:00:49.579> you<00:00:49.670> notice<00:00:49.910> it's

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
ps4 sleep and what do you notice it's

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.669 
ps4 sleep and what do you notice it's
the<00:00:51.050> same<00:00:51.670> fucking<00:00:52.670> thing<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.719> I<00:00:54.379> find<00:00:54.590> it

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
the same fucking thing and I find it

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.080 
the same fucking thing and I find it
funny<00:00:54.890> how<00:00:55.039> you<00:00:55.190> tell<00:00:55.460> me<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.579> have<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.730> compare

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
funny how you tell me I have to compare

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.060 
funny how you tell me I have to compare
the<00:00:56.210> 360<00:00:56.809> but<00:00:57.019> then<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.289> go<00:00:57.410> into<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.739> comment

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
the 360 but then you go into the comment

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.919 
the 360 but then you go into the comment
section<00:00:58.339> on<00:00:58.460> your<00:00:58.640> video<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.179> tell<00:00:59.719> me<00:00:59.809> that

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
section on your video and tell me that

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.529 
section on your video and tell me that
the<00:01:00.050> ps3<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.589> 360<00:01:01.039> are<00:01:01.219> two<00:01:01.579> barely<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.120> very

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
the ps3 and 360 are two barely a very

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.720 
the ps3 and 360 are two barely a very
closely<00:01:02.839> spec<00:01:03.260> machines<00:01:03.469> so<00:01:04.460> what's<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
closely spec machines so what's the

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.670 
closely spec machines so what's the
point<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:04.970> me<00:01:05.060> even<00:01:05.090> adding<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.870> 360<00:01:06.410> to<00:01:06.530> this

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
point of me even adding the 360 to this

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.040 
point of me even adding the 360 to this
graph<00:01:06.920> is<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.460> first<00:01:07.820> place<00:01:08.060> then<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:08.390> see<00:01:09.020> it

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
graph is the first place then you see it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.320 
graph is the first place then you see it
I'm<00:01:09.200> saying<00:01:09.380> but<00:01:10.040> just<00:01:10.370> to<00:01:10.430> point<00:01:10.610> out<00:01:10.820> this<00:01:11.270> is

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
I'm saying but just to point out this is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.820 
I'm saying but just to point out this is
a<00:01:11.480> little<00:01:11.600> bit<00:01:11.780> more<00:01:11.930> refined<00:01:12.140> graph<00:01:12.620> I

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
a little bit more refined graph I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.830 
a little bit more refined graph I
actually<00:01:13.040> got<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.030> combined<00:01:14.510> flat

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
actually got the combined flat

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.680 
actually got the combined flat
performance<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:16.070> ps3<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.880> 360<00:01:17.570> to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
performance of the ps3 and the 360 to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
performance of the ps3 and the 360 to
compare<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.050> to<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.200> combined<00:01:18.470> class

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
compare it to the combined class

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.350 
compare it to the combined class
performance<00:01:19.160> of<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.310> ps4<00:01:19.580> it's<00:01:20.000> no<00:01:20.180> longer

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
performance of the ps4 it's no longer

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.810 
performance of the ps4 it's no longer
CPU<00:01:20.900> only<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:21.770> those<00:01:21.980> the<00:01:22.160> multipliers<00:01:22.640> you

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
CPU only so those the multipliers you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.640 
CPU only so those the multipliers you
get<00:01:22.970> right<00:01:23.150> there<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.840> green<00:01:24.080> arrows<00:01:24.440> all

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
get right there the green arrows all

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.500 
get right there the green arrows all
that<00:01:24.770> means<00:01:24.980> is<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.190> their<00:01:25.610> greater<00:01:25.940> than<00:01:26.240> in

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
that means is that their greater than in

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.780 
that means is that their greater than in
that<00:01:26.720> area<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.860> minuses<00:01:28.340> you'll<00:01:28.580> see

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
that area and the minuses you'll see

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.220 
that area and the minuses you'll see
next<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.210> some<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.480> multipliers<00:01:29.900> near<00:01:30.140> the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
next to some the multipliers near the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.260 
next to some the multipliers near the
bottom<00:01:30.410> is<00:01:30.710> basically<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.730> know<00:01:31.790> that's<00:01:32.060> it

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
bottom is basically you know that's it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.870 
bottom is basically you know that's it
at<00:01:32.390> its<00:01:32.540> max<00:01:32.810> it<00:01:33.050> seven<00:01:33.410> times<00:01:33.590> maximum<00:01:34.160> 7<00:01:34.580> or

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
at its max it seven times maximum 7 or

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.690 
at its max it seven times maximum 7 or
below<00:01:35.180> 15<00:01:35.780> or<00:01:35.960> below<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:36.620> see<00:01:36.740> on<00:01:36.830> me<00:01:36.980> so<00:01:37.370> even

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
below 15 or below you see on me so even

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.090 
below 15 or below you see on me so even
those<00:01:37.850> aspects<00:01:38.420> um<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:39.740> know<00:01:39.830> with<00:01:39.980> those

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
those aspects um you know with those

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.040 
those aspects um you know with those
things<00:01:40.340> smaller<00:01:41.210> than<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:41.480> previous<00:01:41.600> leaps

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
things smaller than in previous leaps

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.470 
things smaller than in previous leaps
but<00:01:42.590> that's<00:01:42.800> all<00:01:43.070> i<00:01:43.100> have<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.370> say<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:44.120> rest<00:01:44.360> of

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
but that's all i have to say the rest of

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.700 
but that's all i have to say the rest of
the<00:01:44.540> video<00:01:44.810> I'm<00:01:44.930> just<00:01:44.960> going<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.260> roll<00:01:45.440> his

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
the video I'm just going to roll his

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.560 
the video I'm just going to roll his
footage<00:01:46.100> show<00:01:46.580> him<00:01:46.730> contradicting<00:01:47.450> himself

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
footage show him contradicting himself

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.320 
footage show him contradicting himself
and<00:01:47.990> show<00:01:48.200> him<00:01:48.410> arguing<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.490> gets<00:01:49.790> mark<00:01:50.060> cerny

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
and show him arguing it gets mark cerny

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.420

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
games you told me to use numbers i use

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.420 
games you told me to use numbers i use

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
numbers so now i have to use a 360 i use

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.400

talking<00:03:41.380> about<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.590> different<00:03:41.709> game<00:03:42.010> oh<00:03:42.420> right

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
talking about a different game oh right

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.080 
talking about a different game oh right
but<00:03:44.560> they<00:03:44.709> had<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.920> sell<00:03:45.250> architecture<00:03:45.970> to

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
but they had to sell architecture to

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.750 
but they had to sell architecture to
deal<00:03:46.270> with<00:03:46.540> on<00:03:46.750> Killzone<00:03:47.560> 2<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:48.069> was<00:03:48.370> hard<00:03:48.550> rock

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
deal with on Killzone 2 I was hard rock

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.160 
deal with on Killzone 2 I was hard rock
church<00:03:48.910> architecture<00:03:49.270> would<00:03:49.750> take<00:03:49.930> longer

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
church architecture would take longer

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.070 
church architecture would take longer
but<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.370> was<00:03:51.519> after<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.300> game<00:03:52.540> came<00:03:52.660> out<00:03:52.780> two

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
but that was after the game came out two

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.800 
but that was after the game came out two
years<00:03:53.110> after<00:03:53.590> launch<00:03:54.100> right<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.420> they<00:03:55.540> had<00:03:55.660> all

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
years after launch right so they had all

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.000 
years after launch right so they had all
those<00:03:55.930> other<00:03:56.110> games<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.470> were<00:03:56.650> being<00:03:56.830> made

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
those other games that were being made

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.800 
those other games that were being made
at<00:03:57.190> launch<00:03:57.400> helping<00:03:58.090> people<00:03:58.330> learn<00:03:58.510> how<00:03:58.750> the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
at launch helping people learn how the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.509 
at launch helping people learn how the
cell<00:03:59.080> architecture<00:03:59.380> worked<00:03:59.920> they<00:04:00.250> got<00:04:00.400> to

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
cell architecture worked they got to

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.830 
cell architecture worked they got to
take<00:04:00.670> advantage<00:04:00.970> of<00:04:01.209> some<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.660> knowledge

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
take advantage of some of that knowledge

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.449 
take advantage of some of that knowledge
and<00:04:02.200> put<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.680> into<00:04:02.830> what<00:04:03.069> they<00:04:03.190> were<00:04:03.250> doing

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
and put it into what they were doing

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.850 
and put it into what they were doing
with<00:04:03.670> Killzone<00:04:04.120> 2<00:04:04.230> well<00:04:05.230> how<00:04:05.500> do<00:04:05.560> we<00:04:05.680> have<00:04:05.830> that
