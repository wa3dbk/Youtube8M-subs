I've<00:00:25.050> never<00:00:25.199> seen<00:00:25.400> yeah<00:00:26.400> absolutely<00:00:26.670> we've

I've never seen yeah absolutely we've

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.550 
I've never seen yeah absolutely we've
done<00:00:27.330> something<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.689> no<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.260> else<00:00:28.320> has<00:00:28.470> done

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
before the whole point really is to make

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.889 
before the whole point really is to make
something<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.710> really<00:00:31.980> doesn't<00:00:32.899> restrict

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
something that really doesn't restrict

the user as far as how the layout is you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.389 
the user as far as how the layout is you
can<00:00:35.969> set<00:00:36.210> any<00:00:36.390> button<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.320> any<00:00:37.500> function<00:00:38.070> you

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
can set any button to any function you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.760 
can set any button to any function you
can<00:00:38.430> select<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.629> seven<00:00:39.989> colors<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.530> every

button you can set the labels you could

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
button you can set the labels you could
set<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> functions<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.010> you're<00:00:44.190> not<00:00:44.340> limited

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
set the functions so you're not limited

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.760 
set the functions so you're not limited
to<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> manufacturer<00:00:45.840> has<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.680> know

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
to what the manufacturer has you know

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
to what the manufacturer has you know
painted<00:00:47.219> over<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> buttons<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.090> one<00:00:48.300> will

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
painted over the buttons this one will

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.850 
painted over the buttons this one will
let<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.690> set<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> way<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> want

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
so the colors are assignable to each

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900 
so the colors are assignable to each
button<00:00:51.840> yeah<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.739> assign<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.760> on

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
button yeah you can assign the the on

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
button yeah you can assign the the on

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
I don't know any anything you can think

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.730 
I don't know any anything you can think
of<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.880> there's<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.630> no<00:01:18.810> restriction<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of it there's just no restriction to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.120 
of it there's just no restriction to
that<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.159> about<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.390> screen<00:01:21.920> yeah<00:01:22.920> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that at all about the screen yeah so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.410 
that at all about the screen yeah so
basically<00:01:23.280> we've<00:01:23.610> got<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> touch<00:01:23.939> screen<00:01:24.119> up

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
basically we've got a touch screen up

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.050 
basically we've got a touch screen up
here<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> first<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.759> really

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
here and for the first time we really

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.969 
here and for the first time we really
wanted<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> controller<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.500> didn't

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
wanted to do a controller that didn't

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.380 
wanted to do a controller that didn't
work<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> traditional<00:01:29.549> controllers

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
work like the traditional controllers

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.319 
work like the traditional controllers
where<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.369> revolt<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.790> involves

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
where you know that revolt that involves

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.060 
where you know that revolt that involves
a<00:01:33.390> lot<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> button<00:01:33.930> mashing<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.439> all<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
a lot of button mashing and all that and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.179 
a lot of button mashing and all that and
so<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:35.970> we've<00:01:36.900> used<00:01:37.680> touchscreen

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
so here we've used touchscreen

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.359 
so here we've used touchscreen
technology<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.650> we<00:01:40.650> only<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> bit<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
technology and we only have a bit of the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.889 
technology and we only have a bit of the
interface<00:01:41.700> implemented<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:42.659> but

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
interface implemented it right now but

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.660 
interface implemented it right now but
basically<00:01:43.290> instead<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.979> putting<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.490> bunch

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
basically instead of putting in a bunch

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.999 
basically instead of putting in a bunch
of<00:01:44.790> numbers<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> MIDI<00:01:45.509> parameters<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.829> want

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
of numbers and MIDI parameters we want

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.740 
of numbers and MIDI parameters we want
to<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.369> set<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.060> tell<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
to have it set up so you can tell it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.240 
to have it set up so you can tell it
what<00:01:49.290> devices<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:50.670> system<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
what devices you have in your system and

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
what devices you have in your system and
then<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.640> set<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.970> up<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.689> best

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
then it will set it up for you as best

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.530 
then it will set it up for you as best
it<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.310> if<00:01:56.310> you're<00:01:56.520> setting<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.180> an<00:01:57.270> effects

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it can if you're setting up an effects

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.289 
it can if you're setting up an effects
processor<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.759> system<00:02:00.060> will<00:02:00.149> know

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
processor you know the system will know

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.999 
processor you know the system will know
okay<00:02:00.570> we've<00:02:00.899> got<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> chorus<00:02:01.530> pedal<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.979> a
