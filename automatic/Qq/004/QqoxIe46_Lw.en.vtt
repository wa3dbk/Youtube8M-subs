additional<00:03:26.370> chant<00:03:26.880> crit<00:03:27.510> chance<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.169> it's

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
additional chant crit chance so it's

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.220 
additional chant crit chance so it's
going<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:28.950> toss<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.310> between<00:03:29.579> those<00:03:29.819> as<00:03:30.569> you
