56<00:02:59.910> millimeter<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.989> then<00:03:04.849> they<00:03:05.849> sent<00:03:06.239> me

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
56 millimeter and then they sent me

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.020 
56 millimeter and then they sent me
another<00:03:06.840> set<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.290> EFS<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.040> think<00:03:08.849> these<00:03:08.940> are
