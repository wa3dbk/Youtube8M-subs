00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.260
 and all the welcome age 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.880
 Today, as promised, I show the config on 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.980
 ks16 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.970
 this tip takes away completely the recoil and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 a little scatter i.e. recoil is when 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.170
 throws you in different directions scatter it 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.020
 when bullets fly 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:38.219
 very smooth and so well here is this config me 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:44.070
 I like the fact that SVP is just hard 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:48.210
 how I take it out I'll show you later so myself 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.520
 the config is called hack but it will be necessary 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.719
 rename Dima player I'll throw you 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:00.780
 Just the player is already installed 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:02.690
 so I know what's in the folder contrast rayka 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.920
 there is already this player 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:12.510
 yes but you will need to throw this one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.560
 dimu player that the config started working like this 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.280
 copy replacements 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:25.340
 all now comes a little bit of file replacement 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.340
 close everything and go into the game 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:32.590
 so i went to counter-strike and to 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.030
 activate this config us you 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.060
 you just need to open the console and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.969
 enter three teams 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:49.209
 all teams will be in the description 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:50.439
 first team kyle nori coil 1 2 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:57.640
 team kyle 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:58.890
 nose alcohol is also 1 and 3 command call out a 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.840
 pistol 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.020
 these commands are not in the console and because 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.619
 these commands only come with config so 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.569
 when we all led 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.670
 go in the game so I will put more 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.209
 of money 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.209
 now 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:31.500
 go in the game and check so well 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.650
 for example on n4 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.340
 no better on the machine gun show then you 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.340
 Make sure that 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.860
 what's the spread and 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.850
 so you see the variation of recoil is not at all 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.600
 in us does not throw in any direction 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:16.860
 usually when you shoot from + p us 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:25.820
 throws here defense and as we see in 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:28.620
 the spread has decreased significantly like this 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:34.590
 but now when the round comes I have a bunch 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.660
 record and so passed the round and now I will give you 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.670
 I will demonstrate how it shoots at all 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:44.120
 savab and gvp just fly away i servers 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.340
 just putting headshots svp 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.220
 so for example just so i like to shoot 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.930
 just here and so the wall of players and 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.220
 so no sight is not necessary to direct 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:02.810
 just shoot as you can see the bullet flies 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.810
 straight on target but in general 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.540
 no impact and spread of small but 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:23.010
 generally crashed no but the group so now 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.010
 I will demonstrate on m4 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:37.180
 as you can see the scatter is very small and 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:43.150
 recoil is not all well everything is in general on this 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:47.440
 all subscribe to the channel who does not 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:51.490
 will go this config then I will leave in 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.510
 describing your main zhks all good luck 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.510
