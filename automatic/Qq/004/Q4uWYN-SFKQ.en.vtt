the Live View window for control and I

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.389 
the Live View window for control and I
console<00:00:46.359> looks<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.750> same<00:00:46.960> now<00:00:47.859> you<00:00:47.980> could

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
console looks the same now you could

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.400 
console looks the same now you could
change<00:00:48.789> this<00:00:49.149> some<00:00:49.480> people<00:00:49.750> find<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.199> the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
change this some people find that the

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.029

dark<00:00:50.620> color<00:00:50.920> isn't<00:00:51.190> quite<00:00:51.609> as<00:00:51.730> easy<00:00:52.149> to<00:00:52.620> use<00:00:53.620> so

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
dark color isn't quite as easy to use so

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.680 
dark color isn't quite as easy to use so
what<00:00:54.339> you<00:00:54.460> can<00:00:54.609> do<00:00:54.789> is<00:00:54.999> this<00:00:55.149> go<00:00:55.329> up<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.570> the

you can use on control my Nikon so by

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.910 
you can use on control my Nikon so by
default<00:01:07.060> we<00:01:07.630> had<00:01:07.840> one<00:01:08.020> called<00:01:08.290> default<00:01:08.740> this

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
default we had one called default this

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.320 
default we had one called default this
dark<00:01:09.190> one<00:01:09.370> but<00:01:09.550> let's<00:01:09.730> try<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.940> different<00:01:10.300> one

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
dark one but let's try a different one

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
we're going to call it calcium and

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.450 
we're going to call it calcium and
automatically<00:01:13.720> this<00:01:14.080> will<00:01:14.290> change<00:01:14.800> for<00:01:15.310> you

different ones that's calcium we have

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.570 
different ones that's calcium we have
another<00:01:36.400> one<00:01:36.640> called<00:01:36.810> let's<00:01:37.810> see<00:01:38.460> pulsar<00:01:39.460> is

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
another one called let's see pulsar is
