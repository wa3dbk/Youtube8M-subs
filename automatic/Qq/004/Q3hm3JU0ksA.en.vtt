seriously I haven't tried it out I love
my<00:01:52.020> gallup<00:01:52.860> my<00:01:53.070> smartphones<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.899> know

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
my gallup my smartphones that you know

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.980 
my gallup my smartphones that you know
the<00:01:55.500> screen<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.130> everything<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.990> having

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the screen and everything and having

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.190 
the screen and everything and having
like<00:01:58.649> three<00:01:58.979> more<00:01:59.430> inches<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.079> be

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
like three more inches that would be

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.340 
like three more inches that would be
kind<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.500> nice<00:02:01.710> yeah<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> mean<00:02:03.689> seriously<00:02:03.930> I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
kind of nice yeah so I mean seriously I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.410 
kind of nice yeah so I mean seriously I
think<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.250> would<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.670> more<00:02:05.880> interested<00:02:06.329> in

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
think I would be more interested in

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.400 
think I would be more interested in
buying<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:07.190> seven-point<00:02:08.190> 85<00:02:08.610> inch<00:02:08.849> iPad<00:02:09.569> then<00:02:10.379> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
buying a seven-point 85 inch iPad then a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.040 
buying a seven-point 85 inch iPad then a
10<00:02:10.920> inch<00:02:11.129> iPad<00:02:11.730> because<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.569> never<00:02:12.690> actually

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
10 inch iPad because I never actually

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.820 
10 inch iPad because I never actually
tried<00:02:13.410> all

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
tried all

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.470 
tried all
this<00:02:13.920> form<00:02:14.160> factor<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.550> think<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.970> feels<00:02:15.150> like

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
this form factor I think it feels like

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.710 
this form factor I think it feels like
this<00:02:16.320> could<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.710> one<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.160> more<00:02:18.150> optimal

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
this could be one of the more optimal

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.310 
this could be one of the more optimal
screen<00:02:19.590> sizes<00:02:19.800> may<00:02:20.130> be<00:02:20.570> because<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.870> 10-inch

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
screen sizes may be because the 10-inch

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.530 
screen sizes may be because the 10-inch
it's<00:02:22.770> really<00:02:23.130> big<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.490> know<00:02:23.640> you're<00:02:24.300> going<00:02:24.420> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
it's really big you know you're going to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.370 
it's really big you know you're going to
take<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> deep<00:02:25.050> no<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.400> won't<00:02:26.580> take<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> deep

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
take it deep no you won't take a deep

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.620 
take it deep no you won't take a deep
but<00:02:28.380> yeah<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.490> it's<00:02:29.910> seven<00:02:30.240> point<00:02:30.450> eight<00:02:30.570> five

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
but yeah so it's seven point eight five

if I know Apple right I think that they

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.930 
if I know Apple right I think that they
wouldn't<00:02:44.850> actually<00:02:45.270> do<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.670> they<00:02:47.670> will<00:02:47.850> you

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
wouldn't actually do it they will you

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.440 
wouldn't actually do it they will you
slap<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:48.480> their<00:02:48.720> own<00:02:48.840> school<00:02:49.230> or<00:02:49.530> old<00:02:49.890> screen

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
slap on their own school or old screen

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.720 
slap on their own school or old screen
