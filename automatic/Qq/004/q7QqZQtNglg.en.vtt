could<00:03:08.610> probably<00:03:08.940> do<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> good<00:03:09.510> stop<00:03:09.720> if<00:03:09.900> you're

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019

could probably do a good stop if you're
doing<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.380> good<00:03:10.560> clip<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.239> responds

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
doing on a good clip and that responds

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.960 
doing on a good clip and that responds

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
once you kind of figured out the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.930 
once you kind of figured out the
expansion<00:04:56.680> on<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:56.980> luggage<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:57.520> you<00:04:57.550> can<00:04:57.790> have

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
expansion on the luggage so you can have

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.520 
expansion on the luggage so you can have
it<00:04:58.090> small<00:04:58.210> for<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.600> day<00:04:58.780> trip<00:04:59.110> but<00:04:59.140> then<00:04:59.440> it

it small for a day trip but then it

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.200 
it small for a day trip but then it
expands<00:04:59.980> it<00:05:00.100> apparently<00:05:00.430> is<00:05:00.550> waterproof

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
expands it apparently is waterproof

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.120 
expands it apparently is waterproof
it's<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.600> neat<00:05:01.810> system<00:05:02.110> it<00:05:02.530> is<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.860> the<00:05:02.919> fact

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
it's a neat system it is and the fact

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.950 
it's a neat system it is and the fact
that<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.400> can<00:05:03.850> pop<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.240> off<00:05:04.390> carry<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.750> into

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
that you can pop it off carry it into

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.420 
that you can pop it off carry it into
your<00:05:05.050> hotel<00:05:05.380> room<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.650> bed-and-breakfast

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
your hotel room you bed-and-breakfast

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.280 
your hotel room you bed-and-breakfast
it's<00:05:06.669> even<00:05:06.910> better<00:05:07.060> yeah<00:05:07.510> it's<00:05:07.720> only<00:05:07.900> ready<00:05:08.230> to

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
it's even better yeah it's only ready to

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.320 
it's even better yeah it's only ready to
go<00:05:08.440> with<00:05:08.680> pop<00:05:08.860> off<00:05:09.070> luggage<00:05:09.430> like<00:05:09.640> that<00:05:09.820> very

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
go with pop off luggage like that very

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.720 
go with pop off luggage like that very
smart<00:05:10.690> move<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.260> I<00:05:11.800> don't<00:05:11.919> and<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.370> think<00:05:12.400> it

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
smart move and I don't and I think it

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.159 
smart move and I don't and I think it
goes<00:05:12.850> well<00:05:13.120> with<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.300> price<00:05:13.570> it<00:05:13.840> doesn't

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
goes well with the price it doesn't

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.190 
goes well with the price it doesn't
distract<00:05:14.470> from<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.919> in<00:05:15.010> my<00:05:15.130> opinion<00:05:16.200> yeah

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
distract from it in my opinion yeah

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.770 
distract from it in my opinion yeah

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
anything let you down I was looking for

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.210 
anything let you down I was looking for
something<00:05:19.960> that<00:05:20.229> was<00:05:20.320> wrong<00:05:20.590> with<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:21.010> in<00:05:21.190> that

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
something that was wrong with it in that

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.550 
something that was wrong with it in that
I<00:05:21.790> was<00:05:22.479> playing<00:05:22.750> with<00:05:22.960> it<00:05:23.139> when<00:05:23.320> we<00:05:23.350> were

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
I was playing with it when we were

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.990 
I was playing with it when we were
following<00:05:23.860> you<00:05:23.950> just<00:05:24.250> you<00:05:24.490> know<00:05:24.610> back<00:05:24.820> and

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
following you just you know back and

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.490 
following you just you know back and
forth<00:05:25.180> trying<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:25.450> get<00:05:25.570> a<00:05:25.630> feel<00:05:25.870> how<00:05:25.900> nimble<00:05:26.290> it

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
forth trying to get a feel how nimble it

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.890 
forth trying to get a feel how nimble it
was<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:27.070> turned<00:05:27.370> on<00:05:27.640> a<00:05:27.669> dime<00:05:27.790> even<00:05:28.390> like<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.750> said

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
was it turned on a dime even like I said

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.020 
was it turned on a dime even like I said
despite<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:29.500> long<00:05:29.830> wheelbase<00:05:30.070> did<00:05:30.880> are<00:05:31.000> you

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
despite the long wheelbase did are you

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.060 
despite the long wheelbase did are you
turns<00:05:31.450> no<00:05:31.810> problem<00:05:32.290> in<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:32.740> just<00:05:32.770> trying

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
turns no problem in that and just trying

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.140 
turns no problem in that and just trying
to<00:05:33.160> throw<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.520> bike<00:05:33.700> because<00:05:33.910> if<00:05:34.030> you're

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
to throw the bike because if you're

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.610 
to throw the bike because if you're
doing<00:05:34.330> an<00:05:34.510> emergency<00:05:34.930> avoidance<00:05:35.320> or<00:05:35.410> anything

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
doing an emergency avoidance or anything

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.980 
doing an emergency avoidance or anything
it<00:05:35.890> responded<00:05:36.430> so<00:05:36.700> well<00:05:36.910> so<00:05:37.270> like<00:05:37.479> obviously

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
it responded so well so like obviously

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.719 
it responded so well so like obviously
lowering<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.740> center<00:05:38.890> of<00:05:39.039> gravity<00:05:39.130> that<00:05:39.520> they

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
lowering the center of gravity that they

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.719 
lowering the center of gravity that they
have<00:05:39.940> done<00:05:40.180> is<00:05:40.479> just<00:05:40.510> is<00:05:41.020> astronomical<00:05:41.890> yeah

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
have done is just is astronomical yeah

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.730 
have done is just is astronomical yeah
they<00:05:42.910> really<00:05:43.030> lay<00:05:43.360> down<00:05:43.630> that<00:05:44.470> becomes

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
they really lay down that becomes

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.929 
they really lay down that becomes
important<00:05:45.130> to<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.400> ride

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
important to the ride

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:47.559 
important to the ride
unfortunately<00:05:46.939> have<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.150> same<00:05:47.330> strength

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
unfortunately have the same strength

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.480 
unfortunately have the same strength
that's<00:05:47.810> a<00:05:47.900> guy<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:48.349> that<00:05:48.379> not<00:05:48.979> to<00:05:49.129> say<00:05:49.250> that<00:05:49.370> we

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
that's a guy and that not to say that we

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.249 
that's a guy and that not to say that we
can<00:05:49.639> try<00:05:49.819> just<00:05:50.090> as<00:05:50.210> well<00:05:50.360> as<00:05:50.479> fast<00:05:50.810> but<00:05:51.080> with

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
can try just as well as fast but with

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.230 
can try just as well as fast but with
the<00:05:51.349> low<00:05:51.500> center<00:05:51.770> of<00:05:51.800> gravity<00:05:51.889> I<00:05:52.280> never<00:05:52.699> felt

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
the low center of gravity I never felt

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.939 
the low center of gravity I never felt
that<00:05:53.389> this<00:05:53.509> bike<00:05:53.750> was<00:05:53.930> too<00:05:54.080> heavy<00:05:54.289> whatsoever

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
that this bike was too heavy whatsoever

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.100 
that this bike was too heavy whatsoever
I<00:05:55.189> could<00:05:55.520> be<00:05:55.610> very<00:05:55.819> happy<00:05:56.120> having<00:05:56.569> this<00:05:56.689> Holman
