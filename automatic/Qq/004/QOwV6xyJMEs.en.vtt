effects<00:00:29.340> processors<00:00:30.000> which<00:00:30.179> basically<00:00:30.570> means

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
effects processors which basically means

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.450 
effects processors which basically means
that<00:00:31.140> when<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> get<00:00:31.830> these<00:00:32.630> black<00:00:33.630> edition

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
that when you get these black edition

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
that when you get these black edition
process<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.640> basically<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.170> black

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
process is basically because it's black

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
process is basically because it's black
edition<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.980> unlocked<00:00:38.700> which<00:00:38.969> means<00:00:39.270> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
edition it's unlocked which means that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.930 
edition it's unlocked which means that
it<00:00:39.540> doesn't<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> frequency<00:00:40.739> block<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it doesn't have a frequency block so you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.850 
it doesn't have a frequency block so you
can<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.149> overclocked<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> absolute

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
can just overclocked the absolute

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.799 
can just overclocked the absolute
out<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.879> either<00:00:45.270> stop

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
out of it and it will just either stop

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
out of it and it will just either stop
working<00:00:46.289> burnout<00:00:46.829> or<00:00:48.050> work<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.489> that's<00:00:50.489> good

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
working burnout or work so that's good

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.279 
working burnout or work so that's good
but<00:00:51.329> we're<00:00:51.449> not<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.780> overclocking

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
but we're not going to be overclocking

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.889 
but we're not going to be overclocking
because<00:00:52.469> i<00:00:52.680> don't<00:00:52.890> actually<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.899> sufficient

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
because i don't actually have sufficient

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
because i don't actually have sufficient
cooling<00:00:55.820> alright<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.210> nine<00:00:57.390> series
