00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.899
 I'm here as if two whites are coming 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.630
 with the 27 m diamond a nuclear 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.580
 took off quickly good the nuclear no 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
 it's very fast but good 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.969
 It comes perfectly for what they 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.859
 I want to comment today and how are you seeing 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.300
 in the voice that I have is practically not 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.550
 the best one not every day 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.490
 forgive me for that but good as you already 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.070
 I commented to everyone in general today I had to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.260
 today not yesterday I had in the recording I had 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 after the party and all that and then as 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.130
 you are seeing is not that I have my best 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.410
 good voice so I imagine that tomorrow 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.570
 last week and if not then gone 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.579
 as much so good forgive me for 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.070
 I'll try to do the best I can 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.110
 try that is not something that depends on 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.969
 me but I will try that it does not return to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 have been so bad so good 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.010
 I imagine that maybe I do some blog 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.449
 of what I did yesterday of the recording 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.160
 then since many of you do not 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.320
 you are asking and it is a lot that does not 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.270
 a blog so good was quite 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.430
 entertaining about the whole party with 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.579
 several points that there were so good 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.739
 I will comment now a series of things 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.180
 the game and then I will tell you what 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.690
 I really want to come and comment on 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.550
 this 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.410
 in this good as you are seeing then 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.720
 good is a game in which I get out 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.930
 the v is quickly with the trick that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.670
 to catch the points and get out and everything 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.430
 what are you seeing the one you know 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.050
 every Monday art in just 30 28 29 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.610
 seconds is that good is pretty good 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.380
 and I also do it because I'm staying 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.200
 no bullets although good always always 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.870
 he tried to kill with the 27 to try 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.550
 make it nuclear with the 27 since it has 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.670
 take out the nuclear with all the rifles 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.070
 of assault and good is a game which 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.070
 I was with two more subscribers in my 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.560
 team and well we were a group of six 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.810
 what is being said is a group of 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.400
 three I said special we were a group 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.230
 of three so well we did not have the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.660
 whole group so after the end it's 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.970
 as you are seeing in the end you will see that 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.530
 they start to throw the dogs and everything 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.690
 that because our team and us 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.729
 we could not control it 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.320
 because we did not know anything and 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.390
 they started throwing all the gusts and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.330
 all that and good people like 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.700
 we need the pm they start to leave and what 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.470
 typical of always not and good as you are 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.660
 well the title I will make a series 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.910
 of competition 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.800
 of games and that 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.220
 with subscribers and against 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.470
 subscribers and they will be all split 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.660
 not public and nothing will be split 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.400
 private and that to be with you 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.220
 since good there are two types of people 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.770
 who really often comment on this 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.210
 aspect in my videos a first 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.980
 person is the person who wants to play 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.550
 with me it 's good because he likes my 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.470
 videos because he wants to see how it's over 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.230
 I live nuclear also 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.150
 he wants to see how he can throw uve schatz 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.820
 and that to help him get his 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.710
 first nuclear or also help you 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.240
 get one more nuclear or me that is a 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.250
 double nuclear anything for the 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.830
 good style that's a first person 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.500
 the one that really likes all that and 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.540
 then there is another person who wants 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.740
 good are the ones that really help me 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.810
 they like those that are made in the 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.820
 Cockerels saying well that they are the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.260
 better than me I really get these 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.240
 thank you because I'm playing against 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.490
 very bad people that will play against 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.100
 they would not take anything out of me that please 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.050
 same I have played against us a 6 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.120
 against 6 in barracks that if not what 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.800
 you play is that you're good if you do not 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.630
 you play against us 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.150
 and you really think we're better than 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.470
 that series of people whom I most 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.260
 they love those who come here 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.840
 equipped saying they are the best and 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.100
 we have to basically take longer 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.840
 can play a game against all 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.750
 you already know, I guess because 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.060
 you are many and I will try to do my best 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.950
 that I can for then to give a 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.470
 opportunity to all you can do 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.450
 it's just good to delete from my account 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.060
 every so often to add them and 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.770
 for as good for more people 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.660
 can play with you so that 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.820
 besides you can see my 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.830
 departures and they put that are 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.380
 incredible that I made you is also 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.270
 to you for a cable and all that stuff 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.230
 how good we were going directly 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.300
 then I will tell you how you can 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.400
 enroll in this tournament and I'm going to 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.400
 comment on what will consist then 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.980
 As you will see, I will not be anything 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.840
 competitive with the rules or anything vp 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.460
 for the style wear of certain as 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.430
 that the call will not be anything like that 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.000
 they will be yes with a few small rules and 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.500
 mailing list not already made by me and by 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.630
 the things that fascinate me most about 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.710
 this game I'm just going to remove them 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.479
 for 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.340
 that do not bother me and so little 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.289
 annoyed the frame I imagine that the 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.099
 most annoy the first thing to do 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:37.250
 that will be multi team three times 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.840
 three times three or a team of three 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.780
 teams of three and another team of three is 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.759
 that I will try so good to play with 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.530
 two on my team two of you and with 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.720
 six on the other team 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.970
 the lungs games no more imagine 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.000
 that I will not upload the whole game I do not know 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.680
 that as there was no spectacular water today 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.930
 I doubt enough that you take out a nuclear 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.250
 against you because surely you are going to 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.169
 go alone for me to try to annoy 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.990
 bad streak and all that is that good if 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.330
 comes out some interesting play or some 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.599
 interesting defense I do not know if I'll make a 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.720
 assembly that will be the special 30,000 or 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.699
 I'll do a good harvest of the 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.289
 best plays I really do not know what 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.270
 I'm going to do what I do know is that I'm going to 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.770
 organize you can also put me for the 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.330
 comments what you think should be 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.979
 do with all this if you want to what 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.080
 better to upload the games that go 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.090
 throwing in plan 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.620
 how to say it from the second daily video or 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.330
 something like that especially not what 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.340
 I know what I 'm going to do I guess I'll do 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.139
 that if I make a good move and that 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.530
 collect them all and then make a 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.729
 assembly or if it really is an idea that 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.259
 I have in mind for quite some time 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.919
 time but I did not know how to take it to 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.569
 cape 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.219
 I know how to carry it out is how to do the 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:45.050
 inch tournament I will say how can you 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.639
 write I'm going to put the things that 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.409
 I'm going to restrict as for example they're going to 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.780
 be the shotguns that you left a 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.360
 heap totally remove age in 94 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.310
 since many people will be will have 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.990
 they will be used and will be this as 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.060
 it's a savagery we can use the 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.289
 same weapon at the end good can not be 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.259
 practically Cuban and that only 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.699
 I'll remove that to invite the thrown 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.729
 rockets already exist a lot in the 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.530
 light those things I will remove them and it is already 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.319
 You can play well with your 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.490
 rifles and with assault rifles that 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.770
 they were pretty good you will be watching 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.569
 there the nuclear and good things that 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.729
 I will remove then surely they will be 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.259
 grenades or things for style really not 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.009
 I know the rules is already long and I will continue 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.240
 commenting 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.710
 I will comment now how you can 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.509
 register what is ending the 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.400
 video is simply going to be putting a 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.680
 comment which can then put 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.690
 inside him 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.759
 the tournament in two ways the first will be 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.979
 by lottery and the second will be for 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.840
 smart comment the first way 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.690
 you will have to put a literal number 500 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.490
 which, well, you can put that 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.919
 a comment per person then if you 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.530
 repeat I'll put the people who 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.970
 have touched the same for another for another 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.430
 game for the next game as 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.440
 be and the second way will be putting a 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.270
 comment within that same 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.610
 Comment that you put the number you put
