00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.160 

basically<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.640> same<00:05:03.820> just<00:05:04.120> wait<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:04.510> bit<00:05:04.900> more

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
basically the same just wait a bit more

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.340 
basically the same just wait a bit more
doughy<00:05:05.440> I<00:05:05.710> think<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.840> slightly<00:05:07.840> ready<00:05:08.200> as

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
doughy I think and slightly ready as

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.870 
doughy I think and slightly ready as

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
in a heap of it--some which is quite

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.340 
in a heap of it--some which is quite
strange<00:05:16.180> it's<00:05:17.250> really<00:05:18.250> good<00:05:18.430> maybe<00:05:19.240> Apple<00:05:19.540> as
