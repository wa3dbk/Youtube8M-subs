00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
it was too fast especially closely to

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.270 
it was too fast especially closely to

for<00:05:52.870> that<00:05:52.930> is<00:05:53.110> right<00:05:53.290> below<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:53.860> once<00:05:54.730> you've

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
for that is right below and once you've

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.270 
for that is right below and once you've
kind<00:05:55.000> of<00:05:55.120> got<00:05:55.360> it<00:05:55.510> at<00:05:55.630> this<00:05:55.960> tempo<00:05:56.410> feel<00:05:57.040> free

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
kind of got it at this tempo feel free

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.460 
kind of got it at this tempo feel free
you<00:05:57.310> can<00:05:57.490> move<00:05:57.640> on<00:05:57.850> to<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.150> advanced<00:05:58.780> warm-up

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
you can move on to the advanced warm-up

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.130 
you can move on to the advanced warm-up
and<00:05:59.940> it's<00:06:00.940> much<00:06:01.360> more<00:06:01.510> challenging<00:06:01.570> same

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
and it's much more challenging same

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.980 
and it's much more challenging same
exercises<00:06:02.710> but<00:06:03.070> a<00:06:03.130> faster<00:06:03.670> tempo<00:06:03.880> and<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:04.900> you

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
exercises but a faster tempo and so you

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.660 
exercises but a faster tempo and so you
kind<00:06:05.170> of<00:06:05.230> use<00:06:05.440> it<00:06:05.650> to<00:06:05.890> maybe<00:06:06.250> challenge

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
kind of use it to maybe challenge

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.190 
kind of use it to maybe challenge
yourself<00:06:07.030> and<00:06:07.240> say<00:06:07.390> I'm<00:06:07.480> going<00:06:07.570> to<00:06:07.690> get<00:06:07.930> up<00:06:08.080> to
