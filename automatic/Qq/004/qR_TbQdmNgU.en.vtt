00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
their buy one get one free deal they

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.290 
their buy one get one free deal they
have<00:01:32.870> going<00:01:33.050> on<00:01:33.200> before<00:01:33.560> 9:00<00:01:33.740> a.m.<00:01:33.880> by<00:01:34.880> 6-inch

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
have going on before 9:00 a.m. by 6-inch

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.900 
have going on before 9:00 a.m. by 6-inch
sub<00:01:35.740> get<00:01:36.740> another<00:01:36.890> six<00:01:37.100> inches<00:01:37.160> up<00:01:37.460> for<00:01:37.640> free

footlong so I figured eating two six
inches<00:01:43.850> or<00:01:43.940> getting<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.510> six<00:01:44.720> inches<00:01:44.930> I'll<00:01:45.050> eat

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
one now and then eat one later and maybe

00:01:47.270 --> 00:02:04.990 
one now and then eat one later and maybe
