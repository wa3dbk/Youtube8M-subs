and<00:02:05.960> very<00:02:06.500> quick<00:02:06.920> kind<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.429> like<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.700> old

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
and very quick kind of like the old

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.279 
and very quick kind of like the old
series<00:02:08.269> it<00:02:08.420> feels<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.840> bit<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.229> old

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
series it feels a bit like the old

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.800 
series it feels a bit like the old
series<00:02:09.619> however<00:02:09.950> not<00:02:10.519> quite<00:02:10.880> there<00:02:11.269> so<00:02:11.660> we're

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
have a lot of combos but the enemies

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.400 
have a lot of combos but the enemies
basically<00:02:50.329> leave<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.690> just<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.079> spam<00:02:51.380> the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
basically leave you just to spam the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.069 
basically leave you just to spam the
same<00:02:51.769> moves<00:02:52.010> over<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.790> over<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.480> over<00:02:53.720> again

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
same moves over and over and over again

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.400 
same moves over and over and over again
you<00:02:54.859> really<00:02:55.130> do<00:02:55.400> nothing<00:02:55.639> because<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:56.870> return

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
you really do nothing because in return

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.470 
you really do nothing because in return
they<00:02:57.650> don't<00:02:57.829> really<00:02:58.040> fight<00:02:58.400> back<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.120> there's

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
they don't really fight back so there's

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.590 
they don't really fight back so there's
really<00:02:59.660> no<00:02:59.959> reason<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:01.010> do<00:03:01.519> these<00:03:01.730> cool<00:03:02.359> moves

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
really no reason to do these cool moves

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.259 
really no reason to do these cool moves
I<00:03:02.720> guess<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.959> could<00:03:03.350> if<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.769> want<00:03:04.069> but<00:03:04.519> like

I guess you could if you want but like

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.990 
I guess you could if you want but like
why<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.950> then<00:03:07.100> there<00:03:07.280> are<00:03:07.310> enemies<00:03:07.850> that

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
why and and then there are enemies that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.640 
why and and then there are enemies that
you<00:03:08.180> know<00:03:08.299> will<00:03:08.540> fight<00:03:08.750> back<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.170> mostly<00:03:09.470> use

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
you know will fight back but mostly use

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.309
