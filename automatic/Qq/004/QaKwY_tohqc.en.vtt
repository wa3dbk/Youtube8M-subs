amplifier / DAC but unfortunately it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.580 
amplifier / DAC but unfortunately it
seems<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:58.949> my<00:00:59.399> unit<00:00:59.850> has<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.510> rather<00:01:00.809> severe

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590

seems like my unit has a rather severe
fault<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.969> seems<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.629> some<00:01:03.899> sort<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
fault it seems to have some sort of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
fault it seems to have some sort of
internal<00:01:04.650> electrical<00:01:05.430> fault<00:01:05.700> which<00:01:05.909> means

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
internal electrical fault which means

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.370 
internal electrical fault which means
that<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> LED<00:01:07.080> display<00:01:07.970> flickers<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.380> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that the LED display flickers and the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.460 
that the LED display flickers and the
unit<00:01:10.799> sends<00:01:11.100> loud<00:01:11.700> popping<00:01:12.270> noises<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.200> any

it's in operation and it also sends loud

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's in operation and it also sends loud
popping<00:01:19.080> noises<00:01:19.380> when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.040> disconnect<00:01:20.310> or

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
popping noises when you disconnect or

connect any headphone to it lion I
verified<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.799> problem<00:01:26.280> occurs

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
verified that this problem occurs

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.060 
verified that this problem occurs
whether<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.330> there's<00:01:27.689> USB<00:01:28.350> input<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.890> any

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
whether or not there's USB input or any

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.340 
whether or not there's USB input or any
kind<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> input<00:01:29.820> into<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.600> geek<00:01:30.780> post<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.200> it's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
kind of input into the geek post so it's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.160 
kind of input into the geek post so it's
not<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.770> source<00:01:32.100> issue<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.880> verified<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.900> it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
not a source issue I verified that it

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.410 
not a source issue I verified that it
happens<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.250> different<00:01:35.640> power<00:01:35.909> supply<00:01:36.390> I

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
happens with a different power supply I

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.780 
happens with a different power supply I
tried<00:01:36.840> using<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.590> same<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.670> know

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
tried using this one same you know

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.499 
tried using this one same you know
compatibility<00:01:39.540> same<00:01:40.170> issue<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> seems<00:01:42.360> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
compatibility same issue so it seems to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.719 
compatibility same issue so it seems to
be<00:01:42.659> some<00:01:42.899> sort<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.259> internal<00:01:44.009> fault<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.610> I'll

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
be some sort of internal fault and I'll

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.050 
be some sort of internal fault and I'll
just<00:01:44.909> demonstrate<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.659> popping<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> now

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
just demonstrate the popping to you now

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.719 
just demonstrate the popping to you now
with<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.240> pair<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.780> takstar<00:01:49.439> Pro<00:01:49.799> ATS<00:01:50.189> so

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
with this pair of takstar Pro ATS so

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.100 
with this pair of takstar Pro ATS so
what<00:01:50.850> happens<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.210> when<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.390> plug<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.659> this

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
what happens is when I plug in this

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.630 
what happens is when I plug in this
cable<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> puppy<00:01:53.130> noise<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
cable I get a puppy noise on the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
cable I get a puppy noise on the
headphone<00:01:54.000> when<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> take<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> cable<00:01:55.110> app<00:01:55.290> I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
headphone when I take the cable app I

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.679 
headphone when I take the cable app I
also<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> popping<00:01:56.219> noise<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.600> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
also get a popping noise so and at this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.260 
also get a popping noise so and at this
point<00:01:57.899> I'm<00:01:58.140> actually<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:58.799> afraid<00:01:59.240> haha

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
point I'm actually a little afraid haha

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.380 
point I'm actually a little afraid haha
because<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.960> unit<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.070> grounded<00:02:02.610> at

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
because this unit is not grounded at

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.639 
because this unit is not grounded at
least<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.689> doesn't<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> 3-pin

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
least it doesn't have the 3-pin

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.100 
least it doesn't have the 3-pin
Australian<00:02:05.610> electrical<00:02:06.149> grounding<00:02:06.479> plug<00:02:06.719> but

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
Australian electrical grounding plug but

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.710 
Australian electrical grounding plug but
anyway<00:02:07.409> okay<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.369> when<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> plug<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.239> it

various discussions about like light

that<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.100> have<00:04:14.340> had<00:04:14.579> with<00:04:14.850> people<00:04:15.570> in<00:04:15.690> the

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
that I have had with people in the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.819 
that I have had with people in the
community<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.470> respect<00:04:17.039> there<00:04:17.310> is<00:04:17.640> a

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
community that I respect there is a

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.320 
community that I respect there is a
question<00:04:19.829> about<00:04:19.979> whether<00:04:20.489> or<00:04:20.760> not<00:04:20.789> light

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
question about whether or not light

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.000 
question about whether or not light
harmonic<00:04:21.959> is<00:04:22.140> able<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.520> actually<00:04:24.390> deliver<00:04:25.200> the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
harmonic is able to actually deliver the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.710 
harmonic is able to actually deliver the
units<00:04:26.460> in<00:04:27.200> working<00:04:28.200> order<00:04:28.350> now<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:30.390> again<00:04:30.690> I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
units in working order now and again I

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.750 
units in working order now and again I
don't<00:04:30.840> have<00:04:31.020> any<00:04:31.350> numbers<00:04:31.770> for<00:04:32.070> this<00:04:32.160> so<00:04:32.430> you

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
don't have any numbers for this so you

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.510 
don't have any numbers for this so you
know<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:33.030> is<00:04:33.210> speculation<00:04:34.050> on<00:04:34.230> my<00:04:34.290> part<00:04:34.680> but

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
know this is speculation on my part but

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.840 
know this is speculation on my part but
I<00:04:35.760> have<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.920> have<00:04:37.920> been<00:04:38.100> told<00:04:38.310> things<00:04:38.610> that

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
I have I have been told things that

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.580 
I have I have been told things that
suggest<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.330> me<00:04:39.450> that<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.630> failure<00:04:39.990> rate<00:04:40.350> on

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
suggest to me that a failure rate on

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.120 
suggest to me that a failure rate on
these<00:04:40.770> units<00:04:41.070> is<00:04:41.660> much<00:04:42.660> higher<00:04:43.020> than<00:04:43.500> what<00:04:43.770> has

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
these units is much higher than what has

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.300 
these units is much higher than what has
been<00:04:44.160> reported<00:04:45.500> like<00:04:46.500> Harmonix<00:04:46.950> says<00:04:47.100> that's

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
been reported like Harmonix says that's

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.450 
been reported like Harmonix says that's
shipped<00:04:47.670> 61<00:04:48.630> percent<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.500> these<00:04:49.830> units<00:04:50.280> and

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
shipped 61 percent of these units and

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.450 
shipped 61 percent of these units and
yet<00:04:51.270> there<00:04:51.480> are<00:04:51.510> only<00:04:51.630> you<00:04:52.530> know<00:04:53.070> one<00:04:53.310> or<00:04:53.430> two

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
yet there are only you know one or two

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.540 
yet there are only you know one or two
reviews<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.330> them<00:04:54.480> out<00:04:54.960> there<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:56.280> don't

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
reviews of them out there so I don't

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.520 
reviews of them out there so I don't
know<00:04:56.790> I'm<00:04:56.940> just<00:04:57.150> adding<00:04:57.330> my<00:04:57.570> one<00:04:58.110> data<00:04:58.440> point

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
know I'm just adding my one data point

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.330 
know I'm just adding my one data point
to<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.040> pool<00:04:59.370> now<00:05:00.410> keep<00:05:01.410> in<00:05:01.560> mind<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:01.920> while

to this pool now keep in mind that while

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.980 
to this pool now keep in mind that while
light<00:05:02.880> harmonic<00:05:03.300> is<00:05:03.390> still<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.960> know
