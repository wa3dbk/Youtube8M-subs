00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.300
 show you how to handle your stem 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.290
 to replace 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.620
 for this repair you need 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.780
 torque wrench 4 torque wrench 6 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.359
 Allen key four 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.490
 Allen key 6 and the stem today 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.340
 we are going to replace the stem because again 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.019
 want to set up a longer stem 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.080
 when it is going to replace the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:35.520
 front bolts loosen the front 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.500
 off the stem and / or release 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.090
 can get 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.950
 when you have the four bolts loose 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.950
 art you get the handlebars 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.520
 you can just let it hang quietly 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.930
 Now we are going to stem the headset 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.250
 unscrew 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.590
 the larger one uses this 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.210
 Allen key to release the top cap 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.199
 turning after I release the top cap 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.390
 screwed 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.289
 I screw four other two with hex 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.289
 unscrew 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.339
 you can now remove the stem 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.040
 we now have a longer stem and that 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.159
 we are going to mount it back on the bike 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.290
 super place a place on the fork 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.150
 first the top cap 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.500
 you can do this for the first part with 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.820
 tighten the hand 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 then the last part 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.380
 with the Allen key too broad then 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.380
 the two hexes 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.510
 it must again later release 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.350
 turn to properly control the ball head 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.210
 fine tune 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.100
 but for now it's probably the most convenient 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.860
 to assemble the board 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.810
 when mounting the new stem 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.110
 It is important that you add fat to it 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.650
 we use bolts in this case 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.020
 morgan blue 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.320
 we now go back on the handlebar 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.320
 assemble 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.380
 take care when adjusting the steering wheel 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.369
 put your handlebars in the desired position 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.369
 this is for everyone personally 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.010
 then all four boats turn 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.010
 evenly 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.070
 if you have the four bolts evenly 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.590
 tightened finally tighten it 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.500
 with a torque wrench in this case 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:25.730
 companies fixed it with 6 new to meters 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:27.950
 what is described on the stem to 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.630
 to check all the bolts are correct 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.320
 tightened you walk them all four 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.320
 just after 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.400
 now that you have replaced the stem it is van 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.560
 importance you also have to adjust the steering head 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.990
 these bearings have been loose so serve 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.680
 newly adjusted and where we get the bike off 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.680
 the standard 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.860
 and put the wheel back in 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.000
 we are going to adjust the head and it 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.430
 turn control law 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.350
 yes tighten a bolt to check if 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.400
 the steering wheel is straight 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.970
 you can see this from the top 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.580
 when the handlebar is straight, turn the bolt 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.040
 release again after you put the steering fun 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.840
 Grab the large Allen key to the top 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.460
 cap to adjust 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.990
 the adjustment of the steering head is complete 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.730
 accurate 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.380
 tightening the top cap is it 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.660
 not important that you do that with much 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.800
 strength occurs after you the stem 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.020
 mounted 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.150
 do you want to adjust a headset this 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.100
 free play 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.490
 to do this turn the wheel to 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.220
 left 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.930
 you pinch the for him and move 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.210
 bicycle forward and backward 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.400
 You can repeat this a number of times as 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.780
 you do this for you at the headset or 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.090
 4 play on it 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.620
 city ​​only leeway you need him 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.540
 tighten again 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.940
 when ball or less is adjusted 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.010
 and still has slack you need to 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.700
 steps that you've done before one more 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.890
 repeat times 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.080
