00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
poked out as well so it's just mechanics

out for them I will ask probably the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.529 
out for them I will ask probably the
talent<00:00:55.559> versus<00:00:55.800> Oriana<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.640> saw<00:00:56.910> porn

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
talent versus Oriana we saw porn

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
talent versus Oriana we saw porn
constantly<00:00:58.199> throwing<00:00:58.530> his<00:00:58.739> ultimate<00:00:59.129> over

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
constantly throwing his ultimate over

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.740 
constantly throwing his ultimate over
and<00:00:59.520> over<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.789> over<00:00:59.850> talk<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> me<00:01:00.539> about<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and over and over talk to me about the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.389 
and over and over talk to me about the
matchup<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.260> played<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> out<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.980> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
matchup and how we played it out so I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.860 
matchup and how we played it out so I
guess<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:02.910> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.539> counterintuitive

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
guess it's kind of counterintuitive

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
guess it's kind of counterintuitive
because<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:04.920> about<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.549> go

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
because you think about it and you go

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399 
because you think about it and you go

gonna<00:01:07.560> kill<00:01:07.799> him<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.520> matchup<00:01:08.760> it's

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
gonna kill him but in that matchup it's

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.300 
gonna kill him but in that matchup it's
actually<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.780> hard<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.140> ever<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> free

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
actually really hard to ever get a free

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.609 
actually really hard to ever get a free
kill<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.610> Oriana<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.479> using<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.110> ultimate<00:01:13.439> on

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
there's literally no way you're actually

there's literally no way you're actually
to<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.479> able<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.930> relevant<00:02:07.170> staying<00:02:07.500> know

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to be able to be relevant staying know

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.309 
to be able to be relevant staying know
and<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:08.759> only<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:10.259> were

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and not only that but they were

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.180 
and not only that but they were
basically<00:02:11.099> samsung<00:02:11.550> white<00:02:11.760> was<00:02:12.090> running<00:02:12.510> from

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
basically samsung white was running from

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.940 
basically samsung white was running from
red<00:02:13.730> buff<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.300> blue<00:02:14.780> buff<00:02:14.990> on<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.440> enemy<00:02:15.590> side

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
red buff to blue buff on the enemy side

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.920 
red buff to blue buff on the enemy side
over<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.490> over<00:02:16.580> again<00:02:16.820> while<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.510> mid<00:02:17.690> turret

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
over and over again while the mid turret

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.790 
over and over again while the mid turret
will<00:02:18.200> still<00:02:18.500> up<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:20.230> there's<00:02:21.230> not<00:02:21.410> really<00:02:21.650> a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
will still up and there's not really a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.370 
will still up and there's not really a
way<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.160> get<00:02:22.640> out<00:02:22.850> rotated<00:02:23.450> harder<00:02:23.930> than<00:02:24.170> that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
way to get out rotated harder than that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.310 
way to get out rotated harder than that
i<00:02:24.620> zs<00:02:25.040> that's<00:02:25.280> because<00:02:26.030> basically<00:02:26.510> when<00:02:27.290> you

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
i zs that's because basically when you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.380 
i zs that's because basically when you
still<00:02:27.590> have<00:02:27.710> that<00:02:27.740> mid<00:02:28.160> outer<00:02:28.400> up<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.210> should

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
still have that mid outer up you should

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.910 
still have that mid outer up you should
always<00:02:29.540> be<00:02:29.930> able<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.170> reach<00:02:30.380> your<00:02:30.530> other<00:02:30.680> buff

Alistair<00:03:15.950> comes<00:03:16.160> in<00:03:16.340> especially<00:03:16.790> if<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:16.970> have

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
Alistair comes in especially if you have

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.910 
Alistair comes in especially if you have
some<00:03:17.420> sort<00:03:17.750> like<00:03:18.020> if<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.260> have<00:03:18.380> vein<00:03:18.650> there

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
some sort like if you have vein there

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.890 
some sort like if you have vein there
and<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.400> have<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> zoning<00:03:20.270> tool<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.630> keep<00:03:20.750> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
and you have a zoning tool to keep the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.390 
and you have a zoning tool to keep the
rest<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.200> team<00:03:21.380> out<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.980> can<00:03:22.160> quickly

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
rest of the team out you can quickly

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.920 
rest of the team out you can quickly
burst<00:03:22.760> down<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.970> hyper<00:03:23.180> tank<00:03:23.480> it's<00:03:23.690> good

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
burst down a hyper tank it's good

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.840 
burst down a hyper tank it's good
against<00:03:24.260> maokai<00:03:24.620> as<00:03:24.800> well<00:03:25.010> very<00:03:25.610> quickly

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
against maokai as well very quickly

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.370 
against maokai as well very quickly
before<00:03:26.030> we<00:03:26.180> get<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.420> replay<00:03:26.510> yeah<00:03:27.050> just

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
before we get to the replay yeah just

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.320 
before we get to the replay yeah just
swallow<00:03:27.650> think<00:03:27.830> so<00:03:28.070> sending<00:03:28.880> vein<00:03:29.090> top

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
swallow think so sending vein top

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.260 
swallow think so sending vein top
against<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:29.959> think<00:03:30.380> better<00:03:31.340> teams<00:03:31.700> are

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
against that I think better teams are

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.670 
against that I think better teams are
going<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.480> be<00:03:32.570> able<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.780> realize<00:03:33.170> that<00:03:33.200> kind<00:03:33.590> of

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
going to be able to realize that kind of

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.740 
going to be able to realize that kind of
fault<00:03:34.130> with<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.340> top<00:03:34.580> line<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:34.910> not<00:03:35.480> allow<00:03:35.720> that

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
fault with a top line and not allow that

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.570 
fault with a top line and not allow that
to<00:03:35.930> happen<00:03:36.050> when<00:03:36.410> vein<00:03:36.680> went<00:03:36.890> top<00:03:37.070> is<00:03:37.310> very

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
to happen when vein went top is very

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.800 
to happen when vein went top is very
predictable<00:03:38.090> they<00:03:38.209> should<00:03:38.450> have<00:03:38.540> been<00:03:38.720> able

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
predictable they should have been able

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.090 
predictable they should have been able
to<00:03:38.959> see<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.140> coming<00:03:39.410> after<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.739> ball<00:03:39.920> turret

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
to see that coming after the ball turret

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.680 
to see that coming after the ball turret
fell<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.610> if<00:03:40.940> they're<00:03:41.090> disabled<00:03:41.450> two<00:03:41.540> lane

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
fell and if they're disabled two lane

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.420 
fell and if they're disabled two lane
swap<00:03:41.900> they<00:03:42.260> could<00:03:42.410> have<00:03:42.560> avoided<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.190> but

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
swap they could have avoided that but

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.740 
swap they could have avoided that but
it's<00:03:43.580> kind<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:43.760> like<00:03:43.850> dark<00:03:44.090> passage<00:03:44.390> wasn't

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
it's kind of like dark passage wasn't

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.970 
it's kind of like dark passage wasn't
really<00:03:44.930> aware<00:03:45.170> they're<00:03:45.380> gonna<00:03:45.500> do<00:03:45.680> this<00:03:45.830> and

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
really aware they're gonna do this and

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.550 
really aware they're gonna do this and
after<00:03:46.720> alastar<00:03:47.720> was<00:03:47.810> sucked<00:03:48.019> top<00:03:48.230> against

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
after alastar was sucked top against

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.140 
after alastar was sucked top against
pain<00:03:48.739> is<00:03:48.950> just<00:03:49.250> now<00:03:49.670> they're<00:03:49.820> gonna<00:03:49.940> bleed
