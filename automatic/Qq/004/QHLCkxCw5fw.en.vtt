to<00:00:18.180> Gascony<00:00:18.690> fall<00:00:19.350> into<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.740> category<00:00:20.570> with

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
to Gascony fall into this category with

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.320 
to Gascony fall into this category with
these<00:00:21.779> kind<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.230> moves<00:00:23.060> now

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
these kind of moves now

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.839 
these kind of moves now
I<00:00:24.359> alluded<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.439> fact<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.699> can

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
I alluded to the fact that if you can

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.089 
I alluded to the fact that if you can
get<00:00:27.029> away<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.050> keep<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.650> fleet

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
get away with this and keep that fleet

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.790 
get away with this and keep that fleet
there<00:00:29.369> you've<00:00:29.609> got<00:00:29.640> total<00:00:30.470> flexibility<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
there you've got total flexibility I

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.979 
there you've got total flexibility I
mean<00:00:32.130> let's<00:00:32.669> say<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.120> example<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.630> did<00:00:33.809> go

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
mean let's say for example you did go

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.130 
mean let's say for example you did go
Italians<00:00:34.559> way<00:00:35.030> look<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:36.870> look

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
Italians way look at this and then look

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.260 
Italians way look at this and then look
at<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> fact<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.160> spring<00:00:38.760> 1902

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
at the fact that it's in spring 1902

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.530 
at the fact that it's in spring 1902

you're in the Western mid yeah now check

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.479 
you're in the Western mid yeah now check
this<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:42.930> against<00:00:44.090> perhaps<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.239> standard

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
this out against perhaps a standard

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.299 
this out against perhaps a standard
French<00:00:47.489> opening<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.559> attack<00:00:49.860> Italy

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
French opening like that to attack Italy

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.510 
you're still only getting in the Western
mid<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.309> spring<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.699> 1902<00:00:54.559> but<00:00:55.559> you've

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
mid in the spring of 1902 but you've

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.330 
mid in the spring of 1902 but you've
declared<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.480> bit<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:57.840> intention<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.710> so

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
declared a bit of an intention there so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.889 
declared a bit of an intention there so
you<00:00:59.399> might<00:00:59.699> find<00:00:59.940> yourself<00:01:00.120> facing<00:01:00.809> an

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you might find yourself facing an

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.649 
you might find yourself facing an
alliance<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.440> those<00:01:01.680> two<00:01:04.909> as<00:01:05.909> Satan<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.570> the

alliance with those two as Satan and the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.310 
alliance with those two as Satan and the
fleet<00:01:07.260> has<00:01:07.409> not<00:01:07.439> gained<00:01:07.860> anything

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
fleet has not gained anything

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
fleet has not gained anything
conversely<00:01:10.490> if<00:01:11.490> you're<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.790> going<00:01:12.180> Italy's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
conversely if you're not going Italy's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.200 
conversely if you're not going Italy's
way<00:01:12.810> you've<00:01:13.500> got<00:01:13.560> your<00:01:13.740> two<00:01:13.979> bills<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:15.150> you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
way you've got your two bills now you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.710 
way you've got your two bills now you
could<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.780> England's<00:01:16.170> way<00:01:16.729> with<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.119> bit<00:01:18.479> more

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
could go England's way with a bit more

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.609 
could go England's way with a bit more
force<00:01:19.610> with<00:01:20.610> two<00:01:20.939> fleets<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.380> get

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
force with two fleets if you can get

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.620 
force with two fleets if you can get
England<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.159> only<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:23.880> build<00:01:24.180> which

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
England to only have the one build which

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.289 
England to only have the one build which
is<00:01:24.659> very<00:01:25.049> possible<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:26.369> Germany<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.060> done

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
is very possible if Germany have done

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.530 
is very possible if Germany have done
this<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.840> thing<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:29.360> might<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
this kind of thing that might be a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.819 
this kind of thing that might be a
bounce<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.200> England

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
one build out of that and it's great
